	<p pid="e.710W.0/1">The Government recognise that the Aarhus Convention is an important statement, at international level, of the rights of the public to be involved in decisions which have significant environmental effects. The UK's ratification of the convention, in February 2005, demonstrates our commitment to the importance of these principles. A comprehensive guide can be found on the DEFRA website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="e.710W.0/2">In addition, DEFRA's environmental information unit (EIU) provides advice on the convention and the Environmental Information Regulations. The EIU has produced leaflets and posters publicising peoples' rights to access environmental information and provides detailed guidance on the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index. htm</a> This also links to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs), the code of practice and the Aarhus Convention.</p>
	<p pid="e.710W.0/3">The code of practice, (which was laid in Parliament in February 2005) and guidance have been revised to take responses to a public consultation into account.</p>
	<p pid="e.710W.0/4">Additionally, the unit offers support to Government Departments and public authorities on EIRs. This support includes workshops to discuss how they can raise awareness within their authorities and provides an opportunity to share good practice. In 2003-04, the Government's sustainable development unit worked with the Department for Constitutional Affairs supporting the freedom of information (FOI) roadshows programme and gave talks to public authorities around the country explaining how to handle FOI and EIR requests.</p>

	<p pid="e.710W.3/2">The Government's response to the taskforce report was published in April 2006 and sets out 12 key initiatives and over 60 associated actions to help realise optimum use of biomass as a resource. These measures include a capital grant scheme for biomass boilers, the establishment of a new Biomass Energy Centre to provide expert information and advice, further grant support for biomass supply chains, and a commitment to consider using biomass in the Government estate. We also intend to publish a UK Biomass Strategy in the coming year.</p>

	<p pid="e.719W.12/2">Past research has considered implications of common agricultural policy Reform on land management, including the take-up of agri-environment schemes. A new research programme was set up last year to monitor the impacts of the introduction of the SPS on farm level change and the environment under the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory Programme, details of which are at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/observatory/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/observatory/index.htm</a>. The results of that programme will help inform the UK negotiating position in future EU discussions on both the SPS rules and wider CAP reform.</p>
	<p pid="e.719W.12/3">Environmental Stewardship has also an evaluation strategy, available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/es/ES-EvaluationPlan-Feb06.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/es/ES-EvaluationPlan-Feb06.pdf</a>, and is supported by research and monitoring programmes. The projects under these ES programmes tend to focus on issues such as 'effectiveness', 'efficiency' and 'improvements' relating to the management options of the scheme. The 'capability of farmers' is not investigated independently but is a factor that can influence the outputs of these projects.</p>

	<p pid="e.720W.2/1">UK methane emissions between 1990 and 2004 fell by an estimated 50 per cent., mainly as a consequence of reductions in sectors such as waste, agriculture, coal mining and natural gas distribution.</p>
	<p pid="e.720W.2/2">More recycling, helped by the introduction of the landfill tax, and an increase in the capture of landfill gas for energy recovery, has led to an estimated 63 per cent. fall in landfill emissions since 1990. There has been a 40 per cent. decrease in landfill emissions since 1999, when the Government increased the landfill tax to &pound;10 per tonne of waste. Agriculture accounts for around 41 per cent. of UK methane emissions, and emissions from this sector have fallen by an estimated 13 per cent. since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="e.720W.2/3">We are currently reviewing our approach to anaerobic digestion, which can help to capture and utilise emissions from manures and slurries, as part of the Government's response to the Biomass Taskforce Report. Additionally we are continuing to fund research on options to reduce direct emissions from ruminants.</p>
	<p pid="e.720W.2/4">Methane emissions from coal mining fell by more than 70 per cent. between 1990 and 2004 due to the closure of coal mines as a consequence of fuel switching in the energy supply industry and UK Coal participation in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Methane gas extracted from mines and used as fuel has been exempt from the climate change levy since 2003. This exemption encourages the owners of mining facilities and decommissioned mines to invest in systems that capture methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="e.720W.2/5">Fugitive emissions from natural gas have fallen by about 39 per cent. between 1990 and 2004. National Grid Gas, which owns and maintains the UK gas distribution network, is continuing to improve the UK gas network. Internationally, the UK is taking an active role in the international Methane to Markets Partnership, and will co-chair a new Agriculture Sub-Committee with Argentina. This will examine the scope for capturing methane from animal wastes in a cost-effective way.</p>

	<p pid="e.721W.2/1">From a review the Department has undertaken and has published on the DEFRA website, I am assured that much of our current legislation addresses risks from materials regardless of their size. DEFRA has responsibility for the possible environmental risks from nanomaterials. If there are environmental risks which need controlling, irrespective of whether the cause of the risk is already marketed or not, they will be appropriately controlled and emergency powers are available if needed.</p>
	<p pid="e.721W.2/2">I am aware that very small materials may pose new risks and it is with that in mind that the UK are moving towards a framework of appropriate control. We are therefore currently gathering evidence to see if these types of products represent a hazard or risk to the environment that would require additional control. Our evidence-gathering phase, working across the UK Government, is scheduled to cover the next two years, at which point it is intended that there will be a fundamental review of the need for control. Given this, there are no plans for the mandatory regulation of nanotechnology products and hence no plans for publication.</p>

We took the opportunity in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 to consolidate and simplify the way in which the roles of these bodies have been described in legislation since the 1940s. However the statutory purpose of Natural England is deliberately drawn widely to encompass everything which the predecessor bodies were able to do. It will, of course, be a matter for the Board of Natural England, in consultation with Ministers, to decide how to distribute its resources between its various functions.</p>

For food which can be produced in the UK the estimate for 2005 is 62 per cent.

	<p pid="e.725W.3/1">No recycling targets have been specifically set by the Government for schools. However, DEFRA does provide financial support for the operation of Eco-Schools, an international programme developed by the Foundation of Environmental Education (FEE) and managed in England by Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS). Eco-Schools promotes environmental awareness around nine main themes, one of which is waste minimisation and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="e.725W.3/2">Eco-Schools involves the whole school (pupils, teachers, non-teaching employees and governors) together with members of the local community (parents, the local authority, the media and local businesses). The scheme enables schools to enter for an internationally recognised award, the highest level of which is the Green Flag, with intermediary awards of bronze and silver. Over 3,000 schools are currently registered, including 500 schools that have achieved Green Flag status.</p>
	<p pid="e.725W.3/3">DEFRA will be providing &pound;40,000 of funding for Eco-Schools in 2006-07. &pound;100,000 is also provided from non-grant sources, mainly from other sponsorship.</p>
	<p pid="e.725W.3/4">In addition, from April 2006 the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) will be carrying out work with schools, including continuation of the Cycler assemblies, as part of their waste awareness programme. Many local authorities are involved with waste education work, both independently and with WRAP. The Environment Action Fund also funds some projects that work with young people on issues around sustainable consumption.</p>

Food from Britain (FFB) take the lead in the delivery of a national programme of activity that supports producers in the sector. In taking forward this programme of activities, which focuses on trade development, consumer awareness and business competitiveness, FFB work together with a range of organisations, including Slow Food UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.727W.5/2">A good example of this is ensuring a strong British presence at Slow Food's biennial Salone del Gusto food show held in Turin. Both organisations have worked well together for the last two shows in recruiting quality regional food producers for the event and in providing the necessary logistical support at the show. This close co-operation is continuing this year in preparation for the 2006 Salone del Gusto taking place in October.</p>

A study of fatal accident victims during the period 1996-2000 showed that in a sample of 779 drivers and riders killed, 17 per cent. had traces of illegal drugs.

On this assumption, it is estimated that in the first year after construction (2013) of the published scheme there would be travel time savings of between &pound;3.495 million at low growth and &pound;6.317 million at high growth.

	<p pid="e.748W.8/1">A new, directly applicable, EU regulation on drivers' hours has recently been adopted by the EU institutions&mdash;it was published in the Official Journal in April 2006 and will, for the most part, come into force in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.748W.8/2">We will consult later this year on the amendments that will need to be made to domestic legislation to facilitate compliance with the new EU regulation. These amendments will adopt all of the national derogations available in the new EU regulation (without any additional restrictions), apart from the newly available derogation for specialised vehicles transporting money and/or valuables&mdash;in Article 13.1.(m). We do not intend to adopt this derogation because there is no obvious case to exempt these operations which currently take place within the scope of the existing drivers' hours rules without any apparent difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="e.748W.8/3">The working time of mobile workers (basically drivers, crew and other travelling staff) operating on vehicles subject to the EU regulation on drivers' hours is governed by the European Road Transport Working Time Directive 2002/15/EC. A review of the UK's implementing regulations is due to commence later this year.</p>

	<p pid="e.755W.6/1">Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to those members of the armed forces, and their partners and families, who have contributed in any way to the evacuation of UK and other nationals from Lebanon over recent days. The evacuation was conducted with the utmost professionalism, under difficult conditions, with the safety of evacuees paramount at all times. I should also like to convey my thanks to those members of the FCO and the MOD who have been involved in the evacuation. I offer all those involved my personal congratulations on a job well done.</p>
	<p pid="e.755W.6/2">Secondly, on the subject of international support for Lebanon, I can tell the hon. Member that plans are under development, both in terms of a peacekeeping deployment, and in terms of the humanitarian response. Specifically, discussions have been held with international partners including France and the United States, on the subject of an international force. Crucially, whatever is proposed will need the support of both the Lebanese Government and Israel. If an international force is to be deployed, HMG will consider how best we can support the international community in that effort.</p>

	<p pid="e.756W.6/2">Service Families Accommodation is graded into four categories for condition, and I can tell the House that 95 per cent. of our housing stock in Great Britain falls into the top two of those categories. We are aware that more needs to be done to improve our housing stock, and it is for that reason we have introduced Prime Contracting to cover all repairs and maintenance. One contract replaces 22 previous contracts. This should lead to improved standards of work and responsiveness and much higher levels of satisfaction for families.</p>

This second Phase will provide a minimum of 3,000 additional bedspaces and create a minimum of 100 apprenticeships within the Prime Contractor's supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="e.759W.2/1">The four provinces covered by Multi-National Division (South East) remain relatively quiet compared to other areas of Iraq, accounting for around 4 per cent. of all attacks. The security situation in Basra, however, continues to cause concern. To address the problems in the province, the Iraqi Government have announced a security plan for Basra. I discussed the plan with Prime Minister Maliki this morning. The plan is in its early stages but has already resulted in increased presence of Iraqi security forces&mdash;with more to come.</p>
	<p pid="e.759W.2/2">Elsewhere in MND(South East) the security situation is more positive. Our progress with security and training of the Iraqi security forces was a factor in making Al Muthanna province the first where responsibility for security was handed over to Iraqi control. I expect Maysan and Dhi Qar provinces to follow suit before the end of this year, once the conditions on the ground are right.</p>

	<p pid="e.779W.5/1">All nuclear test veterans are eligible to claim, under the terms of the war pension scheme, for any disablement causally linked to service rather than for specific conditions or diseases. A war pension is also paid whenever the claimant can raise reasonable doubt, by providing reliable evidence, that the claimed disablement is causally linked to service. The War Pensions Scheme considers disablement from radiation linked disease, to include such conditions as certain thyroid and parathyroid diseases, cataracts and malignant disease and cancer. Cancers due to ionising radiation are clinically indistinguishable from those due to any other cause which are common in a population increasing with age. Based on the findings of National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) reports it is war pensions policy that entitlement is given to any type of leukaemia, other than chronic lymphatic with onset, within 25 years of participation at a nuclear test.</p>
	<p pid="e.779W.5/2">Therefore no estimate has been made of the cost of awarding war pensions to all veterans who might be suffering from a radiation linked disease that has arisen some time after service in nuclear test areas as it might not be linked to that service. The value of a disablement award is determined by the assessed level of all service related disablement, which can be re-assessed if there is subsequent deterioration.</p>

	<p pid="e.797W.3/1">The Public Prosecution Service conducts all cases it prosecutes, including those on behalf of the Environment and Heritage Service, in accordance with the Test for Prosecution. That test is whether there is sufficient available evidence to afford a reasonable prospect of conviction and, if so, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. If the evidential aspect of the test is met, there is a strong presumption that prosecution is in the public interest; the more serious the offence, or its consequences, the stronger the presumption. The cost of bringing a prosecution does not weigh in that consideration. The PPS may take into account, in assessing the public interest, whether the offence is of such a nature that it is likely that the court will impose only a very small or nominal penalty.</p>
	<p pid="e.797W.3/2">The cost-effectiveness of prosecutions is based on the overall efficiency of the PPS. It is not connected in any way with the fines imposed following conviction. Such fines are not payable to the PPS. Following conviction, the PPS will usually ask for its costs to be paid by the defendant but whether such an order is made, and to what extent, is a matter for judicial determination.</p>
	<p pid="e.797W.3/3">The cost-effectiveness of the PPS and what is being done to maintain and improve efficiency is the subject of the PPS annual report and business plan, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.797W.6/1">By statute, certain offences require the consent of the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in order for there to be a prosecution.

	<p pid="e.798W.13/1">The Government plan to introduce regulations later this year under part 3 of the Equality Act 2006 to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities, services, education and public functions. These measures will empower individuals to challenge unacceptable prejudice in their everyday lives and will reinforce and support the work already being done in many communities by police forces and other bodies to confront and tackle homophobic bullying.</p>
	<p pid="e.798W.13/2">The regulations will be promoted to raise awareness of people's new rights and responsibilities under the regulations and will be accompanied by detailed guidance for service providers. The new Commission for Equality and Human Rights will play an important role in promoting and supporting the regulations when it opens its doors in October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.798W.13/3">We take the issue of homophobic bullying in schools very seriously and the Government gave an undertaking in the White Paper, &quot;Higher Standards, Better Education for All&quot;, published last year, to issue guidance on bullying motivated by prejudice, including homophobia, providing school staff with valuable support in an area they often find challenging. The Department for Education and Skills is currently developing a programme to tackle homophobic bullying and has accepted a tender from Stonewall for the provision of guidance on homophobic bullying. The Department expects to issue that guidance early in 2007, and to follow this with a series of dissemination workshops.</p>

Regional projects have been established to plan and manage the changes at regional and FRS levels. Progress is monitored and reported against the project plan.

	<p pid="e.822W.8/2">Formula grant per head has been calculated by dividing the total amount of formula grant received by the authority and dividing through by the mid-year population used in the calculation of the formula grant. For 1997-98 to 2005-06, the latest population estimates were used. These relate to the period two-years before the period for formula grant. For example, in 2005-06, the mid-2003 population estimates were used.

	<p pid="e.826W.8/1">Planning guidance to local authorities on planning applications in areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs) is set out in Planning Policy Statement (PPS)7 Sustainable Development in Rural Areas. PPS7 states that AONBs confirmed by the Government have the highest standards of protection in relation to landscape and scenic beauty. Major developments (including mineral working) should not take place in these areas except in exceptional circumstances and applications for such developments should be subject to the most rigorous examination. Major development proposals should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed and will need to be assessed against the criteria set out in paragraph 22 of PPS7. However, it will be for local planning authorities to decide on a case by case basis whether exceptional circumstances exist which would allow them to grant planning permission for a minerals development in an AONB.</p>
	<p pid="e.826W.8/2">No recent assessment of the impacts of mineral operations on residential areas or areas of outstanding natural beauty has been undertaken by my Department. Any adverse potential impacts of quarries will need to be considered by mineral planning authorities after applications for planning permission have been submitted. Mineral operators will need to demonstrate to local planning authorities in planning applications including (where appropriate) through the preparation of environmental impact assessments that their proposals are acceptable. Minerals Policy Statement (MPS)2 &quot;Controlling and Mitigating the Environmental Effects of Minerals Extraction in England&quot; stresses that mineral planning authorities should take account of the full range of social, community, economic and environmental issues relevant to the planning decision. Any adverse effects on local communities, environmental damage or loss of amenity must be kept to an acceptable minimum. MPS2 advises mineral planning authorities on the use of appropriate planning conditions, which must be capable of being monitored, to mitigate any environmental impacts. Where adverse environmental effects cannot be adequately controlled or mitigated through the design of proposals or the attachment of conditions, planning permission should be refused.</p>

In addition, officials are closely involved with the borough council and other partners in bringing forward housing, growth and other agendas. There have already been a number of ministerial visits to North Northamptonshire and more are planned. DCLG Ministers are more than happy to discuss housing development in Kettering with key partners during future visits to Northamptonshire.</p>

	<p pid="e.828W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.9/2">Our Welfare Reform Bill set out our plans to assess people based on the effects a condition has on a person's capacity to work. This is not done on the basis of a single &quot;snapshot&quot; assessment but over a reasonable period of time given the nature of the condition. In this way we will take account of the effects of fluctuating and long-term conditions. Personal advisers have the freedom to waive or defer a work-focused interview where a claimant is unable to participate for good reason.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.9/3">We aim to have a system that can be flexible to an individual's changing condition. We will be sensitive to each person's situation and take serious consideration of any medical advice given, such as that provided by a GP. Our services are delivered by personal advisers whose key motivating factor is the help they are able to offer. These advisers receive specialist training to give them the skills, knowledge, techniques and confidence to deal with customers whose circumstances include having a health condition or disability. If someone cannot reasonably participate in back-to-work activity because of their current health condition, they will not be required to do so. It is about people meeting with an adviser to discuss their circumstances and look for ways to improve the quality of their day-to-day living and perhaps begin to chart a route back to work.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.9/4">In Pathways to Work areas, our Condition Management Programmes have been effective in helping individuals with health conditions to return to work. The programmes, jointly delivered by Jobcentre Plus and NHS Primary Care Trusts, offer help to the very large proportion of people coming on to incapacity benefit who want and expect to work again but genuinely believe that they are too ill to do anything about it. The programmes are designed to assist individuals understand and manage their health conditions better, particularly in a workplace environment, and reflect current best clinical practice in the management of these conditions.</p>

	<p pid="e.831W.5/2">I agree with the report's conclusion that there is no single &quot;best practice&quot; model for managing local authority leisure services. The report makes clear that both the public and private sector can provide good public leisure services for local communities where councils have taken decisions based on a robust options appraisal. It is important that councils, with support from Government, continue to get better at managing their leisure provision which is why I have asked Sport England to work closely with them in taking forward the Audit Commission's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="e.831W.8/2">We want to help local authorities to revitalise their leisure facilities and to ensure that the right sports facilities are in the right places. Sport England has already developed a range of strategic planning tools to assist them. These include, among others: the Active Places database, which provides a comprehensive picture of sports facilities across the country; the National Benchmarking Service; a Facilities Planning Model; and a Sports Facilities Demand Estimator. In addition, I have charged Sport England with the task of driving forward work with local authorities to improve the quality of their sports facilities and service delivery. They are creating an Improvement Unit to deliver this.</p>

	<p pid="e.833W.5/66">It is not possible, except at disproportionate expense, to provide a more detailed breakdown for actual dates for when each campaign ran, other than detailing the Financial Year within which the expenditure occurred.</p>
	<p pid="e.833W.5/67">The Department runs a number of campaigns in support of our key delivery priorities, in order to inform our target audiences of how they are affected by our policies. All of our campaigns follow the guidelines which govern Government information on issues of propriety and cost.</p>
	<p pid="e.833W.5/68">Every campaign is measured vigorously against specific communication objectives using pre- and post-campaign research, to record shifts in awareness, attitudes, knowledge or behaviour among the target audience(s).</p>
	<p pid="e.833W.5/69">The Department employs tracking research to monitor these shifts over time and, typically, conducts telephone surveys of respondents to advertising campaigns, to monitor satisfaction with the services offered and actions taken as a result of the campaign. It routinely tests the likely effectiveness of different creative approaches on the target audience(s) through market research, as part of the development of advertising campaigns. Lessons learnt from previous campaigns are used to inform future ones.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-24e.86500.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-24e.834W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" speakername="Parmjit Dhanda" colnum="834W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060724/text/60724w0029.htm#06072519005141">
	<p pid="e.834W.2/1">The framework for teacher training ensures that qualifying and newly qualified teachers, including those who support children with autism in mainstream schools, are aware of their responsibilities to children with special educational needs (SEN) and can plan effectively to meet these children's needs. Further, in-service training on particular SEN, such as autism, is a matter for schools and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/2">In order to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status, all trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/3">The current standards for teachers are under review. Once revised, it is proposed that they will be strengthened to include a standard which requires teachers to know and comply with current legislation on well-being of children and young people and one which requires teachers to know and understand the role of others when dealing with children who have special needs and/or disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/4">Induction Standards require Newly Qualified Teachers to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement, and in consultation with the SEN Co-ordinator (SENCO), can contribute to the planning for individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/5">The Department's published SEN Strategy, 'Removing Barriers to Achievement' recognised the importance of training and committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) to ensure that initial teacher training and programmes of continuing professional development provide a good grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. We have commissioned the TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainees, newly qualified and established teachers. These initiatives will be implemented over the period 2005-08 at a cost of approximately &pound;1.1 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/6">All schools receive a School Development Grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/7">In 2002 we published jointly with the Department of Health, &quot;Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs): Good Practice Guidance&quot; which offered a series of pointers to good practice, including pointers on in-service training. The Guidance advises that,</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/8" class="indent">&quot;all those who plan or provide for children with an ASD should have some knowledge and understanding of autism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.834W.2/9">Many schools, local authorities and Regional Partnerships have used the Guidance to develop their autism provision. The West Midlands Regional Partnership last month published &quot;autism spectrum disorders: training policy and framework&quot; to ensure more consistency in ASD training by clarifying the knowledge and skills that courses are aiming to cover. This has been distributed to all the Regional Partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="e.841W.2/1">In relation to questions 86889 and 86903, the Information Sharing Index will be designed to ensure a high level of physical and environmental security to protect against natural hazards that could interrupt service. Arrangements will be in place to enable operations to continue effectively, notwithstanding any system component failures. There will be an effective and tested contingency plan that would, for example, ensure that a back-up system is in place.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/2">We see no need to introduce specific offences as there are already measures in criminal law which impose penalties for theft or misuse of data or unauthorised access to computer records. Mandatory training for all users and operators of the index will stipulate that the Data Protection Act provides that a serious offence, with a penalty of a fine up to the statutory maximum, will be committed where personal data is unlawfully obtained or disclosed without the consent of the data controller. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 provides that unauthorised access, or attempted unauthorised access to a program or data held on a computer may be punishable by imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/3">In relation to question 86901, all index use will be monitored through the creation of an audit trail record. Users will be required to supply a valid reason when searching for and viewing an index record. All access to any record will be recorded and reviewed regularly for suspicious patterns of access. Misuse of the index will therefore be detected and dealt with through internal disciplinary procedures or the criminal measures referred to.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/4">In relation to question 86890, the index will not be linked to the National Identity Register, nor are there plans for data-sharing between them.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/5">In relation to questions 86892 and 86891, the Children Act 2004 provides that records of children and young people will remain on the index until they reach age 18. There is also provision for records of young people who receive additional services&mdash;for example, care leavers and those with learning disabilities&mdash;to remain on the index, with their consent, up to age 25 in order to provide continued support in the transition to adult services. We will be consulting over the autumn on draft regulations that will, among other issues, propose a period of time during which records will be kept in a secure archive before permanent destruction.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/6">Children, young people, and parents when acting on their behalf, have rights under the Data Protection Act to see the data that is held about them on the index and to request that incorrect data is corrected or removed.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/7">In relation to question 86902, the Information Sharing Index is a central database containing a basic record on all children in England, with contact details of practitioners working with them. There will be no case information on the index record. The Integrated Children's System (ICS) is not a database. ICS is a framework that provides a set of principles for case record management by local practitioners working with individual children in need (as defined under the Children Act 1989) and looked-after children. ICS is not itself an IT system, but it is IT-enabled to help practitioners carry out their key tasks effectively.</p>
	<p pid="e.841W.2/8">In relation to question 86978, section 12 of the Children Act 2004, and affirmative resolution regulations to be made under section 12, will set out the information that must or may be included on the index and specify the types of practitioner whose role would make it appropriate for them to have access. Consultation on the draft regulations will run over the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="e.846W.2/2">Data on areas of school playing fields and external spaces were supplied to my Department by local education authorities in 2001 and 2003. However, the completeness and quality of the data are not good enough accurately to assess the proportion of schools that have playing fields or playgrounds where students can practice sports and participate in physical education lessons. Nor can the data provide information on the total area of land in use as school playing fields.</p>
	<p pid="e.846W.2/3">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field.</p>
	<p pid="e.846W.2/4">Since 1998, 175 applications to sell an area of school playing field capable of forming at least a small sports pitch have been approved. Of these, 73 related to playing fields at closed or closing schools. In every case the sale proceeds were used to provide new or improved sports or educational facilities.</p>

	<p pid="e.847W.0/1">Data on the particular courses offered by colleges are not held centrally. However, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) holds information on which FE providers have at least one LSC-funded learner taking a British Sign Language course for 2003/04 (336 providers in total) and 2004/05 (312 providers). A list of these FE providers will be placed in the House of Commons Library. Full year figures for 2005/06 are not yet available as the academic year which spans <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 July</phrase> has not finished, but an initial list based on enrolments at <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase> will also be provided in the House Library. Full-year information for 2005/06 is likely to be available in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.0/2">FE college planning data for 2006/07 or 2007/08 at the level of individual courses are not required by the Learning and Skills Council. The Learning and Skills Council plans provision with FE providers at a higher and more aggregated level i.e. Full level 2 achievements, etc.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.0/3">In 2004-05 the LSC funded 641,000 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities at a cost of around &pound;1.5 billion. Continuing investment in this provision remains a priority, which was confirmed in our 2006-07 Grant Letter to the LSC and the LSC has in turn made clear in its strategic planning guidance the priority it attaches to this provision.</p>

	<p pid="e.847W.3/1">The Joint Planning and Commissioning Framework for Children, Young People, and Maternity Services, published in March 2006, aims to help local partners to put in place a unified planning and commissioning system which will put improved outcomes at the centre of their thinking, will create a clear picture of what children and young people need, will make the best use of resources, and will join up services so that children and young people with multiple needs experience a seamless service.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.3/2">To assist the process of joint working, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health have commissioned a study of good practice in the provision of speech and language therapy services to children and young people with special educational needs in the age range 0 to 19. A research team from Christ Church College Canterbury is carrying out this study and the fieldwork is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.3/3">The Department recognises that early identification of need, early intervention and early co-ordinated support are key in improving outcomes for children with communication difficulties. As part of a major new &pound;250 million investment in improving the quality of the early years work force, the Department has identified training to support practitioners working in private, voluntary and independent sector settings in meeting the needs of disabled children and their families as one of four priority areas. This is new money and complements the training resources already available to local authorities through the General Sure Start Grant. The Department has also funded the development in partnership with 45 partnership areas of a wide range of practical resources and training materials through the Early Support Programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.3/4">The Department is supporting a longitudinal study by the university of Warwick looking into the learning needs of a group of children with specific language and communication difficulties, the characteristics of the current provision made for them and its impact, their aspirations for the future and the ways in which services can best support them. The results of the study are due to be published in autumn 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.3/5">Parental awareness of speech and language difficulties is of course very important. In 2005 the Department published a detailed and well received information booklet for parents on speech and language difficulties under the Early Support Programme. This resource was produced in close collaboration with specialist organisations in the voluntary sector and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. It explains how children normally develop communication, language and speech, how adults can help in this, the difficulties that can arise and how to seek help from professionals.</p>
	<p pid="e.847W.3/6">In the report of their inquiry into special educational needs published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-06">6 July 2006</phrase>, the Education and Skills Select Committee make recommendations concerning the possible shape and nature of a national framework on SEN. We are considering the Select Committee's report very carefully and will respond in due course.</p>

	<p pid="e.848W.2/1">The Department does not itself provide advisory support services for children with communication disabilities. We have however published a detailed information booklet for parents on speech and language difficulties under our Early Support Programme and we continue to look for opportunities to work in collaboration with relevant voluntary sector organisations. We have, for example, given grants for particular projects to the Association For All Speech Impaired Children (AFASIC), I CAN, the Aiding Communication in Education Centres and the Selective Mutism Information and Research Association (SMIRA).</p>
	<p pid="e.848W.2/2">The Primary and Secondary National Strategies provide a range of support and guidance to schools and childcare settings on the teaching of English and the development of speaking and listening skills, including frameworks to help teachers meet the requirements of the National Curriculum. The primary framework for teaching literacy is currently being revised, and we are developing a statutory framework for care and learning for children aged between birth and five&mdash;the Early Years Foundation Stage. Both of these documents will emphasise the importance of supporting children's development of speaking and listening skills from an early age. We have also rolled out a national training programme&mdash;Communicating Matters&mdash;for practitioners in early years settings, dealing specifically with children's language acquisition. This training, which relates closely to the curriculum guidance for the Foundation Stage, includes a module focused on support for children with additional needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.848W.2/3">Speech and language skills are assessed by teachers on an ongoing basis in all key stages including the Foundation stage. Speaking and listening is an explicit element of the overall subject level for English and it is reported within the overall subject level for English at the end of each key stage; it is not reported separately. In the Foundation Stage, it is reported within communication, language and literacy in the Foundation Stage Profile.</p>
	<p pid="e.848W.2/4">The Department has also indirectly assessed levels of speech and language development in Sure Start Local Programme areas to monitor progress towards its targets in this area. This has been collected using the Sure Start Language Measure (SSLM), a parental report tool used to measure change in the language skills of two year old children in Sure Start Communities. SSLM data collected by Sure Start local programmes has shown that between 2001-02 and 2004-05 the proportion of children in Sure Start areas with a high word count score at age two and whose parents were not worried about their development rose from 70 per cent. to 74 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="e.849W.2/13">The repayment system is still relatively young. The table shows an increasing proportion repaying each year as older cohorts earn more and pass the threshold. However, full cohorts did not enter repayment until 2002-03 onwards. These larger, new cohorts have a negative impact on the percentage repaying compared to the positive impact of the older, but smaller, cohorts. This 'drag' effect will become less evident as more cohorts move into repayment and the system reaches a steady state.</p>

Between 1999 and 2003, 524 Sure Start local programmes were approved to deliver services to 400,000 children aged under 4 and their families in disadvantaged areas. The latest information available (for March 2005) shows an average of 23 per cent. of children had significant contact (that is a home visit or at a centre-based activity) with their local Sure Start programme. We expect all of these to become children's centres providing services to children aged under 5 and their families. The first children's centres were approved in 2003. By the end of September 2006 we expect children's centre services to be offering services to 893,977 children. By March 2008 we expect this to rise to 2,132,279 children across England, including all those living in the 30 per cent. most deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.860W.2/1">The special educational needs (SEN) code of practice provides advice to local authorities and schools on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children who have special educational needs, including children who are blind or partially sighted. The code sets out a graduated approach to providing support. Many children who are blind or partially sighted will have statements of SEN. All statements are reviewed at least annually. The purpose of the review is to consider a child's progress, to ensure they are achieving desired outcomes and, if necessary, to amend their statements to reflect newly identified needs and provision.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/2">Children with SEN, including those who are blind or partially sighted, benefited from the substantial increase of &pound;1,170 in the funding per pupil from &pound;2,940 in 1997-98 to &pound;4,110 per pupil in 2005-06 (a rise of nearly 40 per cent.) and from the increase in local authorities' budgeted expenditure on the education of children with SEN from &pound;2.8 billion in 2001-02 to &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07. &pound;300 million was also made available from 2003-04 through the schools access initiative to improve access to mainstream schools for disabled pupils. Recently a further &pound;100 million per annum has been announced for both 2006-07 and 2007-08. Funds can be used for improving physical access, including adaptations for sensory disability such as improved colour schemes; access to the curriculum; access to written information in alternative formats. This encompasses information, communication technology equipment (both hardware and software).</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/3">Decisions about the support provided for children in Somerset are a matter for the local authority, taking into account its statutory duties.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/4">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a responsibility under the Learning and Skills Act to support young people and adults with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including learners with visual impairments. Overall, in 2004/05 the LSC supported more than 640,000 learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities which accounted for nearly &pound;1.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/5">Disabled students' allowances (DSAs) are available to help students in higher education with the extra costs they may incur on their course as a direct result of a disability (or specific learning difficulty).</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/6">DSAs are paid in addition to the standard student support package; they are not means-tested and do not have to be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/7">In academic year 2004/05 (the latest for which figures are available) 64,200<sup>(1 )</sup>DSAs were awarded in England and Wales totalling &pound;74.1 million. In addition there were over 2,600 OU students with DSAs worth around &pound;3.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="e.860W.2/8" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The total number of students in receipt of DSAs involves an element of double-counting since a student can have more than one allowance.</p>

Figures for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 are drawn from section 52 (table 3) outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002-03 onwards are taken from section 52 (table A) outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the blank rows.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> From 2002-03 onwards the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002-03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002-03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 and would therefore be excluded from the school based expenditure calculation, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> Figures for the primary sector alone were not available until the inception of section 52 in financial year 1999-2000. The pre-primary figures are not sufficiently robust to use in this reply.<br/> <sup>(5)</sup> Secondary school based expenditure includes all expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained secondary schools. It is not possible from existing sources to distinguish this expenditure between expenditure on 11 to 16-year-olds and expenditure on 6th form pupils attending maintained secondary schools.<br/> <sup>(6)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under fives funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999-2000), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> <sup>(7)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> <sup>(8)</sup> Figures prior to 1999-2000 exclude any expenditure on service, strategy and regulation.<br/> <sup>(9)</sup> The expenditure data for 1999-2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br/> <sup>(10)</sup> '&mdash;'denotes figures are not available or have not been scored on a consistent basis<br/> <sup>(11)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10.<br/> <sup>(12)</sup> Cash figures are converted to 2005-06 prices using the 30 June 2006 gross domestic product (GDP) deflators.<br/> <i> Note:</i><br/> As reported by York local authority as at 17 July 2006.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.872W.5/2">Most people who qualify for a winter fuel payment do not need to make a claim because they are paid automatically from DWP records. Some people aged 60 or over who are not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP do need to claim. Many men aged 60-64, for example, fall into this category and need to claim. However, we do not have any estimate for how many eligible people have not claimed.</p>

Following a recommendation in &quot;Meeting DWP's long-term information needs on disability: a feasibility report&quot;, (DWP Research report number 267), the Department is commissioning research to test two possible approaches to establish whether it is possible to estimate take-up rates for these benefits.

	<p pid="e.875W.8/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how many telephone lines are available in Crewe and Nantwich that are dedicated lines to the North West call centre for crisis loans; how many missed calls were recorded per day on average in the last period for which figures are available; how many complaints have been received about those lines in the last 12 months; how crisis loans can be accessed if the Department's local office is closed and where the officials answering calls to the telephone lines dedicated to applicants for crisis loans in the North West are located. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/4" class="indent">The Social Fund Unit in Hartford House, Northwich is one of 13 such units in the Jobcentre Plus North West Region, which process applications for Crisis Loans. This unit covers more than one individual site. Customers can apply for a Crisis Loan by telephone (Crisis Loan Direct) or opt for a face-to-face interview.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/5" class="indent">The Northwich unit administers the Social Fund for the area covered by the Cheshire and Warrington Jobcentre Plus District. Customers within this District are able to access the Crisis Loan team in Northwich by telephone, or by the freephone facility at their local Jobcentre. Nantwich Jobcentre has one telephone programmed for Social Fund customers and Crewe Jobcentre has four. Applications for Crisis Loans for the rest of the North West are processed in the following sites: Mitre House, Lancaster; Marton Mere, Blackpool; Barry House, Preston; Rusholme, Manchester; Graeme House, Chorlton; Park Road, Toxteth; Hordan House, Birkenhead; Edendale House, Huyton; Webster House, Kirkby; Eastbank House, Southport; Gregson House, St Helens; Kingsway House, Widnes; Newgate House, Rochdale; Elizabeth House, Bolton; Beech House, Hyde; and Brun House, Burnley. Overall, there are 110 dedicated telephone lines for Crisis Loans throughout the North West Region.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/6" class="indent">I regret that I am unable to provide you with reliable data on the numbers of missed calls, as the current telephony system does not record this.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/7" class="indent">The Northwich team receive an average of sixty-five Crisis Loan applications each day. In the last twelve months a total of fifty-five complaints have been received concerning the difficulties experienced by customers in accessing this service. A number of those complaints followed a period between October and November 2005 during which the telephony system experienced extensive service interruptions and suspensions. Jobcentre Plus is currently investing in an enhanced telephony and IT system, to improve customer service as part of our programme to transform Social Fund delivery.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/8" class="indent">From April 2008 all Social Fund functions, including Crisis Loan Direct, for customers in our Cheshire and Warrington District will be delivered from a specialist unit in Belle Vale, Liverpool. Until then, Northwich will continue to administer Crisis Loan Direct.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/9" class="indent">Those customers who need a Crisis Loan when our offices are closed (i.e. outside normal working hours) can access the &quot;Out of Hours Service&quot; (OOHS), by contacting their Local Authority, Social Services or the police. The Pension Service can also make a referral to the OOHS on a weekday night up to 20.00. These contacts have details of the OOHS dedicated telephone numbers.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/10" class="indent">I am extremely concerned that your constituents have continued to experience difficulties in accessing the Crisis Loan service in Northwich, and can assure you that both my Regional and Local Social Fund Managers are taking action to address these capacity issues. I am confident that, as staff gain greater experience, with the introduction of a number of streamlined processes, and with improvements to the telephone service, we should be able to resolve these problems.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.8/11" class="indent">Both Bill Marks, NW Region Benefit Delivery Manager and Angela Keith, NW Region Social Fund Manager, will be more than happy to discuss any further concerns you may have, and I have also asked that they arrange an early meeting with the appropriate Citizens Advice Bureaux.</p>

From October 2006 staff below Senior Civil Service grades will no longer have a mandatory retirement age in DWP. This means that once they have reached the minimum pension age of 60, staff themselves decide when to retire.</p>
	<p pid="e.881W.2/2">Where staff incur a period of sickness absence the Department provides extensive support to all staff through its Occupational Health Service contract, Employee Assistance Programme and generous sick leave provision if an employee is sick or has an incapacity.</p>

These ensure the employee is not placed at a disadvantage in comparison to other employees. The Department takes seriously its responsibilities for managing attendance and has developed a supportive policy and procedures for managing sickness absences. The policy was commended by the National Audit Office (NAO) as meeting best practice.</p>
	<p pid="e.881W.2/4">Disabled people are included in all restructuring plans in the same way as other employees. They are guaranteed interviews in selection exercises if they meet the minimum criteria for the post. All applicants are offered reasonable adjustments at all stages of the selection exercise. When a disabled person is successful at the selection exercise our Human Resources teams work closely with occupational health to ensure that any adjustments needed, to either the workplace environment or the post, are put in place quickly to enable the person to commence work without delay. Workplace adjustments are given priority to facilitate moves. Should volunteers be called for to move jobs, or compulsory moves required, the same adjustments are made for any disabled people included in these moves.</p>

	<p pid="e.885W.3/1">Following the recent review, on <phrase class="date" code="">25 May</phrase> we announced that we will extend eligibility for the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to members of qualifying pension schemes who were within 15 years of their scheme's normal retirement age on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.885W.3/2">Those within seven years of their scheme's normal retirement age on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase> will benefit from the FAS topping up their pensions to around 80 per cent. of their expected core pension. Those between seven and 15 years from their scheme's normal retirement age who can more reasonably be expected to supplement their retirement income will be considered for a top-up to around 65 per cent. of their expected pension if they are between seven and 11 years from scheme pension age, and 50 per cent. between 12 and 15 years.</p>
	<p pid="e.885W.3/3">We estimate that this will require funding of &pound;2.3 billion. This is &pound;1.9 billion more than the &pound;400 million over 20 years that we allocated in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="e.885W.3/4">The Pension Protection Fund is an independent body governed by a board. It is funded in two ways; through the assets of schemes for which it assumes responsibility and by charging an annual pension protection levy on the pension schemes eligible for entry to the PPF. The PPF is responsible for setting the levy and has estimated a levy of &pound;575 million for 2006-07 following wide consultation with industry.</p>
	<p pid="e.885W.3/5">Provisions in the Pensions Act 2004 prevent the PPF from increasing its levy by more than 25 per cent. each year, up to an overall maximum ceiling. If the PPF wish to raise a levy beyond the ceiling then it must undertake consultation before asking Secretary of State to increase the levy ceiling.</p>

	<p pid="e.885W.6/3">The scheme works by deducting a prescribed amount at source from someone's weekly benefit, currently &pound;2.90, and paying it direct to the creditor until the debt is cleared. In fuel and water cases an amount is also deducted to cover current consumption costs preventing further debt accruing. The scheme is regulated under Schedule 9 of the Social Security (Claims and Payment) Regulations 1987 No. 1968. These allow for either a benefit customer or a supplier, to make an application for TPD. However, only the DWP Decision Maker can decide whether or not the application is accepted.</p>

	<p pid="e.889W.6/1">In June 2006, the average clearance time for jobseeker's allowance claims in the south-west region was 17 days, and for Somerset claims was 17 days. The average time taken for the contact centres to return a customer's call was within the target 48 hours within the region. The average time between contacting the contact centre and the claim being taken in the Jobcentre was two days.</p>
	<p pid="e.889W.6/2">We recognise that the delivery of jobseeker's allowance in the south-west and Somerset are not as we would want and that is why we have put additional measures in place to improve performance. These include the recruitment of additional staffing and increased telephony capacity. These measures along with closer working within Jobcentre Plus have resulted in an improvement in average clearance time for the south-west and Somerset. Jobseeker's allowance claims are now being actioned on the day of receipt in all processing centres. We anticipate the improving trend to continue.</p>
	<p pid="e.889W.6/3">We are also operating a fast track system for those customers in urgent need. Details of this have been shared with local stakeholders.</p>

In the past year these have also been scrutinised by the independent Pensions Commission who found them to be broadly comparable with their own analysis.</p>

	<p pid="e.892W.2/1">The New Deal Reduced Rail Fare Scheme was established in 1997 and, in England and Wales, is jointly operated by Jobcentre Plus and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC). The scheme was set up to provide new deal participants with reduced travel costs whilst on the New Deal programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.892W.2/2">New deal participants are advised about the availability of the Reduced Rail Fare Scheme either in their first invitation letter or at the initial gateway interview. Rail fare reductions can be made available, at adviser discretion, to eligible new deal for young people participants travelling in England and Wales throughout their time on new deal, on all trains participating in the scheme. In addition, ATOC have agreed to provide further reductions for the first three months of rail travel once participants have left new deal for a sustained job. In this instance, all travel tickets must be bought whilst the participant is on the new deal programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.892W.2/3">In Scotland, First ScotRail, SPT, GNER and Virgin Trains offer free and reduced rate travel to all new deal customers in certain geographical locations. This provision is available to new deal customers from their first day on the programme until their first wage is received.</p>
	<p pid="e.892W.2/4">Local agreements are also in operation with some bus companies for the provision of reduced rate fares for new deal customers and, in certain circumstances, travel costs are paid through other sources such as the Adviser's Discretion Fund or the Travel to Interview Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.892W.2/5">Data is not held on the number of travel passes issued, and expenditure has not been accounted for at the level of detail required to separately identify the costs of the New Deal Reduced Fare Scheme, or the costs of funding travel for new deal customers through other sources. However, no subsidy is paid to train or bus companies by Jobcentre Plus for the Reduced Fare Scheme and the only costs incurred by the Department are the administrative costs involved in managing any necessary paperwork.</p>

	<p pid="e.893W.2/2">The Government's position is that the United Kingdom's interpretation of article 8 of directive 80/987/EEC is consistent with the text of the directive, the legislative history, the case law of the European Court of Justice and, until recently represented, the view of the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.2/3">In the event of the European Court's judgment being that article 8 requires a higher level of protection than provided in the UK, the Government asked the Court, in the interests of legal certainty, to consider imposing a temporal limitation on its judgment.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.2/4">It is usual practice to ask for a temporal limitation on the judgment in a case such as this, where the relevant criteria that the Court has set down for imposing a temporal limitation are met.</p>

Projections of numbers receiving savings credit in the future are subject to a range of uncertainties and a number of factors including policies on uprating different benefits, and assumptions on rates of take-up.<br/> 2. The assumptions applied here are consistent with those that underpin published long-run expenditure projections, and are applied to projections of the number of pensioner households estimated to be eligible for the savings credit.<br/> 3. The projections of recipients of the savings credit under the current system and the reform proposals are calculated by applying assumed rates of take-up, care should be taken when interpreting these projections. In particular data deficiencies make it difficult to be confident in the split between the number of people who may be in receipt of only the guarantee credit and those who may be in receipt of both the guarantee credit and the savings credit. Also the projections are sensitive to the assumed take-up rates.<br/> 4. Estimates of the proportion of pensioner households eligible to the savings credit are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not assume any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for the savings credit.<br/> 5. The projections of the number and proportion of pensioner households eligible for the savings credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes.<br/> 6. The projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for the savings credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.<br/> 7. The reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper.<br/> 8. The projections under the current system assume that basic state pension is uprated in line with prices and the standard guarantee credit with earnings each year. It should be noted that there is a government commitment to uprate the standard guarantee credit with earnings until 2008. Treasury projections for the current system assume price uprating of the standard guarantee credit beyond 2008.<br/> 9. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.<br/> 10. The projections are rounded to the nearest 50,000. Totals are rounded separately so components may not sum to totals.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.910W.2/1">Recruitment Service of the Department of Finance and Personnel has responsibility for providing a vetting service for all employees appointed to the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS).</p>
	<p pid="e.910W.2/2">The vetting process for all prospective appointees to the NICS includes a number of levels which will be determined by the nature of the duties the appointee is required to carry out. Approximately 95 per cent. of all appointees are required to satisfy a Basic Check level which consists of an identification check as well as a Criminal Record Check (CRC). The CRC, which is undertaken by the Criminal Records Division of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), identifies all instances where an individual has either been convicted of an offence or where a criminal case is pending.</p>
	<p pid="e.910W.2/3">A small number of posts within the NICS may require enhanced vetting. In addition to those checks carried out under Basic Check, enhanced vetting, which is undertaken by the NI Security and Vetting Unit of the NIO, includes an assessment of an applicant's credit and pecuniary history and an assessment of the individual as a security risk.</p>
	<p pid="e.910W.2/4">Recruitment Service does not have any direct links, or liaise in any way, with foreign law enforcement agencies, when vetting prospective recruits.</p>

	<p pid="e.924W.3/2">Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) continually reviews safety with regard to access to railway lines and engages in a wide range of activities to prevent accidents. In this respect NIR recognises that a partnership is required between the public and Translink. By their nature it is not possible to totally separate rail lines from public access as access to and across tracks is required at various defined points.</p>
	<p pid="e.924W.3/3">NIR has spent over &pound;8 million upgrading either half or full barriers at public level crossings in the last five years. CCTV also protects full barrier crossings and the crossings are inspected on a quarterly basis for maintenance purposes. These crossings are also subject to Level Crossing Orders made under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. Furthermore, they are also subject to a tripartite annual safety inspection involving NIR, PSNI and Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="e.924W.3/4">NIR has developed a comprehensive risk model covering all private user accommodation crossings and has a programme of improvements and closures in progress to reduce overall risk. User worked crossings are inspected twice a year with access points, where defined, protected by a number of means including user worked gates and arras boards (planking laid on the ground) to discourage people and animals from going onto the track.</p>

In addition, this approach is supplemented by the qualified teachers employed at each of the EHS's Environmental Education Centres across Northern Ireland, who have integrated waste education into their teaching programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.924W.6/3">District councils have waste management education officers, who visit primary schools on a regular basis, raising awareness of how to prevent and recycle waste.

	<p pid="e.928W.5/1">The Department advises schools to carry out a risk assessment when they are planning trips. In 2002 the Department issued comprehensive guidance to schools entitled &quot;Health and Safety of Pupils on Educational Visits&quot;, which was published by the then Department for Education and Employment (DfEE). The Education and Library Boards provided their own guidance to schools in 2004. Both sets of guidance provide advice on carrying out risk assessment, including evaluating potential risks, putting control measures or mitigations in place and informing all relevant people.</p>

The Chief Coroner will make an annual report to the Lord Chancellor on the performance of the coroner system and, in turn, the Lord Chancellor will ensure the report is laid before Parliament. A Coronial Advisory Council will also be appointed to provide advice, and make recommendations, to the Chief Coroner and Lord Chancellor on any matters relating to the operation of the coroner system.</p>

Regulations made under the Act, entitled &quot;Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2006&quot;, set out the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice, and the Office for Judicial Complaints, with regard to the handling of complaints and the discipline of judicial office holders.

The draft Coroners Bill provides for new appeal arrangements which will make it easier for the public to seek review of coroners' decisions, relating to both an investigation and an inquest. The procedure for complaining about coroners' personal conduct will remain the same.</p>

	<p pid="e.933W.6/1">The budget allocation for FY 2006-07 is: Dorset&mdash;&pound;7.647 million; Gloucestershire&mdash;&pound;5.644 million; and Wiltshire&mdash;&pound;6.620 million. Re-structuring will not be completed until <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> and no changes will be made to the FY2006-07 budget allocations for these three areas as a result of the re-structuring exercise. The appropriate budget allocation for the new amalgamated Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire area will be determined in due course as part of the annual financial planning cycle.</p>
	<p pid="e.933W.6/2">Under the provisions of the Courts Act 2003, Section 4, the Lord Chancellor may make orders altering the HMCS areas but, before doing so, must consult any Courts Board(s) affected. This process has been invoked and each of the existing Court Boards have been invited to express their views by <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase>. It is anticipated that the separate Courts Boards for Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire will continue to operate in their current form until the end of FY 2006-07. Meanwhile, arrangements will be made to select members for a new single Courts Board which will correspond to the amalgamated Dorset, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire area. This will be done in close liaison with the Chairmen and Members of the existing bodies. Delivery of the service to court users in Dorset (as with Gloucestershire and Wiltshire) will not be affected by the re-structuring, and support to the judiciary at bench and court level will remain as it is now.</p>
	<p pid="e.933W.6/3">The number of people employed by Her Majesty's Courts Service in the three areas (expressed as full-time equivalents) as at June 2006 is: Dorset&mdash;219; Gloucestershire&mdash;163; and Wiltshire&mdash;193. While the precise management structure for the amalgamated area cannot be determined until a new Area Director has been appointed in October 2006, it is likely that re-structuring will directly affect only a very small number of senior management posts and those more junior staff who directly support them, leaving the courts operational staff unaffected. It is anticipated that this will be achieved through a combination of redeployment, natural wastage and targeted voluntary redundancy. Trades Unions will be consulted, at every stage.</p>

	<p pid="e.955W.0/1">Different aspects of the performance of the 149 public library authorities in England have been assessed, on a different basis, for DCMS since 1998. There was no formal assessment by the Department before then.</p>
	<p pid="e.955W.0/2">Though the terms &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;good&quot; have been part of the assessments of public library authority performance carried out for DCMS, there is no direct comparison between these different types of assessments.</p>
	<p pid="e.955W.0/3">Annual Library Plans were introduced in 1998 to improve the planning processes of library authorities. The scoring methodology was refined over time until they were discontinued in 2002-03 by which time 64 per cent. of authorities were producing plans that were assessed as good or excellent.</p>
	<p pid="e.955W.0/4">Library position statements were introduced in 2003-04 to assess the extent to which authorities were engaging with key messages that emerged from the Framework for the Future national public library strategy document. Authorities that were assessed as &quot;excellent&quot; in overall Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) terms; or &quot;excellent&quot; in CPA &quot;Leisure and Libraries&quot; terms and &quot;good&quot; overall were exempted from having to provide position statements. Additionally, authorities assessed as having provided an excellent position statement in 2003-04 were exempted from having to produce one in 2004-05. Therefore, there is no straight read across for the two years. However, of those authorities making submissions by the end of 2004-05, 87 per cent. were assessed as having presented good or excellent position statements.</p>
	<p pid="e.955W.0/5">The Public Library Standards originated in 2001-02 to introduce performance measurement for library authorities in England. They now form part of the Comprehensive Performance Assessment Culture Block. The basis of assessment for authorities' performance against the standards has evolved across the period so it is not possible to make straight comparisons. In 2004-05, authorities were assessed on the number of standards they had passed. Details of each of the 149 authorities' performance appear in the Public Library Statistics 2005-06 Estimates and 2004-05 Actuals published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. Copies are held in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="e.957W.6/1">Initial site investigation and desk-top research work, undertaken in support of the Olympic and Legacy Planning Applications, identified some contamination within the footprint of the Olympic Park area. Much of the contaminated land is former Brownfield or derelict land that has been used for a variety of industrial activities.</p>
	<p pid="e.957W.6/2">Site investigations are currently being carried out to characterise the nature of the ground conditions and the level of contamination. These investigations will be carried out in accordance with current industry best practice to identify the exact type and concentrations. The investigations are following the principles set out in the Intrusive Investigation Method Statement approved by the London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest, the Environment Agency and British Waterways. Copies of the Statement have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.957W.6/3">The boroughs have been consulted throughout the preparation of the Environmental Impact Assessment, during the site investigation phase and will continue to be consulted throughout the development of the remediation and validation works.</p>
	<p pid="e.957W.6/4">In addition, generic site specific soil target values have been generated and are detailed in a Global Remediation Strategy which has been reviewed and approved by the same regulators noted above. Once the site investigation is complete, detailed remediation strategies, including generation of site specific clean up targets, will be prepared and agreed with the regulators as appropriate prior to implementation and validation. All of the sites to be remediated will be subject to detailed planning applications.</p>

	<p pid="e.960W.8/1">All investment in medal potential for London 2012 is channelled through UK Sport, the Government's lead agency on high performance sport. UK Sport allocates Exchequer and Lottery funding solely through its World Class Pathway programme to the National Governing Bodies for Olympic and Paralympic sport, based on a range of factors including regular assessment of athlete performance at major international competitions. It is for those Governing Bodies to determine whether funding should then be provided for high performance sport through their clubs and associations.</p>

	<p pid="e.966W.11/1">Television licences for respite care arise principally in relation to the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary scheme. As part of BBC Charter Review, the Government re-examined anomalies within the existing concessionary arrangements, with a special focus on the ARC scheme. In the March 2006 White Paper, the Government acknowledged the shortcomings of the scheme but noted that proposals for change focused on individual anomalies rather than ways to improve the scheme as a whole. Previous changes to correct individual anomalies have done little to improve the scheme as a whole and have tended to create new problems. We therefore have no plans to amend the scheme, or to introduce a separate concessionary scheme for respite care accommodation.</p>

The returns policy will be implemented by the industry itself and I hope that it will take all relevant views into account, especially those of the ticket buying public, when doing this.

	<p pid="e.967W.2/1">The UK tourism balance of payments deficit was &pound;18.1 million in 2005. This figure has been produced using a range of data sources including the UK Tourism Survey and the International Data Survey.</p>
	<p pid="e.967W.2/2">The deficit reflects a range of factors including increased prosperity and the availability of cheap flights. The UK is by no means alone in this regard, indeed, in 2003 Germany's deficit stood at over &pound;27 billion.</p>

	<p pid="e.977W.3/2">The Government of Afghanistan have been leading the process to develop a national development strategy to tackle the country's reconstruction and development needs. In January at the London Conference, an interim strategy was launched and endorsed by the international community. Building on this effort, donors are now supporting the Government to prepare a final Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS), which will review needs in eight priority sectors: infrastructure, security, governance, education, health, agriculture and rural livelihoods, economic governance and private sector development, and social protection; as well as on important cross-cutting issues such as counter-narcotics and gender.</p>
	<p pid="e.977W.3/3">Progress of the international reconstruction effort is reviewed though a number of mechanisms. Donors will monitor progress of their own projects, and occasionally there may be joint reviews (such as the recently undertaken joint donor review for the National Solidarity Programme). Government Ministries work with donors to identify duplication and gaps in their sectors, and will draw up plans to feed into the ANDS. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) Performance Assessment Matrix will also allow for joint monitoring of development impact, once it is formally launched later this year.</p>

	<p pid="e.979W.11/1">We have no record of any independent detailed assessment of these issues. However, the UN-established serious crimes unit was mandated to investigate crimes against humanity and other serious crimes committed in East Timor in 1999 and issued a number of indictments against people who were serving in the Indonesian military at that time. A parallel process, the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) was set up by East Timor to look at less serious offences. The CAVR report found that human rights abuses were committed by Indonesian security forces. These human rights abuses were clearly contrary to the aims of the UN Mission to East Timor.</p>

	<p pid="e.980W.2/1">We recognise the important work done by the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation to promote reconciliation in East Timor, both through its Community Reconciliation Process&mdash;whereby those responsible for less serious crimes made amends for their actions outside the formal judicial system, supporting grassroots reconciliation&mdash;and through its attempts to determine the truth about human rights violations from 1974-1999. It is for the UN Secretary-General to decide whether to disseminate the Commission's report within the UN, including in the Security Council. The Commission for Truth and Friendship was set up by the Governments of East Timor and Indonesia specifically to look at the events surrounding the 1999 referendum. It commenced work in August 2005, for a period of one year and an extension has recently been announced until at least May next year. The central element to the Commission's work is truth and reconciliation rather than seeking to bring the perpetrators of human rights violations to court.</p>

	<p pid="e.981W.5/1">We believe the agreement between the US and India on nuclear arrangements can make a significant contribution to energy security, development, economic and environmental objectives for India and the international community, as well as representing a net gain for the non-proliferation regime. The UK has strongly supported this initiative from its inception and has been actively involved throughout.</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.5/2">We also believe that the initiative can have a positive impact on the broader nuclear non-proliferation framework, of which the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) is the cornerstone. We do not believe the agreement will have a direct impact upon the NPT. We remain committed to the objective of universal NPT adherence.</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.5/3">India has undertaken for the first time to put a large proportion of its nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, including all future civilian reactors, to sign an additional protocol with the IAEA, to adhere to the guidelines of the missile technology control regime and the nuclear suppliers group, to continue its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing, and to work with the US for a multilateral fissile material cut off treaty. Implementation of these commitments will bring India further into, and thereby strengthen, the broader nuclear non-proliferation framework, which is underpinned by the NPT. We judge that these steps will enhance regional stability.</p>

The programme is designed to strengthen the capacity of the East Timorese police service to maintain law and order effectively and professionally with full respect for human rights. The TLPDP complements other past and current police training undertaken by the UN and bilaterally. The programme has had a number of successes, including the design of a new curriculum at the police academy to incorporate human rights materials throughout. It produced its first batch of East Timorese trainers in November 2005, who were able to graduate their first basic recruit course of 260 new personnel earlier this year. The TLPDP recently received a favourable mention in the 2006 human rights watch report. Discussions have been held with the UN assessment team to look at how the work of TLPDP might complement that of the new UN policing activity in East Timor.</p>

	<p pid="e.988W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.2/2">The Government provided &pound;21.25 million in support of the Afghan Interim Administration's 2002 compensated eradication programme. Eradication in 2003, 2004 and 2005 was not compensated and compensated eradication does not form part of the present Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.2/3">The Afghan Government considered it appropriate to compensate farmers for eradication in 2002 because the 2002 crop was planted before the current regime came to power. We provided support because we believed it was important to support a new regime determined to take tough decisions to tackle drugs. However, it was the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to implement the programme and to ensure that compensation payments were made. We understand from the Afghan authorities that a total of 17,000 hectares of poppy was eradicated under the 2002 programme. The number of farmers compensated is a matter for the Government of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="e.988W.5/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.5/2" class="italic"> Spending on opium poppy eradication</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.5/3">None of the UK spending for opium poppy eradication comes from DFID's budget. In 2002, the UK provided financial assistance worth &pound;21.25 million to support the new regime's compensated eradication programme. The programme was led by the Afghan Transitional Authority who considered it appropriate to offer a one-off programme of payments to opium farmers on the basis that the poppy crop had been planted during the Taliban regime, before the current regime came to power.</p>
	<p pid="e.988W.5/4">Over financial years 2003-04 and 2004-06, the UK allocated the following amounts to support the Government of Afghanistan carry out poppy eradication in Afghanistan:</p>

	<p pid="e.988W.5/14">The opium economy is a major threat to the prospects for stability, peace and sustainable poverty reduction in Afghanistan. DFID has therefore increased its livelihoods programme significantly in recent years, supporting the Government of Afghanistan to develop the legal economy, and creating sustainable employment opportunities for poor people who currently rely on the illegal opium trade for their income. Since 2002, DFID has spent the following amount on improving rural livelihoods in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="e.991W.8/1">In South Sudan, an ongoing cholera epidemic has resulted in 16,964 reported cases of the disease, with 504 deaths. Of these, 6,163 cases and 116 deaths have been in Juba. The international response, working in partnership with the Sudanese Ministry of Health, has recently made good progress in bringing the outbreak under control in the South. Over the last week in Juba, for instance, there were only 10 new cases and no deaths reported. There continue to be new cases reported in some parts of the South but the response has become increasingly effective in containing these and treating those infected, according to DFID's humanitarian partners.</p>
	<p pid="e.991W.8/2">The UN Common Humanitarian Fund in Sudan, to which the UK is the largest donor with &pound;49 million this year, has played a key role in funding the international and local response to the cholera outbreak in the South, through UN agencies and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="e.991W.8/3">In Angola, a widespread cholera epidemic has been ongoing since mid-February, when the first case of cholera was reported in the Boa Vista slum area of Luanda. Due primarily to heavy rains, and poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, the epidemic spread rapidly to the other municipalities and then to neighbouring provinces (Benguela, Bengo, Kuanza Norde, Malanje, Huambom, Namibe and Bie).</p>
	<p pid="e.991W.8/4">Even though the epidemic has calmed considerably from its peak at the beginning of May, when more than 500 cases were being reported per day, it continues to result in 100 new cases per day across the country. By July 11, the Angolan Ministry of Health reported a total of 49,620 cases of cholera and 2,040 deaths since mid-February, making it the most serious outbreak ever to have affected Angola.</p>
	<p pid="e.991W.8/5">DFID has provided &pound;200,000 to Medecins Sans Frontieres to help combat the epidemic in Angola, and is currently supporting UNICEF with a grant of &pound;3.5 million to tackle some of the root causes of Angola's vulnerability to cholera outbreaks, including the poorest's access to primary health care, safe water and sanitation.</p>

	<p pid="e.993W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has issued two key papers in recent months outlining our commitments on climate change and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/2">DFID's new White Paper, 'Eliminating world poverty: making governance work for the poor' was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">13 July</phrase>. The White Paper addresses the need for a coherent approach to global environmental challenges and development, such as climate change. It states that:</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/3" class="indent">environmental wealth&mdash;natural resources&mdash;is a main source of growth in developing countries, and central to livelihoods of poor people;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/4" class="indent">environmental sustainability is one of the seven essential components for developing country growth;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/5" class="indent">we can help countries develop better approaches to using assets e.g. forests and water, in a more sustainable manner, and help manage the environmental impacts of growth;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/6" class="indent">we need to focus on the global consequences of growth&mdash;climate change has negative consequences for poor countries;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/7" class="indent">developing countries need assistance to access cleaner energy;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/8" class="indent">we need better information about the predicted impacts of climate change; and</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/9" class="indent">developing countries need support to adapt and build resilience to climate change.</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/10">In February 2006, DFID published a policy paper, &quot;DFID's Approach to the Environment&quot;. It outlines how we incorporate sustainability and environment into our work. The paper sets out principles for tackling environmental challenges, to be applied according to the circumstances of country programmes. These include:</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/11" class="indent">integrating environmental management for poverty reduction into our work, focusing on opportunities as well as risks;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/12" class="indent">supporting country driven processes e.g. poverty reduction strategies, to integrate local and global environmental priorities;</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/13" class="indent">providing technical assistance in selected countries and circumstances; and</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/14" class="indent">strengthening donor co-ordination on the environment, internationally and at country level.</p>
	<p pid="e.993W.5/15">The paper has an implementation plan agreed across DFID and approved by Top Management. Each division is responsible for ensuring that it delivers on implementation. Progress will be reviewed in spring 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.994W.2/1">DFID is committed to incorporating biodiversity into development in helping to improve poor people's livelihoods and in supporting developing countries to use the benefits of biodiversity and conservation to reduce poverty.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.2/2">Our major contribution to international biodiversity conservation is made through the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The GEF provides grants and concessional funds to help developing countries fund projects and programmes for sustainable management of the global environment. One third of the GEF's funds are spent on biodiversity and it is the financial mechanism of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The UK is currently the fourth largest donor, contributing &pound;118 million in the third replenishment period (2002-05). We are working to ensure a successful fourth replenishment.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.2/3">DFID recognises that biodiversity and the ecosystems it supports have a significant contribution to make towards poverty alleviation. However, the links between biodiversity, ecosystems and poverty often remain poorly understood. DFID is involved in a number of initiatives to develop a better understanding of mechanisms to capture the value of biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.2/4">For instance, DFID is currently working to develop a collaborative research programme on Ecosystem Services and Poverty with the Nature Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). Biodiversity will be a sub-theme within this programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.2/5">DFID is also one of the key contributors to the Ecosystems Marketplace. It serves as a one-stop shop for information on ecosystem service markets where providers and beneficiaries of ecosystem services can get together. More information is available at: <a href="http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/">http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/</a>. Additionally, DFID has engaged in a collaborative research project with the UK's fourth largest fund manager&mdash;ISIS Asset Management&mdash;to examine the nature of the relationship between biodiversity and business and the associated risks.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.2/6">As well as these initiatives, DFID works to ensures that its development assistance does not contribute to damage to ecosystems. Environmental Screening, mandatory for all DFID assistance greater than &pound;1 million, identifies environmental risks and opportunities. We are currently reviewing Environmental Screening experience since 2003. This will consider compliance with procedures and the quality of screening.</p>
	<p pid="e.994W.2/7">We also work to ensure that there is a coherent Government approach to international biodiversity. To achieve this, an Inter-departmental Ministerial Group on Biodiversity (IDMGB), comprising DFID, the Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministers has been established.</p>

	<p pid="e.995W.2/4" class="indent">Global Environmental Assets (covering climate change, biodiversity, desertification etc.);</p>
	<p pid="e.995W.2/5" class="indent">Environment for Sustainable Development (local environmental issues and minerals); and</p>
	<p pid="e.995W.2/6" class="indent">Water and Energy.</p>
	<p pid="e.995W.2/7">Policy work on agriculture (including fisheries and forestry) is carried out by the Renewable Natural Resources and Agriculture team in Policy Division's Growth and Investment Group.</p>
	<p pid="e.995W.2/8">On environment in developing countries, Asia Division has a regional adviser based in the UK and advisers in China, India and Bangladesh. Africa Division has two regional advisers based in UK and one adviser based in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="e.995W.2/9">In addition to its environment specialists, many of DFID's livelihoods and infrastructure advisers have relevant background or qualifications for working on environmental issues. Ten out of 38 infrastructure advisers have formal environmental professional qualifications e.g. Institution of Water and Environmental Management. Over half of our livelihoods advisers have natural resources qualifications and experience (e.g. soil science, forestry). Each group is lead by a head of profession. The head of profession environment post is currently filled on an acting basis but we will be advertising shortly. DFID's chief scientific adviser has been providing support on climate change and agriculture. This role has been formalised in his work plan for 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="e.996W.2/1">I was a member of the ad-hoc ministerial committee on climate change established prior to the G8 summit in 2005 to give officials a steer on this issue. This group met several times in the run up to the summit. Following the G8 summit responsibility for the international dimension of the UK's climate change strategy was taken on by the ministerial committee on energy and environment (EE), chaired by the Prime Minister, of which I am a member. In late June 2006, I met with the cross-party group of MPs who are participating in the G8+5 climate change dialogue, to discuss DFID's approach to tackling climate change. Climate change has also been identified as a key priority in the UK Government's latest Development White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="e.996W.5/1">DFID uses a range of different aid instruments, from direct support to countries to funding through multilateral agencies. It is therefore not possible to break down spending on individual communicable diseases; however it is possible to separate out AIDS from other communicable diseases.</p>
	<p pid="e.996W.5/2">DFID's spend on communicable diseases apart from AIDS in 2004-05 was &pound;80 million. Recording AIDS-specific expenditure is difficult because there are a range of sectors which have an impact on the epidemic, including health, education, social development and good government. There are also a range of instruments used to channel AIDS-related development spending. DFID has been working with the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and others to review and improve these expenditure calculations. While refinements to the methodology are still in progress, DFID has reported a provisional bilateral expenditure of &pound;350 million on AIDS for the period 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="e.996W.5/3">The focus of our work in health is to help countries strengthen their health systems both to prevent and mitigate the impact of communicable diseases. Functioning systems are crucial for effectively tackling diarrhoeal diseases, pneumonia and vaccine preventable disease epidemics as well as HIV, TB and malaria. In 2004-05, the UK provided more than &pound;360 million to support health services through our country, regional and research programmes and provided a further &pound;110 million for health through multilateral assistance to World Health Organisation (WHO) and UN agencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.996W.5/4">The UK also provides general poverty reduction budget support to countries to help build basic services, including for health. We are supporting a number of innovative financing mechanisms to increase resources to tackle communicable diseases. For example, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation will raise an additional &pound;4 billion from a number of donors for vaccines for the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisations and help support the development of new vaccines for communicable diseases that can be prevented.</p>

	<p pid="e.997W.2/1">In Southern Africa, the overall picture on food production shows a marked improvement this year compared to the 2004-05 growing season, when DFID spent more than &pound;67 million to deliver emergency assistance to up to 11 million affected people. Urgent humanitarian needs are unlikely this year, except in Zimbabwe, where needs remain pronounced.</p>
	<p pid="e.997W.2/2">Malawi and Zambia are reporting excellent harvests this year, with projected maize production figures for both countries almost double the volumes recorded in 2005. This should feed into more stable prices and improved access in the coming months. Production in South Africa has decreased sharply this year&mdash;a result of depressed prices in 2005 in the domestic market&mdash;but carryover stocks from last year are high. The food security outlook for the coming year is worst in Zimbabwe. Although food production is up on last year's levels, more than 1 million Zimbabweans still require sustained assistance to help them meet their food requirements.</p>
	<p pid="e.997W.2/3">In West Africa, the food security situation is improved compared to 2005, although continuing humanitarian concerns persist, particularly in the Sahel. In Niger, where populations continue to struggle against the legacies of last year's crisis, up to 1.8 million people are currently facing acute difficulties in the ongoing hungry season, with up to 400,000 malnourished children expected to require nutritional therapy this year. In Mauritania, the hungry season is judged to have started early, with up to 400,000 facing acute levels of food-insecurity, particularly in the south. DFID currently has an ongoing humanitarian and hunger-related programme of assistance for the Sahel worth &pound;4 million this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.997W.2/4">Prospects for recovery in the Sahel this year appear compromised by erratic, late-starting and below average rains for the current agricultural season. Elsewhere in West Africa, localised problems of food-insecurity affecting relatively few people (particularly in Guinea and Guinea Buissau) are the exception to an otherwise positive prognosis, with good rainfall expected to lead to an above-average maize crop in August.</p>
	<p pid="e.997W.2/5">In the Horn of Africa, DFID shares the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (UN FAO)'s recent assessment that despite improved rains in eastern Africa, food security remains poor among some communities in particular in northern and eastern Kenya, and in Somalia in many of the same areas affected by drought in 2005. In Kenya, overall prospects for the current main cereal crop are favourable, but in Somalia, the outlook is poor and output is expected to be reduced for the third consecutive year. In Eritrea, the picture is mixed. In Ethiopia, the prospects are generally good apart from in parts of the south east. The UN estimates that 7.5 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in drought-affected areas. In each of these countries high levels of malnutrition and starvation have been demonstrated among children over the past year. The areas and communities where this occurs should be the priority for food aid assistance, and humanitarian assistance more generally. DFID has committed more than &pound;46 million of humanitarian assistance to the response since the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="e.1001W.2/2">DFID uses international data from the World Bank and the United Nations to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the countries in which it has a programme. It is not possible to assess progress towards the MDGs in countries where data on performance in key sectors is missing or incomplete. In such countries, DFID will identify other ways to measure progress. For example, DFID might use targets contained in partner government national strategies as the basis on which progress is assessed. In some countries, sample surveys conducted through DFID projects or by other agencies provide useful data on which assessments of progress can be made.</p>
	<p pid="e.1001W.2/3">DFID is working with many partner countries and with international institutions to improve the quality of the data that are available to measure progress, so that the number of cases of incomplete or missing data are reduced. This includes working with the PARIS 21 (Partnerships in Statistics for Development for the 21st Century) consortium of donors, partner countries and multilateral agencies to raise awareness of the problems linked to inadequate statistics.</p>

	<p pid="e.1004W.3/1">We keep the humanitarian situation in Somalia under constant review. There have been a number of assessment visits this year with DFID participation, and I visited the drought-affected area around Wajid myself in May.</p>
	<p pid="e.1004W.3/2">The main concern remains the effect of the drought in some areas of the South. The conflict in Mogadishu and beyond between Somali warlords and Islamic Courts, which now threatens to involve others, is also having humanitarian repercussions as people's lives are disrupted by the fighting. It appears that for the time being, Mogadishu is no longer contested and that people are now able to go about their business more freely. The UN estimates that approximately 1.7 million people require relief assistance in Somalia. The main rains have been better than last year, but still a long way short of the quantities and distribution needed to produce a satisfactory harvest and recovery of pasture. The UK is currently the second biggest donor of humanitarian assistance having committed &pound;13.2 million since the onset of the drought. This includes support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who are providing drought relief assistance and directly addressing the effects of the previous fighting in Mogadishu where they run hospitals treating the wounded.</p>
	<p pid="e.1004W.3/3">The security situation in Somalia is extremely fragile. The past few months have seen heavy fighting in Mogadishu. With the Islamic Courts' victory over the warlords, the situation in the city appears to have largely stabilised. However, there is a continued threat of conflict between the Transitional Federal Government based in Baidoa and the Islamic Courts which could destabilise the whole country and region, and draw in regional states. We are urging all national and regional parties to show restraint and commit themselves to resolve the situation through dialogue. We strongly support continuation of the Arab League sponsored dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Islamic Courts in Khartoum.</p>
	<p pid="e.1004W.3/4">The northern parts of Somalia remain relatively stable.</p>

	<p pid="e.1005W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/2" class="italic"> Darfur</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/3">The humanitarian situation in Darfur continues to be of concern. The ability of agencies to access and deliver assistance to affected populations has become increasingly difficult because of banditry, inter-SLA factional fighting and attacks on civilians and NGO staff. In North Darfur, the recent fighting between SLA factions has led to an estimated 15-18,000 people displaced, adding to the 250,000 displaced since the start of 2006. While humanitarian indicators (health, mortality, malnutrition etc.) have remained relatively stable in the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, the oncoming rainy season and the increasing instability threatens to undermine the progress made.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/4" class="italic"> East.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/5">The issue of access for humanitarian agencies is also a significant problem in the East. The World Food Programme (WFP) has propositioned food stocks in anticipation of both the rains and further access difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/6" class="italic"> South.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/7">The UN estimate that about 500,000 displaced people returned to the South from within Sudan and neighbouring countries over the last dry season (October-May). The flow of returnees has slowed in recent weeks due to the onset of the rains. Provision of basic services and the establishment of sustainable livelihoods for returnees and others in the South is a major challenge. There has been a predicted seasonal surge in malaria and other disease in the South, but the cholera outbreak has largely been brought under control.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/8" class="italic"> DFID Humanitarian Program.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/9">DFID is providing &pound;67 million this financial year to humanitarian activities in Sudan. In Darfur, we are the second largest bilateral donor with &pound;126 million given in humanitarian assistance since 2003. A major part of our funding this year (&pound;49 million) is for the Common Humanitarian Fund, a pioneering mechanism allowing the Humanitarian Co-ordinator to fund the highest priorities across Sudan. We also continue to lobby the Government of Sudan on allowing full and unimpeded access for humanitarian agencies throughout Darfur and the rest of Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/10">Security information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/11" class="italic"> Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/12">The situation remains fragile. Fighting continues between different rebel groups as well as tribal militias, particularly around Sir Maza, Tawilla and Kutum in North Darfur and Greida in South Darfur. Banditry is an ongoing problem, especially in West Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/13" class="italic"> East.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/14">Some isolated clashes have been reported, but overall the situation is calm at present. The SPLM forces withdrawal from Hamesh Korei has been peaceful. However, there is some tension along the border between Sudan and Eritrea. We hope that the current talks in Asmara will lead to lasting security in the region.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/15" class="italic"> South</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/16">Much of Southern Sudan remains volatile. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has re-established a presence in the far South. Recent tribal clashes in Lakes State reportedly left 60 dead. Lawlessness remains a problem.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/17" class="italic"> Khartoum/North.</p>
	<p pid="e.1005W.2/18">The situation is calm at present. We condemn the recent attack on Hamrat ash-Sheikh in North Kordofan, and any attempt to spread violence from Darfur further afield.</p>

	<p pid="e.1006W.2/1">Water access and management are root causes of the conflict in Darfur DFID's expenditure for water and sanitation in Sudan is approximately &pound;17 million per year, which accounts for approximately half of DFID's total water and sanitation expenditure in Africa. The bulk of these funds are provided as humanitarian support channelled through the Common Humanitarian Fund and NGOs. We are also providing direct support to UNICEF, which is a key donor for the water sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/2">Water will be a core issue for the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) signed in early May 2006. A UN/World Bank-led Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) was launched in June to plan the recovery and development process for Darfur. Water will be an important issue that they will consider when formulating their plans, which will be presented to donors at a pledging conference in October. The UK has provided technical experts for the JAM and &pound;360,000 for its administration costs. The JAM's conclusions will shape our future support for Darfur. We stand ready to be a major partner in its recovery and development.</p>

	<p pid="e.1007W.8/1">The African Union mission in Darfur (AMIS) co-ordinates firewood patrols to provide protection for women when they leave camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs). Where this is happening the number of reported rapes has decreased significantly, and we are encouraging the African Union (AU) to promote this practice. AMIS also has civilian police presence in many IDP camps and we are urging AMIS within its resources to prioritise the civilian protection elements of its mandate.</p>
	<p pid="e.1007W.8/2">We have made, and continue to make clear, to the Government of Sudan that more must be done to provide security for the citizens of Darfur, and that perpetrators of such crimes must be brought to justice. In late December 2005, the UK participated in a mission to assess human rights in West Darfur consisting of representatives of the Government of Sudan, the UN and international community. The mission paid specific attention to gender based violence, and produced a number of recommendations. We are pressing the Government of Sudan to implement these recommendations as a matter of urgency. Transfer to a UN mission in Darfur, which the UK supports, would also help deal with the problems.</p>

	<p pid="e.1009W.6/2">DFID helps developing country governments to implement their own plans for provision of water and sanitation, which include both piped and public or communal provision to safe water, as appropriate. DFID provides direct financing and technical know-how. We also support the international system, particularly the UN to gather data on access to safe water and basic sanitation. In most countries, access to water and sanitation is better in urban areas than it is in rural. Access to water may be through house connections or through public connections close to the home.</p>
	<p pid="e.1009W.6/3">The urban population in Africa will increase from 300 million to 500 million between 2000 and 2015 and in Asia from 1.35 billion to 2 billion. This rapid growth in urban populations will pose severe problems to our partner governments including that of increasing access to water and sanitation. DFID has urban water and sanitation projects in Ghana, Nigeria, India and Bangladesh and our International Division supports the Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor to deliver sustainable water and sanitation to low-income urban and peri-urban communities. DFID is committed to doubling spending on water in Africa to &pound;95 million by 2008 and a further doubling to &pound;200 million by 2011. We are now actively involved in seven African countries (Ethiopia, the DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia), up from only two years ago; and through our funding of other agencies' programmes, we reach many other countries. For example the EU plans to provide 10 million people with access to water and a further 5 million to sanitation by 2010 through projects it has recently approved through the Water Facility.</p>

	<p pid="e.1010W.2/2">DFID commissioned an independent report on its expenditure on water and sanitation in the developing world. This report, &quot;Financial Support to the Water Sector&quot;, was produced by Atkins Consultants and is publicly available at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/water-sector-finance.pdf">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/water-sector-finance.pdf</a>. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, in response to previous related parliamentary questions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1010W.2/3">The report presents a breakdown of expenditure by region, country and theme. In 2001-02, the first year for which an urban/rural breakdown is available, &pound;35.8 million of DFID's bilateral water expenditure was spent on 'Urban water supply and sanitation'. In subsequent years there was a shift to rural activities. Bilateral urban water and sanitation expenditure was &pound;29 million in 2003-04. A proportion of DFID's contributions to multilateral, civil society organisations and Poverty Reduction Budget Support will also be spent on water provision in developing world cities, but it is not possible to break this expenditure down by theme.</p>
	<p pid="e.1010W.2/4">An update of the report, with details of expenditure for 2004-05 and 2005-06 will be published in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.1011W.0/1">DFID currently has two programmes supporting civil society in Iraq in promoting women's rights and equality issues, among other aspects.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/2">Our &pound;5 million Civil Society Fund supports international (mainly UK) Non Governmental Organisations to work with Iraqi counterparts. As part of this we are working with Women for Women International in Iraq to build women's leadership capacity, awareness of rights and the capacity to transfer knowledge and skills to the community more broadly. The Civil Society Fund also provides funding for the Women's National Commission's Internship project, which is working with women to engage with the Iraqi Government, by contributing to better and more inclusive, policies affecting women.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/3">Our &pound;7.5 million Political Participation Fund works directly with a range of Iraqi civil society organisations to help them engage in the political process and has supported a number of Iraqi women's groups in improving the political awareness and participation of women in Iraq's constitutional processes, including its recent elections.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/4">We have not funded specific projects in Iraq on domestic violence prevention.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/5" class="italic"> Afghanistan</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/6">DFID supports the role of women in all aspects of Afghan society. The strategy we are working towards is the Interim Afghan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS).</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/7">The I-ANDS recognises gender as a key cross cutting theme. Development of the full ANDS will ensure that these important issues are adequately addressed across the board. DFID are also funding the Government's National Programmes which include support to enhancing the role of women at community level. For example, the National Solidarity Programme ensures that women are engaged in determining community development priorities through the formation of Community Development Councils. We also support the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA), currently working in 18 provinces and plans to be active in all 34 by end of 2007. 80 per cent. of MISFA's beneficiaries are women.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/8">DFID supports equal rights for all the citizens of Afghanistan. At the national level we provided support to the drafting of the new constitution, which has successfully protected the rights of women and minority ethnic groups before the law. DFID provided significant funding for the Presidential and Parliamentary elections which have been a milestone for Afghanistan. A wide choice of candidates existed from a variety of ethnic, social and political backgrounds. A high number of women also registered as candidates and participated as voters (43 per cent. of voters were women).</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.0/9">DFID has not funded specific projects that target domestic violence in Afghanistan. However the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), through the Global Opportunities Fund is sponsoring a number of projects specifically designed to increase women's access to justice, improve their living standards, promote women's equal participation in governance, create a professional network of women's rights organisations and promote access to information through the radio.</p>

The Department does not hold information on other campaigns centrally, including those by non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), and to do so would entail disproportionate cost.

	<p pid="e.1013W.5/7" class="indent">The Ministers welcomed Airbus' response to the market and its intention to launch an all-new family of widebody aircraft. The Ministers confirmed their commitment to support the European aerospace industry. They reaffirmed their agreement to support Airbus to continue to innovate and to develop programmes in the context of international competition.</p>
	<p pid="e.1013W.5/8" class="indent">The Ministers once again expressed their desire for a negotiated solution to the current WTO dispute, but stressed the need for a balanced outcome regarding support for both current and future programmes so as to ensure a level playing field.</p>

These are part of the Local Transport Plan process and Accessibility Strategies were submitted to Department for Transport as part of the second round of Local Transport Plans in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.1017W.0/2">Department for Transport issued guidance to local transport authorities in December 2004 that highlighted food and essential services such as supermarkets, post offices and banks as being destinations that local transport authorities should consider as part of the process.

Accessibility Strategies contain a forward programme of analysis and action based on this prioritisation process.</p>
	<p pid="e.1017W.0/3">The South Nottinghamshire area is covered by the Greater Nottingham Local Transport Plan, which is jointly developed by Nottingham city council and Nottinghamshire county council. In the development of the associated Accessibility Strategy, a workshop was held in 2005 relating to access to food and essential services and included discussion of closures, cost of travel, relative infrequency of public transport in rural areas, and availability of information on transport types. The Post Office consumer group, Postwatch, were also consulted as part of this work.</p>

	<p pid="e.1019W.2/1">We use the Office of Telecommunications' (Ofcom) definition, published in their report &quot;Review of the Wholesale Broadband Access Markets&quot; of May 2004 as &quot;higher bandwidth, always-on service, offering data rates of 128kbps and above&quot;. This definition is used to measure take-up of the dynamic range of services available to residential and business consumers that are classed by the industry as broadband and to make comparisons with other European countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.1019W.2/2">DTI focuses on the uses for broadband, encourages take-up of services and the applications it provides. To that end, we are working with industry and other interested parties through the Broadband Stakeholders Group to assist and advise us in supporting end users needs in a converged digital world. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> we launched 'Connecting the UK: the Digital Strategy'. The strategy outlines the policy focus towards stimulating effective take-up and use of ICT. The strategy aims to address the digital divide that currently sees some groups excluded from the benefits to be gained from the internet.</p>
	<p pid="e.1019W.2/3">The UK has over 10 million broadband subscribers and there are over a quarter of a million new subscribers each month. Broadband prices are falling and speeds are increasing. As new technologies emerge, consumer choice increases, making broadband a more accessible and popular option. Broadband is available to 99.8 per cent. of households. I also understand that it is likely that the target set by the Telecommunications Adjudicator, for 1.5 million lines to be unbundled from the local loop network by April 2007, will be met by the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.1025W.8/1">Power producers are strongly incentivised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from all aspects of electricity production through the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which incentivises all installations it covers to reduce emissions in response to a carbon price. It is up to each installation to determine what measures it may take to reduce its emissions, which may include those attributable to transmission and distribution losses.</p>
	<p pid="e.1025W.8/2">In addition, power producers are specifically incentivised to reduce transmission and distribution losses through the requirement on all power producers using the transmission system to pay on a cost reflective basis. This aims to reflect the costs generators impose on the network to transfer electricity to where it is required. With 2 per cent. of electricity conveyed over the transmission network lost, through noise and heat, there is an environmental as well as economic case for having generation near to the main centres of electricity demand and the transmission charging system reflects this.</p>
	<p pid="e.1025W.8/3">About 6 per cent. of electricity conveyed over the distribution network is lost. Distribution Network Operators, as part of their regulated price controls, are incentivised to reduce these losses.</p>

Ofgem has to allow the networks sufficient revenue to invest in their businesses to deliver licence conditions, which include having safe and reliable networks. At the same time, Ofgem seeks to keep costs down for consumers. The reliability of the distribution networks in Britain has improved, with power cuts relating to underlying performance (i.e. taking out major storms) down by 16 per cent. since performance incentives were introduced in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="e.1034W.5/2">For the 2005-10 price control, &pound;5.7 billion has been allowed for investment in the distribution networks. These allowances are 48 per cent. above the 2000-05 price control. Specific measures have been introduced to assist renewables and distributed generation. The 2005-10 price controls addresses three key areas: the need to increase investment and efficiency, to improve quality of service and to accommodate the growth in distributed generation.</p>

	<p pid="e.1044W.8/1">The UK remains strongly committed to ensuring an ambitious and pro-development outcome to the Doha Round that provides real benefits to developing countries and an overall stimulus to world trade in goods and services. The inclusion of services and trade facilitation in the Doha Ministerial Declaration that launched the Round in 2001 was welcomed by the UK Government. Both are important elements of the ambitious and balanced final agreement that is our objective for these negotiations, towards which we continue to work.</p>

	<p pid="e.1073W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of unemployment for local areas from the annual local area Labour Force Survey and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions. The number of unemployed, resident in the Brent East Parliamentary Constituency was provided in Table 1 of an Answer on 11th July 2006 (Hansard column 1726W, reference 79828) up to the 12 months ending December 2004. The number of long-term unemployed was given in Table 3 of the same Answer. Table 1 attached shows more recent information from the APS. Table 2, attached, shows corresponding data for people resident in the London borough of Brent.</p>
	<p pid="e.1073W.5/5" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="e.1073W.5/6" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Data for all claimants resident in the Brent East constituency was provided in Table 6 of the above Answer and the number of long-term claimants (over 12 months) was given in Table 8 of the previous Answer. Table 3, attached, shows corresponding data for the London borough of Brent.</p>

	<p pid="e.1088W.2/1">In 2004-05 the last full financial year of providing the service under former arrangements, the cost of providing domiciliary oxygen services was &pound;32,809,524.

Under the new arrangements, which began on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, the annual cost will reflect the regional contract per diem prices in the 10 oxygen service regions in England and local patterns in ordering these services. The full cost of the service for 2005-06 is not yet available and these will include costs associated with the introduction of the new arrangements on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>. The first full year under the new service arrangement will be 2006-07 and we are only three months into the current financial year. In addition, in many parts of the country, primary care trusts have continued to work with local pharmacists to maintain a cylinder service in parallel with the new arrangements to safeguard continuity of supply to patients during action to transfer all patients to the new suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="e.1100W.0/1">The provision of information to the public on this kind of issue is generally a matter for local national health service services taking into account the needs and cultural background of their local population.</p>
	<p pid="e.1100W.0/2">The Human Genetics Commission supports the need for proper provision of education and information about marriage within a kin-ship group. This should entail access to counselling and support, preferably in the individual's or couple's preferred language, and a no-blame approach that enables at-risk couples to come forward for testing. Those wanting specific advice on their individual risk should consult a clinical geneticist or genetic counsellor in their local NHS regional genetics centre.</p>
	<p pid="e.1100W.0/3">The Department is funding two pilot projects in areas with large Asian communities that are looking at how best to raise community awareness of genetics services and what they can provide. These pilots will provide valuable evidence on how best to provide culturally sensitive services that meet the particular needs of these populations.</p>
	<p pid="e.1100W.0/4">The London IDEAS Genetic Knowledge Park (funded by the Department and Department of Trade and Industry) and the genetic interest group are preparing a leaflet dealing specifically with the possible increased risk of inherited disorders associated with consanguineous marriage for use by specialised genetics services as an adjunct to genetic counselling. This is part to of a larger project that aims to address the lack of availability of multilingual information on genetic disorders and risk.</p>

	<p pid="e.1104W.5/1">The Health Bill, which creates the regulation making powers, received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="">19 July</phrase>. The regulations will be laid, subject to parliamentary timetables, this autumn. The guidance on the new governance arrangements for controlled drugs was developed in conjunction with key stakeholders&mdash;professionals, regulators, police services, service providers and patient groups and was the subject of formal public consultation in the summer of 2005. The response to the consultation is available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="e.1104W.5/2">The controlled drugs advisory group commented on the draft regulations at their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-28">28 June 2006</phrase> and self-nominated representatives from the advisory group meet for a more detailed workshop on the draft regulations on <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase>. The sub-group included many of the key regulators involved in controlled drugs inspection: the Healthcare Commission, Royal Pharmaceutical Society, General Medical Council, Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, etc.</p>
	<p pid="e.1104W.5/3">Although there are no plans to repeat the formal public consultation, the Department has just completed a series of six conferences around the country for service providers&mdash;both national health service and the independent sector and the key regulators&mdash;on the new framework for the use and management of controlled drugs created by the Health Act 2006 and subsequent regulations.</p>

	<p pid="e.1109W.11/1">The recent study by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine into a possible link between the triple vaccine and autism and bowel disease in children (the Krigsman study) cannot be given credibility since it did not include any control groups. The same investigation in Dr Wakefield's own laboratories showed no evidence of measles virus in bowel tissue from autistic children. Several properly conducted studies that include control groups, have failed to find measles virus persisting in the blood cells of autistic children and therefore we believe that there remains no convincing epidemiological or virological evidence for measles, mumps and rubella playing a part in causing autism.</p>

	<p pid="e.1110W.2/1">Donor selection criteria are set by the Joint UK Blood Transfusion Services and National Institute of Biological Standards and Control Professional Advisory Committee (JPAC). The rules regarding blood donation are guided by epidemiological data relating to the United Kingdom and are regularly subject to review.</p>
	<p pid="e.1110W.2/2">The donor selection criterion which excludes men who have sex with men is kept under review by the expert advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood, tissues and organs for transplantation (MSBTO). MSBTO discussed a recent review of the epidemiological data relating to this issue at a meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="">20 June</phrase>. The Committee considered an evaluation of the effects of changes in the donor selection criterion for men who have had sex with men on the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections in England and Wales, 2002 to 2004. The Committee is expected to discuss this issue again at its next meeting in October.</p>
	<p pid="e.1110W.2/3">The current Donor Selection Guidelines (202, November 2005) state that female partners of a man who has had sex with another man must not donate, even if a condom or other protection has been used. There is discretionary provision to accept such an individual if at least 12 months have elapsed since the last sexual contact with a male partner who has sex with another man. This policy is currently under review by the UK Blood Services.</p>

	<p pid="e.1111W.2/2">In addition to the basic NHS bursary awards there are a number of other allowances. These include allowances for students aged 26 and over and dependents' allowances. Since 1999, we have also provided better support for student travel costs in respect of practice placements. In 2004, we introduced the childcare allowance and in 2005 continuing payments for students on maternity leave.</p>

The major impacting factor on the NHSLA's resource limit is the level of claims reported to the schemes. In 2005-06 fewer claims were made than forecast, meaning fewer new provisions and therefore an underspend in resource terms. As a consequence, NHSLA actuarial advisors reviewed the incurred but not reported provisions which led to a reduction in the resource requirement in year.</p>

	<p pid="e.1122W.14/1">Hospitals have for more than 70 years been able to recover the costs of providing treatment to the victims of road traffic accidents where the injured person successfully claims personal injury compensation from the person responsible for causing the injury, through their insurer. However, the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a streamlined, centralised recovery scheme, operated by the compensation recovery unit, part of the Department for Work and Pensions, on behalf of the Secretary of State. Recoveries since that scheme was introduced in April 1999 are as shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="e.1128W.9/1">Although the data are not available in the form requested, we know that there has been a huge response both from practitioners (such as local authorities and the police) and from local communities in taking a stand to tackle antisocial behaviour. The tools and powers we have provided since 1997 are being used widely and wisely.</p>
	<p pid="e.1128W.9/2">For the last two years, we have carried out a survey of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England, and Community Safety Partnerships in Wales, asking about their actions taken to tackle antisocial behaviour. From those who responded to the surveys, the results are shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="e.1128W.9/3">A Home Office data collection exercise carried out in July 2005 estimated that between January 2004 and June 2005, 809 areas were designated as dispersal areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.1128W.9/4">The latest number of Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) issued in England between April 1999 and September 2005 as reported to the Home Office is 7,026; there were 330 ASBOs issued in Wales, and 13 in Denbighshire, in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="e.1128W.9/5">Although we have made much progress there is still much more to be done. We must ensure that our approach is taken nationally so that, no matter where they live, communities should not have to suffer long-term antisocial behaviour problems. Therefore, as part of our work to rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of the law abiding majority, we intend to increase the take up of antisocial behaviour powers, and to reduce the variation in local performance.</p>

	<p pid="e.1131W.14/1">Airwave is the new radio communications system for the police service in England, Wales and Scotland. The rollout of the TETRA mast network is the responsibility of O2 Airwave who own the network. The network is already in place. Officers across the country using the network are able to communicate directly with each other, regardless of location. The other emergency services are currently updating their radio communications networks on a national basis and will also be using the Airwave service. When their new systems are fully operational their communications systems will interoperate seamlessly with the police network. Existing interoperability arrangements on the old radios used by the services will be maintained until the new systems are fully operational.</p>

	<p pid="e.1139W.5/1">The majority of requests for the exchange of DNA information between the United Kingdom and other countries are routed through the United Kingdom National Central Bureau for Interpol (UK NCB) based at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA). Other channels may include bi-lateral direct liaison between law enforcement authorities; and formal mutual legal assistance channels. Exchanges of DNA information via these channels will almost always be a response to the needs of a specific criminal investigation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1139W.5/2">Requests from international law enforcement agencies for a search of the National DNA Database are only processed where it is clear that the request is in the interest of prevention and detection of crime, national security or the data subject. They are also subject to a risk assessment, taking into account the justification for and proportionality of disclosure of the information in line with human rights. If cleared for processing, a one-off speculative search of the Database is made by the Custodian and information fed back to UK NCB.</p>
	<p pid="e.1139W.5/3">The UK NCB is not currently able to provide data on the number of requests received from other countries but only on the number of requests processed and dealt with by the Database Custodian. As indicated in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase>, 519 search requests have been dealt with by the Database Custodian since 2004 and responses provided back to UK NCB in each case (this includes searches of the UK DNA Database at the request of other countries as well as preparing profiles in order for UK law enforcement agencies to request searches overseas).</p>
	<p pid="e.1139W.5/4">Data on the countries to which DNA profiles have been sent in pursuit of specific criminal investigations could only be provided at disproportionate cost as the majority of the data are not currently held electronically. This information will be available later this year following the introduction of a new data collection system (this will not apply to retrospective data).</p>
	<p pid="e.1139W.5/5">Data are not collected on the number of exchanges of DNA information which occur through direct liaison between law enforcement authorities or formal mutual legal assistance channels.</p>

	<p pid="e.1147W.5/1">After a very thorough review of data, I can confirm that the figures quoted in &quot;Seizures of Drugs in England and Wales 2003&quot; (Findings 265) for the number of seizures of methadone in 2000 (1,010) and both number/quantity of seizures of cocaine (6,530/5,210 kg) and heroin (14,630/4,000 kg) in 2001 are correct.</p>
	<p pid="e.1147W.5/2">Seizures data for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise published in &quot;Drug Seizure and Offender Statistics, UK, 2001 and 2002&quot; (Home. Office Statistical Bulletin 08/04) were restricted to seizures at the London airports. However, data presented in Findings 265 were for all Customs' seizures in England and Wales. While the number of seizures were largely unaffected, it resulted in increased overall figures for the quantity of drugs seized.</p>
	<p pid="e.1147W.5/3">The figure quoted in Findings 265 for the quantity of methadone seized in 2000 (380 kg) is, however, incorrect. Police in England and Wales seized 91.585 kg of methadone in 2000, with Customs seizing 0.68 kg as well as 284 tablets. For the purposes of reporting the tablets should not have been included in the Findings' tables. The revised total quantity figure is 92.265 kg, which will be rounded down to 90 kg in the next &quot;Seizures of Drugs in England and Wales&quot; Home Office Statistical Bulletin.</p>

A summary of responses report was published on <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase>. A number of respondents commented on the issue of raising awareness amongst those who pay for sexual services of the consequences of having sexual intercourse with a trafficked person. We intend to consider the consultation responses over the next few months with the aim of producing a final UK Action Plan by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1152W.5/2">During the recent, police-led operation on trafficking for sexual exploitation (called Operation Pentameter) specific awareness raising measures were undertaken. These included writing to publishing houses that have men's magazines and pornographic titles asking for them to be informed on the issue of trafficking and for support in terms of editorial copy and advertising space. In addition, leaflets were produced and distributed at airports to raise awareness amongst men travelling to the World Cup. An article was also placed in the England supporter's magazine 'Fanzine' handed out before the England football matches in Germany. The work undertaken by Operation Pentameter will be carried on by the UK Human Trafficking Centre which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="e.1155W.2/1">The Government take the problem of identity fraud very seriously. There is no single offence of identity fraud. On seven June 2006 we brought into force sections 25 and 26 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which created new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents. These offences relate to a wide range of identity documents, including passports, driving licences, ID cards and immigration documents. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for an offence of possession with intent to use the document for establishing registrable facts about another person, such as name, address, date of birth and other personal details, and two years imprisonment for possession without reasonable excuse. Investigation of offences under these provisions is already under way and statistics on the number of prosecutions and convictions will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="e.1155W.2/2">There is also a range of other criminal offences to combat identity fraud. These include, for example, the offences in the Theft Acts of 1968 and 1978 of obtaining property by deception (property includes money), obtaining services by deception and obtaining a money transfer by deception. The number of these offences that were committed using a false or stolen identity is not recorded centrally and it is not possible to provide such figures for Humberside or any other area. However, identity theft and identity fraud questions were incorporated into the British Crime Survey in 2005 and the results should give us more information on the number of victims and the types of fraud that are being committed.</p>

	<p pid="e.1156W.9/1">An initial assessment of vulnerability of under-18 offenders is carried out, before sentence, by the youth offending team . Figures provided by the Youth Justice Board show that during the period April 2004 to March 2005 the number of young people who were assessed as vulnerable in this way and subsequently placed in a young offender institution was 3,370. All young people placed in a secure training centre or a secure children's home are considered vulnerable, either on account of their age or because of other risk factors.</p>
	<p pid="e.1156W.9/2">Vulnerability is a concept which embraces a wide range of possible factors, including physical and mental health and other special needs. Young people assessed as vulnerable by the youth offending team are not all at high risk. Also, the degree of vulnerability may change in the course of their period in custody. The youth offending team's assessment is therefore only a starting point. While the most vulnerable young people are accommodated in establishments with high staff-to-trainee ratios, safeguarding arrangements are in place in all establishments.</p>
	<p pid="e.1156W.9/3">There is no formal definition of vulnerability for adult offenders and consequently no estimate has been made of young adults falling within this category. However, there are systems in place to identify and assist vulnerable adult offenders in custody.</p>

	<p pid="e.1159W.8/1">Partnership working is central to the delivery of Home Office business. The National Community Safety Plan provides a clear statement of community safety priorities for local partners. Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) are well established as the primary local delivery vehicle for community safety work. Earlier this year, the Government published a review of CDRPs, with the aim of further improving their effectiveness and strengthening their accountability to the communities they serve. Partnership working is also at the heart of neighbourhood policing. As part of the neighbourhood policing initiative the police will work with local partners and communities to tackle local priority issues. At the national level, the Home Office is working with stakeholders to ensure that neighbourhood policing is integrated into the wider community safety agenda.</p>
	<p pid="e.1159W.8/2">The National Offender Management Service is giving high priority to fostering partnership working as part of its work to reduce re-offending, including through the Civic Society, Corporate and Faith, Community and Voluntary Sector Alliances.</p>
	<p pid="e.1159W.8/3">Working with a range of external partners is vital for delivery of 'Integration Matters', our strategy for refugee integration. We recognise that statutory and voluntary sector organisations are best placed to help us to remove the barriers that can prevent refugees from integrating into their new communities. Partnership working is also essential for the National Refugee Integration Forum (NRIF). This body brings together 32 individuals with a range of experiences and perspectives in delivering refugee integration, and is tasked to review our work and ensure that we are delivering on the action plan set out in the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="e.1160W.2/1">The Youth Justice Board commissions 2,844 places for boys in 13 young offender institutions and 75 places for girls in four special units. It also commissions 274 places in secure training centres and 235 in secure children's homes. Younger and more vulnerable sentenced young people and those subject to court-ordered secure remands are placed into secure training centres or secure children's homes. All of the secure training centre places are provided by the private sector and all but one of the secure children's homes are in the public sector. Eleven of the 13 young offender institutions for boys and all four special units for girls are in the public sector. There are two privately run young offender institutions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.2/2">Although the most vulnerable young people are placed in secure training centres or secure children's homes, all establishments are able to accommodate young people who have some degree of vulnerability. There are safeguarding arrangements in place at all establishments for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.2/3">There is no formal definition of vulnerability for adult offenders but prisoners may be in need of support or protection for a number of reasons. Such prisoners are managed and supported in a range of ways including being located in vulnerable prisoner units, in units or establishments dealing with prisoners convicted of certain offences such as sexual offences, segregated for their own protection or transferred to another establishment where they are not known. The management of vulnerable prisoners is a progressive process and they are not necessarily held in designated accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="e.1160W.5/3">Information on basic command units has only been collected since 2003. In March 2003, Southend had 170 (full-time equivalent) officers per 100,000 population. This figure increased to 175 in March 2004 and 179 in March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.5/4">Information on the number of police officers to population was published in the annual report of HM chief inspector of constabulary prior to 1998, but this information was based on the authorised establishment of each police force rather than its total strength and was presented as the ratio of population to each police officer. Therefore it is not possible to provide data for earlier years as it is not directly comparable with the Home Office calculations from 1998 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="e.1164W.3/1">We have already made good progress on reducing the bureaucratic burdens on police officers by cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring that forces have the best scientific and technological support like video identity parades and electronic fingerprinting.</p>
	<p pid="e.1164W.3/2">The Government introduced a measure in 2003 to record the amount of time that police officers spend on frontline duties in order to help to maximise the time spent on their core roles of preventing and reducing crime. More police officer time was spent on front line duties in 2004-05 (64.1 per cent.) than in 2003-04 (63.6 per cent.) and we are determined to see this improvement continue, with police authorities setting robust targets for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="e.1164W.3/3">The Home Office expects that the police service can increase this to a national average of around 72 per cent. in 2008. This will be a gain in time on frontline duties equivalent to an extra 12,000 police officers. To support this, police staff numbers have grown substantially over the last few years. In September 2005 there were 71,967 police staff, an increase of 18,956 (nearly 36 per cent.) since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="e.1167W.2/1">No. The police funding formula was reviewed in 2005. It was concluded that data used in the tourism indicator were out of date. The use of more recent information was considered but this was unsatisfactory for inclusion in the new police formula.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/2">Representatives from ACPO and the APA and the wider policing community were involved in the review. A full consultation on options for change took place last summer. All representations received were fully taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/3">Overall, Dorset has benefited from the revised formula changes and their position was protected further by the application of a virtually flat rate grant increase for all police authorities for 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="e.1168W.6/1">In November last year we announced a two-year funding settlement for police authorities in England and Wales. The increase in 2006-07 enabled a broadly flat-rate increase of 3.1 per cent. for each police authority. A provisional grant increase of 3.6 per cent. was announced for 2007-08. The utilisation of all available resources is a matter for the police authorities and chief officers of police.</p>
	<p pid="e.1168W.6/2">We are also putting substantial resources into neighbourhood policing and police community support officers (PCSOs). With the &pound;91 million from the Chancellor in the Budget, we are expecting to allocate over &pound;220 million to police authorities this financial year to increase PCSO numbers to 16,000 by April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.1169W.15/1">The Home Office Scientific Development Branch has carried out desk-based research into the area of calmatives, including anaesthetics, and malodorants. It concluded that neither calmatives nor malodorants currently meet the police requirements. Calmatives carry additional health risks compared to alternative options and malodorants do not appear to offer any tactical advantage over existing incapacitants available to the police. Further research will only be carried out on either of these areas if there are significant advances in the available technology.</p>

	<p pid="e.1173W.6/1">The prevalence of mental health problems among prisoners is considerably higher than for the general population. The most reliable evidence comes from the 1997 ONS study of psychiatric morbidity among prisoners which found that 90 per cent. of prisoners have at least one significant mental health problem, including personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence (Singleton et al, 1998).</p>
	<p pid="e.1173W.6/2">Data from a Home Office survey of over 2,000 prisoners nearing release found that 5.6 per cent. were veterans of the armed forces (cited in Dandeker et al, 2003). Of these 85 per cent. had been in the Army, four per cent. in the RAF, and 11 per cent. in the Navy. However, there are no estimates available of the proportion of veterans in custody who have mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid="e.1174W.0/1">The policy on the use of mechanical restraints is contained in the Prison Service's national security framework. Any use of restraints is based upon a thorough security risk assessment of the individual prisoner and this includes pregnant women. Where a need to use restraints is identified, the general expectation is that the restraints will be removed upon arrival at the hospital and not re-applied until the prisoner is ready to be returned to prison.</p>

	<p pid="e.1181W.5/1">Information on the average custodial sentence lengths for determinate sentences for these offences is contained in the table.</p>
	<p pid="e.1181W.5/2">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole half way through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Release, when it occurs, is on licence and subject to supervision up to the three-quarters point (or to the end of the sentence in the case of some sex offenders), and they are liable to recall if they breach any of the licence conditions. All offenders risk serving the rest of their sentence in custody if they commit another offence before the end of the original sentence.</p>
	<p pid="e.1181W.5/3">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced new arrangements for the release on licence of determinate sentence prisoners. They apply only to offences committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. A new indeterminate public protection sentence was introduced. Those offenders judged to be dangerous, and who have committed serious sexual or violent offences, can be kept in prison until the parole board judges it is safe to release them. If they have committed less serious offences they may serve a determinate sentence followed by an extended period on licence after release of up to eight years for sexual offences and five years for violent offences.</p>
	<p pid="e.1181W.5/4">Unless considered dangerous, those sentenced to 12 months or more will be released on licence at the halfway point of their sentence. They will remain on licence, subject to a recall if they breach the conditions of their licence, for the entire remaining period of their sentence instead of to the three-quarter point as under the 1991 Act.</p>
