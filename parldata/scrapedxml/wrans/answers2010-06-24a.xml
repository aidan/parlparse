	<p pid="a.281W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice has, for the last four years, allocated &#163;1.25 million per annum to voluntary sector organisations supporting victims of sexual violence. This is funded through the Victim Surcharge, which is a &#163;15 levy on all fines imposed by the courts following a criminal conviction. It is a condition of the Ministry of Justice's financial settlement that the income from the surcharge must be used to provide non-financial support to victims of crime and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.281W.5/2">For the current financial year only, the previous Secretary of State for Justice agreed with the then Minister for Women to combine this funding from the Ministry of Justice with &#163;1 million from the Government Equalities Office, creating a single fund for organisations that support victims of sexual violence. All other arrangements for the funding, including any ring-fencing, remain unchanged. This one-off combined fund was created to provide a more joined-up approach to the sector, to simplify the application process for organisations bidding for money and to deliver better value for money overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.282W.0/1">As I am sure the hon. Member is aware, RMJ are now in administration. Where any provider ceases to have a legal aid contract for whatever reason, the LSC will make an assessment of any potential financial issues in the individual circumstances. This will include payments on account made, claims to be billed and whether for example the provider will be continuing to conclude cases for existing clients. It may transpire that RMJ owe money to the LSC.</p>

	<p pid="a.283W.0/1">The overwhelming majority of property occupied by the UK Border Agency overseas is linked to the processing of visa applications. None of these buildings are leased by the UKBA; they are all leased and managed by the FCO, as part of a package of support services provided to the FCO for which a central charge is made. It is common practice for office accommodation to be shared with the FCO, where this represents the best use of the available office space. Over the last three years the UKBA have rationalised their footprint overseas by concentrating work into a reduced number of decision-making posts. They are currently investigating how further, similar savings can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.0/2">The remainder of UKBA overseas property is linked to the operation of the juxtaposed control. The UK Border Agency rents residential and business properties on the continent for use by officials who operate from ports, terminals and office sites. These properties are not shared with other bodies and there are no plans to cease operation of these immigration controls.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.2/1">In England and Wales, the acquisition, deployment and use of Tasers is an operational matter for chief officers of police. Conducted Energy Devices are classified as 'prohibited weapons' by virtue of section 5 Firearms Act 1968. Police officers in England and Wales while acting in their capacity as such, are exempt from the requirements of the legislation and do not need any additional legal authority to possess the Taser.</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.2/2">Taser is available to Authorised Firearms Officers (AFO) in England and Wales as a less lethal alternative for use in situations where a firearms authority has been granted in accordance with criteria laid down in the Association of Chief Police Officers Manual of Guidance on the Management, Command and Deployment of Armed Officers. Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July 2007</phrase> Taser has been deployed by AFOs outside of a firearms authority where officers are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves and/or the subject(s). Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase>, Taser is also used in similar circumstances by specially trained units who are not authorised firearms officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.0/2">Due to the uncertainty of certain costs when building a road, the Highways Agency calculates the maximum and minimum forecast spend on the scheme to create a range estimate. A figure in the middle of the range estimate is then used for planning purposes. The current scheme range estimate for the A5-M1 Link is &#163;134 million to &#163;189 million with a mid range estimate of &#163;162 million. This is based on a detailed review of scheme costs in September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.0/3">In relation to previous estimates, the July 2008 scheme range estimate was &#163;121 million to &#163;156 million with a mid range estimate of &#163;139 million. This was based on M1 J10-13 being constructed as a widening scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.0/4">The March 2009 scheme range estimate was &#163;160 million to &#163;218 million with a mid range estimate of &#163;189 million. This was based on an initial assessment of the cost of A5-M1 Link following the decision to change M1 J10-13 from a widening to Managed Motorways scheme with the resulting transfer of some statutory diversion and structure works at Junction 11A to the A5-M1 scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.304W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many parents who were paying child support to the Child Support Agency directly from their salary by Deduction from Earnings Orders in financial year 2009-10 lost some or all of their payments after their employer went into receivership.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.3/5" class="indent">The information you requested is not available as the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) does not collate this type of information for management information purposes. However, you may find it helpful to know, as at March 2010, it is estimated that 117,600 cases are receiving maintenance via a deduction from earnings order or request.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.3/6" class="indent">In England and Wales, if the non-resident parent's employer enters bankruptcy or liquidation, the non-resident parent is responsible for paying any maintenance which was deducted from their wages by their employer and not paid over to the Commission, and for recovering any money deducted from their employer. They can do this through lodging a claim in the insolvency proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.3/7" class="indent">The official receiver or liquidator appointed to look after the affairs of the employer gives employees a comprehensive information pack which should cover every eventuality, including the non-payment of deductions to the Commission. If a non-resident parent has specific questions not covered in this pack, they should contact the official receiver or liquidator directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.3/8" class="indent">Scottish law is different. Any money deducted by a deduction from earning order remains part of the non-resident parent's wages until the Commission receives it. However the Commission is responsible for claiming the money and the Commission must lodge a claim in the insolvency proceedings for money deducted and not paid over.</p>
	<p pid="a.304W.3/9" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.5/1">The coalition Government are committed to reducing the United Kingdom's budget deficit. It has led us to identify savings across Government, starting with the &#163;6 billion of immediate savings this year that we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-24">24 May</phrase>, including the &#163;150 million reduction against the previous Administration's housing pledge. Against this &#163;170 million has been provided for 2010-11 to safeguard delivery of around 4,000, otherwise unfunded, social rented homes. It is estimated that the &#163;150 million reduction will reduce the number of affordable housing starts by around 5,000 but these changes will mainly fall to shared ownership and shared equity schemes-not social rented housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.5/2">The Department is consulting on the mechanism by which the Housing Market Renewal reduction of &#163;50 million will take place. In addition we will un-ring fence HMR expenditure in order to provide maximum flexibility at a local level. At this stage the final decision on individual allocations has still to be taken. It will be for individual HMR Pathfinders to manage the reductions and to review the varying impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.314W.0/4">All colleges that received less than &#163;5 million in grant support since 2001 will receive a share of the &#163;30 million renewal grant.

Each will receive approximately &#163;225,000, with an expectation that such investment will facilitate considerable additional private finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.0/5">The remaining &#163;20 million will be made available to the same colleges through an enhanced renewal grant. At least 20 colleges will have the opportunity to add to their renewal grant, by bidding to build their total allocation to &#163;1 million. Colleges will be expected to attract substantial additional private finance, resulting in final projects of significant value.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.0/6">Applications for the enhanced renewal grant will be assessed using key criteria, including the existing condition of bidding colleges' estates and facilities; resulting benefits to learners; and the contribution which each applicant's proposals make to the regeneration of their local community. Projects will be expected to meet exacting design standards, ensuring a built legacy of which all concerned can be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.0/7">I understand that the College of North West London had previously received capital grant support, and as such, will not be eligible to access the &#163;50 million fund. It is recognised that this may leave ineligible colleges feeling disappointed, but this Government believe it is right to target resource at those who have to date benefited least and believe we will see significant improvements for learners as a result.</p>

	<p pid="a.325W.6/1">Food Standards Agency (FSA) officials have attended each meeting at the EU level to discuss European legislation on food supplements in the last 24 months. There have been no European Union level meetings on this subject since this Government was formed and therefore no reports have been received.</p>
	<p pid="a.325W.6/2">A team of FSA officials are responsible for this issue. While officials at grade 7 and above in seniority will normally represent the United Kingdom in EU level discussions, the FSA deploys staff resources flexibly, using to the best effect the available skills and expertise, to ensure that the UK is best able to deliver its objectives. The FSA team includes officials with relevant scientific qualifications and expertise. Additional technical expertise is available from independent scientific experts and food supplement industry experts as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.325W.6/3">The European Commission has indicated that discussions will continue at working group level later in 2010. A date has not been set for publication by the European Commission of proposals for maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements under the provisions of article 5 of the food supplements directive. An impact assessment is being prepared according to cabinet office guidelines, which will include economic impact to UK businesses; the assessment will be completed when the maximum European Commission's proposal on permitted levels for vitamins and minerals is published. The impact assessment is made at the UK level and does not consider individual counties or towns separately. The impact assessment will form part of a public consultation on the proposals.</p>

Election literature is censored and public gatherings, political banners and flags are banned. Most people are unable to access the media to voice political views and those who do so risk draconian measures imposed by the military junta including long prison sentences. Under these conditions, Burma's people will not have reasonable access to free and impartial media.</p>

BBC World Service reports that it reaches 8.5 million listeners every week inside Burma. Although internet use is limited in Burma, the FCO's digital communications work also plays its part in the flow of information to the country. As elections approach in Burma, the FCO will continue to work closely with the BBC World Service and others to increase access to political information.</p>

DECC's Offshore Inspectorate also plan to visit the above HSE listed Transocean rigs as part of their series of prioritised environmental inspections to fixed installations and drilling rigs, subject to a risk based approach which takes into account operations being conducted. During 2008 DECC's Offshore Inspectorate completed an inspection campaign focused on industry drilling operations, the results of which are published on the DECC website.
