	<p pid="b.7W.5/1">The Government are committed to involving, informing and engaging local people in all stages of planning for the Olympic and Paralympic Games which will transform East London. Recognising that the Games will have greatest impact on local communities, the official bid commitments for London 2012 included an extensive engagement programme. The Government Olympic Executive has used social media to support this engagement work and runs an online forum for residents of the five host boroughs in East London. This forum enables invited local people-representative of the wide range of communities in the five host boroughs-to give their views on the Olympics in a context which encouraged ongoing debate and discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.5/2">The forum has discussed a variety of topics and issues important to local residents. These include how local people can access jobs and training opportunities created by the Olympics; ensuring that all opportunities are inclusive and benefit everyone; planning of the Olympic site and surrounding areas; and how to promote disability issues using the Paralympics. The Government Olympics Executive responds to the information gathered accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.5/3">The cost of managing this forum to date, including set up costs, site hosting and recruitment of members has been &#163;128,523.08.</p>

	<p pid="b.12W.6/1">Visits by members of regimental associations would usually be treated as &quot;pastoral&quot; rather than &quot;official&quot; visits. Pastoral visits are always welcome, but are subject to the wishes of the patient and to local hospital visiting rules and hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.12W.6/2">Further, visits by family and close friends take precedence, and consequently there may not always be the capacity to allow visits by regimental associations. For that reason, associations are strongly advised to check first with the Headquarters Joint Medical Command Visits Coordinator in order to avoid conflict with higher priority visitors before travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.2/1">A comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of mandatory drug testing (MDT) was undertaken by the Office for National Statistics published in 2005 at:</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/rdso1r0305.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/rdso1r0305.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/3">It concluded that the mandatory drug testing programme provides a reliable and statistically valid way of measuring patterns and trends of drug misuse in prisons. Random MDT continues to be the best overall measure of drug misuse in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/4">In addition, MDT processes are assured by a rolling programme of internal audits and an independent quality assurance provider. The last audit concluded that comprehensive guidance was available to prisons and, by extension, did not require updating. Further, urine samples were taken correctly and chain of custody was generally well documented.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/5">The audit also identified areas of concern, which NOMS is now working with prisons to address:</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/6" class="indent">at a third of establishments sampled, there were long periods each month where no random testing was undertaken;</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/7" class="indent">at one establishment the disciplinary award given for test refusals was more lenient than that for positive results; and</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/8" class="indent">establishments were not sending details of refusals to the laboratory. Central records on refusals therefore did not match those held locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/9" class="indent">MDT roles were not always properly recorded in staff performance and development records.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.2/10" class="indent">Where urine samples were left with the prison gate prior to collection, a number of establishments did not require gate staff to complete a form to acknowledge receipt of samples.</p>

	<p pid="b.33W.2/11">At the same time, we have recently conducted an internal review of the services provided at other centres where children may be detained.

	<p pid="b.42W.8/2">The UK passport contains a facial biometric, which complies with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards for the inclusion of globally interoperable biometrics in travel documents. The UK passport also meets the requirements for the US Visa Waiver programme. As the UK is not a member of Schengen, the UK passport is not required to meet Schengen standards for passports. However the inclusion of a facial biometric in the UK passport is consistent with the EU Passport Regulation (EC 2252/2004) by which Schengen states are bound. The UK plans to implement fingerprint biometrics in passports from 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.44W.6/1">In July 2008 research was carried out to see if a direct link between application fees for short term visit visas and demand could be identified. This was jointly funded by the UK Border Agency, DCMS and Tourism Alliance. Research concluded that in general there is no link between application fees for short term visit visas and demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.44W.6/2">The UK Border Agency also ran two piloted schemes to see if a lower visit visa fee would stimulate demand. From March to September 2007 the pilot was for travellers from China applying to enter the UK on the Approved Destination Status (ADS) scheme. From December 2008 to April 2009 the pilot was carried out in India for visitors on an organised tour with a Trusted Partner (TP) travel agent. The pilot schemes demonstrated that visa cost is not the single most important driver to encouraging applications.</p>

This will include the possible options around flexibility, part time working and job share.</p>

	<p pid="b.76W.5/1">The following administrative penalties have been identified as being within the scope of the question.</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.5/2">1. By sections 54, 62 and 75 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 vehicle examiners working within the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) (an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport) have power to issue fixed penalties in respect of certain road traffic offences. An example of an offence for which VOSA may issue a fixed penalty is an offence in relation to drivers' hours (under section 96(11) of the Transport Act 1968).</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.5/3">From May 2009 (when the power was introduced) to December 2009, VOSA issued fixed penalties to the total value of &#163;2.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.5/4">2. The Railways Act 1993 provides for certain administrative penalty powers within the scope of the question:</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.5/5" class="indent">(a) Section 55(7A) allows the Secretary of State to make a final or provisional order against a relevant operator (most obviously a franchisee). The order may contain a requirement to pay the Secretary of State a specified sum in the event of a specified contravention of the order. The specified sum may not exceed 10 per cent. of the relevant entity's annual turnover.</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.5/6" class="indent">(b) Section 57A allows the Secretary of State to impose a penalty on a relevant operator (most obviously a franchisee). A penalty imposed under this section may not exceed 10 per cent. of the relevant entity's annual turnover.</p>

	<p pid="b.76W.5/24">They have the power to impose administrative penalties under section 155 of the Transport Act 2000 (which has been amended by the Local Transport Act 2008). Section 155 enables the Commissioners to impose financial sanctions of up to &#163;550 per vehicle operated under a Public Service Vehicle operator's licence. The recent amendments made by the 2008 Act also enable the Commissioners to require operators to pay compensation to passengers affected by poorly operated services, or to require operators to spend money either on specific services or facilities, or on improvements to such services or facilities. Section 155 extends to England and Wales. There is an equivalent provision in relation to Scotland contained in section 39 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 (sums recovered are paid to the Scottish Ministers). Section 39 has not, however, been amended in the same way as section 155 was by the 2008 Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.81W.5/1">The Department for Transport's Operational Guidance to Local Authorities on Parking Policy and Enforcement states that the setting of charges for parking on-street or off-street in designated areas is a matter for the authority in accordance with the provisions of the Road Traffic Regulation Act (RTRA) 1984. The Secretary of State recommends that authorities set charges at levels which are consistent with the aims of the authority's transport strategy, including its road safety and traffic management strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.81W.5/2">The Operational Guidance makes clear that authorities should never use parking charges just to raise revenue or as a local tax. Where there is surplus income local authorities must ensure that any on-street revenue is used according to the provisions of section 55 of the RTRA.</p>

	<p pid="b.81W.8/2">Research has shown that awareness and usage of information services can influence levels of motorway congestion. It is not possible to directly correlate the impact of Traffic Radio to motorway congestion due to the complexity of assessing one information service in isolation from the others. In addition, information is only one of a series of measures that can contribute towards congestion reduction.</p>

	<p pid="b.90W.0/2">However, following reviews of the sector by Ofcom and as part of the Digital Britain Review we have introduced a draft Community Radio Order 2010 which seeks to reduce the regulatory burden on community stations. The order would allow stations to take greater than 50 per cent. of their funding from a single source and allow stations to apply for a renewal, of up to five years, of their existing licence. Taken together we believe these measures will support the community radio sector in the future without any significant impact on local commercial stations.</p>

	<p pid="b.90W.6/1">The Royal Parks (TRP) advise that they do not keep records going back 30 years about when and why the Serpentine swimming area was closed. In recent years TRP has never closed the swimming facility due to icy conditions. During the recent cold weather, access to the path immediately adjacent to the swimming area by the general public was restricted, because of safety concerns, after some visitors had walked on to the ice. The Serpentine Swimming Club has been allowed to operate throughout the period and has been issued with keys to the gates to allow the Club access.</p>

A key product encompassing this information is the UK's annual Drivers Report that provides in-depth analysis of the factors that affect a farmer's decision to plant poppy or other crops.

	<p pid="b.96W.2/2">The project received &#163;150,000 in financial year 2006-07, its first year, and subsequently received &#163;3.49 million in 2007-08, &#163;362,000 in 2008-09 and &#163;485,000 in 2009-10. The amount of funding has fluctuated, because this project is a &quot;bundle&quot; of media programming items, which have evolved over time as strategic priorities changed. In some years, there was a higher outlay for media content due to start-up costs. The project is meeting its programme goals, and is contributing to UK strategic objectives.

	<p pid="b.96W.5/1">The objective of the Lashkar Gah Prison Build project is the establishment of a prison in Lashkar Gah, Helmand, that meets international minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners. Secure and humanitarian prison facilities are an important part of building a trusted criminal justice system. In addition to the construction of new prison facilities, the project includes a programme of operational training for prison staff, with a focus on human right awareness and humane prisoner management. The project received &#163;790,000 in its first year (2007-08), &#163;623,813 in 2008-09, and &#163;762,164 in 2009-10. The annual variation in funding reflects the high proportion of infrastructural costs paid for in 2007-08 and subsequent fluctuations in the year-on-year project costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.5/2">We assess that this ongoing project is meeting its objectives. In October 2009, the project's first phase was completed when prisoners moved into the newly constructed prison facilities. The project's final phase, intended to further increase capacity, will continue throughout 2010-11. A final assessment will follow the project's completion.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.3/1">The purpose of the Elections project is to support Afghanistan's electoral cycle in 2009 and 2010-strengthening Afghanistan's electoral legislative framework, voter registration efforts, the capacity of the country's Independent Election Commission including its commissioners, secretariat, departments and provincial and regional offices, and support to broader electoral stakeholders, for example, civic education, the media and domestic observation. The project was funded to build confidence in Afghanistan's democratic institutions and provide a basis for sustainable government and democratic legitimacy, a core part of our stabilisation efforts. The project received &#163;4.1 million in 2008-09, its first year, and subsequently received &#163;200,000 in 2009-10. Funding reduced in the second year because the aim of the project was to enable pre-election activity (elections were held in August 2009). The project is meeting its programme goals and is contributing to UK strategic objectives through the delivery of the Afghan elections in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.6/1">The purpose of the District Stabilisation project is to support the Government of Afghanistan in extending and exerting its authority in key districts, increasingly isolating the insurgency. The project was funded to provide stabilisation experts to work in the districts and to fund delivery of local programmes and projects. The stabilisation advisers help to mentor and coach the Afghan district governors so that they can extend their reach and authority. Local projects delivered through the district governor also demonstrated the Government's ability to deliver whilst at the same time improving the lives of local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.6/2">In financial year 2008-09, its first year, funding was distributed among the regions of the Province as follows: Lashkar Gah &#163;1.08 million, Musa Qala &#163;2.92 million, Sangin &#163;2 million, Garmsir &#163;1.25 million. In 2009-10 the funding was distributed as follows: Lashkar Gah &#163;1.14 million, Musa Qala &#163;697,000, Sangin &#163;792,00, Garmsir &#163;513,000. The budget was reduced in Musa Qala, Sangin and Garmsir for a number of reasons. The 2008-09 budgets included a number of large infrastructure projects (such as road builds) which were completed in year and therefore not budgeted for in 2009-10. The projects are meeting their programme goals and are contributing to UK strategic objectives. The projects have not yet been completed.</p>

Representations about this proposal, made during the public consultation between July and October 2008, will be taken into account before the Secretary of State decides on the final form of the RSS.

However, I have decided that in view of the current economic circumstances, we should not impose an appeal charge at this time. In addition, I have considered the case for increasing planning fees generally but have decided that for the same reason it would be wrong at this time to increase the costs of those seeking to invest in housing and development. Planning fees will therefore remain at their current levels and we shall review them again in a year's time.</p>

These &quot;futures&quot; embodied different socio-economic and climate change scenarios with associated assumptions with respect to sea level rise, but they do not correspond to sea levels. No estimate of land loss was made as this would depend on a number of variables.

	<p pid="b.135W.2/1">The Met Office Hadley Centre uses complex computer models of the atmosphere, land and ocean systems to make predictions of future climate change, including temperature. These models are mathematical representations of the climate system and are based on the fundamental laws of physics.</p>
	<p pid="b.135W.2/2">The models are tested and evaluated against actual observations on a number of time scales, ranging from palaeoclimate to day to day weather. Model performance and improvement is aided because the Met Office uses the same model framework for its climate projections as it does for weather forecasting.</p>
	<p pid="b.135W.2/3">In addition to its own models, the Met Office Hadley Centre makes use of climate models from the global scientific community. These are used for comparison and can aid improvement to Met Office models. The methods employed in the development of Met Office models are thoroughly and independently reviewed in the peer-reviewed literature.</p>

	<p pid="b.135W.8/1">The UK welcomed the offer by the President of Guyana to keep their forests standing. We recognised that Guyana needs to reconcile development challenges with the need to keep forests standing in order to help in the fight against climate change. It is essential that Guyana is supported with sufficient incentives to maintain the services that its rainforests provide. The UK was therefore pleased to hear that Guyana has reached an agreement on support for their forest services with the Government of Norway.</p>
	<p pid="b.135W.8/2">Ahead of the Copenhagen Accord, the UK together with the US, Japan, Australia, France and Norway committed to provide $3.5 billion public finance for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) over the period 2010-12 and to scaling it up thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.135W.8/3">At Copenhagen, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and President Sarkozy reaffirmed that $25 billion is needed for a 25 per cent. reduction in emissions from deforestation by 2015, and that developed countries should pay a significant proportion of this. These announcements were strongly welcomed by rainforest countries including Guyana, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica.</p>
	<p pid="b.135W.8/4">We will continue to work with donors and rainforests nations in preparation for the reconvened climate negotiations in Mexico later this year, to ensure REDD+ continues to be central element of climate change negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="b.136W.2/1">The Renewables Obligation (RO) is the Government's main mechanism for the financial support of renewable electricity. Developers of renewable technologies, including wind, receive Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) for the electricity they generate. Suppliers can buy these certificates and present them to Ofgem to meet their annual obligation.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.2/2">Wind plays an important role in the Government's energy policy and we recently announced an increase in RO support for offshore wind stations accredited between April 2010 and March 2014.

	<p pid="b.136W.9/1">The performance of academy sponsors is monitored and assessed through the performance of their academies. The Department has a rigorous range of measures to achieve this, including education advisers, School Improvement Partners (SIPs) and where appropriate National Challenge Advisers. All of these professionals provide challenge and support to academies, help the academy leaders to evaluate their own performance, identify priorities for improvement, and plan effective change. They report regularly to governors and the Department. Where necessary, the frequency of visits to academies is increased and/or a tailored intervention programme is agreed.</p>

	<p pid="b.141W.5/5">These reimbursable expenses are in large part due to the work of the four regional press officers, who frequently accompany Ministers on visits across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.149W.0/1">Parents' week was first established in 2000 and is organised and delivered by the Family and Parenting Institute (FPI) in partnership with a number of national parenting support organisations. The week co-ordinates activities for parents and children across the UK with many hundreds of local events taking place. Each year there is a different theme. The theme of Parents' week 2009 was &quot;The Changing Face of Families&quot;.</p>

			<tr pid="b.154W.3/71"> <td colspan="5"><sup>(1)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) changed the area covered by Lancashire local authority.<br/> <i> Notes</i>:<br/> <sup>(1)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the R01 form collected by the CLG to the Section 52 form from the DCSF. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-00 to 2001-02 and from the R01 form previously.<br/> 3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> 4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DCSF Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> 5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990's and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.<br/> 6. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> 7. The 1999-00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Consequently Las where there entire pupil provision were educated in GM schools will show a unit cost of zero prior to 1999-2000.<br/> 8. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-00.<br/> 9. School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br/> 10. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and are in cash terms.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.158W.5/1">There are no plans to review the respective roles of the chair of governors and investigating officers where dealing with staff suspensions. The operation of disciplinary procedures, including those that result in suspension, is a matter for local determination. To support schools in this area there are a variety of sources of advice available to help governing bodies with their responsibilities. The School Staffing (England) Regulations 2009 and accompanying guidance, alongside the DCSF's/Guide to the Law for School Governors provides both governing bodies and local authorities with details of their responsibilities in relation to staff suspensions and sets out the statutory responsibilities falling to schools and local authorities as employers. This guidance is available through</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.governornet.co.uk">www.governornet.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/3">and</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.co.uk">www.teachernet.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/5">These sources also provide access to an extensive range of additional guidance material including materials from the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Schools and local authorities are therefore able to draw from a wide variety of guidance when devising their policies and handling disciplinary cases, including suspension.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/6">In respect of both head teachers and other teaching staff our guidance makes it clear that suspension is a neutral act allowing time to assess the situation before a final decision is taken. It does not imply guilt but provides an opportunity for matters to be investigated. Decisions on how any investigation is conducted are best left to schools to determine, drawing on the guidance that is available and where appropriate on advice and support from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/7">There is no requirement on local authorities to report suspensions of head teachers to the Department and there are no centrally held records setting out when and to what extent the Department and/or the Secretary of State have been involved in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.5/8">Staff in the Department who are experienced in the provisions of the regulations and guidance associated with school staffing matters will provide advice on the processes relating to disciplinary procedures. They do not, however, provide advice on whether disciplinary procedures should result in suspension or any other sanction. That is a matter entirely for the disciplinary panel. No records are maintained of the number of requests for advice that has been sought from, or provided by, the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.165W.9/1">Our funding priorities for 2010/11 are set out in the strategy document, &quot;Skills Investment Strategy 2010-11&quot;, published in November 2009. In the 2010-11 financial year we will invest &#163;210 million in Adult Safeguarded Learning supporting:</p>

	<p pid="b.165W.9/5" class="indent">Neighbourhood Learning in Deprived Communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.165W.9/6">In the strategy document we have re-affirmed our commitment to implementing the vision for informal adult learning, including learning for personal, family and community development, described in &quot;The Learning Revolution&quot; White Paper (2009). We recognise that this type of learning contributes to the health and well-being of communities by building the confidence and resilience of the individuals involved. For the low-skilled and under-confident, informal learning can also be an important stepping stone to further learning and a more skilled future. We are working across Government and with our partners in every sector to make &quot;The Learning Revolution&quot; a reality. During 2010-11 we will work with the Skills Funding Agency to determine how funding for Adult Safeguarded Learning can be routed most effectively to secure local ownership and underpin strong local partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="b.178W.2/1">Organisations and consortia were invited to tender to set up and manage the Community Learning Champions Support programme in July 2010. A budget of up to &#163;3 million was made available to the successful contractor to deliver the commitments outlined in &quot;The Learning Revolution&quot; White Paper. Clear emphasis was placed on the need to provide excellent value for money in order to maximise spending on the support programme and the sharing of resources with local champion schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.2/2">Funding is available for two years only and comprises &#163;1.7 million for 2009/10 and &#163;1.3 million for 2010/11. All administrative costs are to be met from this budget. The proposal for a development fund was a feature of the successful tender which, along with the contractor's management and administration costs, is covered by a contract with the Department and as such is subject to commercial confidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.178W.5/1">The Government have made clear their support for an appropriate extension to the term of protection for sound recordings and performer's rights in sound recordings. Any extension should more closely match the expected lifetime of performers and should also be accompanied by a package of measures that deliver real and lasting benefits to all performers and musicians. We believe that the current proposal of the European Parliament for an extension of term from 50 to 70 years, together with a number of permanent measures designed to assist performers and musicians, will deliver this.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.5/2">The text proposed by the European Parliament is still before the Council and I expect discussions to continue under the new Commission when it is appointed. The UK will continue to work to deliver a satisfactory outcome.</p>

They are targeted at a specific sector of the student population. Students cover the full content of an honours degree in two calendar years, by working through university vacations. An interim evaluation of pilot projects currently in train in eight institutions was published by the Higher Education Academy in August 2009. It confirmed that the quality of curricula, the student learning experience and the standard of student work were at least comparable with traditional three year degrees and in some cases higher.</p>

No distinction was made between whether this time-off was taken as paternity leave, annual leave or any other paid or unpaid arrangement with employers The Department's most up-to-date estimates of fathers taking paternity leave are from the &quot;Maternity and Paternity Rights and Benefits in Britain: Survey of Parents&quot;, conducted in 2005. 93 per cent. of fathers interviewed took some time off around the time of the birth. Of the 93 per cent. who took some time off, 79 per cent. took paternity leave. The 2005 survey is based on a random sample of mothers who had a baby in December 2003 and their partners.</p>

	<p pid="b.188W.2/2">Detailed plans for the use of the &#163;422 million resource have not been confirmed yet. However it will support a range of activity to support learners and employers identify and access the skills they need and to support the Government's priorities and reforms set out in the Skills Investment Strategy. For example, through support for the UK Commission for Employment and Skills to strengthen the employer voice in the skills system, the development of National Skills Academies and supporting implementation of the new Adult Advancement and Careers Service.</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-16">16 December 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/2">As part of its objective to build a strong economy Government are taking a range of measures to encourage innovation in the West Midlands and across the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/3">We are doing this through, for example the UK Innovation Investment Fund (UKIIF) which will ensure that venture capital is available by early 2010 to invest in innovative British businesses across the United Kingdom in key sectors (life sciences, clean technology, digital and advanced manufacturing). In the PBR we announced that Government's investment of &#163;150 million in the UKIIF has leveraged &#163;175 million in additional money, creating a pool of funding initially worth &#163;325 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/4">Support for innovation is also provided through the R&amp;D Tax Credit scheme, which allows companies to claim tax relief against R&amp;D expenditure. Latest figures show that up until <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, 425 SMEs and 115 large companies in the West Midlands had their claims for R&amp;D Tax Credits approved.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/5">The establishment of the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) in 2007 has given Britain a successful business-led body whose programmes channel public funds into driving business innovation in areas where there are major opportunities for future growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/6">The Government funded Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are also supporting innovation. The West Midlands RDA, Advantage West Midlands (AWM), has aligned around &#163;157 million of funding with TSB priorities over 2008-11. The Agency is the lead RDA on two of the national Innovation Platforms, Low Carbon Vehicles and Assisted Living and is working on initiatives related to other platforms:</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/7">Intelligent transport systems and services and low impact buildings as well as exploring opportunities in possible future platforms such as immersive education.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/8">Key innovation-based projects supported by AWM include:</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/9" class="indent">(i) The &#163;77 million investment in the Birmingham-Warwick Research Alliance through Birmingham Science City creates a platform on which to build university-business collaboration and business access to research equipment and expertise, in the areas of energy, advanced materials, and translational medicine.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/10" class="indent">(ii) The Advanced Sensors Innovation Project has created an investment fund of over &#163;6 million to exploit intellectual property within QinetiQ at Malvern in conjunction with industry. A further project to exploit Quantum Technologies is under development in a partnership between QinetiQ, AWM and industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/11" class="indent">(iii) AWM is investing &#163;30 million over the next three years to support the Low Carbon Vehicles (LCV) plan from the National Automotive Innovation Growth Team. Part of this will go to a programme based at a regional hub and part will be co-invested with the TSB in support of its Low Carbon Vehicles Innovation Platform.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/12" class="indent">(iv) AWM is investing &#163;40 million, in partnership with emda, in the Manufacturing Technology Centre. Bringing together Tier 1 manufacturing companies, and their supply chains, key Midlands's universities and The Welding Institute (TWI), the MTC will create a step change in the competitiveness of UK manufacturing performance focused around assembly, joining and fabrication technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/13" class="indent">(v) AWM has committed around &#163;20 million to support development of clinical trialling and experimental medicine facilities within the translational medicine part of the Science City programme, as well as investing in a Health Technologies Design Institute at Coventry University.</p>
