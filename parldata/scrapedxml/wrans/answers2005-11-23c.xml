	<p pid="c.1965W.3/2">The majority of the workload dealt with by the CSA is generated by the more difficult cases, in particular where there is no previous stable relationship between the parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1965W.3/3">In addition, results from a national survey of CSA clients (Wikely N et al, 2001) (carried out in 1999 prior to the recent reforms) allow comparative analysis of the characteristics of compliant and non-compliant non-resident parents. Previously married and cohabiting non-resident parents were, respectively, five and three times more likely to comply with the CSA than those in less stable relationships.</p>

	<p pid="c.1977W.2/1">Blood donors may be deferred from giving blood or the donations themselves may subsequently be rejected. The single largest reason for deferment is a low haemoglobin level, which accounts for 6 per cent. of total donor attendances. Donations may be rejected after collection for technical reasons, e.g. inadequate volume, or in a very small number of cases because they fail the standard screening for blood-borne diseases.</p>

As part of this, a more robust regulatory impact assessment procedure was introduced.

	<p pid="c.1980W.5/2">There are no plans to reinstate the Executive Programme Funds (EPFs). However, the three priority funding packages announced in the Draft Priorities and Budget 2006&ndash;08 will build on the positive aspects of the EPFs, in that they are focused on priority areas and will encourage a cross-cutting approach to the underlying issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.1999W.5/1">In the two areas mentioned the priority has been to try to stabilise the situation and balance supply and demand. Less popular accommodation in both areas has been demolished to remove blight. In Antrim the waiting list for small units of accommodation is being catered for through relets. In Newtownabbey there have recently been signs of growing stability to the extent that the development programme that is currently being prepared will make provision for an additional supply of small units over the next five years.</p>

	<p pid="c.2005W.2/1">I have not taken any action on this matter, as it is not Government policy to interfere in the operation of normal market forces, providing competition rules are respected. I, however, appreciate the important contribution which the dairy sector makes to the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland, albeit it is heavily reliant on the manufacture of bulk commodities for export markets. I would therefore encourage the dairy industry to continue in its efforts to move from a production-led approach towards higher value-added and market-led strategies. This should help to improve the overall competitiveness of the industry and hopefully narrow the differential.</p>

	<p pid="c.2012W.14/1">The Draft Budget provides that, by 2008, total Government spending in Northern Ireland will exceed &pound;16 billion, a jump of more than 50 per cent. since 1997. Public expenditure in Northern Ireland is by far the highest figure for any region of the UK and is 29 per cent. higher than the UK average.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/2">Notwithstanding this, there are many pressures on the Northern Ireland Budget and the roads' programme must compete for funding along with other spending programmes. The Draft Priorities and Budget 2006&ndash;08 is presently out for consultation. It allocated additional resources for health and for education and this inevitably had some implications for other programmes including roads maintenance. It is expected that the revised budget will be announced in December 2005 and allocations will be kept under review in the context of budgetary management processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/3">The Regional Transportation Strategy (2002&ndash;2012) identified strategic transportation investment priorities and considered potential funding sources and affordability of planned initiatives over the 10-year period. It was explained in the RTS that the level of public expenditure funding for the Strategy would be determined through the normal budgetary process, which will take account of the needs of other departments and decisions on priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/4">Roads service will continue to make best use of the resources available to it to develop and maintain the road network.</p>

	<p pid="c.2013W.2/1">Officials from the Department of the Environment and the Department for Regional Development have been liaising closely with counterparts in the Republic of Ireland's Department of Transport (DoT), National Roads Authority (NRA) and National Safety Council (NSC) and, through Cross Border Steering Group meetings, with officials from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to ensure positive road safety benefits on both sides of the border.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/2">Among the most notable areas of co-operation is the joint production of road safety campaigns that have been a significant feature of the publicity programmes in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in recent years. Joint campaigns increase value for money, production costs can be shared and the partnership approach draws sponsorship at a level that would not otherwise be available. To date there have been eight joint road safety campaigns with a ninth, addressing drink-driving, in preparation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/3">Work is in hand to develop an agreement between UK and Ireland to allow driving disqualifications to be recognised in both countries regardless of where the offences took place. This will allow the worst offenders, who would otherwise be escaping the rule of law, to be removed from the road. Work is also in hand to allow each administration to recognise the penalties for driving offences at levels below that of disqualification.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/4">There has been a large degree of co-operation on the EuroRAP project. EuroRAP aims to help reduce death and serious injury on Europe's roads by generating consumer information to the public and providing road engineers with benchmarking information.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/5">Roads Service and the NRA are also joint partners in the European (DG TREN) funded project INSTANT, a multimodal project which considers the need for traffic control measures and traffic and travel information on the Belfast to Dublin corridor.</p>

	<p pid="c.2014W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding if he will make a statement on major road schemes in the South Antrim constituency and their estimated cost for each year between 2005 and 2008. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/4" class="indent">The recently published Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan and the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan set out the Department's transport proposals up to 2015. Included within these transport plans are the following major road schemes which lie wholly or partly within the South Antrim Parliamentary Constituency area.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/5" class="indent">All schemes are subject to the satisfactory completion of the various statutory procedures and the availability of funding through the normal budget process.</p>

	<p pid="c.2014W.5/7" class="indent">This &pound;69.5 million contract will complete a continuous dual carriageway between the western end of the M22 Motorway at Randalstown and the Castledawson roundabout. Planning of the scheme is well advanced and it is anticipated that the statutory orders, i.e. Environmental Statement, Notice of Intention to Make a Direction Order, and Notice of Intention to Make a Vesting Order will be published in late spring 2006. Construction of the &pound;33.4 million Randalstown to Toome section of the dualling, which lies within the South Antrim Parliamentary Constituency area, could start in late 2007/early 2008, with an estimated expenditure that year of approximately &pound;12 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/8" class="indentitalic">M2 Crosskeiinan Slips</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/9" class="indent">This &pound;1.8 million scheme will complete the M2 junction 7, providing full motorway access to the Antrim Area Hospital and on to Antrim town. It is anticipated that the current contract to construct the on-slips to the motorway will commence in Spring 2006. The contract will be carried out as part of the &pound;100 million Public Private Partnership contract, which includes widening of the Ml and Belfast Westlink Corridor. It is expected that &pound;1.6 million will be spent on this scheme during the 2006/2007 financial year and &pound;0.2 million spent during the 2007/2008 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/10" class="indentitalic">M2 widening from Junction 4, Sandyknowes to Junction Z, Greencastle</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/11" class="indent">The &pound;30 million scheme to widen the M2 carriageway to create an additional southbound lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions is currently being progressed as part of Roads Service's Design, Build, Finance and Operate Package 1. Construction of these improvements is expected to start in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/12" class="indent">I can also advise that Roads Service are currently progressing two further significant, minor works schemes within South Antrim. Work on a new roundabout on the A57 Templepatrick Road/ Station Road/ Longshot, to replace the existing staggered junction, started on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-15">15 August 2005</phrase> and is due for completion by the end of December 2005, at a cost &pound;878,000. In addition, a scheme to replace the existing staggered junction with a new roundabout at Doagh Road/Carntall Road/Carnmoney Road North, and to include the provision of a footway on Carntall Road from Doagh Road to 100 Carntall Road, is currently at design stage. Subject to clearing the necessary statutory procedures and the availability of funds at the time, the scheme is programmed to start on site during the 2007/08 financial year at an estimated cost of &pound;500,000.</p>

If the board considers that such an assessment is necessary, the parents will be notified and a multi-disciplinary assessment will be made. The board may then make a statement of special educational needs at Stage 5. From the date of the initial request for statutory assessment, the board has 18 weeks, subject to certain exceptions, to issue a proposed statement, where this has been found to be necessary.</p>

I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.2024W.6/4" class="indent">Water Service's second Water Efficiency Plan, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-12">12 January 2004</phrase>, set out a wide range of measures aimed at reducing demand for water through the effective use of water by both Water Service and its customers. One of the key aspects of the plan is a reduction in the level of leakage. A significant programme of investment has resulted in leakage being reduced by over 100 megalitres per day (Ml/d) from 291 Ml/d in March 2002 to the current level of 190 Ml/d at September 2005. In achieving this level of reduction Water Service has been actively encouraging customers to play their part in eliminating leakage within private property. It is estimated that some 20 per cent. of total leakage occurs within the customers' pipework, therefore customers have an important contribution to make to this aim. In 2004, the Water Service introduced the &quot;Leakline&quot; free telephone number (08000 282011) to encourage customers to report any visible leaks.</p>
	<p pid="c.2024W.6/5" class="indent">Water Service continues to raise awareness of the need for water efficiency by providing practical advice on the actions that the customers can take. These include carrying out water efficiency audits and the installation of Hippo bags in larger toilet cisterns to reduce the amount of water used. Water efficiency is also promoted through the distribution of leaflets to customers, through public displays, exhibitions and presentations identifying how water can be used wisely in the home, school, business and agricultural premises Over the past few years, water efficiency leaflets have been issued to every property in Northern Ireland. Water Service has a double decker bus, known as the Waterbus, which contains an exhibition on water and sewerage services. The Waterbus visits schools to make children aware of the water cycle, water sources, water treatment, the efficient use of water and wastewater treatment, through a number of displays, models, experiments, video shows and computers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2024W.6/6" class="indent">Water Service's annual customer survey contains a number of the questions relating to water efficiency and in recent years the responses have indicated an increasing awareness of water efficiency among customers.</p>

	<p pid="c.2026W.3/1">The Development Co-operation and Economic Co-operation Instrument (DCECI) will provide development funding for all countries currently covered by the Asia, Latin America and parts of the TACIS (Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States) Regulations. The Commission has also suggested it covers funding for the ACP countries (Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific). Likewise, it will provide funding for thematic programmes in specific sectors of global or multi-country nature, which cannot be covered by normal country or regional programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2026W.3/2">Country and regional programmes establish the focus of Community assistance in specific countries and regions. This will be based on partner Governments' specific needs and development plans. It will also reflect the added value of Community aid in particular countries and sectors, Funding of activities in the field of education will depend on these factors. From experience, we know that Community country programmes do fund activities in the field of education.</p>
	<p pid="c.2026W.3/3">Globally applicable or cross-cutting education initiatives may also fall under the thematic funding banner. This is likely to remain the case for the new batch of thematic programmes to be launched under the next Financial Perspectives (2007&ndash;13).</p>

	<p pid="c.2029W.2/1">It is very important that Commonwealth Caribbean countries produce appropriately costed sugar transition action plans as soon as possible in order to be eligible for European Union (EU) transitional assistance in 2006, and so that the European Commission (EC) can make realistic and appropriate plans for further financing from 2007 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/2">DFID has been closely engaged with ensuring that the impact of sugar reform is fully considered for a number of years. In 2003 and 2004, DFID-funded reports were produced on the impact of reform on the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Sugar Protocol countries, the impact on the Least Developed Countries and options for transitional assistance. These reports were made public, and have enabled an informed debate on the developmental aspects of sugar reform to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/3">In March 2005, DFID funded a workshop in Trinidad which initiated the process of developing sugar transition action plans in the Caribbean. Since July, as President of the EU, the UK has been working with the EC, other EU member states and the European Parliament to secure agreement on the draft regulation produced by the EC in June 2005 for the timely delivery of adequate transitional assistance to the Sugar Protocol countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/4">DFID is working alongside the EC Delegations in the Caribbean to support development of sugar transition action plans by the six Commonwealth Caribbean sugar producing countries: Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/5">The Government of Barbados has asked for DFID's support for the preparation of its action plan on the basis of its forthcoming National Strategic Plan that will inform the future direction of the sugar industry. Consultancy work on this should begin shortly and a draft report should be prepared by mid-January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/6">Belize has already developed a strategy for the reform of its sugar industry and initiated discussion of a detailed action plan. The Government of Belize recently asked DFID's support for its preparation and is finalising the scope of the required advice. We are encouraging the Government to take the opportunity of the changes necessitated by the sugar reform to look more widely at the macro-economic challenges facing the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/7">The Government of Guyana's working group is preparing the draft action plan, with DFID-funded consultants identified to help put this into the required EC format. To date, given the Government's unwillingness to commit itself publicly to producing an action plan, there remains a risk that Guyana will not be prepared to submit its plan by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/8">In Jamaica, Prime Minister Patterson said in a statement to Parliament in October that the cane industry will be centred on three products raw sugar for export and domestic markets, molasses for use in rum production, and ethanol. He stated that the Government was at an advanced stage of development of the Jamaica action plan and intended to submit this to the EC ahead of schedule. He specifically recognised the assistance that DFID has offered to provide to help design measures to mitigate the social impact of the sugar reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/9">Due to the high debt to national income burden and its impact on the labour force, the adjustment process in St. Kitts and Nevis will be particularly challenging. To assist, DFID is leading the co-ordination of donor support to St. Kitts and supporting three key pieces of work to inform the Government's preparation of its action plan: consultants to advise on the corporate restructuring of the Sugar Manufacturing Company, a land resource analysis to identify feasible options for the use of the sugar lands and a study to help identify support for those affected adversely by the sugar transition. The Commission's team of consultants working on the preparation of St. Kitts adaptation strategy aims to complete its assignment in December, drawing on these DFID supported reports.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/10">In Trinidad and Tobago, DFID, in close liaison with the EC Delegation, is financing a consultancy to help put the Government prepare its action plan. The consultants facilitated the first consultation on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> that brought together representatives from farmers' associations, the sugar industry, the Government, and development partners. The consultants are due to deliver their report by the second week of December.</p>

As a result of the recent attacks many agencies have severely curtailed their movement outside major towns. The World Food Programme continues to deliver essential emergency food aid as normal under heavy military escort.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.2/2">The attacks only serve to increase the suffering of civilians. The Ugandan Government, working with other countries in the region, must do all it can to protect civilians and to ensure the safety of aid workers.</p>

The report 'Financial Support to the Water Sector 2002&ndash;04', produced for us by consultants, estimates that DFID spent &pound;221 million on water and sanitation in 2003&ndash;04. This report also provides a breakdown of expenditure by country and estimates of how expenditure is split through different funding routes for the years 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. A copy of this report has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The analysis is currently being updated for 2004&ndash;05 and figures are expected to be available around March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2031W.5/1">In response to the current situation where most of sub-Saharan Africa is off-track to meet the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets, DFID has committed to double spending on water supply and sanitation sectors in Africa from &pound;47.5 million in 2004&ndash;05 to &pound;95 million in 2007&ndash;08. This will bring our global spending on water and sanitation up to at least &pound;225 million a year by 2008. We anticipate that meeting the commitment will require an increase in expenditure through all funding mechanisms, including our own bilateral programmes, but also through encouraging others such as the World Bank and the EU to do more in water and sanitation. We do not have specific country targets.</p>

	<p pid="c.2032W.2/3">EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) inspectors visited the UK in June 2005 to assess the state of our BSE controls. Their report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-28">28 September 2005</phrase> and was discussed at a meeting of the Commission's TSE Working Group on the same day. The Commission issued a press release stating that the pre-conditions for discussions to begin with member states on lifting the embargo have been met.</p>
	<p pid="c.2032W.2/4">The next step is for the Commission to submit to member states a proposal to lift the ban on the export from the UK of cattle, beef and other bovine products and we expect discussions with member states to commence this month. Due to the need to observe EU legal procedures and to gain member states' agreement, it is unlikely that legislation to lift the ban will come into force until early 2006. The Government is continuing to work in Brussels to ensure that the export ban is lifted as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.2032W.2/5">If EU legislation to lift the export ban is adopted, we will need to amend our existing domestic legislation, the Bovines and Bovine Products (Trade) Regulations 1999, to bring UK law into line with EU law. We have already launched a public consultation on the lifting of the ban and related issues, with the aim of ensuring that changes to EU and UK law can, as far as possible, enter into force at the same time so as to enable exports to resume at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.2032W.2/6">When the export ban is lifted, the date-based export scheme will no longer be required and will automatically be discontinued.</p>

	<p pid="c.2035W.8/2">Under current EU legislation, the rate for compulsory modulation to be applied across the EU-15 agreed as part of the 2003 CAP reforms is 4 per cent. in 2006, rising to 5 per cent. in each of the years from 2007 to 2012. The European Commission has recently suggested, in the context of the EU future financing negotiations, an increase in that rate of compulsory modulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2035W.8/3">In addition to this, the UK countries apply additional national modulation, which for England is 6 per cent. in 2006. It is likely that the rate in England will rise in future years, in order to provide part of the funding for Environmental Stewardship. However, the rate of any additional national modulation will depend on the outcome of the EU future financing negotiations for the period 2007&ndash;13. The UK is pressing to ensure the principle of additional national modulation is available to member states in the next budget period.</p>

Feedback from members of the Group, and other sources, suggests that TRIG guidance &quot;notes to aid tenants and landlords on CAP reform&quot; has proved effective, in the majority of cases, in helping both parties reach amicable arrangements in respect of the new Single Payment Scheme, but there have also been reports of arrangements which have left one party or the other feeling aggrieved.</p>

While the research is intended primarily to focus on the effect of CAP reform in opening up opportunities for farm diversification by tenant farmers, the specification for the project also covers investigation of the wider impact of CAP reform on the landlord/tenant relationship.</p>

	<p pid="c.2038W.8/1">The major schemes that are proposed in the second round of local transport plans fall into two categories. There are those for which we received Major Scheme Business Cases in July 2005 which contain detailed proposals, including costs. The remainder are those that authorities have indicated that they will be developing over the next few years for which there are fewer details.</p>
	<p pid="c.2038W.8/2">The schemes for which we have business cases are set out in the table. Both the estimated total cost and the Department's contribution have been rounded to the nearest million.</p>

	<p pid="c.2038W.8/43">Decisions on these schemes will be taken in the spring of 2006, following the receipt of the advice from the regions on transport priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2038W.8/44">These major schemes are being considered by the Department and are subject to economic appraisal using the NATA methodology which looks at both traffic and emissions. However, neither carbon dioxide nor traffic levels are always explicitly identified as part of the appraisal, so it would not be possible to identify these elements for all schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2038W.8/45">In terms of the other schemes in the second round of local transport plans, these range from specific proposals to descriptions of the problem that needs to be addressed. A list of the named proposals has been placed in the Libraries of the House. This list is not exhaustive and other proposals may be presented to the Department in the period.</p>
	<p pid="c.2038W.8/46">We are unable to provide the estimated total cost or the Department's contribution at this stage as these proposals have not yet been formally submitted to the Department. No decisions have been taken on these schemes.</p>

	<p pid="c.2045W.5/1">Regarding the removal of the UK opt-out from various aspects of the EU Working Time Directive, the Government have conducted a number of regulatory impact assessments on the Working Time Regulations and their subsequent amendments. The initial introduction of the Working Time Regulations was estimated to cost &pound;10 million a year in annually recurring implementation costs and around a &pound;2 billion annual cost to employers. Subsequent regulatory impact assessments have estimated the costs of the various amendments to the original regulations, all being significantly less than the original introduction costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2045W.5/2">Regarding the European Commission's proposed Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), the Government commissioned an impact assessment which estimated the direct costs of REACH on UK industry to be &pound;515 million over 11 years. This impact assessment was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March 2004</phrase> as part of a Defra public consultation paper on REACH.</p>
	<p pid="c.2045W.5/3">The Government subsequently commissioned a further assessment to look at the indirect costs of REACH through supply chains. This assessment was published on Defra's website in October 2005. The assessment concluded that industry is likely to be able to absorb the majority of the costs of REACH without significant impact on the competitiveness, location or market structure in the UK. However, in the case of a substance being withdrawn due to the failure of manufacturers or importers to support it through REACH, significant industry barriers may result in unexpected impacts (even where substitutes already exist).</p>
	<p pid="c.2045W.5/4">The Government have drawn on the results of these impact assessments to identify improvements to REACH to ensure that it meets its objectives of delivering better protection for human health and the environment while not undermining competitiveness or hindering innovation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2045W.5/5">Regarding the proposed EU Directive on agency and temporary workers, the Department of Trade and Industry published the final regulatory impact assessment on its website in April 2002. The regulatory impact assessment estimated direct costs to agencies and user enterprises to be in the region of &pound;330 million to &pound;596 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2045W.5/6">All regulatory impact assessments are placed in the Libraries of the House when the relevant Bill is laid in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.2046W.5/1">The manufacturing industry in Northamptonshire was comprehensively assessed most recently as part of the Northamptonshire Integrated Local Employment Strategy (NILES). This was work undertaken on behalf of local partners by the Economic Development Arm of Northamptonshire county council and financed by the Council of Europe's European Social Fund. This found that Northamptonshire is characterised by a relative over-representation in employment in manufacturing with over 20 per cent. of employment being within that sector. It also found that the county was dependent on declining traditional manufacturing but that it was now attracting new higher level manufacturing with proposals for science and technology realms at the forefront of this drive.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/2">In addition the Northamptonshire Chamber and Business Link continue to undertake regular Quarterly Economic Surveys. Their findings for the quarter ending September 2005 for the sector show the following results in relation to sales and business confidence:</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/3" class="italic">For businesses involved in the UK market, excluding seasonal variations, over the past three months:</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> In general sales/custom/bookings have either increased or remained constant.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/5" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> In general orders/advance custom/bookings have either increased or remained constant.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/6" class="italic">For businesses involved in overseas markets, excluding seasonal variations, over the past three months:</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/7" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> The majority reported that overseas sales/custom/bookings have remained constant.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/8" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> The majority reported that overseas orders/advance custom/bookings have remained constant.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/9" class="italic">Business confidence:</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/10" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> 65 per cent. believe 'Turnover' will improve over the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/11" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> 50 per cent. believe 'Profitability' will improve over the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/12">A further survey carried out for the Chamber by the organisation 'Matters of Fact' and based on the latest figures from the Annual Business Inquiry 2003 show a continuing decline in the county's manufacturing base. Manufacturing businesses accounted for 10.3 per cent. of all businesses in 2001, and 10 per cent. in 2002 but this has fallen to 9.5 per cent. in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.2046W.5/13">In terms of employment, its role remains significant with manufacturing businesses accounting for the biggest share&mdash;19.1 per cent.&mdash;of county employment. Within the sector the research also shows that the food and drink sector has become by far the most significant area of manufacturing in Northamptonshire in employment terms.</p>

This estimate is an update of a National Audit Office Report, &quot;Tackling Obesity in England&quot; published in 2001, which puts this figure at &pound;1.3 billion in 1998. In addition, there will be production losses through inability to work associated with illness brought on by obesity.</p>

	<p pid="c.2070W.6/3" class="indentitalic">Parliamentary Questions 29556/29557/29558: Setting and Banding by Ability</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary questions have been referred to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/5" class="indent">In sum, you asked:</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/6" class="indent">the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will revise Ofsted inspection criteria to include monitoring of the proportion of classes that are banded by ability (PQ 29556)</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/7" class="indent">the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on what basis it was decided to remove the requirement for Ofsted inspectors to distinguish between setting and banding by ability in the information recorded about lessons (PQ 29557)</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/8" class="indent">the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what percentage of lessons was recorded as banded by ability in <i>(a)</i> Year 7, <i>(b)</i> Year 8, <i>(c)</i> Year 9, <i>(d)</i> Year 10 and <i>(e)</i> Year 11 in secondary schools inspected by Ofsted in each year between 1995 and 2004 (PQ 29558).</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/9" class="indent">In response to Parliamentary Question 29556, Ofsted introduced a new framework and guidance for inspections under section 5 of the Education Act 2005 from September 2005. Although these will be kept under review, there are no plans to change them in the immediate future. The observation of lessons is no longer conducted in the same way as under the previous inspection regime (under section 10 of the School Inspections Act) and in Ofsted's view it would not be appropriate to ask inspectors to collect information about the proportion of classes that are grouped by ability on every section 5 inspection.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/10" class="indent">In response to Parliamentary Question 29557, changes were made in 2003/04 so that Ofsted had information about the level of ability of groups as well as whether pupils were grouped by ability for their lessons. The information about ability levels was not previously available. To avoid over-complexity, the distinction between banding and setting was removed. In making judgements, Ofsted felt that it was not important for inspectors to know whether pupils were grouped by ability or not, rather than knowing the precise arrangements through which this was achieved. In some schools the distinction between banding and setting is blurred.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/11" class="indent">In response to Parliamentary Question 29558, the table (see Appendix 1) includes the information you required for the years 1996/97 to 2002/03. The data were not recorded in 1995/96 and from September 2003 inspectors were not required to distinguish between setting and banding in the information they recorded about lessons.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/12" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jacqui Smith and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.2070W.6/45">1. Framework changes occurred in January 2000 and September 2003. Changes in the way groupings in lessons were recorded may mean that data are not directly comparable from periods of one framework to another.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.6/46">2. From January 2000 to July 2003, the inspection arrangements included full and short inspections. The majority of lessons observed will have been in full inspections. The most effective schools had short inspections.</p>

It points out that learndirect has been innovative and, within a few years, has become the largest educational provider of its type in the world. Ufi has an ambitious plan for working more with employers. The report also highlights that more than 1.7 million people have already used learndirect's services, many of whom would not otherwise have undertaken learning.</p>

	<p pid="c.2072W.5/1">The Government believe that the most important thing we can do to improve the quality of life for disadvantaged and excluded individuals and their families is to raise their prospects of a productive, sustainable employment. This is why the priorities for public funding of adult learning are helping individuals to attain the platform of employability represented by improved basic skills and a first full level 2 qualification. In addition, work for my Department by the centre for the wider benefits of learning shows that participation in adult learning has beneficial effects on a wide spectrum of measures which relate to the quality of life both for the individual and for society as a whole. These include smoking, exercise taken, life satisfaction, and attitudes such as race tolerance, authoritarianism, political cynicism, political interest, and voting behaviour.</p>

Pending a final decision about the College's future, the LSC has appointed a dedicated team of educational advisers, experienced in the field of complex learning difficulties and/or disabilities, to ensure appropriate alternative provision is focused for the young people affected. This team has been working with parents, Connexions and other local partners to explore appropriate options for the young people. They are now finalising the details of alternative arrangements that are intended to take effect from January 2006 for all 11 learners at the College.

The LSC's original intention was to give the College notice that the contract would terminate in February 2006.

	<p pid="c.2073W.5/3">The funding decision follows an Ofsted and Adult Learning Inspectorate inspection of Belford College in February 2004 when overall provision was judged to be inadequate. Since then Ofsted has undertaken a series of monitoring visits and an annual assessment visit to the college. The LSC is concerned about the rate of progress made by Belford College in addressing the weaknesses identified in the Inspection. In view of this, the LSC has made the difficult decision to terminate the College's contract.</p>

Following the Davies Review of 2002, in 2003 we launched Pathfinders involving 700 schools over two years, to develop the first national guidance on Enterprise Education. This was disseminated at 47 regional conferences between May and July 2005, attracting 67 per cent. of all secondary schools. Business and Enterprise Colleges came into the specialist schools programme for the first time in 2002, and in March 2005 there were 201 such specialist schools.

	<p pid="c.2076W.2/1">I wrote to hon. Members on <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase> setting out the Government's strategy for funding the further education sector in 2006/07 and 2007/08&mdash;enclosing the Learning and Skill Council's document 'Priorities for Success' which explains its priorities and detailed approach. The strategy will ensure that substantial additional levels of public funding for FE and training are focused on the key priorities: embedding 14&ndash;19 reforms and raising attainment of Level 2 at 19, supporting low skilled adults in acquiring basic skills and progressing from basic skills to Level 2 and above, increasing employer engagement and increasingly meeting the needs of employers, and continuing to raise standards in all areas of education and training.</p>
	<p pid="c.2076W.2/2">Limited public funding needs to be focused on key priority areas. For example, in supporting additional provision for 16 to 19-year-olds and continuing to provide free tuition for everyone studying literacy and numeracy skills or a first full Level 2 qualification, as well as providing free tuition for those on jobseeker's allowance or income-related benefits and their dependants. One of the measures that the LSC will be taking, to ensure those key priorities are met, is to cease funding for very short courses&mdash;below nine hours. Very short Skills for Life programmes should be part of larger programmes aiming towards a qualification achievement, while other very short courses appear to have limited benefits in terms of progression for learners.</p>

	<p pid="c.2077W.5/3">Epilepsy is a medical condition and for some children may have implications for the way they function in school. In March 2004 the Department, with the Department of Health, published &quot;Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings&quot; to provide guidance on supporting children with medical needs, sets out a clear framework within which local authorities, NHS Primary Care Trusts, schools, early years settings and families are able to work together to develop policies to ensure that children requiring medicines receive the support they need. It contains specific guidance on epilepsy.</p>

	<p pid="c.2078W.2/1">The information requested is not available on a regional or local authority basis. However, my Department recently commissioned MORI to undertake a survey of study support (out-of-school-hours learning) activities in England. This showed that over 90 per cent. of primary schools and over 98 per cent. of secondary schools currently offer some study support. The most popular activities are PE/sport, followed by music and ICT. In addition, 97 per cent. of secondary schools offer activities specifically designed to promote study skills or to help with homework and revision.</p>

	<p pid="c.2078W.5/16">The Family Fund provides grants direct to approximately 45,000 families per year with severely disabled children, where the family income is less than &pound;23,000 a year. Over 90 per cent. of the Family Fund's income is paid out in grants, reflecting efficient processes and low administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2078W.5/17">How the grant is used will depend on the needs of the family. Examples include: family holidays for those who would otherwise not have a break, washing machines and other white goods, transport costs to help ease the burden of frequent hospital visiting and other practical support.</p>
	<p pid="c.2078W.5/18">The Fund also holds a database which contains records on over 150,000 families. The database represents well over half of the population of all families with a severely disabled child and is used by Government Departments and others to inform policy developments.</p>

	<p pid="c.2079W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. My main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2079W.5/2">In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published 'Priorities for Success'-a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.2079W.5/3">Although more funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14&ndash;19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult workforce. This will mean that less provision outside these priority areas can be supported at previous levels, and that there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between government, employers and learners to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.2079W.5/4">The LSC are currently seeking views of its proposed funding changes for 2006/07 including the funding of very short courses. These very short learning aims (below nine guided learning hours [glh]) currently funded by the LSC fall into four groups; very short Skills for Life programmes, University for Industry (Ufl) Learn Direct programs, very short programs within the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and other very short programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2079W.5/5">From 2005/06 Skills for Life courses will be incorporated into larger programmes aiming towards the achievement of qualifications and will still be funded but in a different form. University for Industry Learn Direct courses and very short learning aims accredited within the NQF will also still be funded but other very short programmes will not.</p>
	<p pid="c.2079W.5/6">The resource required to list all relevant courses in all 2005/06 college prospectuses would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold for answering Parliamentary questions. However, the generic names for very short programmes are listed in the four groups outlined.</p>

	<p pid="c.2090W.8/1">The Labour Force Survey is not used to assess need for youth services. Through our Every Child Matters reforms we are giving local authorities and their partners through children's trusts increasing freedom to make local assessments of the need for particular services and allocate resources accordingly. Data collected by Connexions Services is a powerful tool for partners to use in planning and commissioning services for young people, and this local data is used in assessing local performance.</p>

These statistics are a measurement of the overall impact of policies&mdash;not of the need for youth services.</p>

Funding to cover administrative costs is based on the clear demonstration of need. When agreement is reached the additional resources are formally notified, in writing, to the LSC as additions to the grant letter. The LSC's core administration costs have fallen steadily from 3.4 per cent. of total funding in 2001&ndash;02 to 2.5 per cent. of its planned total budget in 2005&ndash;06. Using the figures in LSC annual accounts for 2001&ndash;02, which include the set up costs occurred in the last seven months of 2000&ndash;01, gives the administration budget as 4.6 per cent. of total funding.</p>

	<p pid="c.2091W.11/1">The discussions held with educators and officials concerned with the Milwaukee charter schools' programme included the teaching and learning strategies and curriculum used to engage and motivate young people; the implications of teacher led schools and the accountability systems in place to quality assure provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.2091W.11/2">The official made the following observations based on his visit to Milwaukee:</p>
	<p pid="c.2091W.11/3" class="indent">1. The inclusive nature of new charter school creation has encouraged the involvement of people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Their expertise and enthusiasm helps practitioners see things from a different angle.</p>
	<p pid="c.2091W.11/4" class="indent">2. There is little intervention or co-ordinated response to prevent fragile charter schools from failing, although there is expertise in the system to share good practice to build capacity and ensure consistency of approach.</p>

	<p pid="c.2092W.14/2">The Government's position is that the needs of children, and not the rights of parents, should be at the heart of the law. The courts are required to have the welfare of the child as their paramount consideration in determining any question in relation to their upbringing. This paramountcy principle is focused on the child, and there is no legal bias toward or against either parent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.14/3">The Government take very seriously the need to support both parents in seeking to know and love their children, and we believe firmly that it is normally in the child's best interest to have a meaningful relationship with both parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.14/4">Following on from the parental separation Green Paper, &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;, we are introducing a raft of measures to support parents and children, both in legal disputes and in avoiding those disputes in the first place, through rolling out in-court conciliation, revising and updating parenting plans, launching a telephone helpline later this year, making new arrangements to incentivise solicitors to promote successful out-of-court contact settlements and increasing the availability of child contact centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.14/5">On the more technical matter of parental responsibility (PR), fathers who have PR for their children have exactly the same level of rights and responsibilities as any other party with PR. We introduced new provisions to allow fathers to register as a child's parent through the Adoption and Children Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.14/6">Anyone with parental responsibility has all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property, including being consulted over important changes in the child's life, such as a change of name or taking the child abroad for longer than one month, and being entitled to information about the child such as school reports.</p>

	<p pid="c.2094W.5/2">We are supporting schools in making sure that each classroom is a positive and orderly place where pupils are free to learn. Our National Primary and Secondary Strategies are improving the quality of teaching and learning in schools. We are also implementing a complementary and comprehensive programme of measures to strengthen schools' capacity to improve pupils' behaviour and attendance, which includes access to high-quality training for all school staff and extra support for schools facing the greatest challenges.

	<p pid="c.2094W.5/4">We want to help parents and schools to work well together and raise children's achievement. It is crucial we ensure that the importance of parental involvement is embedded throughout the education chain to establish a culture of parental involvement and encourage a positive, two-way partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.2094W.5/5">To enable this, we are actively encouraging parents to become more closely involved in their children's education and learning at home and at school by providing information for parents such as the Learning Journey guides and the Parents Centre website; and materials for schools such as the Involving Parents, Raising Achievement toolkit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2094W.5/6">The family learning programmes funded by the Learning and Skills Council enable parents and their children to improve their literacy, language and numeracy skills together.</p>
	<p pid="c.2094W.5/7">All these measures support the creation of a positive learning environment in schools, at home and in the community, as they all include an emphasis on work with parents and raising awareness of children and young people's position and responsibilities in the communities in which they live.</p>

	<p pid="c.2096W.8/1">Schools and local authorities have duties under the Education Act 1996 to identify, assess and make suitable provision for all children with special educational needs (SEN), including those with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). In making provision for children with SEN schools and local authorities have to have regard to statutory guidance set out in the SEN Code of Practice. With the Department of Health, we have also published non-statutory Good Practice Guidance on ASDs (2002) some 30,000 copies of which have been distributed on demand. The Guidance is designed to raise awareness and to give providers a tool with which to audit and develop their provision. The Department is aware that the Guidance is being used in this way by schools, local authorities and the Departmentally-funded SEN Regional Partnerships, nine of the 11 of which have established autism working groups.</p>

	<p pid="c.2104W.8/2">The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.2104W.8/3">The MRC is currently funding one research grant of relevance to cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The MRC is additionally supporting a considerable programme of underpinning research in both neurology and genetics that may lead to a greater understanding of the condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.2104W.8/4">Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on health research is devolved to and managed by national health service organisations. Details of current and completed individual projects, including a number concerned with CADASIL, can be found on the national research register on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/research">www.dh.gov.uk/research</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2104W.8/5">There is currently no specific treatment available for CADASIL, although the associated migraine, anxiety and depression can be controlled using standard treatments. The recently published national service framework for long-term conditions focuses on the health and social care needs for people living with neurological conditions, including those with CADASIL.</p>

We advised PCTs to offer a minimum of one cycle of IVF by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria in the guideline, giving priority to couples with no children living with them.

	<p pid="c.2115W.0/1">A formal race equality impact assessment (REIA) on the Mental Health Bill began at the end of 2004. Prior to this, the Bill and the preceding Green Paper received a wide consultation over a period of four years with various parties including black and minority ethnic (BME) stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.2115W.0/2">Officials conducted a series of roadshows after the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in September 2004, at which BME communities and stakeholder groups participated. The pre-legislative scrutiny committee also received substantial written and oral evidence from BME stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.2115W.0/3">We have also published our action plan to tackle racial discrimination in mental health services &quot;Delivering Race Equality&quot;, January 2005, which also covered our response to the David Bennett inquiry. These factors have influenced our decision to re-examine the concerns expressed by BME stakeholders about the Bill, and to our carrying out a formal REIA on the Bill before its introduction, in accordance with current race relations legislation. We have had close regard to the Commission for Racial Equality's (CRE's) guidance in undertaking the REIA, and Officials met with the CRE to discuss our approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.2115W.0/4">As an initial part of the process we planned a series of regional meetings with service users and carers from the BME stakeholder community this spring. These events were cancelled when the general election was called. However, we have since established an advisory group chaired by Rabinder Singh, QC, whose report we expect to receive shortly, and which will inform the REIA which is to be published with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.2115W.0/5">The advisory group's summer workshop assessed the potential impact of the Bill. We have more recently held regional consultations attended by more than 200 people, mostly BME service users, carers and community groups. These events were organised with the help of race equality leads from the care services improvement partnership, a relatively new and powerful resource. These leads have strong and extensive links with the communities they serve, enabling events such as these to be organised quickly. Again, the outcome of these events will feed into the REIA when this is published.</p>
	<p pid="c.2115W.0/6">We remain confident that these processes will identify the key concerns that will enable us to respond to the REIA. We are also considering with the BME mental health network what further consultation(s) might be possible before the Bill is introduced. We will continue to engage with BME stakeholders as the Bill progresses through Parliament. We consider that it is particularly important to secure the strong engagement of BME stakeholders in developing the code of practice for the Bill, and the Bill's implementation.</p>

The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding.</p>

The proposals for London are available from the SHA. These proposals have been assessed by an independent external panel drawn from and representing a wide range of stakeholder interests, to determine whether the SHA proposals meet the criteria stipulated in &quot;Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot; (July 2005). Where the criteria are judged to have been met, the proposals will go forward to a three-month public consultation.

	<p pid="c.2119W.8/2">The facts and purposes of custody, including the need to protect the vulnerable and to maintain good order and discipline, mean that it would be inappropriate for prisons to condone or encourage sexual activity between prisoners. However, the Prison Service recognises that sex in prisons is a reality and prison doctors were advised in 1995 that they should make condoms available to individual prisoners, on application, if in their clinical judgment, there is a risk of transmission of HIV infection during sexual activity. The Prison Service is planning to issue, in 2006, revised guidance and instructions which aim to clarify the policy on condoms so that it can be applied more evenly across the prison estate. The intention is to preserve individuals' health rather than to encourage sexual relationships.</p>

	<p pid="c.2120W.2/1">The Department supports the development of screening technology for prostate cancer by having a comprehensive research strategy into all aspects of prostate cancer. By providing both funding and structure we are improving the knowledge base of prostate cancer, opening up new possibilities for screening, treatment, care, etc.</p>
	<p pid="c.2120W.2/2">We are jointly with other National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) members, such as the Medical Research Council, funding two NCRI prostate cancer collaboratives, one based at the University of Cambridge and the other at the Institute of Cancer Research. The Department is funding half of the total &pound;7.4 million cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.2120W.2/3">The research undertaken by the collaboratives covers all aspects of prostate cancer and has already generated the groundbreaking discovery of the overactive E2F3 gene in prostate cancer tumours. This discovery provides the potential not only to identify those at risk of developing the disease, but for the first time allows the prediction of how aggressive the cancer will be.</p>
	<p pid="c.2120W.2/4">It is important to note that in order for a screening technology to contribute to saving lives it is essential for there to be effective treatments for the disease detected. That is why the Department is funding a &pound;20 million trial of treatments for prostate specific antigen (PSA) screen-detected early prostate cancer (the ProtecT trial).</p>
	<p pid="c.2120W.2/5">The Department directly commissioned funding for prostate cancer research, including screening, as shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="c.2124W.0/2">The rules which preclude the payment in full of more than one non-income-related benefit for income maintenance purposes are common to a wide range of benefits. Payment of carer's allowance is withdrawn from carers who receive state pension, either in full where the weekly rate of state pension exceeds the weekly rate of carer's allowance, or in part where the weekly rate of state pension is less than the weekly rate of carer's allowance. This means that carers of state pension age <sup>1</sup> receive at least as much by way of state benefits as they did before state pension age. They may retain entitlement to carer's allowance for so long as they continue to meet the entitlement conditions and, if they have a low income, may also be entitled to pension credit which includes an additional amount for carers, currently &pound;25.80 per week.</p>

New marketing campaigns have been developed to target regions and demographic groups that have a low take-up of pension credit.

Over 50 per cent. of the UK's budget for Afghan CN will go towards law enforcement and criminal justice; we are doubling our previously planned expenditure on criminal justice. The Government of Afghanistan, with our support, is on track to put in place the key foundations of a CN criminal justice system. This includes a new counter narcotics law, which is currently being drafted and is due to be finalised by the end of this year. The UK has also worked with the international community to recruit and train a CN Criminal Justice Task Force of Afghan investigators, prosecutors and judges, currently 80-strong, to work with the CN Police, to be able to push through successful investigations and prosecutions. The Criminal Justice Task Force has made 150 convictions since it became operational in May and are currently investigating 247 cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.2128W.2/1">The UK, as lead nation on counter narcotics (CN), remains committed to supporting the Afghan Government in the implementation of their comprehensive 2005 CN Implementation Plan. A UK advisor is also currently working with the Ministry of Counter Narcotics Strategy Unit to update the National Drugs Control Strategy for the new five-year period. We continue to work with the Afghan Government and others to increase activity in all areas of their strategy. As well as co-ordinating the activity of international partners, we are providing substantial financial and practical support, spending over &pound;270 million over the three financial years 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 on CN activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.2128W.2/2">Significant steps have already been taken to build Afghan capacity to tackle the drugs problem. At the end of last year, the Government of Afghanistan established the Ministry of Counter Narcotics charged with co-ordinating the fight against drugs. This year, the Ministry has organised on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan a series of high profile provincial CN &quot;jirgas&quot;&mdash;meetings of local leaders, to persuade local communities to not plant poppy this year, these meetings have taken place with the support of our ambassador in Kabul. The UK is funding a &pound;12.5 million Institution Development project to further strengthen the Ministry of Counter Narcotics and other institutions in Afghanistan. On <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase>, a CN Trust Fund was officially launched at the Afghan Ministry of Finance. The Fund will give the Government of Afghanistan more money for CN activities and greater say over how this money is spent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2128W.2/3">The UK has helped to establish and provide training for the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA)&mdash;the lead drugs law enforcement agency, headquartered in Kabul with seven provincial offices. The CNPA is currently around 500 strong, but will be expanded further to give it the capacity to operate nation-wide. The UK is also providing training for the Afghan Special Narcotics Force (ASNF), an elite and highly trained force equipped to tackle high value targets across the country. Since January 2004, the CNPA and ASNF have seized approximately 150 tonnes of opiates, destroyed over 264 drugs labs and made a significant number of arrests.</p>
	<p pid="c.2128W.2/4">We are also working with the international community to recruit and train a counter narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force of Afghan investigators, prosecutors and judges to work with the Counter Narcotics Police, to be able to push through successful drugs investigations and prosecutions. The Criminal Justice Task Force is currently around 80 strong and made its first convictions in May this year for drug trafficking in Kabul. President Karzai also signed off a decree on <phrase class="date" code="">25 July</phrase>, to establish Counter Narcotics divisions in Kabul's primary and appeals courts with jurisdiction over the whole of Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.2131W.6/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is fully committed to improving the diversity of its workforce. Part of the FCO's work towards achieving this goal is positive action, involving the encouragement of candidates from under-represented groups to enter and progress in the organisation. Along with the rest of the civil service, we are committed to improving the representation of these groups, while ensuring that all recruitment and promotion is fair and achieved on merit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2131W.6/2">The FCO participates in the Summer Development programme, which is a Cabinet Office run programme offering minority ethnic graduates the chance of working within Government Departments each summer. In 2005 we took on 10 participants, all of whom spent part of the summer working in an overseas mission.</p>
	<p pid="c.2131W.6/3">We place advertisements for our generalist recruitment campaigns in the following minority ethnic newspapers and magazines: Works for Me, The Voice and the Ethnic Media News covering Eastern Eye, India Weekly, Asian Times, Caribbean Times, African Times and New Nation. We also advertise throughout the year in a number of minority ethnic publications and websites aimed at school leavers and graduates.</p>
	<p pid="c.2131W.6/4">The following statistics show that, although the percentage of minority ethnic staff in the FCO has remained constant since 2002, recent recruitment figures show that there has been an increase in the number of minority ethnic recruits across the grades in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.2136W.2/1">I refer the hon. Member to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1599" name="Adam Holloway">the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November 2005</phrase>, O<i>fficial Report</i>, column 1092W. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear in his speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase>, the current round of World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations is an opportunity to tackle some of the most fundamental injustices at the heart of world trade and to help millions of people to escape poverty. We are making the same argument to our EU partners, the European Commission and to other WTO members and stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.2136W.2/2">A successful, pro-development outcome to the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December remains a priority for the UK as presidency of the EU. The EU has agreed to negotiate an end to agricultural export subsidies, which are damaging to developing country producers, provided that other developed countries follow suit. The UK believes this date should be 2010. The EU is also pushing developed countries to extend tariff and quota free access to least developed countries, as the EU has already offered under the Everything But Arms initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.2136W.2/3">This is also why my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced that the UK will treble aid to &pound;100 million a year by 2010 in order to help the poorest countries develop their capacity to trade. At the G8 Gleneagles summit, the European Commission already pledged to increase its aid for trade to &euro;1 billion per year. We have called for EU member states to match that amount. We have also challenged other G8 countries to increase their aid for trade ahead of the Hong Kong ministerial conference.</p>

	<p pid="c.2143W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2143W.8/2">Two major research studies on special measures were commissioned by the Home Office. The first assessed the satisfaction of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The report 'Are special measures working? Evidence from surveys of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses' (Home Office Research Study 283, available at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/hors283.pdf">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/hors283.pdf</a>) was published in June 2004. Key findings from the research were also published in Home Office Findings 240 and are available at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/r240.pdf">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/r240.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2143W.8/3">Key points are that a third of witnesses using special measures would not have been willing and able to give evidence without the availability of these measures and that those who used the measures were significantly more likely to express satisfaction with the criminal justice system. The report of the second study evaluating the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in implementing the special measures is likely to be published in early 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2155W.2/1">Prison staff are required to complete a life sentence plan (LSP) for all life sentence prisoners. The LSP framework provides the prisoner with a series of objectives designed to help him or her reduce their risk, and the means by which such a reduction might be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="c.2155W.2/2">Specific risk reduction work, in the form of offending behaviour programmes, courses and other treatment options will be identified and managed throughout sentence by prison staff and treatment managers. The prisoner is involved in the LSP process and will be aware of the various targets and objectives. Selection for particular interventions will depend on a number of factors. These include, for example, an assessment of suitability, the prisoner's motivation to address the various treatment needs, the availability and location of the intervention, the proximity of the tariff expiry date, the sequencing of the individual's treatment needs alongside areas like work, education or vocational training. Treatment managers in prisons are largely responsible for prioritising cases and managing waiting lists for programmes and courses. In this respect, the treatment needs of life sentence prisoners would also have to be prioritised as appropriate, alongside those of determinate sentence prisoners.</p>
