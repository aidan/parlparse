	<p pid="b.1292W.3/1">The current overall strength of the University Officer Training Corps is approximately 5,030 (including the instructional staff). The actual strength of the student body is currently approximately 4,430<sup>(1)</sup>. Demand can exceed capacity and a selection process is adopted similar to that which governs Officer Selection at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Candidates can fail to gain entry for a number of reasons, not just because of capacity constraints. A list of reasons given for non-selection of individuals is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.3/2">There are currently no plans to increase the strength of the University Officer Training Corps by either expanding existing units or creating new ones. A contingent can only be formed when specifically requested by a university. There have been no formal requests for a new contingent by a university since the year 2000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1293W.9/1">Statutory responsibility for supporting carers under the age of 18 who have been assessed as children in need lies with the local authorities concerned, and my Department issued guidance with the Department of Health in August 2005 on the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 and the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004. The latter Act requires authorities, in making an assessment, to take into account the carer's wishes to undertake education, training, work, or a leisure activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1293W.9/2">The Department's guidance to administrators of the discretionary Access to Learning Fund covers students with caring responsibilities, although this is chiefly designed with adult carers in mind. Young carers in full-time education&mdash;that is, with at least 12 guided learning hours per week&mdash;may be eligible for Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs). Although in general a weekly allowance payment is only made to a student where they have attended all required sessions, a school or college has discretion to authorise an absence caused by caring responsibilities. Learning providers should not, however, authorise a student's absences regularly for this reason.</p>
	<p pid="b.1293W.9/3">Carers aged over 16 who provide at least 35 hours of care a week may be entitled to Carers Allowance, where they are undertaking less than 21 hours a week of supervised study, and institutions will need to take this into account when considering appropriate arrangements for enabling carers to access learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1294W.8/1">The Government are committed to improving safeguards for children. We have introduced new legislation, new guidance, new structures and new policy initiatives to make children safer and to ensure that there is a proper focus on children at the very heart of Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1294W.8/2">To reduce the amount of abuse and neglect we need safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children to be clearly everyone's responsibility&mdash;to be fundamental duties for everyone who has regular contact with children. Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 places a statutory duty on all key agencies (including prisons, the police, and health bodies) to make arrangements for ensuring that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. It mirrors a requirement on education institutions in the Education Act 2002. We published updated guidance on the section 11 duty earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1294W.8/3">Last year we set out clear guidance for the rest of the safeguarding framework with the publication of &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot;, the new version of &quot;Working Together To Safeguard Children&quot;, which is the core guidance to help all agencies act effectively to safeguard children, and an updated version of &quot;What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is Being Abused&quot; which is a guide for front line staff. New Local Safeguarding Children Boards were put in place by April 2006 to co-ordinate what is done in each local area to safeguard children and to ensure that it is effective. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 will deliver the first centralised vetting and barring scheme for all those working with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.1294W.8/4">The Act will introduce a new system with a number of improvements over the current arrangements to make the work force safer. These improvements include: bringing together in one place for expert judgement all information relevant to vetting and barring; introducing tough penalties on employers who fail in their responsibility to carry out the necessary checks; making barring decisions when new information becomes available, and notifying employers when an employee's status changes; and making it possible for parents to check that home tutors and nannies are members of the new vetting scheme. The new scheme will apply in the same way to the volunteers and those organising the work of volunteers as it will to employees and employers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1295W.2/1">The Department's March 2008 target of 3,200 (full time equivalents) was set following Sir Peter Gershon's independent review of public sector efficiency. This recognised that the Department will be smaller but more strategic enabling it to deliver its priorities for improved outcomes for children and learners within the planned headcount. Reform programmes within each Directorate, underpinned by a project and programme management approach to delivery, allows the Department to focus its resources efficiently but flexibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295W.2/2">The Department's board maintain an awareness of issues and business priorities and are regularly provided with detailed analysis of current and anticipated labour market and work force issues. The board decides any necessary reallocation of staff resources to best meet the needs of the business and ministerial priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295W.2/3">Cover for key staff and resource planning for incidents/emergencies are part of the business continuity planning process which is undertaken across the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.0/2">The data which underpin this figure are taken from the Labour Force Survey. We estimate the effect on net additional earnings from getting a degree, after allowing for factors like gender, age, and the probability of being employed. The figures are also discounted so that they are in 'today's valuation'. Comparing the lifetime earnings profiles of otherwise similar graduates and those with A levels, we find that graduates can expect to earn, after taxation, over &pound;100,000 more than similar non-graduates.

	<p pid="b.1303W.6/1">FE colleges are independent institutions catering for the diverse needs of young people and adults participating in learning. Colleges have an important role in promoting physical education and healthy living. Government funding is provided for all 16 to19-year-olds in FE to support a range of extra curricula activities including sport and health promotion. We are also supporting the FE sector as it implements a number of sector led initiatives to promote healthy living and participation in sport and physical education, including for the 2012 games. With Government funding, the new sector co-ordination and communications unit will ensure that learners in FE colleges benefit from and contribute to the success of the games. In addition, a wide range of publicly funded learning programmes for learners of all ages, ranging from construction through to hospitality and tourism, delivered through FE colleges, incorporate modules relating to physical education and health promotion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1304W.2/2">Maintained schools have the power to collect pupils' personal data, including biometric data without prior written consent of parents. Under paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 of the Education Act 2002 the governing body of a maintained school has the legal power to do anything which appears to them to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of, or in connection with, the conduct of the school. Schools must process biometric data in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. DfES guidance recommends that schools should engage fully with parents and pupils if they decide to introduce biometric technology systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306W.2/1">Schools are already required to promote the education and welfare of all their pupils, and they should take pupils' particular circumstances into account. The Government are clear that if a school is concerned that one of their pupils may be a &quot;child in need&quot;, whether as a young carer or for any other reason, they should consider communicating with the child's family and with local children's services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that the revised guidance on attendance management, &quot;Advice and guidance to Schools and Local Authorities on Managing Behaviour and Attendance: groups of pupils at particular risk&quot;, is understood by schools and publicised by the Department. This guidance includes young carers as one of the groups that is at risk of becoming disengaged from education, and it was revised in October 2006 to reflect comments from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. Young carers will be mentioned in our revised anti-bullying guidance, Safe to Learn (due to be issued later this term), as one of the categories of pupil particularly vulnerable to bullying. We also plan to ensure that schools are aware of their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA), and to draw their attention to our resource Implementing the DDA in Schools and Early Years Settings. Once this work is complete, we plan to draw the attention of teachers, schools, and local authorities to the specific application to young carers of these resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/3">There is no specific budget allocated for the support of young carers at school: head teachers and governors have discretion to allocate their resources flexibly in response to local needs. As part of their general funding, local authorities have substantial resources to fulfil their responsibilities towards children and families. They also receive the carers special grant which supports local authorities in providing breaks and services for carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.2/4">Schools are not required to collect data on children and young people with caring responsibilities. The Government accept that not all young carers wish to discuss what they regard as sensitive family issues with their schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1310W.6/1">Strangles is not a notifiable disease or infection, there is no evidence that it has any significance for public health and it is not a listed disease by the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health). There are no plans to make it notifiable or for the Department to take steps to eradicate the disease. The equine industry has the responsibility to control strangles and the Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB) publishes a code of practice, updated annually, containing guidelines on the disease. The code is available from the HBLB, the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association and the British Horse Society, and can be accessed via the DEFRA website. Both DEFRA and the industry encourage horse owners to follow the guidelines on strangles contained in the code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.6/2">DEFRA is not funding research into developing a diagnostic blood test for strangles and has no plans to do so. However, the Animal Health Trust is currently working on improving diagnostic tests for equine strangles through a three-year welfare grant awarded by The Horse Trust.

	<p pid="b.1310W.9/2">The European Union's sugar restructuring scheme has, so far, failed to achieve its planned results and we agree with the European Commission that further action is necessary to make it more effective. The Commission's proposal to establish a limited grower initiative within the third year of the scheme is part of a wider package of measures designed to increase uptake. Discussions on the proposed package are at a very early stage but we do believe that, if adopted, this element of the package would contribute to increased overall uptake.</p>

Our ambassador in Addis Ababa is accredited as the British permanent representative to the AU; the embassy spends a substantive part of its time on AU matters. The UK is providing significant support to AU operations in Sudan and Somalia, as well as to help develop the AU's internal capacity and its key instruments such as the African peace and security architecture.</p>

We strongly advise all British citizens who intend to stay in Nigeria for three months or longer to register with the high commission but not all do so, so the exact number of British residents is likely to be higher than 3,007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.0/1">We are concerned about the security situation in Gaza. The recent intra-Palestinian violence, which started on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-13">13 May</phrase>, has left 54 Palestinians dead. We welcome the ceasefire, which was agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-19">19 May</phrase>, to end this violence. However, the on-going launching of Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel, the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and the resulting Palestinian casualties are of serious concern. As the Minister for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Middle East my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase> said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May</phrase> in a press conference following the Israeli raids on Gaza:</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;For the sake of the people of Gaza and southern Israel, we want to see a complete halt to internal violence in Gaza and to rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. The continuing violence is creating a situation of intolerable suffering for those living in the Gaza Strip, and taking its toll on the residents of Sderot&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.0/3">We are also concerned by the movement restrictions placed upon Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has noted that access to parts of the West Bank, such as East Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, have not improved due to a high number of checkpoints (537 as of April), roadblocks, the barrier and a complex system of permits. In Gaza, the regular closure of the Rafah crossing point and lack of access to the West Bank has had a detrimental effect on the population. We continue to raise our concerns about movement restrictions with the Israeli Government and call upon both parties to implement the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access.</p>

Large numbers of people live in extreme poverty and socio-economic indicators, such as infant mortality, are the worst in the country. Illiteracy and unemployment levels in the region are also high. The UK supports development and stability in Eastern Sudan as part of our contribution to implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.</p>

The priority given to IP crime by all Government enforcement agencies has risen since the launch of the national IP Crime strategy in 2004, with ACPO identifying IP Crime as a spotlight crime. Government recently committed an additional &pound;5 million for 2007-08 to accompany additional powers for Trading Standards to enforce against copyright counterfeiting and piracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1329W.8/3" class="italic"> Letter from Bernard Herdan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/4" class="indent">Thank you for your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February</phrase> to the Rt Hon John Reid MP. It has been passed to me to reply as Executive Director, Service Planning and Delivery at the Identity and Passport Service (IPS).</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/5" class="indent">The network of 69 interview offices has been designed to strike a balance between keeping costs (and therefore fees) as low as possible while making journeys to interviews as short as possible. The proposed locations have been verified by a consultancy and take into account consultations with authorities and agencies responsible for sparsely populated areas. I have enclosed a document &quot;Passport Office Authentication by Interview Network&quot;, which will give you more information on how we decided the locations of the interview offices, The interview office network is intended to provide an office within an hour's travelling time for over 95% of the UK population. In remote, sparsely populated areas where it is not cost-effective to set up an interview office, we are putting in place videoconferencing facilities to conduct the interview to avoid people having to make long journeys. This will affect a small number of applicants who live more than an hour's journey from an interview office, estimated to be less than 4,000 per year in 25 areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/6" class="indent">When assessing interview office locations and travelling times to those offices we considered both private and public transport and used all available local and national transport and census data on population movements and modes of travel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/7" class="indent">Each location has been selected as part of a mutually supporting network; no individual location can be changed without affecting the whole network.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/8" class="indent">I hope this has clarified the situation.</p>

Since then DFID has worked closely with the government of Burundi and a range of other partners on the development of a sector plan for educational development, and on financing arrangements. We are also working with the government to help them gain endorsement of their sector plan and entry to the Education-For-All fast track initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.1338W.2/1">The UK has agreed that half of our direct bilateral aid to poor countries should be spent on basic services, including water, and we will double our total support to water and sanitation in Africa to &pound;95 million a year by 2007-08 and more than double it again to &pound;200 million a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.2/2">In 2005-06 we committed &pound;78 million to Sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to some of the world's poorest people and where the millennium development goals (MDG) for water and sanitation are most off-track.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.2/3">Current bilateral commitments include a planned investment of &pound;100 million in Ethiopia and around &pound;20 million a year in Sudan. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have more than doubled our commitments on water and sanitation from &pound;4 million a year in 2005-06 to &pound;10 million a year by 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.2/4">Our major commitments in Asia include &pound;5.5 million to help deliver water and sanitation to &pound;6 million slum dwellers in Indian cities. In Bangladesh, we support UNICEF's sanitation, environmental health and water programme, which helps 30 million people and 7,500 schools. We also provide nearly &pound;16 million to the charity WaterAid's sanitation and environmental health programme. This has already reached over 1 million of some of Bangladesh's poorest people&mdash;and intends to reach a further 3 million over five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.2/5">But we cannot tackle this alone. That is why I have called for global action on water and sanitation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1338W.2/7" class="indent">one annual report to monitor progress towards achieving the MDG water and sanitation targets. This should set out levels of access to safe water and adequate sanitation, highlighting where progress is lagging behind.</p>

	<p pid="b.1338W.2/11" class="indent">One water and sanitation co-ordinating group&mdash;this should bring together government, civil society and donors to identify the blockages and agree who will do what.</p>

	<p pid="b.1339W.2/1">The security situation in Mogadishu and the surrounding area makes it difficult to assess the humanitarian situation precisely, and DFID has not made any independent assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/2">However, there is wide consensus that over 350,000 people were displaced by fighting in Mogadishu at the end of March and beginning of April. Many estimates, including those of the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross, put the number higher. In addition the UN estimates that 30 to 40 per cent. of the population were unable to leave the city and were displaced within Mogadishu. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) has accused the UN and the international relief agencies of overestimating the numbers, and asserts that only 30,000-40,000 were displaced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/3">The feedback from those relief agencies currently operating in Mogadishu is that humanitarian needs are substantial in all sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/4">Since January 2006 the UK has been the second largest donor of humanitarian relief to Somalia, including $7.4 million since January 2007, of which a substantial amount is being used to help those displaced by the fighting. We stand ready to provide more assistance where we can be sure this will make a difference to the poorest and most vulnerable Somalis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking:</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/4" class="indent">What the total cost has been of the scheme for the online registration of births deaths and marriages and how much is accounted for by (a) software (b) hardware (c) press and publicity to promote the scheme and (d) training costs. (138062)</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/5" class="indent">What assessment has been made of the effectiveness of the scheme for the online registration of births deaths and marriages in the UK and what assessment he has made of the suitability of the (a) scheme as a whole and (b) chosen software to handle volume of transactions required. (138063)</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/6" class="indent">What alternative schemes were considered before the adoption of the chosen scheme for the online registration of births deaths and marriages in the UK and what procurement process was followed for the scheme. (138064)</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/7" class="indent">What the name is of the software which is being used for the online registration of births deaths and marriages in the UK and whether the software was specifically designed for use in the UK. (138065)</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/8" class="indent">What representations have been received on the introduction of the online registration of births deaths and marriages in the UK and what problems have been experienced with the service. (138067)</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/9" class="indent">When is the national scheme for the online registration of births deaths and marriages to be reactivated and what funds have been set aside for that purpose. (138068)</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/10" class="indent">The total cost of the new system (known as &quot;RON&quot;) is just over &pound;6m, of which some &pound;3.5m is for the software, &pound;2.5m is for IT infrastructure, and &pound;60,000 for training. Compared with its predecessor, the new system does not significantly alter the experience for informants when they carry out a registration, so no costs were set aside for publicity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/11" class="indent">I expect the RON system to deliver considerable benefits once fully operational, both in terms of the speed with which registration data will become available centrally and the reduction in administrative effort in the General Register Office and local registration offices. There is no question of the software not being capable of handling the volume of transactions required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/12" class="indent">There was a full procurement process for the software conducted in accordance with the principles of good procurement laid down by the Office for Government Commerce, and subject to Gateway Review. Before a final choice was made, a range of software products was extensively reviewed, tested and evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/13" class="indent">The software acquired as a result of the procurement is a package called VRVWeb, a system developed initially for use in the USA. The core system has been customised to ensure that its functionality meets the requirements of the registration service in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/14" class="indent">Representations have been received mainly from staff in registration offices. As would be expected, those in districts where RON has not worked well have expressed disappointment and frustration at the problems experienced, whereas a number of staff where RON has performed at expected levels have commented very favourably on its qualities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.3/15" class="indent">The RON system is currently being used by some 54% of Local Authorities. No precise estimate is currently being made of when it will be available to other authorities, all of which are able to continue to register births and deaths using pre-existing systems. The need to reintroduce RON in those districts in such a way as to ensure no detriment to current users means that the exercise must be very carefully planned and could take some months. Estimates of additional cost are currently being drawn up.</p>

	<p pid="b.1364W.2/6" class="indent">This is an annual scheme linked to annual appraisals markings, determined as part of the Departmental Performance and Development System.

	<p pid="b.1364W.2/7" class="indent">All payments made in the last 12 months were for the 2005/06 performance year. Total payments for the 2005/06 performance year were &pound;3.314m and were all made In July 2006 salaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.2/8" class="indent">The table attached at Annex A provides the distribution of performance gradings throughout the Agency for 2005/06. All employees receiving a 'majority' rating or higher receive a performance bonus.</p>

	<p pid="b.1365W.3/1">The Government have a number of surveys (including the Labour Force Survey, the ONS Omnibus Survey, and the General Household Survey) which include information on whether the respondent has epilepsy. They provide information on the respondent's age, sex, employment status, place of abode, interaction with the benefit system, marital status, income, participation in society and education. They also capture whether the respondent has experienced problems with accessibility, problems with participating in society, discrimination as a result of their health condition, and whether the respondent is aware of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365W.3/2">A person is a disabled person for the purposes of the Act if they have a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. A person with epilepsy will be protected by the provisions of the Act as long as their impairment meets the Act's definition. The statutory &quot;Guidance on matters to be taken into account in determining questions relating to the definition of disability&quot; makes clear that a disability can arise from a wide range of impairments which can include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1365W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;impairments with fluctuating or recurring effects such as rheumatoid arthritis, myalgic encephalitis (ME)/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, depression and epilepsy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365W.3/4">My Department undertakes regular research on how employers are responding to their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act. This shows that organisations are responding positively to their duties under the Act and that employers have positive attitudes towards employing disabled people. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.1365W.3/5" class="indent">84 per cent. of employers that had employed disabled staff had made, or were planning, adjustments for disabled people. The majority making adjustments had found them easy to make.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.1365W.3/6" class="indent">Around two-fifths of employers reported they had made adjustments due to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Most changes were motivated by an interplay of factors, including 'doing the right thing' and business benefits, as well as the influence of the Act.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.1365W.3/7">The research does not focus on specific impairments, but when asked in 2006 how easy it would be for them to employ somebody with epilepsy, 65 per cent. of employers said that it would be easy. This has increased since 2003, when only 52 per cent. said that it would be easy.<sup>(2)</sup></p>
