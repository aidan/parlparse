	<p pid="a.235W.3/1">The Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) within the Cabinet Office is the Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament, and responsible for the publication of Acts of Parliament. HMSO has considered the publication of Acts prior to 1988, which is the earliest date when these were available electronically, but has decided not to do so as many have been heavily amended and to publish them in their original form would be misleading for many users. The Government are, however, taking forward development of a Statute Law Database which will contain the fully revised and updated text of all legislation from 1275. It is expected that this will be made available to the general public during 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.240W.5/2">Auction marts continue to be important for livestock farmers, particularly for store and breeding stock. As part of the wider livestock and meat marketing chain they are not immune from change and evolution, but this can have positive impact too. New and/or redeveloped markets will include the one now being built at Cirencester which is p art funded by the Defra Rural Enterprise Scheme. In other markets there may be opportunities for business diversification. We continue to monitor the network of auction markets, and remain in regular contact with the Livestock Auctioneers Association and the Meat and Livestock Commission. The Red Meat Industry Forum, with significant contributory Government funding, is working on finding ways of helping industry improve the competitiveness of the red meat supply chain. This includes livestock auction markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.241W.2/1">Canada geese were introduced to this country to add interest to parks and are another example of unwise introductions. They are large aggressive birds, now resident and breeding in Britain. The population estimate is 96,000 in England, with a suggested annual increase in population of 10 per cent. Its size and aggressive nature enables it to dominate other native species in terms of feeding and nest site selection, which can result in other species being unable to breed. There are also reports that breeding success of other birds is affected by trampling of nests, eggs and young. The Canada goose can also interbreed with other goose species, resulting in hybrids.</p>

	<p pid="a.244W.3/1">The Government want to make it possible for more children to walk, cycle or use the bus to get to and from school. Where these are not feasible, we would like as many parents as possible to have the option of car-sharing. Many families already make their own informal arrangements but formal car-sharing schemes for school journeys are only just starting to be developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.244W.6/20">Since October 2003, the focus has been on promoting school travel plans through the Travel to School Initiative. This is a joint project with the Department for Education and Skills. A budget of &pound;50 million has been allocated for the two years up to March 2006. The aim is for every school in England to have a travel plan by the end of the decade and through this to boost walking, cycling and bus use. The funding is being used to support around 250 local-authority based school travel advisers to assist schools with developing their plans. There are also capital grants for schools with approved travel plans to pay for infrastructure such as improved cycle storage facilities. This is typically &pound;5,000 for a junior school and &pound;10,000 for a senior. &pound;14 million was spent on these capital grants in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;20 million is expected for this and each subsequent year up to and including 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.247W.0/1">Three sections of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane are presently in operation. In Leeds two lengths totalling 1.5 km have been installed along a 2 km stretch of the A647 Stanningley Road. South Gloucestershire council has three sections of HOV lane on the A4174 Avon Ring Road totalling 1.79 km. North Somerset council has a 1.425 km length of HOV lane on the A370 Long Ashton Bypass.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.0/2">Leeds city council plans to include HOV lane operation on the East Leeds Link. South Gloucestershire council plans a further 220 metre length for the A4174 and North Somerset council is considering an HOV lane on the A369 as part of a showcase bus route. I understand a number of other local authorities are also considering HOV lanes.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.0/3">In addition the Highways Agency has recently carried out a study that assessed the feasibility of introducing HOV lanes on sections of the motorway network. As a result of this study it is planned to introduce an HOV lane in both directions on the M1 junctions 7&ndash;10 when that section of motorway is widened in 2008. If this scheme proves successful the HOV lane could be extended as far as junction 13 (Milton Keynes) when that section of motorway is widened in 2011. The length of HOV lane to be provided between junction 7&ndash;10 is approximately 12.5 km in both directions. If the HOV is extended to junction 13 the total length will be about 36.25 km in both directions.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.0/4">The Agency is also looking into the feasibility of introducing HOV lanes on other sections of the motorway network. Locations being actively considered include sections of the M25 to be widened, M61 junctions 6&ndash;3 on the approach to Manchester and M62 junctions 25&ndash;27 on the approach to Leeds. This feasibility work is yet to conclude.</p>

	<p pid="a.249W.12/1">The reduced vehicle delay at a puffin crossing is primarily a result of cancelling the call for a pedestrian stage when no pedestrians are waiting. This frequently occurs when pedestrians see a gap in the traffic after pressing the call button. The benefit published in the Transport Research Laboratory study, (TRL Research Report 364), was derived from observations at sites where the call cancelling facility was trialled.</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.12/2">Puffin crossings were developed to address the problems that pedestrians were encountering in using traditional signalled controlled crossings, including pelicans. We are currently carrying out further research to assess the operation of conversions from pelicans to puffins, including the behaviour and perception of pedestrians.</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.12/3">The Department issued guidance to practitioners in the form of Local Transport Notes 1/95 The Assessment of Pedestrian Crossings&quot; and 2/95&mdash;&quot;Design of Pedestrian Crossings&quot;. These include information about both pelican and puffin crossings. They do not recommend one against the other, although they do say that it is intended that the puffin operational cycle will become the standard form of pedestrian crossing at all types of crossings.</p>

	<p pid="a.250W.5/1">The 10-year plan for transport included an illustration of the delivery programme possible by 2010&ndash;11, given the levels of investment set out in the plan. Included in the illustration was the installation of quieter surfacing on over 60 per cent. of the strategic road network. The Highways Agency had surfaced approximately 27 per cent. of the network with quieter surfacing by the end of March 2005 and is currently on target to resurface 60 per cent. by the end of March 2011.</p>

The railway industry has a duty under health and safety legislation to ensure that risks to those on or near railway lines are reduced. The location of whistleboards is the responsibility of Network Rail, who apply the requirements laid down by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.5/2">Train drivers are required to sound train horns where whistleboards are located: on the approaches to footpath crossings and at unprotected crossings, in order to alert pedestrians to approaching trains. This is an important safeguard for those using footpath and level crossings, as there have been a number of fatal accidents at such locations.</p>

	<p pid="a.257W.2/1">In the 12 months to the end of March 2005 DVLA successfully prosecuted 189,418 cases in court for vehicle excise duty (VED) evasion. DVLA was unsuccessful in 3,400 cases. A breakdown of why these cases were unsuccessful is not available but the main reason is likely to be that VED was paid after the summons had been issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.2/2">DVLA asks for a minimum of &pound;35 to cover the costs of the whole procedure from initiation of enforcement proceedings to attendance in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.2/3">The agency makes every effort to avoid court action. Initial action against VED evaders is taken through the offer of an out of court settlement which offers the offender the opportunity to settle the matter without recourse to court proceedings. Around 27 per cent. of evaders make use of this procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/20">5. It is assumed that the full rate of basic State Pension is increased to the level of the individual guarantee credit in 2005&ndash;06 and is increased in line with earnings. Category B pension paid to married women and basic State Pension paid to people entitled to less than the full rate of basic State Pension are increased by the same proportion.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/24">Under this proposal the pensioners already in receipt of pension credit would be no better off and a substantial number of pensioners would be worse off.

	<p pid="a.263W.8/2">No housing benefit or council tax benefit assessments need to be revisited solely because of an incorrect tax credit award. Both housing benefit and council tax benefit take into account the actual amount of tax credit in payment at the time. This means that when someone is getting a higher amount of tax credit than they are due, they will receive less housing benefit or council tax benefit. However, when the tax credit is reduced on account of an earlier overpayment, the individual will receive a higher amount of housing benefit or council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.263W.8/3">This is easier for local authorities to administer and means that individuals receive, overall, the right amount of money. There should be no cost implications to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.271W.11/1">The general duty to promote disability set out in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 will place positive, proactive responsibilities on public authorities to work towards a more equal society by mainstreaming disability equality into the way in which they carry out their functions. This includes local authorities and Government Departments (including the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister). The general duty will come into force in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.271W.11/2">The 2005 Act also enables Ministers to impose specific duties on public bodies such as local authorities. The purpose of imposing specific duties is to assist these public bodies to comply with the general duty to promote equality. Such duties might include the publishing of Disability Equality Scheme, or the monitoring of various indicators, particularly in relation to employment of disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.271W.11/3">It will be the responsibility of each public authority to ensure that it is acting in compliance with its statutory duties. If the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) is satisfied that a public authority is not complying with its specific duties, it will be able to serve a compliance notice. This would require the authority to comply with its duties and inform the DRC of the measures it has taken. If necessary the DRC could ask the county court or sheriff court to order the authority to comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.271W.11/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will publish a Disability Equality Scheme by December 2006, which will outline how the Office will meet its legal responsibilities.</p>

We want to ensure that local authority employees have a stable, strong pension scheme in which they have confidence.

In the last financial year we ran seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter-Narcotics Police; supported five major seizures of opiates; provided a mobile forensic laboratory; and helped to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.</p>

In addition, as we made clear in the five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, Controlling our Borders: Making migration work for Britain&quot; which was published in February 2005 [Cm 6472], we are planning to introduce faster, tightly-managed processes for all new asylum claimants. Existing detained processes will continue alongside new, faster, non-detained processes which are currently being developed and will be implemented in phases which will include tight case-management as a specific feature.</p>

	<p pid="a.298W.8/1">The Task Force on Child Protection on the internet was established in March 2001 in response to concerns about the possible risks to children after a number of serious cases where children had been groomed&quot; via the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.8/2">The work of the Task Force have focused on the needs of children and in particular teenagers, under the age of consent, who are considered to be most at risk from paedophile grooming&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.8/3">Arising out of its work, we introduced legislation to tackle the sexual grooming of children under 16 both online and offline in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Section 15 of the Act makes it an offence for a person aged 18 or over to meet intentionally, or to travel with the intention of meeting, a child under the age of 16 in any part of the world, if he has not met or communicated with that child on at least two prior occasions, and intends to commit a sexual offence against that child either at the time of the meeting or on a subsequent occasion. The offence has a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.8/4">To cover the kind of behaviour which might precede a meeting, and enable the police to take action at an earlier stage, Sections 123 to 129 of the Act provide for a new civil preventative order, the Risk of Sexual Harm Order (RSHO). The police can apply for this civil order against any person aged 18 or over who is thought to pose a sexual risk to children under 16, provided that on at least two occasions, the defendant has done one of the acts listed. The acts include, among other things, communicating with a child, where any part of the communication is sexual. The minimum duration of an order is two years. Breach of an order, without reasonable excuse, is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty on indictment of five years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.8/5">The work of the Task Force has also extended to four national awareness campaigns since 2001 at a cost of over &pound;3 million. These campaigns, carried out through cinema, radio and online advertising, have highlighted the measures that can be taken to promote safety online, and the new risks posed by emerging technology. In addition, over 1.5 million copies of a leaflet for parents called Keeping your Child Safe on the Internet&quot; have been distributed to schools in conjunction with the campaign. The Government have also provided online advice for children, parents and carers, in particular at <a href="http://www.thinkuknow.co.uk">www.thinkuknow.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.parentscentre.gov.uk">www.parentscentre.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="a.300W.11/2">Police forces and other law enforcement agencies are responsible for providing witness protection and they make full use of measures such as relocation and identity changes where the risk to the safety of a witness is serious or life threatening.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.11/3">The provisions we have introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Policing Act 2005 will greatly support this work. They provide an additional safeguard in the form of two new offences of disclosing information about protected witnesses or protection arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.11/4">Law enforcement agencies believe that the legislation will also assist them in a number of other ways, most importantly in placing a statutory duty on public and private bodies to assist protection officers in setting up protection arrangements. This will overcome many of the difficulties they face in obtaining the cooperation of such organisations. The provisions will also help programmes run more effectively by exempting protected witnesses who have had an identity change from criminal or civil liability in respect of failure to declare their original identities when asked to do so by these organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.11/5">We also provide more practical support to protection officers through the Witness Mobility Service, which has helped speed up the completion of witness protection arrangements and ensure that witnesses are moved to a place of safety as quickly as possible. We are planning to expand on this service through the establishment of a central services unit which will provide law enforcement agencies with other essential witness protection needs. Work is now under way to set up the unit, which we hope will be operational by spring 2006.</p>

The report's main conclusion, which we accepted, was that consumers need better information to make properly informed choices about which dentists and treatments will best meet their needs. We have been working with the General Dental Council (GDC) on implementation of the report's recommendations. The GDC has just published a new version of its ethical guidance, Standards for Dental Professionals&quot;, which includes the requirement that dentists give full information on proposed treatments and possible costs. In addition, the Dentists Act 1984 Amendment Order 2005, which was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May</phrase>, includes a power for the GDC to establish a new private complaints system to investigate and resolve complaints from patients who have received private dental treatment including instances where patients have not been given a well-informed choice between national health service and private treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.3/3">The level of diagnosis of hepatitis C will depend upon the number of individuals at risk of infection who are tested. In many cases, particularly those who injected drugs in the past, this will depend upon their coming forward. The recent and on-going awareness campaign aims to increase knowledge of hepatitis C among the public and particularly those who may have been exposed to the virus. Those at risk can then make informed decisions about whether to seek testing. Infected individuals can be referred for further specialist advice and treatment where indicated. There are currently no plans to set standards for the levels of diagnosis of hepatitis C, but progress will be monitored from the total number of laboratory-confirmed reports of hepatitis C infection collected by the Health Protection Agency.</p>

Last November, the ACP considered a report produced by its medical and toxicology panel on the possible links between pesticides and Parkinson's disease.

	<p pid="a.312W.8/1">There are no plans to extend the scope of the current welfare food scheme tokens or the new healthy start vouchers to include soya based milk products. Expert advice from the committee on medical aspects of food policy concludes that soya milk is not as nutritionally adequate for infants and young children as cow's milk.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.8/2">This is because soya based milk products are lower in energy than cow's milk, lack sufficient amounts of several vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc and are particularly low in calcium unless fortified.</p>

	<p pid="a.316W.5/1">The Department for Social Development's fuel poverty strategy which was launched last year sets stringent targets for the eradication of fuel poverty in vulnerable households and all social houses by 2010, and in non-vulnerable households by 2016. The Strategy is underpinned by a wide range of measures and programmes which both directly and indirectly tackle fuel poverty including the Warm Homes Scheme, winter fuel payments, cold weather payments and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive's (NIHE) heating replacement programme. A Fuel Poverty Advisory Group and an Interdepartmental Group on Fuel Poverty have been established to monitor and review the fuel poverty strategy and ensure a partnership approach to tackling fuel poverty.</p>

In addition the table shows those properties for which longer term use has still to be decided, because they are located in areas where there has been civil disturbance. Some of these may need repairs and may eventually come back into use. Also shown are those properties being used for decanting purposes and on which decisions on future use have still to be made.

	<p pid="a.324W.3/1">The Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Strategy, published in March 2005, sets out the long term vision for the use of ICT in the HPSS. It outlines a framework of activities to develop ICT in support of service modernisation. The HPSS ICT Programme, developed to deliver the HPSS ICT Strategy, was formally launched in March 2005. This programme encompasses the projects and activities required to develop and roll out new and enhanced ICT systems and support structures over a 10 year period, focusing on new and improved systems for electronic care records, electronic care communications and electronic information.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.3/2">Among the many activities identified, the HPSS ICT Programme aims to establish an electronic integrated record for each individual using community services by 2008, with electronic care records in use across the whole of the HPSS by 2010. Also by 2010, technology will be available to care professionals at the point of need, whether at remote locations or in clinics, hospitals or health centres. The programme will also introduce electronic transfer of pathology results and digital imaging which will enable early diagnosis. Electronic referral and booking systems as well as electronic prescribing will give patients more choice and convenience.</p>

A patient may be seen by consultants from general medicine, chemical pathology, dermatology or a combination of these as appropriate. In addition, the medical genetics service can offer appropriate genetic advice and gene testing.</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.6/1">The Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) within the Cabinet Office is the Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament, and responsible for the publication of Acts of Parliament. HMSO has considered the publication of Acts prior to 1988, which is the earliest date when these were available electronically, but has decided not to do so as many have been heavily amended and to publish them in their original form would be misleading for many users. The Government are, however, taking forward development of a Statue Law Database which will contain the fully revised and updated text of all legislation from 1275. It is expected that this will be made available to the general public during 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.331W.2/1">We welcome the appointment, in May 2005, of Narmin Othman as the new Minister of the Environment for Iraq. The Ministry was created under the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003. Iraq faces many environmental challenges following the neglect and abuse inflicted by Saddam Hussein's regime. Getting an up to date Environmental Law on the statute books is an environmental priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.2/2">The UK Government are working closely with the Government of Iraq to develop the principles of good governance in the oil sector. In January and February this year the Tigris was polluted by oil slicks emanating from sabotaged pipelines. Booms were successfully deployed to prevent contamination of drinking water plants along the river. Oil pollution is also evident in the marshland and desert areas around Basra, particularly where saboteurs breached pipelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.2/3">We are aware of reports of people in the area of the Al Tuwaitha nuclear facility having looted drums and containers, emptied low-enriched uranium from them, and taken the containers off to use for water storage. Separate reports of children playing with the uranium powder on the site have also been made, but we have seen no confirmation of these. The site has now been secured, and the radio-active material there returned to safe storage. We are not aware of any further looting taking place, and much of the remaining material was subsequently removed from Iraq by US experts, with the consent of the Iraqi Interim Government and keeping the IAEA informed. Initial indications are that there was little or no immediate radiation sickness evident in the population, but there might well be longer term health risks to people who were exposed to radiation. An inter-agency task force was set up in Baghdad in October 2004 to take forward action on recovering radio-active material that has been taken from the site, and monitor the long-term health of people at risk of exposure to radiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.2/4">We have no information on chemical pollution in Iraq. However, disposal of chemical and hazardous waste is a significant problem. The US embassy estimates that there may be 5,000 chemical waste sites across Iraq which fail basic international environmental standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.331W.2/5">The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has a $5 million programme in Iraq aimed at capacity building and in particular to train staff to assess the extent of environmental hazards. The Department for International Development has contributed &pound;717,000 towards UNEP's work on post-conflict environmental assessment and to support the Environment Ministry.</p>

It has not yet been possible to collect data on staff applying for and attending training courses broken down by ethnicity. However, we are working to establish a mechanism to monitor training using the FCO's information management system, Prism. We have asked the development team for a standard report to be available on Prism which will enable ethnicity data to be taken from staff records for all training courses attended.

	<p pid="a.335W.6/1">The Government continue to support the international community's efforts to support the African Union mission in Darfur, notably through the UN, NATO and the EU. All these organisations have an important and complementary role to play in providing support to the work of the AU. What matters is that this support is provided through the most effective means, is in line with African Union requirements, and respects African ownership, through close co-operation between the supporting bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.6/2">NATO will support the AU mission through provision of airlift and the training of AU personnel. Individual contributions of airlift under the auspices of NATO will be clarified following a joint NATO/EU Donor Airlift Nation Movement Planning Conference on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>. The provision of training will be from within NATO's command structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.6/3">The EU has supported the AU mission since its inception: the European Commission has allocated &euro;92 million and provided logistical and planning support. The EU is now in the process of bringing together a further consolidated offer of assistance to support both the military and police aspects of the AU mission, including provision of equipment and assets, planning and technical assistance, and training. It is supporting the development of a police unit within the AU. Some member states also want to provide their airlift support under EU auspices.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.6/4">The African Union is leading the operation and managing offers of assistance. There is no operational command and control role for either the EU or NATO. As the EU's support is a co-ordinated civil-military effort, the Government do not believe that it can be co-ordinated using NATO's military headquarters at Mons. However, both organisations are working closely together to co-ordinate their military offers, including through joint support to a single AU co-ordination cell for airlift at Addis Ababa.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.6/5">On <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase> the Secretary of State for International Development announced that the UK will increase its contribution to the expansion of the AU mission to &pound;19 million. This brings the UK Government's total contribution to the AU mission since its inception to almost &pound;32 million. The Ministry of Defence has contributed to this support, which includes the purchase of vehicles, training for military observers, advice on logistics, and airlift. As part of the support to the expansion of the AU mission, the Ministry of Defence is offering two logistic planners within the EU's support to the AU's Joint Logistic Operation Centre at El Fashir, Sudan; and a mobile air movements team of up to 15 people to NATO if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.335W.6/6">European countries including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey have all pledged financial assistance and/or declared other resources available for operations in Darfur. Many of these offers are still being finalised and may be made through the EU or NATO depending on the nature of the offer.</p>

Current work is focused on experimentation under the Joint UAV Experimentation Programme (JUEP) to inform the development of user requirements and possible future programmes, including maritime applications.

	<p pid="a.343W.2/1">Pension tax simplification replaces the numerous existing tax regimes with a universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings providing greater flexibility to some 15 million pension savers.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/2">Currently most pension funds may invest in residential property, and many do. Under the new simplified regime small self-administered schemes (SSASs) and self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) may invest in residential property from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. Around 200,000 people, compared to over 15 million pension scheme members, hold these specialist pension vehicles. Creating a single set of allowable investments across all pension schemes fits the requirement to create a single regime for tax privileged pension saving and corrects an existing distortion by giving investors greater choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.2/3">The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) Simplifying the Taxation of Pensions&quot; published in April 2004, which can be found at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/simplifying-pensions.pdf">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/simplifying-pensions.pdf</a> set out an assessment of the potential impact of the whole pensions simplification package, including the changes to the lifetime allowance and ages at which pensions can be taken, together with allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs. These elements cannot easily be separated and therefore the RIA estimates the overall cost of the pensions simplification package to the Exchequer at around &pound;&frac14; billion within four years. Paragraphs 55 and 56 deal specifically with the potential consequences of allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs.</p>

	<p pid="a.343W.5/2">Projected figures for the in year accrual of liabilities for the main unfunded pension schemes to 2007&ndash;08, based on the current normal pension age, are published in the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.5/3">The net liabilities of funded pension schemes in the wider public sector to 2015 will be dependent on the performance of the individual pension funds. Central Government does not hold comprehensive information on, or estimates of the future performance of, these individual funds.</p>

The Government have delivered macro-economic stability that allows investors in venture capital to invest with confidence, and a low-tax environment, including an effective Capital Gains Tax rate of 10 per cent. on business assets held for at least two years, which allows them to keep more of the reward from successful investments.</p>

Overall around 16 per cent. of adults had literacy skills below Level 1 and 47 per cent. had numeracy skills below this level.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.3/1">This Government are fully committed to improving the performance of African-Caribbean boys in our schools and narrowing achievement gaps for all underachieving minority ethnic pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.3/2">Following the Aiming High: Raising the Achievement of Minority Ethnic Pupils consultation, the Government announced a national strategy in November 2003. The strategy aims to: focus mainstream school improvement programmes and targeted activity on identifying and addressing underachievement; increasing accountability, including through the publication of achievement data; and supporting the school workforce to be able to meet the needs of minority ethnic pupils more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.3/3">The strategy included a pilot national project focused on raising the achievement of African-Caribbean young people, and boys in particular. This project was developed following detailed assessment of performance data for African-Caribbean pupils. The experience of delivering this project is currently informing the roll out of a national programme to support black pupils in all our schools across both primary and secondary education.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.3/4">More widely my officials routinely use data, including ethnicity data, to support the development of policy and initiatives. In order to ensure that parents and other interested parties are kept informed of our progress in narrowing achievement gaps, my Department publishes the ethnicity performance data on an annual basis.

	<p pid="a.356W.5/1">The Education Act 2002 embeds the Foundation Stage as part of the National Curriculum and supports our aim of giving all children a better start to school life. This will support staff in equipping children in their early years with the key skills they need for their learning journey and will feed through to higher educational attainment, supporting standards and improved behaviour within schools and outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/2">In order to meet children's diverse needs, and help all children make the best possible progress, practitioners should provide a safe and supportive learning environment, free from harassment, in which the contribution of all children is valued and where racial, religious, disability and gender stereotypes are challenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/3">'Personal, social and emotional development' is part of the Foundation Stage Curriculum. This includes 'developing respect for others, social competence and a positive disposition to learn'. Children learn to understand what is right, what is wrong and why; and to consider the consequences of their words and actions for themselves and others. Guidance to practitioners includes involving children in agreeing codes of behaviour and taking responsibility for their implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/4">To support this the Department has appointed the Institute of Psychology, King's College London to develop a training programme on young children's personal social and emotional development to support the Birth to Three Matters and Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/5">The materials will address various aspects of children's personal social and emotional development and its promotion, implications for practice and multi agency-working. The emphasis will be on producing effective, user friendly, quality materials setting out key messages. Through these key messages children will develop respect for others, social competence and a positive disposition to learn.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/6">In June 2005, the DfES is making available to all primary schools curriculum materials to help reduce bullying. They include age related materials for pupils in Foundation Stage, KS1 and KS2, and are part of the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/7">All primary schools also have access to the DfES anti bullying resource pack for schools 'Don't Suffer in Silence', which provides a number of anti-bullying strategies including co-operative group work, circle time, circle of friends, all of which are suitable for use with infant age children.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/8">Head teachers, staff and learners from various primary schools have been involved in the Make the Difference conferences sharing effective practice from their own schools with others.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.5/9">We are currently developing advice for schools on Countering Racist Bullying, which will cover issues for all children from foundation stage upwards.</p>

	<p pid="a.358W.8/1">The thrust of the workforce reform agenda&mdash;which is supported by school workforce unions and employers, as well as by Government&mdash;are to encourage schools to make the most effective use of all their resources. In many cases, using cover staff rather than supply teachers will be the best option&mdash;in terms of educational benefit as well as value for money. But deployment will depend on a number of factors, including how much short term absence&mdash;much of which is unforeseeable&mdash;a school needs to cover.</p>

	<p pid="a.359W.3/1">It is difficult to estimate precisely the number of EU students that may be eligible for higher education maintenance support because of the uncertainty involved in projecting future numbers of EU students and the limited data available centrally on the number of years people in this group may have been resident in the UK. An EU student will still need to satisfy the requirement of three years residence in the UK prior to the start of his or her course in order to be eligible for maintenance support. Based on the limited data available, we estimate that around 6,000 full time EU students studying in English institutions could in principle be eligible for maintenance support in Academic Year 2006/07 as a result of changes we have made to regulations in the light of the ECJ ruling.</p>

	<p pid="a.361W.5/1">The Leadership Group on Behaviour and Discipline, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-20">20 May</phrase>, will advise the Government on how effective school discipline reaches every classroom, how to improve parental responsibility for their children's behaviour and deliver a culture of respect in all schools. Chaired by Sir Alan Steer of the Seven Kings High School in Ilford, the group has a membership of heads and teachers with a proven track record in managing behaviour. Six of these have been nominated by teacher unions and professional associations&mdash;ATL, NAHT, NAS/UWT, NUT, PAT and SHA. The Leadership Group is due to report by the end of October to a ministerial group on behaviour and attendance. The Ministerial Group comprises general secretaries of those six organisations, a representative from Unison, Ofsted, local authorities and governors, including a parent governor. The ministerial group's role will be to advise Ministers on the development and implementation of behaviour and attendance policies and to play an active part in promoting and helping to embed the most effective practice in improving behaviour and attendance across all schools. This includes receiving the report of the Leadership Group. I intend to make available the report of the leadership group, once my Ministerial Group has had an opportunity to consider its findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.5/2">With the creation of the two new groups, and pending the report of the leadership group, we have suspended meetings of the Improving Behaviour and Attendance Programme (IBAP) reference group. The IBAP reference group has played a valuable role since its creation in September 2002. Its functions have been to review and help develop strategy, including the effect and practicalities of its implementation; to comment on guidance and other materials that have been made available to schools and LEAs; and to provide a forum for partners to discuss behaviour and attendance issues. Following the decision to suspend its meetings, its overall strategic role and its role as a discussion forum will be taken forward by the new Ministerial Group. No decisions have yet been taken on its future role.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.5/3">The IBAP reference group did not receive any specific funding, apart from costs of its meetings. It is envisaged that similar arrangements will apply to the two new groups. As the Leadership Group comprises serving heads and teachers, we are providing supply cover costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.364W.6/5" class="indent">Otley College's funding allocation for adult learners in 2005&ndash;06 has been capped at the 2004&ndash;05 level to support growth in funding for 16&ndash;18 learners.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.6/6" class="indent">The IT Centre offers free, low level IT courses mainly to adults, that are funded entirely from the college's funding allocation from the LSC. This provision is not a priority for the LSC and the college, having reviewed its adult provision, has decided to close the Centre because it is not economically viable. In making this decision the college was aware that suitable alternative provision was available in Colchester. Colchester has a large FE college, a large adult community college and numerous private providers that offer similar IT courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.6/7" class="indent">In order to achieve Government targets for 2005&ndash;06 LSC funding has been focused on priorities which has reduced the funding available for non-priority adult provision such as that offered at the IT Centre in Colchester. The scale of reduction in adult provision is likely to be greater than anticipated due to our need to support unprecedented numbers of young people in FE provision, and the LSC is currently reviewing planning arrangements and modelling funding implications to assist college plans for 2006&ndash;07.</p>

Where BSF proposals address the 14&ndash;19 agenda in association with a local further education college, the LSC will consider this when determining applications to upgrade further education provision, where this is deemed to be necessary as part of the overall local strategy. In order to support the needs of further education colleges, the Chancellor's March 2005 Budget statement included additional resources for the sector of &pound;100 million and &pound;250 million in 2008&ndash;09 and 2009&ndash;10 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.374W.0/1">This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for students studying on a part-time basis. In the current academic year, a grant of up to &pound;575 for fees and a course grant of up to &pound;250 are available for students from the poorest backgrounds. The grants are means-tested in order to target funding most effectively at those from disadvantaged backgrounds. There is no age limit on the fee grant or the course grant, ensuring that part-time students have access to funding regardless of age.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.0/2">In 2005/06 we are improving the fee grant arrangements by linking the maximum fee grant available to the intensity at which the student is studying. For example, for a student studying at 75 per cent. or more of the full-time equivalent course a fee grant of up to &pound;885 will be available.</p>
