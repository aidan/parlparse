This figure reflects departmental capital accounting policy which is to capitalise all IT equipment if the useful life of the equipment is greater than one year and the cost, including VAT, is greater than &#163;1,000. Figures relating to expenditure by the Bloody Sunday Inquiry are available on the Northern Ireland Office website:</p>

Some consumption will likely be shifted from one type of good to another, or from one time period to another. The Government continue to monitor all relevant factors from a range of sources to inform their assessment of the UK economy.</p>

The new accounts, potentially referred to as Junior ISAs, will offer parents a simple and tax-free way to save for their child's future, while also saving over &#163;500 million that would have been spent each year on Child Trust Funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.9/3">The Government are working closely with stakeholders to finalise the design of the accounts, and intends for them to be available by autumn 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.9/4">This work includes exploring how to ensure that Junior ISAs are accessible to looked after children, who are among the most disadvantaged groups of young people in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.9/5">In particular, as I said at the Report stage of the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-22">22 November 2010</phrase>, I am carefully considering proposals that have been made for the Government to open and contribute to Junior ISA accounts for looked after children.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.9/6">The Government have received no further representations on this matter since <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November 2010</phrase>.</p>

The Commission sent letters to 1,603 hostels and 835 charities and homeless organisations that work with homeless people to encourage them to order this poster, along with other Commission resources that would be useful in engaging with this group. The letter also gave instructions for running a workshop on registration and voting.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.3/1">We continue to authorise the use animals for the potency testing of botulinum toxin products as international and United Kingdom regulations relating to the safety and efficacy of medicines require that they are tested for potency. This form of testing is kept under regular review and only licensed where there is no alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/2">The Home Office currently license the use of animals for the testing of material produced in the United Kingdom for medicinal use because, at present, non-animal alternatives have yet to be validated to the standard required for use by the relevant laboratories. There is a wide variation in batch-to-batch potency which requires that each batch should be checked and each different medicine requires a unique development, validation and regulatory acceptance for any proposed alternative test. There is no agreed measurable unit of potency for botulinum toxin, it can only be assessed as a function of its biological effect on a living organism.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/3">We believe that our licensing is consistent with the requirement of section 5(5)(a) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 that licence authorities may only be granted where we are satisfied that the purpose of the programme to be specified in the licence cannot be achieved satisfactorily by any other reasonably practicable method not entailing the use of animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/4">The Home Office and all others, including the laboratories and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, concerned with conducting and regulating such testing are committed to using alternatives to animals as soon as it becomes practicable to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.383W.5/1">Prompt payment is an important issue, particularly to small and medium enterprises, where cash flow is critical for business survival. My own Department is a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code for this reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.5/2">I understand that, during 2009, the previous Government considered taking measures to encourage local authorities to sign up to the Prompt Payment Code. This did not happen as it was deemed an unfunded additional financial burden. Instead the then Secretary of State wrote to Margaret Eaton, Chairman of the Local Government Association to encourage local authorities to improve their already strong track record on payments to suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.387W.5/1">There is one directive currently pending transition into domestic legislation which is Directive 2010/53/EU which sets minimum standards across the European Union for the quality and safety of organs intended for transplantation. It entered into force in August 2010 and national governments have two years to transpose it into national legislation. The directive requires EU member states to set up a competent authority or authorities responsible for maintaining quality and safety standards for organs intended for transplantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.5/2">Implementation is likely to involve some costs-for example, the establishment of a competent authority; establishment of a new authorisation system (including the compliance costs of those required to register); and introduction of a formal reporting system for serious adverse events and reactions. The estimates of these costs vary considerably depending on the regulatory model used across the whole of the United Kingdom, but may be between &#163;0.5 million and &#163;2 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="a.388W.2/1">We are evaluating the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme in England through a formative evaluation of implementation in the first 10 sites, conducted by Birkbeck college, university of London; and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in 18 sites, led by the South East Wales Trials Unit at the School of Medicine, Cardiff university. The RCT will test the impact of FNP compared with other services on pregnancy and birth outcomes, on child health and development and on parental life course; and it will also assess costs, through an economic evaluation. This is due to report in 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.2/2">Reports of findings from the first two years of the Birkbeck evaluation were published in 2008 and 2009. This early evidence is promising, suggesting that the programme can be delivered well in England, that take up is also good amongst the most disadvantaged, teenage parents, including fathers, who we know often distrust services, with 87% of mothers who are offered FNP enrolling on it. In addition, mothers are reducing smoking in pregnancy, a high proportion are initiating breastfeeding, mothers are coping better with pregnancy, labour and parenthood and are more confident as parents. A report of the toddlerhood phase of FNP will be published shortly, and a full report of all three years will be published by spring 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.2/3">In addition, over 30 years of United States research suggests positive outcomes in the short, medium and long-term for both mothers and children, together with substantial cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.2/4">On the basis of this learning the Government have committed to double the number of families receiving the Family Nurse Partnership programme by 2015. Over 6,000 families have benefitted from FNP to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.390W.5/1">Since April 2006, commissioning responsibility for prison health services has been fully devolved to the national health service. Palliative care for prisoners is therefore provided according to both local circumstance and the needs of the individual prisoner. Local health services work with the prison to provide care based on NHS models of best practice following a thorough risk assessment. This may involve the prisoner being returned to the community during the last months of their life or being cared for through local adaptions to the prison environment. The response will vary according to security issues and the wishes of the prisoner.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/2">Prison Service Order 3050 sets out the policy for prisoners who require end of life care. A copy has been placed in the Library. The Department and the National Offender Management Service shortly expect to publish guidance for managing end of life for prisons, based on current best practice in both the community and prison environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.394W.2/1">The housing benefit and council tax benefit regulations prescribe key elements that must be included in the decision notifications that local authorities send to claimants when informing them about their benefit entitlement. Claimants need this information so that they can work out how their benefit awards have been calculated and confirm that their circumstances have correctly been taken into account. There are no current plans to amend the regulations, but we keep this under review and will continue to consider feedback from local authorities, claimants and representative organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.2/2">Although certain information must be included in decision notifications, local authorities have the discretion to decide how best to present it, and to design letters that communicate as clearly as possible what the claimant needs to know. To help with this, officials in my Department have been working with representatives of several local authorities to explore ways of making decision notifications easier to understand.</p>

However, a further 196,000 JSA leavers (38% of all off-flows aged 50 years and over) were categorised as: ceased claiming; failed to sign; or information about them is unknown.

	<p pid="a.400W.2/1">The Government are committed to tackling youth unemployment. We aim to have the new Work Programme in place nationally by the summer of 2011. This will offer integrated employment support to young people helping them move into sustained employment rather than temporary jobs. Young people aged 18-24 will be referred to the Work Programme from nine months. Prior to the Work Programme we will be giving Jobcentre Plus advisers more flexibility to work with young people to make the transition into employment. This journey might include, for example, work experience, pre-apprenticeship training, an apprenticeship, a further education course or other training.</p>
	<p pid="a.400W.2/2">Until the Work Programme is introduced, young people will continue to have access to the existing range of services. Young unemployed people registering with Jobcentre Plus have access to a named personal adviser from the first day of their claim. The personal adviser works with them to create a personalised back-to-work plan. This support will continue throughout the jobseeker's spell of unemployment, as will access to the existing range of opportunities, support and advice to help them find employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.400W.2/3">In order to reduce the number of younger, 16 to 18-year-olds becoming long-term unemployed the Government want to ensure that the next generation of school leavers are equipped for the future, raising attainment for all children and closing the gap between the richest and poorest. We are considering how best to provide access for young people to high quality careers education which will help them navigate the complex choices on offer to them about learning, careers and wider lifestyle options.</p>

For example, households previously receiving tax credits only will see a small increase in their marginal deduction rate from 73% to around 76%. In addition, because universal credit allows low-earning households to keep more of their earnings, some households who previously received no state support will now do so. As a consequence they will experience a higher marginal deduction rate than they otherwise would have done but they will be better off financially.</p>

	<p pid="a.404W.2/1">The total economic impact of traffic delay is measured by the Department's transport appraisal tool QUADRO, which costs this at &#163;11.28 per vehicle hour delay (based on 2002 prices). However, we do not estimate the specific costs of each individual road closure due to the complexity of the assessment required, for example, the mix of trip purposes, vehicle types and number of occupants in each vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.2/2">The financial effects to the economy would very much depend on the day, time of day and the number of vehicles affected, as well as the effectiveness of diversion routes.</p>

	<p pid="a.406W.9/2">The resulting junction is similar to those on motorways and results in improved journey times, allowing the local traffic to cross the main trunk road or join using a slip road. Replacing these single level roundabouts with grade separated junctions has reduced congestion, queuing and delays in these areas and improved the safety record.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.9/3">Three of the junctions targeted as part of this scheme are between Newark and Peterborough, Gonerby Moor (north of Grantham), Colsterworth North and South (classified as a single junction for the purposes of the scheme) and Carpenter's Wood.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.9/4">The scheme started in 2006 and completed in 2009. The total value was &#163;95 million. As a result of this planned major improvement, no additional funding was bid for to improve traffic flows during this period.</p>

	<p pid="a.411W.2/2">With regard to the specific contract between the Cabinet Office and DLA Piper, the legal firm which employs the Deputy Prime Minister's wife, Miriam Gonz&#225;lez Dur&#225;ntez, the Deputy Prime Minister had no involvement in the award of this contract in 2008 under the last Government. The Deputy Prime Minister is a Minister in the Cabinet Office not the Minister for the Cabinet Office and he has had no involvement in the award or management of Cabinet Office contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/3">Furthermore, the Deputy Prime Minister and Miriam Gonz&#225;lez Dur&#225;ntez have been assiduous at all times in ensuring there is no conflict of interest between the Deputy Prime Minister's official responsibilities and their private interests. In accordance with the Ministerial Code, the Deputy Prime Minister, on appointment to office, provided the Cabinet Secretary with a list of his interests. At the same time, Miriam Gonz&#225;lez Dur&#225;ntez had separate discussions with the Cabinet Secretary and the Cabinet Office Director of Propriety and Ethics to ensure there was no conflict between her work and the Deputy Prime Minister's official responsibilities. Procedures have been put in place to ensure any contract between DLA Piper and the Government is insulated from Miriam Gonz&#225;lez Dur&#225;ntez's role in DLA Piper so no conflict will arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.416W.3/2"><i> </i>In his statement on the outcome of the spending review on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-10-20.949"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 949-65</phrase>, the Chancellor announced that all three and four-year-olds would continue to receive 15 hours per week of free early education, and that, through an additional investment of &#163;300 million, this would be extended to all disadvantaged two-year-olds by the end of the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/3">Further details, including on the question of how the additional &#163;300 million will be will be allocated to local authorities, will be announced in due course. However, the extension of free early education for two-year-olds will take account of the existing pilot in all 152 local authorities in England. This currently provides free early education to these children for up to 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year for around 20,000 two-year-olds drawn from the most disadvantaged families.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/4">Under the current pilot, local authorities are strongly encouraged to use only provision rated good or outstanding by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted), although they can use early years settings rated as satisfactory if the authority is satisfied that the setting is actively working towards a higher rating.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/5">For the current pilot, the Department provides funding to local authorities calculated on the basis of &#163;6.00 per hour in London and &#163;4.85 outside of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/6">Funding for early education for three and four-year-olds is allocated to local authorities through the ring-fenced Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG), but is not ring-fenced within the DSG. Local authorities in consultation with Schools Forums decide locally how best to distribute 3-16 funding across their locality, and local authorities set their own local rates of funding to early years providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/7">An analysis of the rates paid by the 71 local authorities that have already implemented their Early Years Single Funding Formula is available on the Department's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/earlyyears/fundingreform/eysff_pathfinderprogramme/">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/earlyyears/fundingreform/eysff_pathfinderprogramme/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.416W.3/9">It found that the median base rates paid to different types of provider range from &#163;3.54 to &#163;3.76 per hour. Supplements for deprivation are also paid by all authorities, and many also provide supplements for quality and flexibility.</p>

In addition, the introduction of the new National Scholarship programme, linked to the pupil premium, will also help to widen access to higher education for young people from the poorest backgrounds. We do not anticipate any impact on student choice in applying to higher education from the introduction of the enhanced discretionary funding.</p>

It also requires a declaration of ingredient origin when origin claims are made. While there will be further discussion on the details of this requirement, the text is a positive move towards improving food labelling and complements the recent work that UK industry is doing to improve origin information for the benefit of UK consumers.</p>

Agriculture needs to move away from permanent subsidy by continuing the market orientation of the industry. As the Prime Minister has made clear, the EU Budget also needs to reflect the budgetary constraints on European economies. The CAP budget must therefore fall significantly over the next Financial Perspective.</p>

	<p pid="a.429W.9/1">The Government have made a commitment to source food, subject to no overall increase in costs, meeting British or equivalent standards of production. In addition, we are developing Government Buying Standards for food and catering. We are proposing that these standards, which are mandatory for central Departments, include a range of sustainability and nutrition criteria. Our timetable to introduce these standards is March 2011 and Departments will report in June 2011 on the amount of food procured during the year April 2010 to March 2011 that meets these Government Buying Standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.432W.0/1">The proposed changes to DEFRA's public bodies will contribute modest savings. The main benefits of the Public Bodies Reform Bill proposals are to increase transparency and accountability of public bodies. Where bodies are to be reconstituted as expert committees, we do not envisage that significant financial savings will be generated.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.0/2">The 2011-12 budgets for the new committees have not yet been finalised but these will reflect the cuts agreed in the Government's spending review. The time scale for implementing the decisions announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October</phrase> will vary for each body, and depend on legislative or administrative processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-07">7 December 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/2">The Government have been very clear about the importance of widening participation and improving fair access in higher education-all those with the ability should have access to higher education irrespective of family income.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/3">The interim equality impact assessment of the reforms to higher education funding and student finance was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-29">29 November 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/i/10-1310-interim-equality-impact-assessment-he-funding-and-student-finance.pdf">http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/i/10-1310-interim-equality-impact-assessment-he-funding-and-student-finance.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/5">Department commissioned research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) which explored how changes in fees, grants and loans impact on participation. That research, which analysed the impact of the 2006-07 HE finance reforms, indicates that while a &#163;1,000 increase in fees results in a 4.4ppt decrease in university participation, this is more than offset by the increases resulting from provision of loans and grants (3.2ppt and 2.1ppt increases).</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/6">The interim EQIA does not include an assessment of the full new package of proposals that includes ending Aimhigher; introducing new access arrangements for universities wishing to charge over &#163;6,000; a new &#163;150 million National Scholarship Programme targeted on students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and a new &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium from April 2011. A full EQIA will be published in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/7">In reaching the decision to end the education maintenance allowance (EMA), the Government closely assessed the evaluation evidence and other research which indicated that EMA does not effectively target those young people who need financial support to enable them to participate in learning. The evidence suggested that around 90% of the young people who receive EMA would still have participated in learning if the scheme was not available. Data from the 2008/09 Family Resources Survey suggests that the removal of EMA will have a negligible impact on the number of children in poverty. From 2011/12, EMA will be replaced by an enhanced learner support fund that will be administered by schools and colleges themselves, targeting those young people who face a real financial barrier to participation.</p>

However, whilst graduates are eligible to take up employment as apprentices at any level, Government funding is not available to support their training.</p>

The Commissioning Green Paper to be published by the Cabinet Office shortly will aim to create a level playing field for charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises that wish to bid for public service contracts. The Government have launched a forum on the No. 10 website for SMEs to give their views on public procurement from which we will be able to take further action.</p>

We are further simplifying systems by creating a single adult skills budget, which will also rationalise data collection. Also, subject to the will of Parliament, we will remove a raft of statutory powers and duties, including the exemption of colleges judged &quot;outstanding&quot; by Ofsted to be inspected, unless their performance drops, and the removal of the requirement to seek approval from the chief executive of Skills Funding before borrowing.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.5/1">The all-age careers service will be operational from April 2012, although young people and adults will be able to start accessing new arrangements for careers guidance from September 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.5/2">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has allocated &#163;82.8 million in 2010-11 for careers guidance for adults, which will be provided by the Next Step careers service in that year. The Department for Education (DfE) has allocated &#163;466.7 million to local authorities for the Connexions service in 2010-11, through the area-based grant. Resources are not allocated separately to 'universal' and 'targeted' activities within the Connexions budget, and the Department does not collect data on local authority spend in those areas. However, we estimate that, of the total budget for Connexions in 2010-11, around &#163;200 million funds careers advice and guidance activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.5/3">Following the spending review, BIS and DfE are working through the detail of their spending settlements and are unable at this stage to confirm the funding that will be available for the all-age service in 2011-12 or 2012-13. There are 12 officials within BIS and 16 officials within DfE currently working on this policy, although some of these officials have other areas of responsibility. There are also 10 individuals in the Skills Funding Agency who devote some of their time to the development of the all-age service.</p>
