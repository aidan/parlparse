In 2002&ndash;03 a total of &pound;4.48 million was actually offered to groups, but this included some funding for groups in their third and final year of funding from a previous grant round. Groups were then required to reapply for funding at the start of each financial year. Following those applications, &pound;4.26 million was offered to groups in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;4.12 million in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.10/2">The planned level of EAF programme resources for projects relating to sustainable consumption and production is &pound;2.25 million per year for the financial years from 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. Offers of grant totalling &pound;2.25 million have been made for 2005&ndash;06, with provisional offers of &pound;2.4 million for both 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 (reflecting the likelihood of some slippage or scaling-down of projects as they develop their work plans in the first year and then reapply for funding for the second and third years).</p>

	<p pid="a.896W.5/1">The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme was reformed in 2003, as a result of which waste projects with an education component (categories C and CC) are no longer eligible for funding. Only a small proportion of that funding was used to support projects with a formal education basis. Certain environmental educational projects remain eligible for funding under the current scheme, for example in the biodiversity category. There was no direct replacement of the LTCS funding stream to support projects that might previously have been eligible. Projects with an environmental education component are supported by the Environmental Action Fund. Several other Defra programmes contribute to more informal modes of environmental education and awareness raising, for example &pound;30 million over three years has been allocated to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) for national and local waste awareness campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.5/2">Government are striving to ensure that education for sustainable development is recognised as part of the core education agenda across all education and skills sectors. The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Sustainable Development Commission have recruited a senior adviser on sustainable development to liaise effectively with non-governmental organisations and other Government Departments to develop partnerships and coordinate action to achieve the objectives of the Sustainable Development Action Plan. DfES, with Forum for the Future and professional organisations, has also set up the Sustainability Implementation Group to make it easier for colleges and universities to raise the profile of sustainability literacy in all curricula for post-16 professional education.</p>

	<p pid="a.902W.7/1">Sections 8 and 9 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 set out the procedures relating to the Funding Code. The Legal Services Commission may from time to time prepare a revised version of the code which must be subject to appropriate consultation. The Funding Code is in two parts: Part I contains the Criteria, and Part II contains the Procedures. Amendments to both Parts must be approved by the Lord Chancellor before the relevant Parliamentary process. Revised Funding Code Criteria must normally be approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament before coming into force, although the Act allows urgent amendments to come into force in certain circumstances in advance of that approval. Revised Funding Code Procedures must be laid before Parliament.</p>

This should help Iraqi agriculture, encourage private trade and remove price distortions, at the same time as ensuring that families in need are properly provided for.

Many UK communities have existing links with communities in disaster prone areas, and in such cases it makes good sense to build on that relationship by offering support to the overseas community. Where no such relationship exists, there may well be further scope for developing twinning arrangements with the aim of providing practical support. A first step for those wishing to establish such community links would be to consult the relevant UK embassies and high commissions, and UK-based community organisations of the relevant countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.3/1">DFID expects to spend &pound;25 million in Zimbabwe during 2004&ndash;05 compared with &pound;34 million in 2003&ndash;04. DFID assistance has given priority to tackling HIV and AIDS, which affects some 25 per cent. of the adult population. We also continue to provide food, seeds, fertilisers and other practical forms of relief to some 1.5 million of the poorest people in Zimbabwe through international NGOs and the UN. The Government of Zimbabwe claim there was a bumper harvest last year and have therefore sharply scaled back international food aid. This claim has been contradicted by independent surveys, UN agencies and other agencies are monitoring food needs closely.</p>

DFID recently designed a new &pound;12 million programme of work on forest governance and trade in west and central Africa. This will continue to focus on reforms in Ghana and Cameroon, where EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) partnership agreements offer the opportunity to bring EU consumer market forces into play. We are also supporting civil society strengthening and dialogue between governments, the private sector and NGOs in the Congo Basin region. Later this year we will begin a programme that supports links between the private sector in four African countries and European trade federations. Our aim is to increase the awareness of African companies to new market requirements and opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.914W.0/1">Over the past year the international community in Angola has steadily reduced food aid contributions in line with the country's decreasing humanitarian needs and increasing crop production. As most donors provide cash funding to the World Food Programme (WFP), there has been no direct link between the reduction of food aid and the new law banning the introduction of genetically modified (GM) foods. When the new law was announced in March 2004, the USA replaced a food aid shipment of 19,000 tonnes of GM maize with 14,000 tonnes of non-GM sorghum. WFP uses donor funds to buy non-GM maize, beans and other food items in the southern Africa region. WFP has sufficient food in its warehouses to help Angola's 900,000 most vulnerable people until the end of March.</p>

The World Food Programme (WFP) runs two small mills, one in Luanda and another in Lobito, which it uses to mill maize.

	<p pid="a.915W.9/1">DFID has supported a range of research examining the economic effects on developing countries of allowing free trade in agricultural products.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.9/2">This includes work on the impact of EU Dairy reform on developing countries and on Food Security, Trade and Livelihoods Links. DFID also funds the World Bank Trade Policy Development Project (TPDP) that includes analysis of agricultural liberalisation, as well as work at the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation on impacts of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) agricultural policies on developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.9/3">The general results of such research are that in the short term, costs and benefits are estimated to vary across producers and consumers and net exporters and importers. However, in the long term, developing countries will gain from freer world trade in agricultural products.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.9/4">In the short term it is estimated that developing countries that are net importers of food may see price rises when export subsidies are removed. Countries that benefit from the current distortions in global agricultural trade would also lose out (for example those that export products to the EU, receiving the same distorted higher price that EU producers receive).</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.9/5">However, in the long term producers should benefit from higher prices and take advantage of lower tariffs to increase their exports. Studies have shown that liberalisation of all OECD farm policies would boost global agricultural trade volume by over 50 per cent. Also, following liberalisation, higher exports have boosted the agricultural component of economic growth in countries like Vietnam and Uganda at 4.6 per cent. and 4.4 per cent. per year respectively. This has also led to an increase in agricultural incomes and significant reductions in rural poverty.</p>

The tables show the percentage of Official Development Assistance (ODA) going to HIPC eligible countries, and also the percentage of both ODA and Official Assistance (OA) <sup>1</sup> combined. Table 1 contains data on EU member states aid only, while Table 2 provides the same information for European Commission aid. In 2003, 56 per cent. of allocated EC ODA went to low-income countries, an increase on 51 per cent. in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.917W.3/1">We fully recognise the key contribution that civil society organisations (CSO) have to play in tackling HIV and AIDS. We are therefore actively working to promote CSO involvement in national AIDS responses. We are, for example, working to find ways to help the flow of resources from National AIDS Commissions to NGOs and CSOs. These, including faith-based organisations, have an important role in helping to meet the needs of children affected by AIDS&mdash;orphans and vulnerable children&mdash;in terms of protection, care and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.917W.3/2">At the Global Partners' Forum on orphans and vulnerable children held in Washington DC in December 2004, I announced how the UK would meet our target of spending at least &pound;150 million over the next three years to meet the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. Most of this will be spent in Africa where the impacts of AIDS on children are most severe. We will mainly be providing funds though our country programmes to support national responses. We are already providing funds through NGOs to support vulnerable children in Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In a number of countries, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe, we are supporting the rapid assessment, analysis and action plan processes which have been led by UNICEF; effective civil society involvement in their implementation is an important issue for us. We are also in the process of developing support to UNICEF to work at both country level and in the case of southern Africa at sub-regional level to develop and implement national OVC action plans. We will be working with UNICEF to ensure that civil society organisations are appropriately included in these programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.917W.3/3">An additional means of ensuring that civil society organisations are appropriately involved in responding to the needs of children affected by AIDS will be provided as we renew our agreements with key UK NGOs such as HelpAge International and Save the Children to include relevant AIDS-related work as a key objective. Out of the 18 partnership agreements we have with UK-based NGOs, 14 have specific objectives on HIV and AIDS. We will also increase our Civil Society Challenge Fund from &pound;10 million to &pound;14 million in 2005 and encourage proposals from NGOs wanting to provide support in this field.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.2/1">We will use our Presidencies of the G8 and the EU to increase action on AIDS. This will include attention to the situation of children affected by the pandemic, the orphans and vulnerable children. Committing resources to implement the Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) living in a world with HIV and AIDS&quot;, which is the global guidance developed by UNICEF and partners and widely endorsed by the international community, including DFID, is key. The framework is being translated into national OVC action plans&mdash;16 have been developed in Sub-Saharan Africa and more are being planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/2">DFID has announced a commitment to spend at least &pound;150 million over three years on OVCs (of which &pound;44 million will go to UNICEF for the development and implementation of national OVC action plans). We will be encouraging other G8 and EU member states to increase their support to national programmes. The USA has, like us, already earmarked funding and endorsed the framework as have Germany and Denmark. Canada and France also see OVCs as a priority issue, yet others have not yet followed this line.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/3">Along with other member states we are engaging in the consultation process towards a new Programme for Action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis which the EC expects to adopt in 2006. The current Programme for Action does not address orphans and vulnerable children and we will consider how best to address this gap in the forthcoming consultations. Discussions on the new EU Development Policy have only just started. The Commission has produced a Consultation on the future of EU Development Policy Issues Paper&quot;, which includes consideration of the broad themes of Development of human resources and citizens' rights' and Combating inequality and promoting social cohesion&quot;, both of which are likely to include consideration of orphans and vulnerable children. Consultations with members of the European Parliament and other member states will take place in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.3/1">A very large proportion of poor households own or work in microenterprises in the informal economy. In Africa, informal work is estimated to have accounted for almost 80 per cent. of non-agricultural employment and over 90 per cent. of new jobs. For women in Sub-Saharan Africa, the informal economy represents 92 per cent. of job opportunities outside agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.3/2">DFID has supported microenterprise development directly through financial services, skills, technology and buyers, and indirectly through an improved policy and legal operating environment for microenterprises. DFID's current commitments to microfinance development projects in Asia and Africa total approximately &pound;50 million. DFID supports country investment climate assessments, and contributed to the World Development Report 2005: A Better Investment Climate for Everyone&quot; that highlights how governments can promote investment, productivity and job growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.3/3">Most microenterprises operate informally, making collecting reliable data on their impact very difficult. However, microenterprises clearly play an important role in developing economies. The average share of the informal enterprise sector in non-agricultural official GDP varies from 27 per cent. in Northern Africa to 41 per cent. in Sub-Saharan Africa. We do know however that many poor individuals would much prefer less risky employment in larger enterprises or the public sector, than self employment in microenterprises.</p>

In April 2001, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) assumed funding responsibility for both LEA-secured adult and community learning and for former Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) funded provision. For 2003/04, the LSC introduced a new approach to collecting data on adult and community learning. The new data collection is more harmonised with other LSC funded learning (for example further education) and allows more flexible analysis. However, it is not possible to form a consistent historical series from the old and new data collections. Using the new data and methods, in 2003/04, a total of 842,000 learners were enrolled on Adult and Community Learning programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.926W.9/1">Under current unfair dismissal rules, employees of any age are entitled to make certain types of unfair dismissal claims where dismissal is for specified reasons. Employees cannot make general unfair dismissal complaints, however, if they have reached their employer's normal retirement age, or, in the absence of a normal retirement age, the age of 65. In its last consultation on the forthcoming age regulations, Age Matters&quot;, the Government proposed to abolish this upper age limit. This would mean that employees of all ages would be able to complain about any unfair dismissal. However, dismissal at a justified retirement age for the reason of retirement will potentially be a fair dismissal.</p>

	<p pid="a.927W.8/1">I have been ask to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.8/2">The Money Laundering Regulations 2003 require the banks to satisfy themselves as to the identity of their customers. It is important to foster an identification regime that does not constrain access to financial services and deals sensibly and sensitively with special groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.8/3">The UK approach to anti-money laundering controls is flexible and risk-based with controls imposed in a cost-effective and proportionate way. High-level objectives are set out in the Money Laundering Regulations but the details of implementation are left to industry-produced guidance. In the case of the banks this is the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) Guidance Notes. The JMLSG Guidance Notes provide flexibility for vulnerable groups such as the disabled, those in care homes or sheltered accommodation, and for foreign nationals. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) Money Laundering Sourcebook also includes guidance on financial exclusion, which aims to help relevant firms ensure that, where people cannot reasonably be expected to produce detailed evidence of identity, they are not denied access to financial services, and are able to prove their identity by alternative means.</p>
	<p pid="a.927W.8/4">Last year, FSA set up a working group of key stakeholders to look at the identification issue. The group comprises representatives of trade bodies and practitioners, consumers, government, law enforcement, credit reference agencies and forensic consultants. As part of this work, the FSA published a report in October on customer identification, ID&mdash;defusing the issue: A progress report&quot;, making proposals to the JMLSG. It proposed in particular including in a revised version of the JMLSG guidance notes, the scope for greater reliance on a single document to confirm ID and how firms should use electronic verification services methods.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.3/3">There are obvious technical reasons for a certain distance between each turbine. It needs to be compact enough to minimise the capital cost, and big enough for adequate separations to lessen energy loss through wind shadowing from upstream machines. It is usual for there to be a distance between the turbines of around 3&ndash;10 rotor diameters The issue of wind farms and their proximity to dwellings and roads should be considered at the planning stage of individual developments and will be subject to policies in the local authority's development plan and the national policies set out in Planning Policy Statement 22 (PPS22).</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.10/1">Over the last 15 years the Chinese Government has done much to help reduce poverty levels within China and promote economic improvements for its citizens. This effort to develop has led in some cases to an improvement in basic freedoms for citizens, e.g. there is more freedom to move around the country and outside the country. However, we remain concerned about many aspects of the human rights situation in China. A detailed assessment can be found in the most recent Foreign and Commonwealth Office Annual Human Rights Report for 2004 available at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/humanrightsreport2004">www.fco.gov.uk/humanrightsreport2004</a> and in the Library of the House.</p>

All of these have contributed to Palestinians' sense of frustration and hopelessness, and make a comprehensive settlement more difficult to achieve.

Copies of the lists are available in the Library of the House. These report information reaching back to 1995&ndash;96.</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.16/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/2">Since 2001 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Preseli Pembrokeshire will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly families with severely disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 31 per cent. of adults and 7 per cent. of children in Wales are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Preseli Pembrokeshire who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.16/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Preseli Pembrokeshire, the proportion in employment has risen to 71.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/21">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 1,950 in Preseli Pembrokeshire alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&ndash;03 show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,400 families in Preseli Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/24">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. Around 3,905 pensioners in Preseli Pembrokeshire are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;38.36 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally for this year eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the One-off 70 plus payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80 plus annual payment are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.16/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 15,600 pensioners in Preseli Pembrokeshire have benefited from this increase.</p>

Other measures to tackle barriers to lone parents entering work include improving the availability of affordable child care and making work pay through the introduction of child tax credit and working tax credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.953W.0/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the South Dorset constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Dorset police force increased by 169, from 1,284 to 1,453. The Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 33 CSOs on Dorset streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, Dorset has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 27per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/3">Dorset police force will receive &pound;66.0 million in general grants in 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&pound;2.4 million). Dorset benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the force would have received &pound;4.2 million less. General grants funding to Dorset police has increased by 22 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Dorset will also receive around &pound;5 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Two CCTV projects in the Weymouth and Portland CDRP area received a total of &pound;691,489 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;380,488 has been allocated to Weymouth and Portland CDRP and &pound;295,714 to Purbeck CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;1.98 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the South West for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/7">The Government's Crime Reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/8">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from anti-social behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Dorset a total of 56 anti-social behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January 2005</phrase>, including eight in Purbeck and 12 in Western Dorset (which includes Dorset West and Weymouth and Portland). Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/9">Tackling drug misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the House Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/10" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/11" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/12" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/13" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/14">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Dorset has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Dorset Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;1.58 million, rising to &pound;2.09 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the South Dorset constituency can be obtained from the Dorset Drugs Action Team For contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/15">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders&quot; fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website, <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/16">This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.0/17">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.960W.8/1">By definition, the scale of illegal migrant working is difficult to measure because illegal immigrants fall outside of the United Kingdom official statistics. Consequently, there is no official estimate for the number of illegal immigrants working in the United Kingdom. The experience of workplace enforcement officials indicates that illegal migrant working tends to feature in commercial sectors characterised by low skilled, temporary employment in which labour is often supplied via sub-contractual arrangements. The Immigration Service has detected illegal migrant workers employed in various sectors, including hospitality (including hotels and restaurants), car washes and repair garages, the sex trade, horticulture and agriculture, food production, contract cleaning, manufacturing and the care home sector. The Government take seriously the harm caused by illegal working, including the risk to our immigration control and the exploitative treatment often experienced by workers. We have strengthened the law preventing illegal working and are examining how best to improve compliance and enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="a.969W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answers 13 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/2">Ministers make every effort to answer questions substantively in accordance with performance guidelines and especially before Prorogation. However this is not always possible and sometimes, as in the case of the nine questions tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the hon. Member for Thurrock referred to in the above question (204164)</phrase>, complex information has to be obtained from both within and outside the Department before it can be answered substantively. In the case in question it was not possible to provide substantive answers to the questions before Prorogation.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/3">For this reason I wrote to the hon. Member for Thurrock on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> providing him with the information he had requested and arranged for a copy of the letter to be placed in the House Library. The <i>Official Report</i> cannot publish the written correspondence between myself and the hon. Member, however, the main text of the letter is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/4" class="indent">On the issues you raised concerning the murder of Richard Watson the Chief Constable of Sussex Police advise me as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/5" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> The purpose of the meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-24">24 January 2003</phrase> with Mrs. Henderson was to ensure that she and her daughter were updated with the progress of the re-investigation. Following that meeting, in March 2003, a suspect was arrested and interviewed, which subsequently led to papers being passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for advice in May 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/6" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> The re-investigation, which was headed first by DCI Wood and then, from April 2002, by DCI Dennis has now been completed. On the <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-26">26 May 2003</phrase>, a file of evidence was forwarded to the CPS concerning one specific suspect who found that there was no basis for a prosecution in relation to the case papers provided to them. The case is not, however, closed and any new lines of inquiry that emerge will be fully investigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/7" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> The Chief Constable did not record the complaint of Mrs. Henderson for two reasons. Firstly, Mrs. Henderson's complaint referred to complaints about the original investigation, which had already been dealt with. Secondly, the remaining points raised about the re-investigation did not amount to complaints about the conduct of individual police officers, but related to operational matters all of which were subsequently addressed by the restructuring of the force approach to critical incidents. The Secretary of State has no powers to review a Chief Constable's decision not to record a complaint under Section 69(1) of the Police Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/8" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> A full and unqualified apology was provided to Mrs. Henderson in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>. Press releases were available from <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-09">9 December 2002</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-08">8 October 2004</phrase>. All of these press releases contained repeated apologies, personally made, to Mrs. Henderson and her family.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/9" class="indent">Following the Inquest, on the <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-08">8 October 2004</phrase>, a public apology was posted on the Sussex Police public website acknowledging its failings in the case and accepting that there were serious failings in the original investigation. The apology also included an acknowledgement that Mrs. Linda Watson and her daughter, Ms Amanda London-Williams, were innocent of all charges in relation to Richard Watson's murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/10" class="indent">This latest statement is available to anyone visiting the site and has been supplied to the <i>Daily Express</i> and <i>Sunday Express</i> following specific requests.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/11" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> The report of the Police Complaints Authority's supervised investigation by the Metropolitan Police into Sussex Police's investigation of the murder of Richard Watson belongs to Sussex Police. It has not been published and is protected by public interest immunity and will continue to remain so unless directed otherwise by the Courts. The Secretary of State is therefore not in a position to place a copy in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/12" class="indent"><i>(f)</i> The original investigating officer overseeing the inquiry retired from Sussex Police on <phrase class="date" code="1998-05-30">30 May 1998</phrase> on completion of over 30 years' service. He would have faced disciplinary charges for his conduct of the investigation had he not already retired from the Police Service. There is no mechanism whereby retired officers can face disciplinary proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/13" class="indent"><i> (g)</i> The Chief Constable formally referred a file of papers relating to the murder of Richard Watson to the Crown Prosecution Service on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-26">26 May 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.9/14" class="indent"><i>(h)</i> Sussex Police received the Metropolitan Police's report into the investigation on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-28">28 April 2000</phrase>.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.2/50">The budget for probation areas has increased by two per cent. in real terms in 2004&ndash;05. Much of this increase relates to funding capacity-building for the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and so is not directly related to the increase in performance. It is fair to say, therefore, that the improved performance has increased the cost-effectiveness of the NPS, so improving the value for money of the service delivered to the community.</p>

In the Statutory Code public authorities are encouraged to use the same ethnic classification system as the one used in the 2001 census. This approach ensures consistency, allowing comparisons to be made over time and across different areas. However, the Statutory Code provides public authorities the flexibility to adapt the categories to fit local circumstances, provided these are the same as, or similar to, those used in the 2001 census.</p>

The Big Lottery Fund (BLF) and the Department have commissioned evaluations of the programme for the United Kingdom and England respectively.

	<p pid="a.990W.5/3">The health improvement workforce in the national health service provides leadership and training in health improvement, supporting local communities and developing a health-promoting NHS.

	<p pid="a.990W.5/4">In the White Paper, Choosing Health&quot;, the valuable contribution of community-based workers is described, for example those in the voluntary sector. But such support is patchy and fragmented and therefore, from 2006, accredited NHS trainers will form part of the wider workforce geared towards prevention of ill health and as part of a comprehensive health improvement service. They will be providing support to people in disadvantaged areas and, progressively from 2007, across the country. The funding details will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001W.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Gregory Campbell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question asking for a list of the major road schemes likely to commence construction in Northern Ireland within the next 12 months (211518). I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Rods Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/4" class="indent">I can advise you that the major road schemes likely to commence construction in the next 12 months are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/5" class="indent">A1 Newry to Dundalk Link Road&mdash;the Northern Ireland section of this scheme will upgrade 4.3km of route to high standard dual carriageway and include one grade separated junction at an estimated cost of &pound;33 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/6" class="indent">The first package of the Roads Service Design Build Finance Operate (DBFO) programme is expected to be awarded in 2005 and it is possible that construction of the following two capital elements of the package may start construction in the next 12 months:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/7" class="indent">the provision of on-slips to the M2 motorway at Antrim Hospital at an estimated cost of &pound;2 million; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/8" class="indent">improvements to the M1/Westlink, costing an estimated &pound;75 million, which will include the widening of 2.8km of the M1 motorway to 3 lanes in each direction (Stockman's Lane to Broadway), the widening of 1.6km of the Westlink dual carriageway to 3 lanes in each direction (Broadway to Divis Street) and the provision of 2 grade separated junctions (underpasses) at Broadway and Grosvenor Road.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/9" class="indent">However, the timing of the construction of these schemes will not be confirmed until later in the negotiations for the award of this DBFO package.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/10" class="indent">Of course, the commencement of these schemes on the Eastern Sea Board Corridor should be viewed in the context of recently constructed and ongoing schemes throughout Northern Ireland, as well as those schemes planned to start in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/11" class="indent">For example, schemes recently constructed that serve the North West include the Strabane Bypass Stage II and Limavady Bypass both opened to traffic in September 2003, and the Toome Bypass that was opened to traffic in March 2004. Several carriageway-widening schemes have also been completed on the key corridors serving the north-west within the past year, including A37 Springwell Climbing Lane (Coleraine to Limavady) and A6 schemes at Munreery (Derry to Dungiven), Curran (Maghera to Castledawson) and Castledawson (roundabout towards Maghera under construction). It is also hoped to commence further widening schemes at A37 Gortcorbies (Limavady to Coleraine) and A6 Kilcattan (extension of Burntollet West&mdash;towards Belfast) and Mulderg (to balance Munreery) over the next couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/12" class="indent">In addition the planning and preparation of the A6 dualling scheme from Randalstown to Castledawson and the dualling of the A2 at Broadbridge (Eglinton to Campsie), is progressing well with construction expected to start in 2006&ndash;07 (subject to satisfactory economic analysis, availability of finance and the completion of the statutory procedures).</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/13" class="indent">You will also be aware that the schemes to provide the Skeoge Link and upgrade the A2 Buncrana road are being taken forward in consultation with the developers of the proposed extensive development in the area. While the timing of these improvements will be dependent on agreement with the developers, the first element of these improvements is expected in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/14" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>
