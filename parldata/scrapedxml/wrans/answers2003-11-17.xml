	<p pid=".467W.3/1">The courts of England and Wales may have jurisdiction in respect of an offence committed abroad if the offender, or the victim, is a British national. Once such jurisdiction is established then the procedures for investigating and prosecuting the case are the same as for any case prosecuted in the courts of England and Wales. The police are responsible for investigating allegations of criminal offences and for obtaining admissible evidence to prove the alleged offence. The CPS is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations. The police ask the advice of the CPS before charging any person with a criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.3/2">In complex and serious cases such as potential offences involving torture, the police will invariably consult with the CPS for advice on the sufficiency of the evidence before a person is charged. The CPS will consider each case that is passed to it by the police. Each case is carefully considered to assess whether it meets the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Once the CPS has decided to start a prosecution, if the alleged offender is located abroad the CPS will refer an application for extradition to the Secretary of State for the Home Department who will forward the request through the appropriate diplomatic channels.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.7/1">Information on compensation orders in Magistrates' Courts has not been historically collected by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. However, the Home Office Criminal Statistics Publication (Table SI, 6(A)) shows that in 2000, 97,073 offenders were ordered to pay compensation (excluding summary motoring offences) and in 2001, 97,134 offenders were ordered to pay compensation (excluding summary motoring offences). Information on the rate of default is not currently collected as compensation orders are measured with confiscation orders and other fines and not isolated. Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates' courts and the Crown Court. Debt collected includes compensation but also fees, fines, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not yet possible to separate out only compensation orders from the total. There are plans, however, to isolate compensation orders in debt analysis under the Libra Project from around Autumn 2004 onwards. This will involve the use of the Libra Application which is the new IT system being developed for the Magistrates' Courts.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.7/2">Figures concerning the number of compensation orders made in the Crown Court for the years 2000&ndash;02 are as follows. This information relates to defendants, not cases:</p>

	<p pid=".468W.5/3">There are Certificated Bailiffs who act in a private capacity. They are given their authority to do so for a period of two years, by their local county court judge, in accordance with the Distress for Rent Rules 1988. A complaint against a Certificated Bailiff is considered by a judge of the county court that granted the certificate. If the certificate is revoked the Department will be informed. The information will be recorded on the Register of Certificated Bailiffs that is kept centrally. The Register is open to public search through a central point of contact. No data is retained longer than three years. In 2001 two certificates were cancelled, in 2002, 13 were cancelled, and in 2003 to date 17 have been cancelled. Any prosecution would be taken by the member of the public affected by the action of a certificated bailiff. There is no data kept by the county court or the Department centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.2/1">There are no plans to collect the data requested. No children statistics distinguish between orders in favour of mothers and fathers and to collect figures in this area would incur disproportionate cost. Figures are kept of the total number of orders made under section 13 of the Children Act 1989 for removal from the jurisdiction since 2000 (when figures were first collected). Separate figures are not held for mothers and fathers, though 333 such orders were made in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".473W.2/2">The more effective use of design throughout the British economy would improve prosperity and productivity. We promote design through the work of the Design Council, which is funded by the DTL.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/3">For example, the Design Council's &quot;Design Demonstrations&quot; projects with companies provide exemplars of how design can radically improve performance. These projects are with manufacturing and emerging technology companies. The outputs will support awareness campaigns, to be undertaken with Regional Development Agencies and Business Link, to reach a wider business audience.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/4">In education, the Design Council's &quot;Design in Schools Week&quot; places professionals in schools to inspire design and technology students and teachers. In 2002, 302 designers worked in 295 schools, this year, 372 designers worked in 360 schools.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/5">Business Link and the Manufacturing Advisory Service provide extensive advice and brokerage services on design.</p>

	<p pid=".476W.6/2">In determining the suitability of a country for exchange purposes, the driver testing and licensing systems are assessed, to ensure that the drivers meet standards that are comparable to those in Northern Ireland. This includes an assessment of the driving test, the integrity of licensing system and the nature and format of the licence itself.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.6/3">With regard to the Republic of South Africa (RSA), it is accepted that the nature of the driving test and the general driving standards are comparable to those in Northern Ireland. However, further consideration is being given to the integrity of the system for issuing licences. Furthermore, the RSA driving licence does not indicate whether it has been issued in exchange for a licence from a third country. This is important since the standards in that third country may not have been assessed against Northern Ireland standards.</p>
	<p pid=".476W.6/4">The Department of the Environment is continuing to assess the suitability of licences from RSA for exchange. The Department is also developing proposals to amend the relevant legislation to enable selective recognition of licences from other countries so that, for example, licences which had been issued in exchange for a licence from a third country, which does not meet Northern Ireland standards, could be excluded from the exchange arrangements. This will bring exchange arrangements in Northern Ireland into line with those in Great Britain. Depending on the availability of legislative opportunities, it is hoped to have the amendment in place before the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".477W.2/2">The Irish Hare Species Action Plan, published by the Department of the Environment in 2000, identifies the need to carry out regular surveys of the Irish hare population in Northern Ireland. The purpose of these surveys is to estimate the size of the population and make deductions about the causes of any movement in the estimated numbers. A baseline survey was completed in 1997; this was followed by &quot;The Northern Ireland Irish Hare Survey 2002&quot;, carried out by Professor Montgomery's research team at The Queen's University of Belfast. The Department will carry out regular, similar research into surveys of the Irish hare population to measure progress against the Species Action Plan targets &quot;to maintain the existing range and to demonstrate a population increase by 2005; and to double the present population by 2010 over as much of the range as possible&quot;. The next of the surveys will be commissioned in spring 2004.</p>

Working closely with key partners such as Citizens Advice, Age Concern and local authorities and with local voluntary organisations the local service reach these pensioners at locations that suit their needs. Activities being undertaken include awareness sessions, information surgeries and take-up campaigns. Over this month the Local Service has held or plans to hold over 1,300 events which are expected to reach around 117,000 people.</p>

Based on a number of assumptions about the future, as set out in Annex 3, this shows that pension credit expenditure could rise to around one and a half per cent. of GDP by 2050.</p>
	<p pid=".492W.0/15">One of the assumptions used was that on average, income brought to account in the pension credit would increase in line with average earnings.</p>
	<p pid=".492W.0/16">The Pensioners' Incomes Series 2001&ndash;02, based on Family Resources Survey and Family Expenditure Survey data, shows that average pensioner incomes between 1979 and 1996&ndash;97 rose by 64 per cent. in real terms, compared to average earnings growth in the whole economy of 36 per cent. in real terms. More recent growth estimates are subject to uncertainty, but the growth in average pensioner incomes between 1994&ndash;95 and 2001&ndash;02 was around 23 per cent. in real terms, higher than average earnings (up 12 per cent. over the same period).</p>
	<p pid=".492W.0/17">Robust projections of future spending on pension credit, housing benefit for pensioners and council tax benefit for pensioners, based on alternative assumptions, and in different years, are not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

	<p pid=".492W.0/37">The long-term cost of pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit will also depend greatly on the decisions made by future governments in annual uprating statements. This Government are committed to increase the guarantee in line with average earnings for the remainder of this Parliament, ensuring that all pensioners share in rising national prosperity. Following the introduction of pension credit, the Government will be spending an additional &pound;9.2 billion on pensioners in 2004&ndash;05 as a result of measures introduced since 1997.</p>

It set by the independent Accounting Standards Board for the purpose of providing clarity of liabilities in company accounts. Its full implementation has been deferred awaiting the development of a revised International Accounting Standard, being developed by the independent International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). It is anticipated that the revised international standard will be agreed by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".504W.2/1">The provision of a safe, secure and risk free environment for the Iraqi people is a key aspect of restoration activity for all members of the International Coalition in Iraq. The United Kingdom takes seriously its obligations as a member of that coalition to deal with unexploded ordnance. Unexploded ordnance in Iraq includes munitions from the Iran-Iraq war, mines laid by Iraqi forces, stores of ammunition and other ordnance left by Iraqi military and paramilitary forces as well as ordnance fired or dropped by both sides during recent hostilities.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.2/2">Since the end of major combat operations UK and other Coalition forces have been engaged in clearing sites containing unexploded ordnance. In the UK's area of responsibility an average of about 45 new sites have been discovered each week. Whenever a site is discovered UK forces mark the site and inform those in the vicinity. The munitions are then recovered or destroyed as soon as resources permit. To date around 1,600 sites have been cleared, containing about 619,000 munitions. We do not record individual types of munitions cleared.</p>

The majority of the assessment and the clearance of UXO is conducted by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) and commercial demining companies, in many cases working under the auspices of the United Nations.

	<p pid=".507W.12/1">Companies in the UK are operating in an increasingly competitive, global marketplace. It is a commercial matter for companies to decide where to locate their operations. In doing so companies will need to consider a number of factors including, inter alia, the strategic importance to the business of their call centre operations and the relative risks and benefits of transferring these overseas, the geographic distribution of their customer base and the need to be close to customers, location of their competitors, relative costs, and the ability to maintain service quality. The United Kingdom has by far the greatest number of call centre operations in Europe reflecting our expertise in call centre management and the wish by many companies to retain call centre bases here.</p>

	<p pid=".508W.5/1">I represented the UK at the Competitiveness Council, Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-10">10 November 2003</phrase>. Andy Kerr MSP was also present.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/2">There was an initial exchange of views over the proposed Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/3">The Council reached General Agreement on the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive. This is designed to guarantee free movement of electrical equipment within the Internal Market, whilst ensuring that such equipment does not create unacceptable levels of electromagnetic disturbance.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/4">The Council adopted a Resolution on the application of New Approach Directives.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/5">The Commission presented its new proposal for a Chemicals Regulation, stressing its importance for European industry. There were differing views of the impact on downstream users, and the Commission stated that it would like to discuss this, and the question of impact assessment at a public meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-23">23 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/6">The Presidency said that this was a priority issue in the Competitiveness Council agenda. There will be a policy debate at the next meeting on 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November 2003</phrase>. I asked for environmental and industrial interests to work together, and called for more effective prioritisation and simplification of the registration procedure, with one substance and one registration.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/7">There was a discussion on Competitiveness Policy. The Commission recognised the need for its proposals to take competitiveness aspects properly into account. The Council and European Parliament would be able to see improvements in the extended impact procedure in the 2004 work programme.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/8">I supported the idea of a competitiveness test and called for a better regulation 'expert' working group to be established as soon as possible to help assess the quality of impact assessments.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/9">The Presidency concluded that the Competitiveness Council needed to work with other Council formations to ensure they took competitiveness into account in their work.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/10">The Presidency asked for views on the Growth Initiative in the light of the October European Council's conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/11">Several of the projects are in the field of Research and Development. Key areas were nanotechnology, space and high speed networks for research bodies. I stated that I wanted to see clear criteria for projects based upon project readiness and EU added value. I also confirmed that UK preferences were close to those of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/12">The Presidency concluded that the Council should agree a new list of priority projects on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November</phrase>, for presentation to the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.5/13">The Council agreed a Resolution on Researchers' Careers.</p>

However, I understand that since March 2000 the company has recorded details of post office closures, including those under the urban reinvention programme, which commenced in late 2002, on the basis of Government Region. In the East of England Region as a whole, there have been 43 closures under the urban reinvention programme to the end of September 2003, the latest quarter for which figures are currently available.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.3/5" class="indent">The overall compliance costs to business are controlled within limits agreed by Treasury Ministers and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Each year ONS produces a Compliance Plan to help monitor and control the load on businesses of its statistical surveys.

	<p pid=".517W.3/6" class="indent">Between 1994 and 1997 compliance costs showed a progressive decrease. However from 1998 onwards compliance costs have risen steadily, as a result of the need for high quality statistics to capture changes in the economy, such as the development of E-commerce and the increasingly important service sector.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.3/7" class="indent">The latest compliance plan has calculated the compliance cost to business of ONS surveys in 2002 at &pound;28.9 million at 2002 prices, which was within the agreed limit. The figure is the same as 1995 in real terms.</p>

However, international differences in survival were not large for tumours amenable to cytotoxic therapy, such as testicular cancer and Hodgkin's disease.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.9/4" class="indent">Estimates for council taxes are based on the analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&ndash;02&quot; produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons Library or from the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. It includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,500 households in the UK and sample sizes for pensioner households are only sufficient to give approximate estimates. The Family Resources Survey would have been an alternative source with a larger sample size, but the taxes and benefits analysis has been used for consistency with answers to other recent parliamentary questions.</p>

Council tax is not paid in Northern Ireland. The survey does not record the income tax threshold of household members so the absence of recorded income tax has been used as the relevant measure. Net council tax is defined as gross council tax less benefits and discounts, where a household reports taking up a council tax benefit entitlement.</p>

Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and discounts. The table also shows the boundaries between equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for households in each Government Office Region. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of those households are estimated to lie. The results are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to increased sampling variability arising from small sample sizes, particularly for some regions.</p>

	<p pid=".523W.2/1">Raising standards of financial literacy is an important part of the Government's wider strategy to reduce social and financial exclusion, and promote appropriate participation in the financial services industry, while tackling overindebtedness, and promote saving. Financially literate, confident, and independent consumers also spur firms to offer high quality, value for money products and services, and promotes effective competition.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/2">A number of departments and agencies are active in achieving our ambitions. For example, we are the first Government to introduce a framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) that provides for personal finance education to be taught throughout Key Stages 1 to 4 of the school curriculum.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/3">We also work closely with the Financial Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/4">In his 2002 Review of Medium and Long Term Saving Ron Sandier suggested that the FSA should lead and coordinate further work in this area. Partly in response to those proposals, the FSA announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-20">20 October 2003</phrase> the membership of their Financial Capability Steering Group. This group will bring together government, consumer representatives, the industry, the media, and the regulator to develop and implement a national strategy for financial capability.</p>
	<p pid=".523W.2/5">The FSA has already delivered a great deal to help consumers and has fostered initiatives on financial literacy, working closely, for example, with the Personal Finance Education Group, which has undertaken valuable work on good practice I delivering personal finance teaching in schools. But the steering group announcement recognised that more needs to be done, to engage with and learn from the widest range of organisation.</p>

We agree with the review's analysis and have therefore asked Defra to work up proposals as part of their Spending Review 2002 commitments. They have since consulted on a range of options, including a Floodplain Development Connection Charge to be levied on new developments in the floodplain. The work on this is still at a very early stage, and will be taken forward as part of Defra's new flood management strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.2/1">The UK Government believe that International Monetary Fund (IMF) support to low-income countries should work within its areas of competence to help these countries achieve the macroeconomic stability and supporting policy measures crucial to poverty reduction and delivery of the Millennium Development Goals. The IMF's chief form of support to low-income countries is through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which was created in 1999. This facility is designed to support country-led poverty reduction strategies, and the UK has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure that the IMF's work is based on these strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/2">Discussions were held at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Dubai in September where my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer chaired the International Monetary and Finance Committee meetings. The Committee noted that faster growth will be needed in low-income countries in order to reduce poverty, and that this would require stronger policies and institutions, better governance and increased and more effective aid.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/3">The Committee observed that the IMF should remain engaged with these countries in the long-term, encouraging it to undertake further initiatives to support higher sustained growth and poverty reduction, improved governance, and reduced vulnerability to shocks. The IMF will prepare a number of Board papers on these issues, and the Committee looks forward to a review of progress at its next meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/4">The Committee also noted the need for increased and more effective aid, and for enhanced market access. The Committee urged the IMF to work with the World Bank on aid effectiveness, aid absorption, results-based measurement systems and financing mechanisms, including the International Finance Facility. Developing and emerging market countries are being consulted on this, and France will host an international conference in spring next year.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/5">In respect of representation of developing countries on the Boards of the IMF and World Bank, the Development Committee, meeting in Dubai, agreed to continue efforts to build the necessary political consensus on this issue, with a roadmap to be produced for the spring meetings. The International Monetary and Financial Committee welcomed measures under way and asked the IMF to examine these</p>

	<p pid=".527W.2/2">Officials have also been consulting on this Directive with businesses and their representatives and advisers since November 2002. These consultations have included regular roundtable meetings, which give participants an opportunity to make their concerns known, to get feedback on the process in Brussels, and to quiz officials involved in the process. Officials have also been holding smaller meetings with business representatives, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants, to provide an additional forum for consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.5/1">The Directive covering reduced rates of VAT is currently under discussion by European Ministers, following a proposal from the Commission earlier this year. This proposal challenges a number of the UK's zero rates including those for children's clothing and several reliefs targeted at charities and disabled people. We have made clear in the negotiations that we will not agree to the removal of any of our zero or reduced rate VAT derogations.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.5/2">The Commission's approach to this review has significantly narrowed the scope to consider the introduction of new reduced rates. However, as well as defending our zero rates, the Government continue to press for our long standing commitments for reduced rates for repairs to listed places of worship and the purchase of energy-saving materials for do-it-yourself installation, and also for energy-efficient products.</p>

This includes target times for the complete delivery process including needs assessment, processing of the application and the completion of building works. These target times will depend on the complexity of, and priority attached to, individual cases but the guidance suggests that the maximum target time for the entire process should in any event be no more than 260 working days and only 80 working days in high priority cases. We are currently considering responses to this consultation and hope to issue final guidance to local housing and social service authorities early next year.</p>

	<p pid=".539W.3/1">The Government's approach to the issue of child contact is based on the principle in the Children Act 1989, that in all decisions and arrangements about child contact, the child's best interests must be paramount. Figures from recent studies and surveys indicate as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".539W.3/2" class="indent">60 per cent. of non-resident parents agreed contact with the resident parent.</p>
	<p pid=".539W.3/3" class="indent">77 per cent. of non-resident parents saw their children every day, or at least once a week, or at least once a month. (Office for National Statistics survey).</p>
	<p pid=".539W.3/4" class="indent">47 per cent. of all non-resident fathers were having at least weekly contact, 68 per cent. at least monthly contact and only 3 per cent. had no contact at all, with their children. (Bradshaw, Stimson, Skinner and Williams&mdash;&quot;Absent Fathers?&quot; 1999).</p>
	<p pid=".539W.3/5" class="indent">69 per cent. of formerly married parents reported on-going contact. Only 5 per cent. reported that there had never been any contact and 27 per cent. said contact had been interrupted or had ended. (McLean and Eekelaar&mdash;&quot;The Parental Obligation: a study of parenthood across households&quot; 1997).</p>
	<p pid=".539W.3/6">The Government believe that children generally benefit from the continued involvement of both parents in their lives following divorce or separation, with the interests of the child always being paramount. I am currently considering our response to the Report of the Children Act Sub-committee of the Advisory Board on Family Law &quot;Making Contact Work&quot; to see what further practical steps we can take to facilitate and support contact between children and their parents.</p>
	<p pid=".539W.3/7">Meanwhile, the Government have already taken the following initiatives:have published the Parenting Plan, designed to help parents make practical arrangements for their children following divorce or separation, and age-related information leaflets for children concerned;are supporting a publicity campaign to emphasise the benefits of safe contact for children and to encourage parents to resolve disputes constructively; have made available public funding for family mediation for the resolution of disputes over children. 250 services now have contracts to provide family mediation and in 2001/02 are expanding the provision of child contact facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.5/1">The Government have proposed a number of measures which will improve the support and protection available to the children and non-abusive partner of a violent parent. These were set out in our consultation paper &quot;Safety and Justice: The Government's Proposals on Domestic Violence&quot; and include:</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/2" class="indent">making sure that child contact arrangements in domestic violence cases guarantee the safety of all parties. We will be expanding the provision of supervised child contact centres and services. Where domestic violence (or other safety issues) features in contact cases it is vital that the families are referred to services that are able to meet their needs, especially on safety. Baroness Ashton of Upholland and I plan to announce successful applicants for funding from a joint Children's Fund/ Sure Start Investment Stream of &pound;2.9 million for new supervised contact services. We expect new services to commence from the New Year;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/3" class="indent">improving the support available to children and young people affected by domestic violence, both for the benefit of the children and young people themselves and to relieve pressures on their parents;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/4" class="indent">providing help for victims of domestic violence as early as possible, and making sure that the civil and criminal law offer the maximum protection to all victims, children and adults, to prevent the violence recurring;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/5" class="indent">providing advice and information to victims on how to get access to support services and legal protection;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/6" class="indent">ensuring an effective police response when victims report domestic violence and ensuring that victims are not deterred by the way they will be treated at any stage of the judicial process;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/7" class="indent">improving the sharing of information so that child and adult victims are better protected and supported;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/8" class="indent">increasing the full range of accommodation options, including supporting people to stay in their own home. Children can particularly suffer by moving away from their friends, school, pets and other familiar surroundings;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/9" class="indent">helping victims who have ended or left a violent relationship to rebuild their lives; and</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/10" class="indent">raising awareness about domestic violence among the general public and key professionals;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/11">The Government are currently considering the responses to these proposals.Our Green Paper Every Child Matters recognises that supporting parents and carers is a significant factor in our general strategy to improve children's lives. It sets out the Government's vision of better integrated services for all children that are focused around the needs of the child, to ensure no child falls through the net and all children get the support they need to fulfil their potential:</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/12" class="indent">integrating services for children and families within Children's Trusts. This will particularly benefit the families in which children are affected by domestic violence as they may have a range of physical, emotional and psychological needs and may often be in temporary accommodation or moving around;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/13" class="indent">providing access to specialist services. Being a victim of, or witnessing, domestic violence can have a long-term negative impact on children's behaviour, health and educational outcomes. The Green Paper sets out how the Government will seek to ensure specialist provision is available so that all children achieve and are in good physical and mental health;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/14" class="indent">strengthening child protection arrangements. The Green Paper sets out proposals for changes to arrangements for safeguarding children, which we hope will lead to a better response to the needs of vulnerable children including those affected by domestic violence;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/15" class="indent">improving information sharing will ensure that difficulties are picked up earlier and acted upon in a coherent way. We are consulting on the best way to use information about families and parents in such cases to build a complete picture of the risks to the child;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/16" class="indent">improving both universal and targeted support for parents. Such support will be appropriate and non-stigmatising. It will help parents in supporting their children and the universal support in particular will be a gateway to more specialist services, for example, support for families affected by domestic violence; and</p>
	<p pid=".542W.5/17" class="indent">improving maternity services. 30 per cent. of domestic violence cases start during pregnancy and existing violence often escalates during it. Through the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services the Government are piloting routine antenatal questioning for domestic violence by midwives.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.9/2">Local education authorities and schools can also use funding from other sources for gifted and talented education, and choose whether or not to take up a range of national resources available to them. These decisions are influenced by a variety of local priorities and needs.</p>

Although the majority of teachers will not be affected by this initial limit, it provides an opportunity for schools to examine the use of supply teachers for providing short-term cover, and developing the use of cover supervision by trained support staff.</p>

	<p pid=".561W.5/1">My right hon. Friend has made no such estimate. However, the financial incentives and new routes to Qualified Teacher Status that the Government has created are bringing specialists in these subjects into teaching in record numbers. Figures published by the Teacher Training Agency on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-10">10 November</phrase> showed that, in the last five years, the number of recruits to conventional undergraduate and postgraduate courses of initial teacher training and the employment-based Graduate Teacher Programme has risen in mathematics by 91 per cent, in English by 33 per cent, and in science by 40 per cent. In these subjects alone, there have been almost 2,700 more recruits to training so far this year than in 1998&ndash;99.</p>
	<p pid=".561W.5/2">In addition to these huge gains, the widely welcomed remodelling of the school workforce that the Government and its partners are tak'ng forward will enable all subject specialists to use their knowledge to the maximum benefit of learners in the classroom.</p>

Applications to medical schools in the UK have gone up since 1988, as have the total number of students studying medical courses. However, Department of Health Ministers have made it clear that they will, if necessary, take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students undertaking medical training.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.9/1">We do not anticipate any significant impact on demand for medical courses after the introduction of variable fees. The Department of Health will, however, be monitoring demand for, and take-up of, medical courses. Department of Health Ministers have made it clear that they will, if necessary, take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.9/2">Since the introduction of tuition fees in 1998, demand for places on medical courses has continued to outstrip significantly the number of places, despite an increase in the number of places available. Between 1999 and 2001, plans for some 2,250 more medical school places in the UK were announced. As a result of the extra investment, the number of students entering medical school will increase to over 7,300 in 2005. The number of UK applicants to study medicine at UK universities is also at its highest since 1986 (the earliest year for which data are available).</p>

	<p pid=".567W.2/1">Each genetically modified (GM) food approved to date in Europe has been assessed on a case by case basis. A comparison is made between the GM food and its non-GM counterpart and the assessment focuses on any differences between the two. This includes a detailed analysis of the inserted gene and the protein produced, and any differences observed in the overall composition of the food.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/2">There are a number of techniques, which could potentially be used for identifying unintended effects in GM foods at the molecular level. These include two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis, protein microarrays, nuclear magnetic resonance and gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/3">The Food Standards Agency funds two research programmes, which underpin the safety assessment of GM foods. One of the programmes is exploring the potential use of the above techniques for detecting unintended changes at the molecular level. The programme started in September 2001 and will finish in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".572W.2/1">We are currently consulting on a range of measures to modernise the regulatory system which governs whether or not a community pharmacy or appliance contractor can dispense national health service prescriptions, known as the &quot;control of entry&quot; test. As well as maintaining and improving access to pharmaceutical services, including the supply of appliances, in all our communities and continuing to raise standards for patients, the aim is to make the system more business friendly, to provide more certainty and reliability for the companies who depend on it and to make the process less time-consuming.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.2/2">The measures include a proposal to exempt from that test applications from contractors who intend to provide a wholly mail order or internet based service by implementing the provisions of Section 43 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 relating to the remote provision of NHS pharmaceutical services. This exemption would be subject to the range of services such contractors are to provide being agreed within the proposed new national contractual framework.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.2/3">Full details are given in Chapter 4 of the consultation document, &quot;Proposals to reform and modernise the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-29">29 August 2003</phrase> and available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk">www.doh.gov.uk</a>./pharmacy regulationconsultation. It also includes at Annex C a draft regulatory impact assessment and competition assessment setting out further details of the possible costs and benefits of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.2/4">Comments can be sent, by <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-21">21 November 2003</phrase>, to Peter Dunlevy, Pharmacy and Prescriptions Branch, Department of Health, Room 155 Richmond House, 79 Whitehall, London SW1A 2NS or e-mail to peter.dunlevy@doh.gsi.gov.uk</p>
	<p pid=".572W.2/5">We have also set up a multi-disciplinary advisory group to advise on the details of implementation of the reform proposals. We have asked the group to report by December this year.</p>

It is for the National Care Standards Commission to inspect care homes to ensure they meet the assessed needs of their residents.</p>

Eligibility criteria are broadly the same everywhere and are essentially clinical though there may be detail differences from place to place. Access in individual cases may depend on a variety of factors including funding but predominantly acuteness of problem, medical risk or clinical need.

Those wishing to see a NHS dentist can do so by contacting NHS Direct for information on dentists offering NHS dental services in their areas. It is recognised that not all dentists on general dental service lists of primary care trusts (PCTs) are accepting new NHS registrations. We have set up a NHS Support Team to work with PCTs on dental access.

A team from the special health authority and the NHS dentistry support team met with NHS officials for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight at the end of October to discuss the development of a dentistry action plan and the support team will be working closely with the NHS locally to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid=".579W.8/5">In the meantime, the Fareham and Gosport primary care trust is putting in place a range of measures to improve access to dental services in the area. This includes a dental access centre in Fareham designed to provide unregistered patients with access to NHS dentistry. This is supported by an incentive scheme which offers additional access to NHS dental care based in existing dental surgeries.</p>

	<p pid=".581W.0/2">National health service trusts are free to employ staff under such terms as they see fit (section 16, NHS and Community Care Act 1990). Trusts are also responsible for the establishment of their own local disciplinary procedures for medical and dental staff. In the 1990s, many trusts developed new procedures often based on the procedures set out in circulars HC(90)9 and HSG(94)49.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.0/3">The Department has been working closely with the British Medical Association to develop a new national framework. Trusts will be required to ensure that their local procedures adhere to the principles and procedures set out in the framework.</p>

This funding will be allocated through a new Quality and Outcomes Framework, which sets out a range of indicators relating to the detection, recording and management of patients with high blood pressure. Practices will gain a certain number of points according to their performance against these indicators.

	<p pid=".596W.2/1">The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its Sub-Committee on Pharmacovigilance (SCOP) have kept the safety of synthetic (human) insulins under close review and have considered the available data on a number of occasions. Most recently in 2002, the SCOP considered the findings of an independent review of controlled clinical trial data by the Cochrane Collaboration. The conclusions of the Cochrane review were that there is no difference in the incidence of adverse events between patients on synthetic insulin compared with patients on animal insulins. The SCOP confirmed its previous advice that there is no clear evidence of safety problem specific to human insulin. However, the issue will be reviewed again should further information become available.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) receives reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) via the Yellow Card scheme. The most commonly reported suspected ADRs with both synthetic (human) and animal insulins are disorders of metabolism and nutrition such as hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia unawareness, followed by skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder such as injection site reaction. However the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug caused the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/3">A higher number of suspected ADR reports have been received in association with synthetic insulin through the Yellow Card Scheme, however this may reflect the fact that 80 per cent. of patients with Type 1 Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus are estimated to be receiving synthetic insulin in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/4">Full guidance on prescribing and use of synthetic insulins, including possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribes and patients. This includes warnings about the risk of hypoglycaemia unawareness particularly upon transfer from animal insulins to synthetic insulins. Key prescribing information is also included in the British National Formulary, which is sent by the Department to doctors and pharmacists.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/5">Both human and animal derived insulins are currently available and the MHRA is not aware of any specific plans for the discontinuation of production of animal derived insulins. However, decisions as to the most suitable type of insulin for particular patients are clinical matters and must be made by individual doctors.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.8/1">Over &pound;3 billion a year is spent on health and social care provision for people with learning disabilities. The White Paper, &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086), published in March 2001, which set out our proposals for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers, announced two new funds to support its proposals: the implementation support fund (ISF) from April 2001 and the learning disability development fund (LDDF) from April 2002. Funding has been allocated to support priorities set out in &quot;Valuing People&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/2">Money from the &pound;2.3 million ISF was fully allocated in both 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03. We expect it to be fully allocated in 2003&ndash;04. Funding has been used to support a range of work, including:</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/3" class="indent">The development and support of advocacy services</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/4" class="indent">The setting up and support of the national forum of people with learning disabilities and its network of regional forums</p>

	<p pid=".597W.8/7" class="indent">Extension of the learning disability awards framework.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/8">The LDDF was introduced in April 2002. &pound;2 million of the &pound;22.6 million revenue element available in 2002&ndash;03 was used to support the &quot;Valuing People&quot; support team and its related activities. The remainder was distributed to health authorities on a pro-rata basis to be used as agreed through their partnership board, with their partner local authorities to support the following priorities for service change:</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/9" class="indent">Modernising day centres</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/10" class="indent">Completing the reprovision of the remaining long-stay hospitals to enable people to move to more appropriate accommodation</p>

	<p pid=".597W.8/12" class="indent">Promoting the further development of advocacy</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/13" class="indent">Supporting the wider introduction of person centred planning</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/14" class="indent">Enhancing leadership in learning disability services.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/15">In 2003&ndash;04, &pound;2 million was again allocated for the &quot;Valuing People&quot; support team, with &pound;21 million being distributed to primary care trusts to be used on the above priorities for service change.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/16">The capital element of the LDDF comprises &pound;20 million a year to be used on the following priorities:</p>
	<p pid=".597W.8/17" class="indent">Enabling local providers to develop specialist services for people with severe challenging behaviour</p>

This figure does not necessarily represent liabilities which will need to be settled nor is it an indication of poor financial performance.

	<p pid=".600W.5/3" class="indent">A major redesign of Aintree Hospital included refurbishment work within the ambulance liaison assistants (ALA) area. This is now more accessible for patients and more suited to their needs. This has also involved a redesign of the office furniture and now all telephone conversations are conducted behind a higher level counter;</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/4" class="indent">During the last 12 months a refurbishment project has been carried out by the Countess of Chester Hospital and this included work in the ALA lounge. Specifically, this involved relocating the patient transport service lounge to make it more accessible and more open plan to create a better environment. Telephone conversations are now held in a much more secure environment behind high level counters;</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/5" class="indent">Work is also currently ongoing with the Royal Liverpool Hospital. As part of its major entrance redesign, this has included the creation of a purpose built patient discharge and ambulance liaison lounge. This is a confidential environment.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/6">Furthermore, recognising the need to work more closely with its hospital partners, the Mersey Regional Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust has recently completed a management restructure, which empowers managers to work on a more integrated basis within the health economy to ensure such projects are taken forward.</p>

By December 2004, this will increase further to approximately 276 MRI scanners, a 150 per cent. increase on 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.0/3">There are approximately 60 MRI scanners in private hospitals in England. The private sector is only able to provide a small amount of additional capacity for the NHS. The utilisation of any radiology equipment is dependent on the availability of skilled staff. Both the NHS and private sector use staff from the same work force pool.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.8/1">When content of National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance requires amendment to National Health Service Clinical Assessment System (CAS) clinical content, the change would normally be made in the next clinical release. Main releases are currently made twice yearly. When the need for change is identified as more urgent than the timetable for the next main release, guidance regarding the change is issued first to all staff by a message system which is part of NHS CAS and this is followed by an interim version release of the clinical content between the main releases. Depending on the timing of release of NICE guidance in relation to the next planned main clinical release, it could otherwise be up to six months before the clinical content was revised. Advice on the urgency of implementing changes is given by the NHS Direct national medical adviser in consultation with the NHS Direct CAS clinical panel. NHS Direct is working with the system supplier to be able to amend clinical content more frequently.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.8/2">If someone required information only on a treatment, the situation is as follows. The NICE website is on the recommended list for all NHS Direct call centres. Also, a monthly current awareness bulletin is produced and posted on 'indirect' (NHS Direct's Intranet site) as well as being e-mailed to site information staff (they are encouraged to publicise at sites). This would feature any new NICE guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.8/3">If NICE guidance requires a change to the content of NHS Direct Online, it would usually be updated in their content within 48 hours, although this process can be shortened to within the hour for urgent cases.</p>

	<p pid=".610W.11/1">Local national health service trusts determine the process for selecting patients for treatment abroad. However, two key determinants are always addressed:</p>
	<p pid=".610W.11/2" class="indent">The patient is clinically fit to travel</p>
	<p pid=".610W.11/3" class="indent">The patient is clinically fit to be operated on</p>
	<p pid=".610W.11/4">In general, in selecting patients for a NHS overseas treatment scheme, acute trusts will review their waiting lists and identify suitable patients who are then contacted to offer patients the choice of travelling for treatment either overseas or in the private sector. Where patients express an interest in treatment abroad, either the local trust or the overseas commissioner (in accordance with local agreement) seeks approval from the patient's general practitioner that they are fit to travel. Before travelling overseas, all patients attend an overseas assessment clinic, run by the overseas clinicians. This allows the overseas clinicians to carry out a pre-operative assessment to determine whether the patient is suitable for surgery and to travel to the overseas hospital.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.5/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-22">22 October</phrase>, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommended that liquid based cytology (LBC) should be introduced across the cervical screening programme in England. LBC is a new method of preparing cervical samples for examination and reduces the likelihood of an inadequate test from one in 10 to one in 100. The Government welcomed the recommendations, which mean that approximately 300,000 women a year will not need to be recalled.</p>

	<p pid=".617W.2/1">The stroke service model in the national service framework for older people states that an integrated stroke service will involve specialist stroke services providing acute care and rehabilitation. Decisions on how that rehabilitation will be provided are best taken at a local level. Different models of care may emerge, but we anticipate that most trusts will establish a rehabilitation stroke unit.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.2/2">The target of all general hospitals that care for people with stroke to have a specialised stroke service by April 2004, as described in the stroke service model, is well on its way to being met. 94 per cent. of the hospitals that provide stroke care now have a specialised stroke service.</p>

	<p pid=".622W.5/1">In 2002/03 we spent &pound;14 million on TB testing to bring the backlog of 27,000 overdue tests built up during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) under control.

This is about the same level as that prior to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The rolling nature of the testing programme means that herd tests are falling due all the time and we are therefore unlikely to reduce the overdue list to zero.</p>

Furthermore my noble friend Lord Whitty has been chairing meetings of a Dairy Supply Chain Forum made up of senior figures from across the diary sector. This Forum and its sub-groups have been examining ways in which collaborative action can promote supply chain efficiency, and how levels of innovation and new products development might be increased, and considering the likely impact of the CAP reform package on the dairy sector. It also intends to consider the kinds of changes that the sector might need to make to adjust to the new environment created by the reforms.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.2/1">Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in 2002, 50 enterprises classified as manufacturers of dairy products were de-registered for VAT. This compares to 525 enterprises under this classification registered for VAT at the end of 2002. Although these figures may be indicative of the number of firms which went out of business, the Government have made no assessment of the reasons for these de-registrations, and it should be noted that de-registration can occur for reasons other than an enterprise ceasing to trade, such as its turnover falling below the VAT threshold.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.5/1">The Department monitors incomes on dairy farms through the annual Farm Business Survey and also, from time to time, via special studies into the economics of milk production. Incomes for the years ended February 2002 and February 2003 on a range of farm types, including dairy farms, will be published by the Department at the end of this month. Forecast incomes for the year ending February 2004 will be published in January 2004. In regard to economic viability, there are a number of factors that influence economic performance, including milk yield, milk price and efficiency of input use and these all vary from farm to farm. The wide range in economic performance across dairy farms is reflected in the wide range in the break even ex-farm milk price.</p>

	<p pid=".625W.8/1">When fully implemented, the reforms agreed in June in Luxembourg will reduce the support price for butter by 10 per cent. more than the 15 per cent. reduction originally agreed for both butter and skimmed milk powder under Agenda 2000 (i.e. a 25 per cent. cut in the support price for butter). If farm gate prices were to fall to the same extent, the price per litre might be reduced by a further 0.95p beyond the impact of Agenda 2000. However, we share the European Commission's assessment that farm gate prices are unlikely to settle at this level: indeed, the overall package of compensation agreed reflects this. (Producers will be compensated through an increase in the level of direct payments of a further 0.74ppl over and above the compensation originally agreed in Agenda 2000.) The figures quoted above are based on an exchange rate of 70p/euro.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.8/2">Our economic assessment indicates that decoupling of direct payments from production will have a beneficial effect on farm incomes; we would expect the main dairy-specific price impact to be in relation to the value of milk quota.</p>

However, there has been significant investment in larger, more efficient, dairy plant in the UK since 1997 and this gap may well have closed.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.8/1">A study commission by Defra, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland by the Centre for Agriculture, Food and Resource Economics at the University of Manchester, which was published in April 2002, concluded that on balance the elimination of dairy market support and milk quotas, together with compensating decoupled direct payments would not result in a significant change in UK milk production. It also concluded that such a reform of the dairy CAP would result in dynamic benefits to the processing sector as it moved from the production of commodity products to value-added products. Nevertheless, this study could not predict and could therefore not consider the actual outcome of the agreement reached on CAP reform in June. Under the umbrella of the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, which is chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty, Defra is co-funding with the Milk Development Council and the Dairy Industry Association, supported by the National Farmers Union, a study on the impacts of the agreement on Dairy CAP reform and some of the options available to the UK. Preliminary results for this work should be available in December, with a final report published in January. Once this is complete, we intend to work with the industry through the Forum to consider the long-term implications and the adjustments the sector will need to make to the new environment.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.0/1">The objective of the 2003 decommissioning schemes in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland is to remove 15&ndash;20 per cent. of the 2001 effort on cod in the North Sea and west of Scotland fisheries (Northern Ireland have also targeted vessels catching cod in the Irish Sea). We are therefore focusing the schemes on those vessels which spend most time fishing for cod. The age of the vessels is not relevant in that context.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.0/2">Other member states will decide for themselves whether a decommissioning scheme is appropriate to their particular circumstances. However the effort control measures that are in place under the Community's 2003 Days at Sea scheme apply to the fleets of all European Union countries fishing in the North Sea and west of Scotland&mdash;not simply the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.0/3">While the Government are keen to reduce overcapacity within the European fleet, we have set no targets for the future size of the UK fleet.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.0/4">We are working with the Regional Development Agencies to ensure that the full range of Government support and regional funding is made available as appropriate to individuals and businesses in fishing communities in order to enable them to deal with the consequences of decommissioning.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.0/5">More than &pound;60 million has been made available within the UK for decommissioning and associated financial support in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.0/6">It is for applicants to the schemes to decide the basis for their decommissioning bids, but these may include any anticipated costs of decommissioning e.g scrapyard fees.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.0/7">The provisions of the decommissioning scheme in England (as defined in Statutory Instrument 2669) are enforced by the staff of the Department's Sea Fisheries Inspectorate.</p>

	<p pid=".633W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.2/2">European Union rules require country of origin labelling for fresh or frozen veal and beef cuts and veal and beef mince sold prepacked or non-prepacked. For other meats, and for processed veal and beef, country of origin need not be given unless failure to do so might mislead a purchaser as to its true origin. Where origin information is given voluntarily it must not be false or misleading.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.2/3">The Food Standards Agency has issued guidance notes for industry and enforcement authorities, which emphasise the need to ensure that origin labels are clearly worded to avoid misleading consumers, for example by applying 'British' labelling to products like ham or bacon prepared from imported meat.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.2/4">The Government are pressing at EU level for compulsory origin labelling on all meats and some meat products, and for tighter controls on misleading origin declarations. It welcomes the European Commission's identification of rules on origin labelling as one of the key issues to be considered in its current review of EU labelling rules.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.9/1">The England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), which is funded by Government and the European Union, provides support for rural areas, by encouraging sustainable rural businesses and thriving communities. It helps farmers and foresters respond better to consumer requirements and become more competitive, diverse, flexible and environmentally responsible. It also provides help to rural businesses and communities which need to adapt and develop. The Programme covers 10 separate schemes which provide new opportunities for farmers and others to protect and improve the countryside, to develop sustainable rural enterprises and to help rural communities to thrive. It is estimated that the Programme will provide &pound;1.6 billion in support between 2000 and 2006. Defra believes the best way to encourage enterprise in rural areas is to provide the right economic framework and, where necessary, to target support measures e.g. rural enterprise and training, towards appropriate people. Awards of ERDP funds are made in line with principles of equal opportunities.</p>

The review concluded that the project had a high probability of success. A further review of progress by an Office of Government Commerce independent expert was conducted in July 2002. This review concluded that an amended contract, then being negotiated, should ensure the first MOT stations would be computerised by mid-February 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.8/3">A third independent review of progress now under way will report by <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-20">20 November 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.8/4">A readiness-for-service review, to be conducted at the end of VOSA trials, will confirm the viability of the business case and that the services and users are ready for go-live. This review will also cover value-for-money set out in the business case and approved by HM Treasury.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.9/1">The Community Liaison Unit (CLU) is based in the Human Rights Section of Consular Directorate in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It provides assistance to British Nationals in danger of a forced marriage overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/2">The CLU covers three main areas of work:</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/3" class="italic">Casework:</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/4">Since the establishment of the CLU in October 2000, staff have dealt with over 600 cases of young British Nationals fearing or escaping from a forced marriage overseas. Forced marriage is a serious human rights abuse and is not sanctioned by any religion or culture. It is quite different from an arranged marriage, in which the parties give their full and free consent. The CLU has dealt with victims, male and female, aged between 11 and 39, and from a wide range of backgrounds including Sikh, Hindu, Catholic and Muslim to date.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/5" class="italic">Public sector guidance:</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/6">The CLU also works with other Government Departments to develop guidance for public sector services that may come into contact with forced marriage cases. To date the CLU has developed a video for schools, guidelines for police and are currently awaiting clearance on guidelines for social services. They have also provided support to link UK and foreign police services tackling some of these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/7" class="italic">Outreach:</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/8">The CLU also work in the UK with NGOs, refuges, community groups, public sector, and faith groups to raise awareness of the issue and the help available to victims. Overseas, the CLU and posts (Embassies and High Commissions) work with partners in the judiciary, police and NGO community.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.9/9">The Community Liaison Unit also worked in partnership with the British Muslim community from 2000&ndash;03 to organise the British Hajj Delegation to Mecca. Responsibility for the Hajj Delegation has now moved to the Middle East Assistance section of Consular Directorate. This section deals with consular assistance to distressed British Nationals in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, which means they are better placed to offer assistance to British Hajjis.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.8/1">Encouraging progress is being made in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Transitional National Government (TNG) in Kinshasa is functioning. Welcome moves have been made recently to improve the DRC's relations with Rwanda and Uganda. The TNG now provides the Congolese people with a real opportunity to end the cycle of violence and human rights abuses and start on the path to democracy and development.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.8/2">Pockets of fighting remain, particularly in the east of the country. We are concerned by recent clashes between &quot;Mai-Mai&quot; and forces of the former Forces Arm&eacute;es Rwandaises/lnterahamwe in eastern DRC. We welcome and support efforts by the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC)&mdash;acting under their new Chapter VII mandate as authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 1493 (2003)&mdash;to tackle this problem.</p>

	<p pid=".653W.0/1">The Gymnich Informal Meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs can take in all the key policy issues of the day, as well as broader strategic issues. The last four meetings have addressed inter alia such issues as: enlargement, wider Europe, counter proliferation, Middle East Peace Process, Western Balkans, ESDP and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.0/2">The Gymnich offers Foreign Ministers an opportunity to discuss broad policy themes in an informal setting. The nature of the Gymnich means that there is no formal agenda. The Gymnich does not form conclusions or take decisions. Items to be discussed are set out in a letter from the Foreign Minister of the country holding the Presidency to his colleagues. However, the issues actually discussed at the Gymnich often vary from the preliminary suggestions in this letter.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.0/3">We usually receive the Presidency's letter about two weeks before the Gymnich. The letter is not a document, which is automatically forwarded to the Scottish Executive. However here, as elsewhere, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is alert to the need to consult the Scottish Executive on issues which touch on devolved areas in Scotland (including non-devolved matters which will have a distinctive impact of importance in Scotland) in line with the Concordat between HMG and the Scottish Executive.</p>

Our ambassador to Indonesia wrote to the Indonesian Government in August 2003 requesting that NGOs be granted permission to return to Aceh. When I visited Indonesia on 3&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-06-04">4 June 2003</phrase>, I stressed to President Megawati that Indonesian military action in Aceh should be proportionate and in accordance with international standards on human rights. We have not approached the head of the Aceh Martial Law Administration as our concerns about the situation in Aceh are raised through Indonesian Central Government. Some media have recently been granted permission to gain access to Aceh to report on the situation there. NGOs have not yet been granted permission to return to Aceh.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.3/2">We, with our EU partners, urged the Indonesian Government to protect non-combatants in the on-going operations in Aceh, and to pursue a peaceful negotiated solution to the conflict. We remain convinced that a long-term solution to the Aceh problem can be achieved only through political negotiation and consultation between the Indonesian Government and the Acehenese people.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.2/1">The elections in north Cyprus on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-14">14 December</phrase> are of pivotal importance to the future of the island. This is an important opportunity for Turkish Cypriots to decide their own future. It is essential that these elections should be conducted in a transparent and democratic manner, free from interference. We are calling on all those who have influence, including Turkey, to help ensure the elections in the north are free and fair. We welcome indications from the Turkish Government of the importance they attach to this.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/2">With regard to legal action against the media, we are deeply concerned about any attempts to limit press freedom. On the particular cases raised, we condemn the physical attack on the journalist Murat Kanatli, reportedly by the 'Grey Wolves' group in north Cyprus. The five further journalists mentioned were charged with a range of offences, including insulting the Turkish Security Forces and undermining the &quot;state&quot;. These charges relate to articles reporting events at Doganci (Elye) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-25">25 March 2003</phrase>, when opposition parties and pro-solution forces tried to hold a symbolic referendum in support of the Annan Plan. The police raided the protest, an army contingent removed the &quot;ballot box&quot; and the organisers were arrested. The timing of these prosecutions (seven months after the event) adds weight to the assertion that the indictments are politically motivated. Furthermore, we are concerned by reports that a number of these cases will be tried in a military court.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/3">On the recent incidents involving the Peace and Democracy movement, we are concerned about reports of attacks on their party headquarters.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/4">We do not wish to offer detailed comments on the remarks attributed to Mr Denktash. If he did say such things, it was clearly intended to be inflammatory.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/5">We continue to have concerns about the number of &quot;settlers&quot; who have recently been granted citizenship in north Cyprus. The fact that this took place in such numbers immediately before an election is undermining confidence in the electoral process. The opposition in northern Cyprus has applied to the &quot;Higher Electoral Council&quot; (YSK) for an injunction barring those who have become citizens since the municipal elections in June 2002 from voting in the elections on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-14">14 December</phrase>. We await a ruling on that particular issue. The Turkish Cypriot courts have already barred two hundred people from voting in the elections who had been granted citizenship by the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/6">We will continue to monitor the situation in Cyprus very closely in the build up to elections on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-14">14 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.2/2">The NPT currently faces a number of challenges. It is not yet universal, and the UK continues to urge Israel, India and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. We are also concerned about North Korea's admission of a uranium enrichment programme and its announced intention to withdraw from the Treaty. This issue can only be resolved by DPRK's strict compliance with the NPT and full implementation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.2/1">In 2002, the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) funded a &pound;71,000 pilot electronic court reporting project in Uzbekistan. As part of the project, new electronic court reporting equipment was installed in four criminal courts in the Ferghana Region. Sadly, while receiving some positive reports from defence lawyers, this assistance has had its limitations; the equipment was abused or not used in practice and court reports were not made available when cases were appealed. Further plans to install the equipment in over 150 courts nation wide have been suspended until we receive firm evidence that the equipment provided thus far is being used effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.2/2">We shall continue to look for viable opportunities to assist Uzbekistan in reforming its judiciary and improving its human rights record in conjunction with EU, OSCE and other partners. We believe that lessening the dependence on often doubtful confessions and improving the focus on material and forensic evidence is the key to reducing levels of brutality and improving fairness in the judicial process. Through engagement with the authorities on development of an action plan to combat torture, we are also pressing for the political will for such reforms. Regionally we are organising a training workshop in Almaty in December to train judges and prosecutors in the judicial control of the practice of torture. Members of the Uzbek judiciary and procuracy will be invited to attend.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.5/2">The UK ideas were designed to stimulate a debate on improving the international asylum system. Our thinking continues to evolve. But we remain focused on the provision of better protection in asylum seekers' own regions to reduce the motivation to cross continents to make a claim; and to reduce the burden on the asylum system from those misusing it to gain entry to the UK for economic or other reasons. This is not about shifting the burden to poorer regions.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.5/3">The majority of the world's refugees are already unable to access asylum systems in the European Union. It is therefore essential to strengthen protection in their region of origin, close to their homes, in order to ensure accessible and effective protection for people fleeing persecution and conflict. We have been working closely with UNHCR, the ED and others on this.</p>

	<p pid=".672W.12/1">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) maintains databases containing address details for asylum seekers which are also recorded in the individuals' Home Office file. All applicants and their representatives are told of their obligation to notify the Home Office of any subsequent change of address. This may be done, either in person at one of 11 designated Reporting Centres or by post to the Change of Address Team (CoAT), based in Croydon.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.12/2">The Casework Information Database (CID) is the main information technology (IT) system used by IND and allows information to be updated upon receipt throughout the asylum process. There is no link within CID between a change of address and the stage in the asylum process at which it occurred, e.g. before or after final refusal, and therefore the information requested is not available and could be obtained only by examination of individual case files at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.12/3">UK Immigration Service visits to asylum seekers' home addresses are not routinely recorded on the national CID database. Again, the information requested is not available and could be obtained only by examination of individual case files at disproportionate cost.</p>

As stated in the letter we sent to stakeholders, we consider that these are urgent measures and are therefore seeking to introduce them as soon as parliamentary time allows. While we are seeking the views of key stakeholders on the new provisions we believe that further reform is needed quickly if we are to capitalise on the success of our measures to date. Further dialogue is taking place with stakeholders on specific measures and a copy of the letter to stakeholders has been placed on the website of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate so that it is available to the public.</p>

Information on expected waiting times for citizenship applications are available on the IND website; <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk</a> and is periodically updated. As at September 2003 the expected average processing times were:</p>

Friend the Home Secretary takes detailed advice as part of his consideration of questions of compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate officials and Home Office lawyers. Judgments in individual immigration appeal cases raising human rights issues are also carefully examined for any wider potential implications for the Rules.</p>

	<p pid=".694W.3/2">In 2001 the Home Office published a wide ranging review of the effects of migration on the UK Economy, and in 2002 its Research Directorate published four separate research reports on migrants' fiscal effects and their labour market outcomes and impacts. The studies considered various aspects of immigrants' characteristics and contribution to the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.3/3">The overall impact is positive&mdash;migrants have no significant adverse impact on non-migrants' employment and, if anything, had a positive impact on wages, suggesting they bring complementary skills. The evidence demonstrates that migrants contribute to economic growth, productivity, innovation and public finances. The fiscal study estimated that immigrants made a net &pound;2.5 billion contribution to the economy in 1999&ndash;2000. Immigrants also help fill jobs that companies have been unable to fill from the domestic labour force.</p>

	<p pid=".702W.0/1">The standard membership of a police authority outside London under section 4(1) of the Police Act 1996 is 17 members, of whom nine will be councillors appointed from relevant councils, three will be magistrates appointed by the local Magistrates Courts Committee and five will be appointed from local people (independent members) who mainly live or work in the police area. The Home Office and Association of Police Authorities published joint guidance on the selection and appointment of independent members of police authorities in England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-20">20 September 2002</phrase>. This guidance reflects the intention in the Act that the independent membership should, as far as practical, represent the interests of a wide range of people in the community and be appropriately skilled. It does not specify organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.0/2">Where there is a single relevant council in a police area, it selects from its membership the nine councillor members of the police authority according to political balance. If there is more than one relevant council, then a Joint Committee of those councils makes the appointments on the balance of parties prevailing among the members of the relevant councils taken as a whole. The apportionment between relevant councils is a matter for the Joint Committee. This is set out in Schedule 2 of the Police Act 1996 as amended.</p>

	<p pid=".710W.0/1">The procedures for managing visitors awaiting entry to a prison varies at each establishment and is not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.0/2">The provision of a covered area immediately outside the gates is often dependent on the structural design of the prison building. However, around 109 establishments provide a visitors' centre which offers visitors both shelter and, in most cases, support services that are available before and immediately after the visit is due to take place.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.0/3">Many of those who do not have a centre provide basic facilities such as a waiting area. Recent enquiries suggest that around 10 prisons appear to have no current plans for a visitors' centre and we are exploring with them their intentions in terms of assisting visitors.</p>

	<p pid=".710W.3/1">The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide in prisons. Over the next few months the outcome of this programme will be reviewed taking into account pilot project evaluations and emerging research findings. The next steps and approaches will be resolved in consultation with partner agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.3/2">As part of this close partnership with other agencies and organisations, there has been a targeting of efforts where the risks are highest. A particular focus, and an investment of over &pound;21 million over the three year programme, has been on physical improvements at six pilot sites. These improvements have been in reception, first night and induction areas, installing more first night centres, and by having more crisis suites and gated cells that enable staff to watch at-risk prisoners closely.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.3/3">Dedicated drug detoxification units and mental health in-reach support have also been established, along with a series of inter-related projects to develop improved suicide prevention and self-harm management policies, concentrating on pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care and peer support, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.3/4">Prison Service Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators have been trained and are now operating in the majority of prisons. Additionally, the Samaritans are recruiting and training more prisoner peer supporters (known as Listeners) in high-risk establishments. Listeners are prisoner volunteers who are selected, trained and supported by Samaritans to offer confidential support to their fellow prisoners who may be at risk of suicide, otherwise in crisis, or simply in need of someone to talk to. 1,241 new Listeners were recruited between <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> with further recruitment and training continuing. The scheme's objectives are to assist in preventing suicide, reducing self-harm and to help alleviate the feelings of those in distress.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.2/1">The Government work closely with the Commission for Racial Equality, (CRE) which has statutory responsibility for enforcing the duty to promote race equality under the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000).</p>
	<p pid=".711W.2/2">The CRE commissioned Schneider-Ross, a firm of diversity consultants to evaluate the response of public authorities to the statutory duty to promote race equality. The research had two main elements, quantitative and qualitative, covering two core stages. The first of these was a questionnaire based survey of 3,338 public authorities and educational institutions, using two questionnaires designed to address the different elements of the general and specific duties that apply to the two broad categories. The second was an analysis of a random sample of 143 race equality schemes and policies from the main sectors covered by the duty, assessed against the recommendations of CRE Code of Practice and CRE guidance materials.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.2/3">The Schneider-Ross report found that overall local government was the highest achieving sector. Around a third of local authorities were on track; a third had good foundations to respond well to the duty to promote, and, a third needed to carry out more work in order to comply. The criminal justice service was strong, especially in the police and probation services. The weakest sector was schools.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.2/4">The Home Office has initiated a Race Relations (Amendment) Act Strategic Sectoral Audit.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.2/5">The audit is a sector by sector analysis of whether the key ingredients for success are present or not in each sector. The work on mapping the landscape of current sector activity builds on the findings of the Schneider-Ross survey. We are working closely with the CRE to take this forward quickly so that necessary support and attention can be made available to those public bodies who need it.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.2/1">Home Office records show that since the Terrorism Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-19">19 February 2001</phrase>, 678 stop and search authorisations under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2001 have been confirmed.

	<p pid=".714W.0/1">Information on sickness absence and compensation payments due to 'work-related' stress are not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.0/2">The Department does, however, monitor factors relating to workplace stress including workload and working conditions through its staff surveys. The Department has taken action to address some of the main identified factors, including filling vacancies, recognition of good performance and improving technology. The Home Office is committed to supporting staff in achieving a balance between their work and home responsibilities and has a range of flexible working patterns to help staff achieve this.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.0/3">A welfare service is available and offers personal support for staff suffering from any form of stress. In addition, stress awareness courses are available and information on how to recognise stress and suggested coping strategies, is accessible via the Home Office Intranet. The aim of these resources is to help staff recognise the early signs of stress and take appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.0/4">The Department is aware of its legal obligation to provide a safe working environment for employees and is committed to meeting targets for reducing the number of working days lost generally due to work related injuries and illness arising from the government's Revitalising Health and Safety initiative.</p>
