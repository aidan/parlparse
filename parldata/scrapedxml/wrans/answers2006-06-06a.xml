Successful mixed communities bring together the economic, social and physical aspects of renewal and development to create sustainable change in communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.493W.5/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government are working with a number of demonstration projects around the country to test the mixed communities approach. The projects are all at early stages of development and we are working with them to evaluate progress and learn lessons.

The groupings Bottom 10 per cent., Top 10 per cent., Bottom 20 per cent. and Top 20 per cent. of the Before Housing Costs and After Housing Costs income distributions are consistent with DWP's National Statistics' series, Households Below Average Income (HBAI). It is presented in this manner to be consistent with HBAI. The Bottom 10 per cent. relates to individuals in households with the lowest 10 per cent. of equivalised household income.  2. Real income growth is represented by the percentage change in decile or quintile income medians that have been adjusted for inflation. Year on year growth estimates are volatile.  3. Comparisons for the bottom decile should be treated with particular caution. Decile medians for the bottom 10 per cent. are more volatile as they are affected to a greater extent by fluctuations in households reporting very low incomes.  4. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data covers selected years from 1979 until 1995-97 where information is available. The Family Resources Survey (FRS) data is for all financial years 1994-95 until 2004-05.  5. Comparisons of estimates between the two sources should be treated carefully: FES figures are for the United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain;<br/> The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years in 1979, 1981 and 1987, two combined calendar years from 1988-89 to1992-93 and two financial years combined from 1993-95 to 1995-97;<br/>The FRS was established by the then Department of Social Security in order to meet the Department's analytical demands; A review, available on the internet, into the differences in income values between the two surveys concluded that the differences in monetary value estimates across surveys were too large to justify publishing direct comparisons. Furthermore, large fluctuations in the difference between surveys for overlapping years mean that a spliced time series may be no more accurate than the unadjusted series. 6. Page 5 of the Child Poverty Progress Report showed growth by quintiles AHC and much higher growth for Q1 than Q5. This is borne out in this PQ. However, BHC progress was only slightly better for the bottom quintile than the top quintile.  <i> Source:</i>  The Family Resources Survey (FRS)</td> </tr>

There is no intention of going further than this. The UK Government remain fully committed to the millennium development goals, and have set a timetable to reach the target of 0.7 per cent. overseas development assistance-GNI by 2013.</p>

The ANPR systems also undergo an annual programme of testing and calibration in accordance with Home Office approved procedures to ensure continual accuracy.</p>

The other 58 cameras were purchased and installed in 2002-03 at a cost of &pound;271,000 and upgraded in during 2004-05 and 2005-06 at a cost of &pound;340,000 primarily for the purchase and installation of ancillary equipment such as fibre optic cables but not new cameras.</p>

The Department for Transport has discussed the situation with train manufacturers and will seek to provide them with better information on future procurement timescales and to facilitate a more even spread of train orders, thus enabling longer term decisions to be made on the maintenance of UK manufacturing capability. It is worth noting that 70 per cent. of the trains procured between 1996 and 2005 were manufactured or assembled in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.513W.2/6" class="indent">Section 29 of the Child Support Act 1991 empowers the Secretary of State to collect child support maintenance. However, the wording of Section 29 enables the Secretary of State to decide, in a very limited range of circumstances, not to collect maintenance. Each case will be treated individually after careful investigation on its own merits and examples include:</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.2/7" class="indent">Death of a non-resident parent;</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.2/8" class="indent">Where a parent with care felt that to continue to collect would put her or her children at risk; and</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.2/9" class="indent">Where an interim maintenance assessment cannot be converted to a full maintenance assessment the Agency will not pursue the punitive element of the debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.513W.2/10" class="indent">As each case is individually considered it would require disproportionate effort to detail every decision.</p>

Estimates of the numbers eligible are given as ranges in order to account for possible biases inherent in estimates from data that is less than perfect.

Estimates cover all those aged 60 and over in the private household population of Great Britain.  4. For the purposes of this analysis, the unit of analysis is the benefit unit. This is either a single person aged at least 60 years old or, if a couple, both will be termed pensioners if one is aged at least 60 years old. This is consistent with both the definition used in &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-up&quot; publications, and with the fact any individual aged 60 or over is entitled to pension credit.  5. The data source for eligibility estimates is the Family Resources Survey. Estimates of eligibility for 2005-06 and 2006-07 are based on Family Resources Survey data for 2003-04 and 2004-05, with incomes and benefits projected forward into the future in order to estimate the eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey. They are calibrated to the 2004-05 National Statistics estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting.  6. All figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.  7. Projections of eligibility may be adjusted following publication of future editions of the National Statistics take-up estimates.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.522W.5/1">We are broadly satisfied with the operation of the Licensing Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) and the Regulations made under it. The Department estimates that some 190,000 premises have been successfully licensed under the 2003 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.5/2">However, as with any large-scale reform, there is a need to ensure that the actual operation of the 2003 Act reflects the purposes for which it was introduced, and to examine and address any anomalies as far as is possible. That is why the Government established an Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel in May last year to consider whether fees had been set at the right level. Their final Report is due for publication in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.5/3">We are also currently monitoring and evaluating the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 nationally through, for example, the Scrutiny Council initiative, in which officials from my Department are working with council officers and through them with local police and other responsible authorities, residents' groups, businesses and other stakeholders, to gather information about how the new regime is working on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.5/4">In addition, our two-stage review of the Guidance issued under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003 commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>. We expect to lay a revised version of the Guidance before Parliament by the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.522W.8/1">I believe that the Licensing Act 2003 will benefit sports in the long term by removing the need for clubs to obtain a number of different permissions for different activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.8/2">However, I recognise that some concerns have been expressed about how sports clubs will adapt to the new licensing regime. An independent Licensing Fees Review Panel was established by the Government in May 2005 to consider whether fees had been set at the right level for community groups, including sports clubs, businesses and local authorities. The Panel&mdash;which is chaired by Sir Les Elton&mdash;published its interim findings on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase>. This identified a number of areas for more detailed work. The full interim report can be accessed on my Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.522W.8/4">The Panel is continuing to receive information from a number of stakeholder interests in order to gather the evidence that will inform their final Report, which is due to be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.8/5">As implementation continues, my Department is working closely with Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) and other sports bodies. The Department has asked the CCPR to provide any information about how sports clubs are adapting to the new licensing regime and in particular, to feed in any evidence about the impact of the fees into the Independent Fees Review Panel.</p>

	<p pid="a.528W.8/2">The main strategy is to gain efficiencies as a result of the reduction of the physical size of the estate and the number of buildings. As a result the DTI London HQ estate has been reduced by approximately 30 per cent. with significant associated reductions in the Department's overall energy usage.</p>
	<p pid="a.528W.8/3">The Department has also implemented a number of energy efficiency initiatives since the target was published. In 1 Victoria Street this included a number of energy efficiency projects to improve lighting and environmental controls as well as occupant awareness. The Department has also undertaken a study into the use of localised micro-generation of energy on the estate. Energy efficiency is taken into account in any estate project undertaken and has included the introduction of energy minimising technology within the recent IT systems refresh.</p>

	<p pid="a.533W.5/1">No specific guidance has been issued to schools on this issue. The liability for the actions of health professionals working on school sites rests with the primary care trust (PCT), or NHS trust which employs them. School governors are responsible for ensuring that the school has consulted parents on the nature and scope of any health services available in the school; and ensuring that a protocol exists with the PCT/Trust that makes clear which services will be delivered by PCT/trust staff working on the school site.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.5/2">In terms of the individual scenarios described in the question:</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.5/3" class="indent">(i) where the drug has been supplied on school premises with the sanction of the governors, the nurse will be personally accountable for their practice, but the employer (PCT/trust) may also be held vicariously responsible for the nurse's actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.5/4" class="indent">(ii) where the drug has been supplied on school premises without the sanction of the governors, the nurse will be personally accountable for their practice, but will still have vicarious liability protection with their employer (PCT/trust) if acting with their consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.5/5" class="indent">(iii) where the drug has been supplied off school premises but as a result of a referral by a school nurse on school premises, without the sanction of the governors, the nurse will be personally accountable for their practice, but will still have vicarious liability protection with their employer (PCT/trust) if acting with their consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.5/6">Emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) is a 'prescription-only' medicine, prescribed by GPs, qualified nurse independent prescribers and nurses and pharmacists working under a patient group direction (PGD). A PGD is where a doctor has delegated authority and the supply will therefore always be under medical supervision. The safety profile of EHC for under-16s is considered to be similar to that for older women. Fatalities and strokes are not associated with use of EHC.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.8/1">The current measure of higher education initial participation is the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR), which is used to measure progress against the Government's target of increasing participation towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by 2010. This covers English-domiciled 17 to 30-year-old first time entrants to HE courses, at UK HEIs and English FECs, who remain on their course for at least six months. The figure is expressed as a proportion of the 17 to 30-year-old population of England. The HEIPR cannot be disaggregated by smaller areas. The provisional 2004/05 figure for England is 42 per cent., and the 2005/06 figure will be available in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.8/2">The latest available figures on participation by region were published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in January in &quot;Young Participation in England&quot;, which is available from their website at: <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/DUbs/hefce/2005/05_03/">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/DUbs/hefce/2005/05_03/</a>. HEFCE has calculated a Young Participation Rate (YPR (A)), which is the proportion of young people in a given area who go on to enter full-time higher education at age 18 or 19. This measure covers the period 1997-2000. This proportion is disaggregated by Government office region, and the figures for England are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.5/2">Changes to local school organisation, including school closures, are decided under local decision making arrangements. Individual proposals are determined by the local authority if they published the proposals and there are no objections. In all other cases the proposals are decided by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or the Schools Adjudicator, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.5/3">SOCs and schools adjudicators must have regard to 'Decision Makers' Guidance' issued by the Secretary of State when deciding proposals. The guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals but also stresses that all cases must be considered on their individual merits. For school closures the factors include: the impact on standards and diversity, the impact on the supply of school places, the cost effectiveness of the proposals, the impact on the community, the views of interested parties and the nature of the journey to any alternative provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.5/4">The guidance also sets out a presumption against the closure of rural schools. The 'Decision Makers' Guidance' is available on the Department's School Organisation website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.2/2">In order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) trainee teachers need to demonstrate they have met the standards for QTS. These standards ensure that all new teachers have the subject knowledge, the teaching and learning expertise they need and are well prepared for the wider professional demands of being a teacher.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/3">Further to this, it is for schools to the set their own improvement priorities, which may include social exclusion and inclusive teaching. They also decide what professional development is required in order to achieve their priorities, taking into account local circumstances and the needs of their teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/4">Support is available to schools through a variety of programmes. In particular the National Strategies' consultants focus on helping schools facing the greatest challenges. This year the National Strategies will be providing training for teachers in the use of catch-up lessons for pupils who have fallen behind, which will help to tackle the problem of children from disadvantaged backgrounds under-achieving. Excellence in Cities is a programme targeted in areas of highest deprivation giving schools access to additional resources through programmes such as Learning Mentors, Learning Support Units and expertise for CPD to meet the teaching and learning needs of teachers in dealing with the barriers faced by disadvantaged young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.544W.2/1">The information requested is not routinely collected. However, that engagement in education and training is a protective factor against poor outcomes for teenage mothers and their children. That is why increasing the proportion of teenage mothers in education, employment or training (EET) is one of the key aims of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. Evidence shows that there were higher rates of participation in EET among under-16s in the Sure Start Plus pilot areas, where young parents were provided with a holistic package of support from a dedicated Personal Adviser. Lessons from the Sure Start Pilots were included in the Children's Centre practice guidance issued in 2005.</p>
