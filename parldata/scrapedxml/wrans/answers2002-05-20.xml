	<p pid=".3W.5/2">I am aware that in certain applications there are drop-in replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. One example is in mobile air-conditioning where HFC-134a is a drop-in replacement for CFC-12, although it should be noted that HFC-134a is also a powerful greenhouse gas with a 100-year Global Warming Potential 1,300 times the warming potential of Carbon Dioxide. There are, however, many other applications where a drop-in replacement is not feasible and the only alternative would either involve costly technical alternations to the refrigeration equipment or replacement of the equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.0/1">On question <i>(a),</i> the UK's sustainable development strategy, &quot;A Better Quality of Life&quot; (1999), sets out the many steps that DEFRA and its predecessors have taken to implement the various Rio agreements and the outcome of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in 1997. The Department has led the world on the elaboration of sustainable development indicators to assess progress. The Government's first annual review of progress towards sustainable development, &quot;Achieving a Better Quality of Life&quot;, was published in January 2001. This is available at <a href="http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk">www.sustainable-development.gov.uk</a>. We have ratified the conventions on Biodiversity, Climate Change and Desertification, which were products of the Rio process, and we have made particular efforts in the promotion of Local Agenda 21.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.0/2">Our future plans, <i>(b)</i>, include the publication of a DEFRA sustainable development strategy and implementation of the recently published fuel poverty strategy and waste strategy. We are also implementing the outcomes on fisheries quotas from the December 2001 Fisheries Council, and the recommendations of the Independent Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. DEFRA's formation itself underlines the Government's commitment to delivering a more sustainable development focused agenda on food, farming and rural communities. &quot;Working for the Essentials of Life&quot;, published in March, sets out DEFRA's plans for the future.</p>

Resource productivity is a concept which underpins actions in particular sectors, such as switching from heavily polluting fossil fuels to cleaner fossil fuels and other low carbon fuel sources, changing demand patterns in favour of environmentally sustainable products and production processes by, for example, raising consumer awareness and promoting certification initiatives and supporting innovation to develop more sustainable technologies.</p>

Officials are currently reviewing the pay system for the main pay bands, in consultation with the trade unions. The review will include an exercise in equality proofing as carried out in the Civil Service.</p>

	<p pid=".8W.8/1">The declaration made on signing the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict was designed to clarify the United Kingdom's understanding of the requirements of the Optional Protocol. It made clear our determination to accord special consideration to members of the armed forces under the age of 18, but also our understanding that the Protocol would not exclude members of our armed forces aged under 18 from taking a direct part in hostilities in certain narrowly defined circumstances (thereby maintaining operational effectiveness). The declaration defined these circumstances as being</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;where there is a genuine military need to deploy a unit or ship or unit to an area in which hostilities are taking place; and by reason of the nature and urgency of the situation:</p>

	<p pid=".8W.8/6">New guidelines are being finalised as part of the process leading to the United Kingdom's ratification of the Optional Protocol. These guidelines are designed to ensure adherence to the Optional Protocol while reflecting the practical position set out in the United Kingdom's declaration, thus maintaining operational effectiveness. Officials in both the Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office continue to work actively towards ratification, and we hope to ratify soon. As part of the ratification process, an Explanatory Memorandum will be laid before Parliament to explain the significance of the Optional Protocol.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any United Kingdom military personnel having being exposed to dangerous and harmful gases resulting from destroyed Iraqi chemical factories during the Gulf conflict. However, on <phrase class="date" code="1991-03-10">10 March 1991</phrase>, US forces demolished Iraqi rockets containing chemical warfare agents near the Khamisiyah Ammunition Depot, Iraq. The MOD's initial assessment of the implications for UK personnel of the demolitions was published in December 1999 in a paper entitled: &quot;Review of Events Concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising from US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot in March 1991&quot;. The paper is available in the Library of the House and on the internet at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/khamisiyah.htm">http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/khamisiyah.htm</a>. The paper's main conclusion was that up to 9,000 UK troops might theoretically have been exposed to nerve agent following the demolitions but that the level of exposure would have no detectable effect on human health.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-25">25 April 2002</phrase>, the US released a technical report about the Khamisiyah demolitions based on a revised theoretical model of the plume of nerve agent which may have been released by the demolitions. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-03">3 May 2002</phrase>, the US Secretary of Veterans Affairs announced that the death rate for US personnel who were near Khamisiyah is similar to that for other US Gulf veterans. The US report is currently being analysed by MOD officials and the implications for UK personnel will be made public when available but at this stage there is no evidence to link the Khamisiyah demolitions with the range of symptoms of ill health being experienced by some Gulf veterans.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.2/2">The latest published data are in the Cabinet Office annual report &quot;Analysis of Sickness Absence in the civil service&quot; for the year 2000 which shows the average number of working days lost per staff year among non-industrial staff. The figure for Ministry of Defence is 8.8 days. MOD's own records show that during 2000 4.1 per cent. of days lost were due to mental disorders (stress-related) and 6.6 per cent. were due to mental disorders (non-stress related). The overall cost of sick absence was some &pound;22 million. These figures exclude MOD Trading Funds. MOD is committed to improving the health and well being of its civilian staff and has programmes in hand to reduce the number of working days lost through sick absence and work-related injury and illness.</p>

Benefits provided on medical retirement are as set out in the rules of the principal civil service pension scheme and laid before Parliament, and provide for an immediate payment of an enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill health retirement expenditure is met centrally from the Civil Superannuation Vote. For the year ending March 2002, provisional expenditure met from the Vote was &pound;310 million in respect of all civil service cases for which an ill health pension has been awarded. These cases number approximately 67,000 and include those who have formerly been ill health retired but who have now reached and exceeded the normal retirement age.</p>

	<p pid=".16W.5/114">There are major difficulties faced by least-developed countries (LDCs) when attempting to accede to the WTO. The WTO Secretariat, UNCTAD and several donor countries are working to address the issue, but since the inception of the WTO no LDCs have acceded to the organisation. This was recognised in the WTO ministerial declaration at Doha in November 2001 which stated:</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/115" class="indent">&quot;Accession of LDCs remains a priority for the Membership. We agree to work to facilitate and accelerate negotiations with acceding LDCs. We instruct the Secretariat to reflect the priority we attach to LDCs' accessions in the annual plans for technical assistance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/116">The WTO is working to help LDC accession candidates by streamlining the existing process in a number of ways. The aim is to have as few working party meetings as possible, to have clear agendas and work plans on exit, and to move as soon as possible towards the first version of the working party's draft report. However, the WTO would also like to see more action from WTO members, and is encouraging them to be more flexible and realistic in their market access negotiations with LDCs.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/117">DFID is at the forefront of work on WTO accession, and since 1999 we have been providing assistance (&pound;400,000) to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to support developing and least developed countries accede to the WTO on terms consistent with their respective development needs.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.2/2">Three countries (Cambodia, Madagascar and Mauritania) were selected for the pilot phase of the Integrated Framework (IF) on the basis of demonstrating a clear choice and commitment to the mainstreaming of trade into their development plans, through the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process. This process helped the three countries to identify and prioritise trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) requirements from infrastructure to human resources within a coherent policy framework. Donors are now in the process of responding to these needs and the final review of the outcome of the pilot phase will be issued in October.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/3">At the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference held in Doha in November 2001, the IF was endorsed as a model for LDCs trade development. In this context, eleven countries, Lesotho, Malawi, Senegal, Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Nepal and Yemen were selected for the next phase of the enhanced IF, and work has already begun. In all 45 countries have been identified.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/4">We remain convinced that the Integrated Framework is the best approach for mainstreaming trade into national development plans and strategies for poverty reduction, as well as being an effective mechanism for supporting donor coordinated delivery of TRTA.</p>

	<p pid=".19W.2/1">The Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) has established an independent commission to investigate reports of ethnically motivated violence. Following a visit to northern Afghanistan in February 2002, the commission made a number of recommendations for improving security in the area, which are currently being considered by the AIA. These include the creation of a collaborative mechanism for addressing complaints, made up of representatives of all ethnic groups in the north, including Pashtuns.</p>
	<p pid=".19W.2/2">The UK is working with the Afghan Interim Administration, other donors and international agencies to strengthen the ability of the Afghan authorities to enforce the rule of law. An Afghan-led, internationally supported security sector reform programme is crucial to ensuring the capacity of the Afghan state both to deter further human rights abuses and to bring those responsible for human rights abuses to justice.</p>

	<p pid=".20W.3/1">In January 2002, the United Nations estimated that there were approximately 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Afghanistan. Since then, approximately 160,000 IDPs have returned to their homes with assistance from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). A further 400,000 IDPs are estimated to have returned home spontaneously, without international assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".20W.3/2">IDPs, as victims of conflict and the ongoing effects of the drought, are among the most vulnerable people in Afghanistan, and are targeted by UN agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for the urgent provision of humanitarian assistance. It is a priority in 2002 for the Afghan Interim Administration and the international community to ensure reintegration of uprooted Afghans who wish to return home. Programmes coordinated by UNHCR and IOM are under way to physically transport returnees back to their places of origin, build the capacity of communities to absorb returning families, and integrate short-term programmes with longer-term strategies to ensure sustainable reintegration of returnees. Since September 2001, my Department has contributed &pound;3 million to UNHCR and &pound;3.6 million to IOM for their programmes in the region.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.2/2">None. Funding of further education (FE) provision is the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). Funding for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities in mainstream FE provision consists of two elements: funding for the basic costs of the course, as for other students; and additional learning support tailored to meet the costs of activities to meet the individual's needs.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.2/3">The LSC is introducing limited changes to its funding for basic course costs for 2002&ndash;03 which include greater emphasis on rewarding retention and achievement. While broadly cost neutral the changes are designed to reward those institutions that raise participation and achievement rates. I believe it is right that funding for retention and achievement for students with special needs in mainstream FE colleges should be on the same basis as for other students. The LSC have safety netting arrangements in place to help those institutions that may see a drop in income solely due to funding methodology changes.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.2/4">Additional learning support funding arrangements for the 2002&ndash;03 academic year remain unchanged from earlier years. However, the LSC is currently consulting on its proposals to revise the present methodology for funding additional learner needs in post-16 education and training. These new arrangements are intended to ensure a coherent approach, based on common principles, to the funding of special needs regardless of age, mode of study or type of programme.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.6/1">The Pension Service, formally launched on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, will provide a modern, efficient and customer focused service, dedicated to combating poverty and encouraging saving for both today's and future pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/2">It will comprise centralised pension centres working with an improved local service nationwide which will operate in the community working with local partners to provide face to face contact for pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/3">A key aim of The Pension Service is to provide an excellent customer service by making use of the advances in new technology. This will be done through our contact centres. Customers can access us easily through a simple range of telephone numbers, and can get their claims and queries dealt with quickly by trained experts who understand state pensions and the needs of their customers.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/4">We fully recognise that not everyone can access the service using the telephone, post or internet&mdash;and for those customers there will be a community based local service.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/5">The local service is being introduced on a phased basis from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> and will be in place nationwide by October 2002. It will be made up of two key elements. A direct local service, providing support directly to customers which will include a targeted visiting service both in the home and at third party locations, and a 'drop in' surgery service for outreach and take up activities; and partnership services provided with partners such as local authorities and voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/6">The new Pension Service sees a key shift in emphasis from processes to people: their needs, what they want and the way they want it delivered. This improved service will be rolled out over the next few years. In the interim, our customers will continue to deal with their existing social security offices until they are contacted in writing about the new arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.8/1">As part of our strategy to combat social exclusion, we are committed to helping resettled offenders overcome the barriers they face in getting work. Ex-offenders who are in work are half as likely to re-offend as those without a job.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.8/2">We offer ex-offenders a wide range of help to move into work, including early access to employment programmes such as New Deal and work based learning for adults. Last October we introduced Freshstart, a &pound;3 million initiative to improve the links between prisons and jobcentres and ease the transition from custody into work. In addition, we are also looking to draw resettled offenders who have recovered from drug misuse into our progress2work initiative. Progress2work pathfinders are already up and running in 27 areas and will be rolled out nationally next year.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.8/3">This autumn we will be piloting further support for ex-offenders, giving them the specialist help they need to make best use of our welfare to work initiatives such as the New Deals.</p>

	<p pid=".36W.5/1">We are committed to reducing discrimination against older people. The Department is responsible for promoting the business case for non-ageist employment practises to all employers and individuals across Great Britain. Through our Age Positive campaign, we are working to challenge ageist employment practices leading up to the implementation of age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance in 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/2">Evaluation of the impact of our Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment indicates that since it was launched in 1999, the number of companies using age criteria in recruitment has halved from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent., and the number of companies with policies against employing older people has also halved from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.</p>

By tackling discrimination and offering a range of back to work help, including New Deal 50-plus, the employment rate for people aged 50 to state pension age has increased each year for the last four years, faster than the overall rate.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.2/1">As part of the Government's commitment to combating poverty and providing security and independence for people aged 60 or over, new measures have been introduced to automatically identify pensioners who might be entitled to Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and encourage them to claim. These measures build on the successful Take Up campaign which ran from May to November 2000, and contacted 2.4 million potential MIG customers. It generated approximately 1 million responses. Further mail shots in March 2001 coincided with the increase in capital limits from &pound;8,000 to &pound;12,000.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/2">From April 2002, all customers contacting the RP Teleclaims Centre are offered information on MIG and asked if they would like someone to call them back to provide them with more information and pursue a claim. Those customers who do not wish to claim MIG via the RP Telecentre are sent a MIG information leaflet with their RP claim pack.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/3">From April 2002, all customers who have claimed RP since November 2000 (the end of the last MIG take-up campaign) who have been identified as having a potential entitlement to MIG are being issued with a mailshot letter and leaflet to encourage them to claim. Around 100,000 pensioners will receive a mailshot over the April-June period.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/4">Further (Key Life Event) MIG triggers have been introduced. Departmental data matching techniques are now being used to identify other new and existing pensioners with potential entitlement to MIG. These triggers identify customers who have a match with one or more predetermined 'key life events', which may indicate a potential entitlement to MIG, for example, when customers aged 60 and over receive a new award of one or more benefits, such as attendance allowance, industrial injuries benefit or housing benefit. A mailshot comprising a letter explaining the possible entitlement and inviting customers to claim along with a MIG1L leaflet is sent to all customers identified in this way.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/5">In order to ensure take up of winter fuel payments, an information campaign ran throughout 2001, including advertisements in national and local press, a leaflet and poster made available in a variety of venues, including social security offices, post offices, supermarkets and doctors surgeries, a dedicated winter fuel payment helpline and information on the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/6">Through all of the above measures we intend to ensure that as many potentially eligible people over the age of 60 as possible do not miss out on the additional source of income MIG can provide them with.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.2/1">Our strategy for combating benefit fraud focuses on getting it right, keeping it right and putting it right: making correct benefit payments in the first place; ensuring payments are adjusted as circumstances change and detecting when payments go wrong and taking prompt action to correct them with appropriate penalties to prevent a recurrence.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/2">As part of getting it right, front-line staff have been made more aware of the risk of fraud and encouraged to take responsibility for ensuring that claims are correct at the gateway.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/3">Jobcentre Plus will provide a more comprehensive and integrated service for all benefit claimants. One-to-one interviews will create a personal environment where the full and accurate details of a claim can be established and customers can be reminded of their responsibility to notify us of changes to their circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/4">From last month, new powers in the Fraud Act 2001 became available for putting it right, by making it easier to catch fraudsters and give greater punishments to those who persistently abuse the system. Benefit fraud investigators can now require organisations like banks, insurance companies and utility companies to provide information about customers where fraud is suspected. Under the &quot;two strikes&quot; provisions, a person convicted of one or more benefit offences in two separate sets of proceedings within a three-year period may be disqualified from receiving benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/5">We know that our strategy is working. By March last year we had reduced fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 18 per cent.&mdash;nearly double our first milestone of a 10 per cent. reduction, a year ahead of schedule.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.6/2">The estimates of the proportions for 1998 were made by using data from the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) and DWP data on state spending on pensioners and Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates of the size of private pensions in payment.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.6/3">The projections of the proportions for future years were made using GAD projected expenditure for national insurance benefits, i.e. the basic state pension and state second pension, and DWP projections of income-related benefits. The projections for income from private sources were based on figures from ONS for current pensions in payment. These were uprated by PENSIM estimates of the growth in private pensions in payment until 2025 and then by estimates of GDP growth thereafter. PENSIM estimates are based on data from three different surveys conducted in 1988. These were the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative, the Retirement Survey and the Family Expenditure Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.6/4">Since the 1998 projections were made, private pension income has increased and we remain committed to promoting saving for retirement. The introduction of secure, value for money stakeholder pensions last year and other measures we are taking mean that we are on track to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.3/1">We are taking a single approach to work and benefits to make work pay, make work possible and to support those who cannot work. This service will be delivered through Jobcentre Plus&mdash;a personal service with one goal: helping people of working age to live independent lives.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/2">People receiving working families tax credit or disabled person's tax credit with net income of around &pound;11,740 a year or less are eligible for a tax credit national health service exemption certificate. This entitles them to free national health service prescriptions, dental treatment, wigs, fabric supports, sight tests, full value optical vouchers and help with the cost of travel to hospital for national health service treatment. For those with a child under one year old baby food is available at a reduced price.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/3">In addition, anybody in work who has a low income can claim help with the cost of national health service treatment provided they have savings of less than &pound;8,000 (&pound;12,000 if aged 60 or over; or &pound;19,000 if they live permanently in a residential care or nursing home). Depending on their income people may be eligible for either a full (HC2) or partial (HC3) Department of Health exemption certificate. The HC2 certificate entitles the person to free NHS services; the HC3 certificate entitles the person to some help towards NHS charges.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/4">People receiving working families tax credit or disabled person's tax credit (where the amount of tax credit is paid in full or reduced by &pound;70 or less) and who have a close relative, or partner, in prison can get help with the cost of travel to visit them. Help is also available in these circumstances for people who hold a Department of Health HC2 or HC3 certificate.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/5">Housing benefit and council tax benefit are available to people in work to help pay their rent and council tax. Part of their income is disregarded when assessing the amount of benefit payable to guarantee that a person is better off in work than out of work.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/6">Sure Start maternity grants are available if a person or their partner is in receipt of working families tax credit or disabled person's tax credit. And help with funeral payments is available through the social fund for the person who is responsible for the funeral if they are receiving working families tax credit, disabled person's tax credit, housing benefit, or council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/7">From April 2003 we will introduce two new tax credits. The child tax credit will offer a single, seamless system of support for families with children, while the working tax credit will help to improve the financial gains to work. The working tax credit will, for the first time, extend in-work support through tax credits to people without children.</p>

It is balanced by non-disclosure of sensitive information. The protection of sensitive information in the civil nuclear industry is one aspect of required security arrangements at civil nuclear installations kept under continuing review by the Director of Civil Nuclear Security, the security regulator.

However, the Office of the e-Envoy commissions an annual tracking study to measure the progress of the overall UK online campaign.

These results are also available by socio-economic group.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/3"><i>(b)</i> A new statistical analysis solution for ukonline.gov.uk was implemented in January 2002. This shows that usage of <a href="http://www.ukonline.gov.uk">www.ukonline.gov.uk</a> has risen from 14,000 unique users per week in January peaking at over 80,000 in April. Visits (a series of page views) have likewise increased from 50,000 in January peaking at over 170,000 in April. We do not have this data broken down by socio-economic group.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/4"><i>(c)</i> The statistical analysis does not cover session cookies, therefore repeat usage figures are not available. However, we closely monitor customer feedback via our customer management programme. A dedicated team has been set up to handle customer queries in real-time and to analyse the feedback from members of the public.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.3/5" class="indent">The Council endorsed the Commission's three main priorities for 2003: achieving enlargement successfully, continuing to ensure security for EU citizens, and developing a sustainable and inclusive economy. The Council agreed that the Commission's suggested budgetary allocations would be studied in the framework of the Preliminary Draft Budget examination for 2003. The Council recommended that future versions of the Annual Policy Strategy should be presented as early in the year as possible to improve the coherence of the budgetary process.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.3/10" class="indentitalic">Renewal of mandates and financing of EU Special Representatives (EUSRs)</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/11" class="indent">Recalling the essential role played by EUSRs, the Council agreed to extend the functions and funding for FYROM and Afghanistan EUSRs and asked the relevant bodies to study financial formulae to make this possible.</p>

The Council called on the SAP countries to devote adequate attention and resources to implementation of EU recommendations, with particular reference to strengthening the rule of law and judicial systems and visa and entry policies. The Council invited the Commission to assess progress made at its next annual review in March 2003. The Council proposed to establish a new ministerial-level political forum, linking the EU with the SAP countries. It also highlighted the need for a greater EU public information effort to foster greater understanding of the SAP. Crisis management in the Balkans, including the future EU police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a possible mission in Macedonia, was also discussed.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/18" class="indentitalic">Iran</p>
	<p pid=".61W.3/19" class="indent">The Council noted that broad agreement had been reached on substance and objectives for developing EU relations with Iran. In addition to commercial matters, it was felt important that this include dialogue on terrorism, proliferation and regional stability.

	<p pid=".71W.0/1">The current Lottery Funding Agreement requires Wembley National Stadium Ltd. (WNSL) to make available 75,000 seats to the general public. Any change to that agreement to reflect the current project is a matter for Sport England, the FA and WNSL.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.0/2">I understand that following the publication of the English National Stadium Review's interim report on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-19">19 December 2001</phrase> [HC 479], WNSL asked Sport England to consider the need to change the balance between general public and premium seats in order to support efforts to secure financing for the project. The request was supported by a revised business plan and by thorough market research carried out by WNSL. The Council of Sport England has considered the revised business plan presented by WNSL and following discussions with WNSL has agreed to reduce the number of general public seats which WNSL must make available to 71,200. This 71,200 figure compares with approximately 73,000 seats available to the general public at the current stadium.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.0/3">The change to the number of general public seats will be incorporated as an amendment to the Lottery Funding Agreement.</p>

The provision has only needed to be in operation since towards the end of last year. The performance of the centre's operator, UKDS, is monitored closely by on-site Home Office officials. I am confident that the dedicated team of UKDS education staff at Harmondsworth provides an excellent and very professional service, which takes account of the academic and emotional needs of the children who stay at the centre.</p>

We are acknowledging all responses and welcome the many constructive and detailed comments received. The Government are setting out clearly their decisions on those areas which require legislative change through the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill which is currently before Parliament.

A Cabinet Sub-Committee, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for DEFRA (Mr. Meacher) has a specific focus on rural affairs. My right hon.

It is currently reviewing and updating its policymakers checklist to include guidance to all staff on best practice and on cross-cutting issues to address in formulating policy on rural matters. Discussions are being held with the Countryside Agency on how they can assist the Department to develop training to support the guidance.</p>

	<p pid=".82W.2/20">With regard to the number of public and voluntary sector organisations invited to, and participating in, conferences, the exact figures are not available as the individual conference organisers retain delegate lists.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/21">However, I understand the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) has worked in partnership with a range of event organisers to put on over 20 conferences since December 2001, some of which were national and some of which were regional. A number of the conferences targeted all public sector organisations while others were sectoral in focus, for example health sector, criminal justice sector, education sector, local government, and police. Attendance at the conferences has varied from 50 to 200 delegates. The highest levels of participation were by representatives from the local government, health, police, criminal justice and education sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.2/22">With regard to the voluntary sector, the CRE has commissioned the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) and the Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations (CEMVO) to run 26 half-day seminars on issues for the voluntary sector. The seminars target both mainstream voluntary sector organisations and ethnic minority voluntary organisations. I understand the seminars will run until June 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".90W.2/1">The Government remain focused on its long-term goal of helping to tackle global poverty and achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These include halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, providing universal access to primary education, reducing child and maternal mortality and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other fatal diseases.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/2">To advance these goals the Government are promoting a significant increase in development aid from all donor countries and international institutions to build capacity and address the long-term causes of poverty in the poorest countries. To tackle global poverty the Chancellor has proposed a Global New Deal as a modern Marshall plan for the developing world. As part of the Global New Deal the Government have proposed an international development trust fund to pool contributions and build on the work of the World bank, IMF and the Regional Development banks.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/3">However, creating new channels for distributing aid would impose unnecessary costs and burdens on developing countries. We therefore believe that any additional aid from the international development trust fund should be distributed in a balanced way through existing bilateral, multilateral and civil society mechanisms used in supporting poverty reduction strategies in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/4">No specific target for ratio of overseas development assistance (ODA) to gross national income (GNI) has been proposed as part of the Global New Deal. However, the UK is committed to the target of raising ODA to 0.7 per cent. of national income, and has increased the budget for the Department for International Development by 45 per cent. in real terms between 1997&ndash;98 and 2003&ndash;04. Moreover, we have made clear that we will significantly raise the amount of our aid, and raise its share of national income, in our next spending round covering the years up to 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/5">There are no plans to propose that ODA from all Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors below 0.4 per cent. of GNI is used to finance an international development trust fund. However, at the meeting of European Finance Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-05">5 March 2002</phrase> the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the European Union (EU) should commit to reach an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.39 per cent. by 2006. At the EU Council Meeting in Barcelona on 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-03-16">16 March 2002</phrase>, just before the United Nations conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, EU members committed to increase their collective ODA to 0.39 per cent. of GNI by 2006 as a step towards the 0.7 per cent. target. Within this, all member states would strive to attain at least 0.33 per cent. by 2006, with other member states above that ratio maintaining or improving their levels of aid.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/6">Clearly the international community will need to debate how any additional aid flows are used to greatest effect in order to help developing countries tackle global poverty and achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To that end the UK has consistently argued that resources should be focused on the poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/7">In terms of the prospective accountability of developing countries receiving assistance from such a fund a major step forward has been the establishment of the poverty reduction strategy process. It includes consulting widely with civil society and producing a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as a framework for IMF, World bank and other donor support. These PRSP's must be clearly linked to the MDGs and provide a budgetary framework to allocate Government revenue, aid and debt relief so that the impact on poverty reduction is maximised.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/8">The Government believe that any lending conditions must be set so that we never return to a situation where countries build up unsustainable burdens of debt. So the very poorest and most vulnerable countries should receive investment help primarily in the form of grants to partner their soft IDA loans and all other low-income countries should be offered interest-free loans. Assistance to middle-income countries should be given via interest- reduced loans conditional upon implementing agreed poverty reduction strategies and engaging civil society.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/9">The extent to which an international development trust fund might have to leverage funds from international financial markets would depend on a wide range of factors, including donor contributions, interest rates, the total amount disbursed and the proportions and terms of any grants and loans within that total. If such a fund were to cease dispensing ODA in 2015 the total volume of ODA would then depend on other bilateral and multilateral ODA flows at that time.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/10">The Government have not proposed a separate Global Health Deal but regards achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals in all developing countries as essential to combating global poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/11">Following the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit, the United Nations is charged with the task of reporting on progress towards the millennium development goals at the global and country levels, coordinated by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat and UNDP, respectively. Reporting is based on two principles:</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/12" class="indent">1. Close consultation and collaboration with all relevant institutions, including the United Nations Development Group (including WHO and UNCTAD), other United Nations departments, funds, programmes and specialized agencies, the World bank, IMF and OECD, and regional groupings and experts; and</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/13" class="indent">2. The use of nationally owned poverty reduction strategies, as reported in poverty reduction strategy papers, United Nations common country assessments and national human development reports, which emphasise a consultative process among the development partners.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.2/14">An annual report is to be submitted by the UN that will chart progress, made or not made, in fulfilling the Millennium commitments, and highlight particular themes of special significance for that year. Every five years a comprehensive progress report will be submitted.</p>

	<p pid=".102W.2/2">Since the start of May 2001 the Banking Advisory Committee has met on four occasions. In accordance with Article 57 of Council Directive 2000/12/EC, member states each appoint representatives to the Committee: the UK is represented by an official from HM Treasury and two officials from the Financial Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid=".102W.2/3">The information regarding the annual cost of the Committee's work to public funds can only be obtained at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".102W.2/4">The items considered at the last meeting of the Banking Advisory Committee in March 2002 included issues relating to the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision; Bank accounting and auditing; accession countries (enlargement) and financial stability. The Committee also considered its own internal rules including the application of the new regulation on public access to documents under Regulation (EC) 1049/2001 of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-30">30 May 2001</phrase>, and the comitology function of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".102W.2/5">The regular EU Scrutiny process ensures transparency to Parliament; where the Commission issues a depositable text as a result of the Committee's work, the document along with an Explanatory Memorandum are examined by the Scrutiny Committees.</p>

As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February 2002</phrase> (Com(2001) 783 Final. As part of the review process, the UK Government has encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.</p>

The Treasury takes Rural Proofing very seriously and has appointed a full-time secondee from the Countryside Agency to rural proof the 2002 Spending Review. That commitment is well demonstrated in the area of banking, where the &quot;Universal Bank&quot;, a project on which the Treasury has been closely involved, is planned to make bank accounts accessible to all at post office counters by April 2003. This will be of particular benefit to those living in rural areas, where post offices are far more numerous thank bank branches: 93.5 per cent. of households in rural England live within 2 km of a post office.</p>

The assumptions used for these are agreed in consultation with the statistical offices of the four constituent countries. A range of projections are then published, based on agreed variations in the assumptions made about mortality, fertility and migration.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.8/6" class="indent">The Government Actuary's Department last year carried out a review of the methodology for projecting mortality in these projections as part of the National Statistics Quality Assurance review programme.</p>

However, several recommendations were made to improve the current methodology. The Government Actuary's Department will take the recommendations of the review and the findings of all relevant recent research into account when setting the assumptions for future population projections.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.0/1">The Government launched the Commonwealth Education Fund (CEF) on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-12">12 March</phrase> to mark Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee year. The CEF will help Commonwealth developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in education, so that by 2015 every child will be able to enrol in and complete primary school, and by 2005 gender equity in enrolments can be reached.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/2">At present 75 million primary school-age children in the Commonwealth do not attend school.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/3">Since 1997 the Government have committed over &pound;650 million to support the development of sustainable, quality primary education systems, mainly in Commonwealth sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/4">Under the chairmanship of Sir Edward George, the Governor of the Bank of England, the CEF will raise resources from business and individuals to support this objective. The Governor is currently working with the administering NGOs to establish the formal umbrella board of the fund, determine trustees, and will make a number of representations to UK industry over the course of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/5">The CEF will have three financing windows:</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/6" class="indent">(i) A strategic fund that will be administered jointly by ActionAid, Oxfam and Save the Children. This will be the largest element of the CEF.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/7" class="indent">The strategic fund will strengthen the capacity of low-income Commonwealth countries to ensure that the poorest and most marginalised children are able to enrol in and complete good quality primary education. Activities will cover three broad areas:</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/8" class="indent">Strengthening civil society participation in the design and implementation of national and local education plans and frameworks. Particular priority will be given to supporting initiatives that can accelerate progress towards gender equity in education;</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/9" class="indent">Enabling local communities to monitor Government spending on education, both at the national and local levels;</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/10" class="indent">Supporting innovative ways for civil society to ensure that all children, especially girls and the most vulnerable and disadvantaged (including street children, former child soldiers and nomadic children) are able to access quality education.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/11" class="indent">The Government will provide a grant of &pound;10 million to kick-start the fund. In addition moneys raised in 2002 by business for the CEF will be matched by the Government pound for pound (including tax relief). Funding from the CEF will commence from mid-2002 and be made available over three and a half financial years, ending in December 2005 (coinciding with the gender equity Millennium Development Goal).</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/12" class="indent">The strategic fund will concentrate on low-income Commonwealth countries identified by ActionAid, Oxfam and Save the Children as being seriously under-resourced in relation to education provision, and in which one or more of them has existing capacity to provide support to local organisations and to monitor and evaluate outcomes and impact. The potential 17 countries are: Bangladesh, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/13" class="indent">(ii) The Government will also match, pound for pound (including tax relief) funds raised for primary education in Commonwealth developing countries through Comic Relief's 'Sport Relief'. Comic Relief will manage these funds independently, and they will disburse funds via UK based NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/14" class="indent">(iii) The Government will expand its work to develop links between schools in Commonwealth developing countries and the UK, to raise awareness and understanding of international development issues and strengthen the global dimension in the life and work of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/15">The CEF will be separately administered by the three NGOs according to a framework agreed with Government. The Government's &pound;10 million endowment and matching funds will be channelled as a grant to the NGOs through DFID, whose existing budget will be increased accordingly. The precise cost of the matching funds will not be known until the end of 2002. Tax relief can be claimed by corporate donors and Comic Relief (in respect of donations from private individuals) at the appropriate tax rate.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is today publishing for public consultation proposed changes to the Draft Regional Planning Guidance for the North-West (RPG13). They are based on the recommendations of the independent panel that held a Public Examination into Draft RPG13 in February and March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/2">Draft RPG was prepared and published by the North-West Regional Assembly (NWRA). Its overall strategy is to establish a broad framework for the preparation of development plans by the North-West's local planning authorities up to 2016. It aims to achieve greater economic competitiveness and growth with associated regional progress; to secure an urban renaissance in the cities and towns of the North-West; to sustain the region's smaller rural and coastal communities; to create an accessible region; to assure the prudent management of the region's environmental and cultural assets; and to secure environmental quality. We support this and, as recommended by the panel, we are proposing changes to ensure that the strategy is more clearly expressed and relates clearly to the policy chapters. It is important that the implications for development plans and other strategies are clear and unambiguous in order to make a real difference on the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/3">A key issue for the region is to bring about the renaissance of the urban areas by encouraging economic growth and regeneration in a sustainable way. To achieve this we are promoting the renewal of the region's urban areas by concentrating resources upon the selective refurbishment, conversion and redevelopment of outworn building stock, and the comprehensive improvement of older and unpopular neighbourhoods. At the same time, we are proposing to include a reduction in the annual rate of provision of totally new housing (unrelated to clearance) by 15 per cent., and increase the proportion of housing provided on previously used (brownfield) land from 65 per cent. to 70 per cent. The proposed changes give added weight to avoiding any premature release of greenfield land which would undermine attempts to promote the use of recycled land and the redevelopment of existing housing areas.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/4">The proposed changes set out projected annual housing provision rates in Table 5.1 and policy on housing provision in Policy UR7. We expect RPG to bring forward an integrated approach to housing renewal at regional and sub-regional level, recognising that the development of sub-regional strategies should look beyond purely housing considerations, and allow for holistic approaches, which include economic, environmental and social elements and mechanisms. We also expect that in developing and implementing sub-regional strategies there will also be a need to have respect for local area/neighbourhood diversity.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/5">Tackling low demand and abandonment lies at the heart of the revised strategy. In underlining the importance of these proposed changes I also wish to draw to attention to the pathfinder initiative &quot;Action to Tackle Housing Abandonment&quot; announced by the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-06">6 April 2002</phrase>. Pathfinders will be formed in Greater Manchester (Manchester&mdash;Salford, Oldham&mdash;Rochdale), Merseyside (Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral), East Lancashire (Blackburn, Hyndburn, Burnley and Pendle). The role of the Regional Assembly, the North-West Development Agency and local planning authorities working with housing and other partners is to pursue a fully integrated response to these issues of low demand, high vacancy rates, falling housing numbers and abandonment, wherever they are to be found. We would welcome views on whether the proposed changes provide an adequate planning framework for tackling low demand and on the sub-regional approach to housing renewal set out by Policy UR6. In particular, we welcome views on whether the proposed changes are sufficient to prevent the unnecessary release of greenfield land for housing. Alternatively, we need to consider whether there should be further changes to reflect the recommendation made by the Transport, Local Government and the Regions Committee that no new planning permissions should be granted for greenfield sites.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/6">The panel recommended the merging of the original Core Strategy/Development Principles and Spatial Development Framework chapters. After careful study we have decided that it would be better to keep the two chapters apart but re-draft them. In so doing I believe that we have kept true to the spirit of what the original draft intended but added a Core Development Principle (on economic competitiveness with social progress), and expressed the Spatial Development Framework with greater clarity. I would particularly welcome views on the proposed priority for urban renaissance resources (set out in Policy SD1) as suggested in the panel's report (R5.6a).</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/7">The panel recommended the development of Table 11.1 in Chapter 11 on Monitoring, Implementation and Review. While attempting to set out targets and indicators in the form suggested by the panel there is a need to develop these further and views on this would be particularly welcome. To help progress this in line with the panel's recommendations, there will be a seminar for stakeholders during the consultation period and assistance from the assembly will be invaluable in this matter. As part of that deliberation an action plan will be considered in line with the panel's recommendation (R13.2).</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/8">During the Public Examination it was acknowledged that there is a considerable amount of further work that needs to be done and a range of issues that will require an early review of both RPG and the Regional Transport Strategy by the NWRA. Specifically, guidance will need to take into account the findings of a number of studies including those on Air Service; Multi-Modal Transport Studies; Public Transport Accessibility Profiling; Regional Freight; Regional Park and Ride Sites; Renewable Energy Resources; Transport Demand Management; Regional Park Resources; Regional Waste Facility Requirements; Regional Derelict Land Survey; Assessment of distribution and effectiveness of a variety of Waste Minimisation Initiatives across the Region; Review of Urban Potential Studies; and the implications of reviews of PPG 25, MPG6 and the Proposed Policy Guidance on the Extraction of Minerals from the Seabed.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/9">In considering these proposed changes and carrying out future review of RPG13 it is important that account is taken of the principles set out in the Planning Green Paper <sup>1</sup> , in particular the need to make RPG shorter and more strategic; more regionally specific; and more integrated and coordinated with other regional strategies; the increasing importance of introducing sub-regional policies within RPGs will also need to be addressed; and ensuring that the RPG process does not avoid making difficult decisions. Such a review is intended to help develop RPG13 and I am sure that the NWRA will continue to embrace the challenge of helping to implement and develop the Guidance. Consequently, while the proposed changes to the policies in this Draft RPG should be the focus of attention, views are also invited on the changes to the supporting text, including on the extent to which there is any scope for it to be shorter, clearer, and more regionally focused. We intend to revisit this issue following the period of consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.3/10">There will now be a 13-week consultation period on the proposed changes which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-16">Friday 16 August</phrase>. Copies of the relevant documents have been placed in the Libraries of the House and provided to all of the region's MPs.</p>

	<p pid=".130W.6/1">The Highway Code has, for many years, included advice to drivers not to use a mobile phone while driving. In March 1998, newspaper advertising alerted readers to the dangers of killing or injuring yourself or another road user. Leaflets and posters have been made widely available since then. In January 2000, television advertising reminded of the possible tragic consequences of using a mobile phone. We launched new radio advertising this month to demonstrate the distracting effect of using a mobile phone while driving. A public information film for use by TV stations has also been produced, as have new posters, and further publicity is being prepared. We continue to support local campaigns by police forces and local authorities.</p>

Similar information for earlier years is not available centrally but advance letters issued to the NHS containing information about the national pay rates for these staff from 1991 to 1997 have been placed in the Library together with the gender breakdown information available for the three professions for the same years. As part of the negotiated settlement of their equal pay claims, a new improved pay and grade structure for speech and language therapists was introduced in May 2000 to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.

	<p pid=".134W.0/57">The Earnings Survey</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/58">The earnings survey is based on payroll data for August of the appropriate year. It covers about half of the NHS trusts in England. It is taken for NHS organisations which use the standard payroll system (SPS), and as such the sample may change from year to year. There is some unevenness in the geographical spread of the organisations included in the survey, but the overall results are broadly representative of all regions and different types of staff. Health authority staff were included for the first time in 2000. Independent contractors (including GPs and their staff) were not included in any of the surveys.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/59">Gross earnings data, i.e. before any deductions, were collected from payroll records. Annual basic salary was read directly from payroll records, and annual equivalent total earnings were calculated using all payments made during August, including e.g. overtime, London weighting, special duty enhancements and other leads/ allowances, and multiplying by 12. Average pay figures were calculated by dividing total salaries/earnings by total whole time equivalents.</p>

In social class V there has been a significant increase in the incidence of breastfeeding from 50 per cent. in 1995 to 59 per cent. in 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".142W.2/1">The Government have made policy commitments through the NHS Plan, the Cancer Plan, the coronary heart disease national service framework and the diabetes national service framework to tackle the rising trend in obesity. As required by the coronary hear disease national service framework, local programmes of effective policies on promoting healthy eating and physical activity and reducing overweight and obesity are under way.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/2">We have put in place major cross-Government work. Specifically, this includes a national school fruit scheme and a wider five-a-day programme to increase access to and consumption of fruit and vegetables, supported by &pound;52 million from the New Opportunities Fund (NOF). Also, work is under way with industry to improve the overall balance of diet including salt, fat and sugar in food.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/3">Among children, there has been significant investment in primary physical education and sports facilities, including &pound;581 million from the NOF for a physical education and sports programme.</p>

	<p pid=".142W.2/5">Information on how many cases of obesity have been diagnosed each year is not held. However, the Department's hospital episode statistics for in-patient admissions in England showed a rise in children (0 to 16-years-old) from 152 in 1996&ndash;97 to 240 in 2000&ndash;01 and a rise in adults (over 16) from 630 in 1996&ndash;97 to 828 in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/6">The National Audit Office report &quot;Tackling Obesity in England&quot;, published in February 2001, estimated that in 1998 the direct cost to the NHS was at least &pound;0.5 billion a year, or about 1.5 per cent. of NHS expenditure. It has also estimated a direct cost of &pound;2 billion a year to the wider economy.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.8/2">The NHS Plan said that by 2004 &quot;one thousand new graduate primary care mental health workers trained in brief therapy techniques of proven effectiveness will be employed to help general practitioners manage and treat common mental health problems in all age groups, including children&quot;. Additional financial resources for their appointment are planned for next year. This year we are concentrating on the establishment of training programmes to support them.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.8/3">Last year the NHS Modernisation Fund allocated &pound;5 million of targeted funding to improve child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) at primary care level (which could include the recruitment of primary care mental health workers) in accordance with the national CAMHS development strategy. Preliminary results from Departmentally-commissioned research into CAMHS in Primary Care indicate that one third of provider trusts have already developed primary mental health worker posts and one quarter had plans to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">The Government have a number of actions in place that will contribute to reducing the number of failed appointments in the national health service due to non-attendance:</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2" class="indent">Booked appointments (including in-patient and out-patient visits) have been shown to reduce the number of failed appointments due to non-attendance. By the end of 2005, all out-patient appointments and in-patient elective admissions will be pre-booked;</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/3" class="indent">Alongside this, electronic booking systems are being implemented.

	<p pid=".150W.2/4" class="indent">All acute hospital trusts now have booking systems in place in at least two specialities/high volume procedures and more than five million patients have now benefited from booked appointments. A fourth wave of the national booking programme, 'moving to mainstream', began in September 2001 and will shift booking to mainstream NHS activity.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/5" class="indent">The Modernisation Agency's Theatre Project have issued interim guidance which includes a checklist of actions for addressing patient cancellations, including validating lists and telephoning patients near the date of admission to confirm attendance. Pre-operative assessment is being rolled out as part of operating theatres and pre-operative assessment programme and should reduce non-attendance and last minute patient cancellations;</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/6" class="indent">Use of partial booking systems support reducing the level of non-attendance by ensuring patients are contacted before their appointment so that they can agree a convenient date and time.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/7">These initiatives are already starting to make an impact. As the level of booking increases and the guidance from the theatre project is spread across the NHS we will see a reduction in number of failed appointment due to non-attendance.</p>

	<p pid=".151W.9/1">For several years, botulinum toxin in very carefully timed and measured doses has been used to treat overactive muscles in adults, particularly around the eyes and in the neck. More recently, it has been used as part of the management of spasticity and dystonia sufferers. It is also useful for people with cerebral palsy. It helps relax muscles so they become less stiff&mdash;and this helps walking and movement. Botulinum toxin is usually most effective if the condition affects only a limited group of muscles.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.9/2">A decision on whether botulinum toxin treatment should be given to a particular patient would be made by the clinician at the National Health Service trust to whom the patient was referred. The injections are available in certain neurology, ophthalmology, and ear, nose and throat clinics.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.5/2">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that all carcases are inspected after slaughter for signs of bovine TB by Meat Hygiene Service Inspectors, in accordance with the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended). Those Regulations require the carcases of animals with evidence of generalised tuberculosis to be condemned as unfit for human consumption. Where there is evidence of localised disease the Regulations require the affected parts to be condemned.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.5/3">In September 2000 the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food reviewed the measures in place to protect the food chain from risks associated with &quot;M.bovis&quot; and concluded that the risk, if any, from the consumption of meat following assessment and action by the NHS staff in UK abattoirs is very low. The committee made recommendations to the Agency to reduce any residual risk still further. These measures included some changes to inspection procedures in slaughterhouses, and a change to national legislation bringing it fully into line with EU requirements. Copies of the ACMSF report were placed in the Library on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-01">1 February 2002</phrase>. The Board of the Food Standards Agency has accepted the recommendations and they will be taken forward as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.8/2">A recent pilot study conducted in Liverpool has investigated the frequency of adverse drug reaction-related hospital admissions. The findings of this study suggest that the proportion of such reactions has not altered significantly in the last decade; that is, around 5.5 per cent. of all hospital admissions are due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A follow-up study is anticipated which should identify areas in which prescribing issues and practices should be addressed in order to reduce the incidence of ADRs in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.8/3">The ADRs observed during the pilot study were subsequently submitted via the Yellow Card Scheme to the Medicines Control Agency, which is responsible for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines to ensure that medicines meet acceptable standards of safety and efficacy. Spontaneous reporting schemes, such as the UK's Yellow Card Scheme which has been in operation since 1964, are one of the primary tools used in monitoring drug safety and provide an 'early warning' of previously unrecognised drug safety hazards in association with medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.8/4">The Committee on Safety of Medicines/Medicines Control Agency receive reports of suspected ADRs from doctors, dentists, pharmacists and coroners and there is a legal requirement for companies to report suspected ADRs to their drugs. Approximately 18,000&ndash;19,000 suspected ADR reports are received each year via this scheme. The number of reports received via the Yellow Card Scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons, as this scheme is associated with an unknown level of under reporting. It is important to note that the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean it was caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as the patient's underlying illness or other medicines taken concurrently.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.8/5">Over the last 20 years, suspected ADRs submitted via the Yellow Card Scheme with a fatal outcome account for less than 3 per cent. of these reports. The Office for National Statistics also collates data on deaths certified by doctors and coroners as due to adverse effects of drugs in therapeutic use. The quality of these data may be inconsistent as many thousands of doctors write certificates with a wide variation in knowledge, training and practice. In 2000 a total of 159 deaths were certified as due to adverse effects of drugs in therapeutic use.</p>
