	<p pid="b.1W.6/1">The regional guidelines for the provision of aggregates, published in 2003 following public consultation, were based on a forecast of national demand for aggregates that was broken down to the regional level informed by regional data on aggregates consumption from the national survey of aggregate minerals. Targets for the use of secondary and recycled materials were taken into account, with the remaining demand to be met from primary aggregates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/2">The guidelines include arrangements for annual monitoring and reports are published on the Communities and Local Government website. Monitoring shows that at the national level forecast demand for aggregates for the period 2001 to 2016 remains as estimated previously. However, we propose to revise the guidelines to cover the period to 2020, and correct some minor regional differences. We will be consulting on proposed revisions shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.2W.2/1">Fire and rescue authorities (FRAs) are required by the fire and rescue service national framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. The IRMP enables the authority to tailor cover to fire and other incidents to local circumstances&mdash;evaluating where risk is greatest and allocating resource accordingly. It is not for central Government to comment upon or intervene in the operational proposals in an authority's IRMP including, in this case, any assessment of the risks posed by chemical installations in Teesside.</p>
	<p pid="b.2W.2/2">The draft fire and rescue service national framework 2008-11, which has recently been out to public consultation, requires FRAs' IRMPs to have regard to the risk analyses completed by local and regional resilience forums including those reported in external community risk registers (CRRs). Cleveland FRA will therefore need to have regard to any chemical installation risks identified in the CRR.</p>

During the course of the programme some schemes will be subject to delay. Under the terms of their partnership agreements with the Housing Corporation, housing associations and other developers are obliged to offer replacement schemes in these circumstances. In addition, as part of the Corporation's normal in year management of their programme, bids for deliverable schemes can be submitted at any time. This helps to ensure that national targets are met and resources committed.</p>

	<p pid="b.21W.2/1">Health care associated infections (HCAIs) are infections acquired in hospitals or as a result of health care interventions. &quot;Clean, Safe Care&quot; is a comprehensive strategy to tackle HCAIs and improve cleanliness, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-09">9 January 2008</phrase>. The strategy draws together recent HCAI initiatives and details new areas that national health service organisations need to consider when developing local plans to tackle infections and improve cleanliness. It emphasises the importance of a whole health economy approach as infection control strategies are only going to be successful if all parts of the NHS work closely together with the shared aim of reducing infection. The Department's improvement team is supporting primary care trusts (PCTs), as well as acute trusts, in developing a whole systems approach to the reduction in HCAIs. Our approach to setting the latest public service agreement target for <i> Clostridium difficile</i> supports this whole health economy approach, as local targets will be set at PCTs level as a rate per 10,000 population.</p>
	<p pid="b.21W.2/2">The Department has produced a focused programme to support the NHS and the independent sector in tackling HCAIs in non-acute settings, including care homes and hospices. &quot;Essential steps to safe, clean care&quot; was launched in June 2006 and revised and re-launched in June 2007. It includes a strategy for local health economies and tools and guidance on areas such as movement of patients between organisations, managing methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the non-acute setting, preventing the spread of infection, urinary catheter care and enteral feeding. We have disseminated this guidance widely and will continue to revise and update the guidance in line with emerging best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.21W.2/3">Other initiatives include:</p>

It is for local organisations to decide the best investment to meet their needs, but this level of funding could, for example, deliver additional infection control nurses in every community in addition to specialist staff in acute trusts; and</p>

	<p pid="b.33W.3/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) livelihoods programme supports the Government of Afghanistan's National Drugs Control Strategy (NDCS). The NDCS aims to reduce poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, acknowledging that sustainable drug elimination takes time. It highlights key priorities where activity is likely to make the greatest impact in the short-term. One of these priorities is strengthening and diversifying legal livelihoods so that farmers and other rural workers are no longer dependent on poppy cultivation. This means tackling key constraints such as access to markets and credit, labour opportunities and training.</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.3/2">DFID has provided over &pound;100 million over the last three years to support this aim. The majority of this funding has been channelled through the Government of Afghanistan's own national programmes, including programmes to:</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.3/3" class="indent">rehabilitate rural roads, generating employment and improving access to markets (&pound;18 million over three years, supporting rehabilitation of over 9,700 km of roads)</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.3/4" class="indent">enable communities to implement their development priorities (almost &pound;50 million over six years, supporting over 34,000 projects)</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.3/5" class="indent">provide small loans to support licit businesses (&pound;40 million over three years to support loans to over 400,000 Afghans)</p>
	<p pid="b.33W.3/6">DFID also supports research into a range of alternative crops including mint and saffron. Further information on DFID's livelihoods programme and other activities in Afghanistan is available on the DFID website at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="b.35W.9/1">The Government use a package of policy instruments to reduce emissions. Spending measures are important, but form only one element alongside, for example, regulation, fiscal measures and trading schemes. These stimulate behaviour change and investment both here and outside the UK. The Government do not make an annual estimate of the amount spent in the UK on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, though they do publish annual emissions data.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.9/2">However, modelling has been conducted for the Energy White Paper to assess the potential costs to the UK economy from meeting its long-term targets. Analysis for the 2020 target suggests that (under a hypothetical scenario and subject to appropriate caveats) acting unilaterally, UK GDP will be lower by 1.7 per cent. in 2020 compared with no action; that acting multilaterally reduces this impact to 1.3 per cent. of UK GDP in 2020; and that achieving a 30 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions would cost 0.6 per cent. of GDP in 2020 if the UK purchased abatement abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.9/3">The Stern review concluded that the costs of reducing emissions to levels that avoid the worst risks of climate change are significant but manageable, whereas delay will be costly and dangerous.</p>

	<p pid="b.39W.3/1">At pre-Budget report 2003 it was announced that the environmental benefits of LPG no longer justified the level of duty differential that it received, and that the Government would gradually increase the duty rate, setting differentials on a path towards a level commensurate with the fuel's environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.3/2">Historical LPG duty rates appear in the UK Trade Information hydrocarbon oils bulletin, available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.uktradeinfo.com">www.uktradeinfo.com</a></p>
	<p pid="b.39W.3/4">The duty rate for LPG was 9p per kilogram from 2001 until December 2006, when it rose to 12.21p per kilogram, as main road fuel duties were increased in line with inflation. It was then increased to 16.49p per kilogram on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>, when main road fuel duties rose by 2p per litre.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.3/5">Consistent with the Government's commitment to give three-year certainty on duty differentials for alternative fuels, Budget 2008 announced that differential tax rate for LPG until 2010. The differential will decrease by 1p per litre when main fuel duty rates change on each of <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.39W.6/1">The Government's policy is that fuel duty rates should rise each year at least in line with inflation as the UK seeks to reduce polluting emissions and fund public services. It is estimated that, by April 2008, fuel duty will be about the same in real terms as it was in May 1997. Therefore, fuel duty has not made a substantive impact on the real cost of motoring since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.6/2">Budget 2008 confirmed that main road fuel duty rates will rise by 1.84p per litre on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and announced that they will also rise by 0.5p per litre above indexation on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>. However, consistent with Government's stance of maintaining flexibility in responding to short-term economic conditions, Budget 2008 also announced that the planned 2p per litre increase in fuel duty due to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> would be deferred for six months, until October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.6/3">The impact of this deferral on the cost of travelling by private car will vary depending on the fuel efficiency of the car chosen, and the number of miles driven. The Government have not estimated the impact of a postponement of an inflation-linked fuel duty increase on the cost of travelling by bus or train in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.40W.2/1">The Government's policy is that fuel duty rates should rise each year at least in line with inflation as the UK seeks to reduce polluting emissions and fund public services. Budget 2008 therefore confirmed that main road fuel duty rates will rise by 1.84p per litre on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and announced that they will also rise by 0.5p per litre above indexation on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.40W.2/4">It is estimated that the three fuel duty increases announced at Budget 2008&mdash;for October 2008, April 2009 and April 2010&mdash;will lead to a reduction of 0.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2010-11. The deferral of the 2008 increase from April to October is expected to lead to an additional 0.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide being emitted in 2008-09, than would have been, had the increase gone ahead in April. However, there is no impact in subsequent years, as the rate returns to the pre-announced levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.40W.5/1">The renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) takes effect from April this year. The RTFO will require fuel suppliers to ensure that 2.5 per cent. of all fuel they supply is biofuel. This will increase to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11. This will ensure that biofuels will account for an increased percentage of fuel used across road transport, including 4x4 vehicles. Therefore, there is not a case for a reduced rate of vehicle excise duty for 4x4 vehicles using biofuels.</p>

In the meantime the UK Government will continue to work with coroners and families to ensure that inquests in England are held in the most appropriate place for those concerned.</p>

A practice direction is also being considered by the senior presiding judge to make the position clear that warrants will only be withdrawn by a properly constituted court in the future.</p>

Responsibility for all other recruitment and workforce planning rests with each of the individual probation areas. With the impending decision on the future of the DiPS and the development and implementation of its replacement, the process by which workforce planning will be conducted nationally and locally, is currently being reviewed in order to align it to future arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.57W.2/1">The design, security and technical specifications/standards for existing and new prisons are not intended for general publication and it would be impracticable to do so. There are currently over 1,000 standard and design documents of which the vast majority are detailed technical drawings. Furthermore, security could be unnecessarily compromised by general publication. If credible interested parties, including the hon. Member for Harborough, wish to gain access to this documentation, suitable secure and controlled arrangements are already in place to facilitate such requests.</p>

	<p pid="b.68W.6/2">The objectives of the Government during the review of European Directive 86/609 on animal experimentation will be to ensure efficient and effective regulation that properly balances the protection of animals against the legitimate needs of science and industry. We do not believe that wholesale changes to the Directive are necessary to achieve the main benefits sought of harmonisation and animal welfare. We believe that the Directive has stood the test of time well and still provides a sound framework for regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.6/3">We feel that the current revision of the Directive should aim to improve the regulation of animal use by focusing on key areas where regulation and harmonisation would improve animal welfare, improve scientific outputs, provide a more level playing field within the EU and improve the EU's competitiveness with other economic regions without compromising science and welfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.6/4">The vast majority of primates used in scientific procedures regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in the UK are marmosets and macaques. Then Home Secretary Jack Straw said in 1997:</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.6/5" class="indent">&quot;Great Apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, pygmy gorillas and orang-utans) have never been used under the 1986 Act as laboratory animals. But this has not previously been banned. The Government will not allow their use in the future. This is a matter of morality. The cognitive and behavioural characteristics and qualities of these animals mean it is unethical to treat them as expendable for research.&quot;</p>

Government communications have aimed to change driver behaviour, such as not leaving items on view in cars.

	<p pid="b.71W.6/1">The number of subject profiles retained on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) for each police force in the Yorkshire and Humberside area are shown in the following table. There are two figures for each force; the number of profiles and the estimated number of individuals. The number of profiles held on the database is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="b.71W.6/2">It should also be noted that the table shows the number of individuals sampled by each police force, and not the area where the people sampled are resident. For example, the figure for North Yorkshire includes people living outside North Yorkshire who have been sampled by that police force and excludes residents of North Yorkshire who have been sampled by other police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.71W.6/3">At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent. that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent. fewer than the number of profiles.</p>

	<p pid="b.78W.2/1">Government investment and support for the arts is primarily channelled through Arts Council England (ACE). Overall arts funding has increased in real terms by 73 per cent. since 1998 and in 2007-08 ACE received &pound;412 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.78W.2/2">ACE West Midlands have placed a priority on ensuring that their investment over the next three years reaches a wide range of communities, artists and audiences in Birmingham and Staffordshire. Between 2008-09 and 2010-11 ACE will provide over &pound;74 million to regularly funded organisations in Birmingham, and &pound;3.4 million to regularly funded organisations in Staffordshire.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-03-25b.196260.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-03-25b.98W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" colnum="98W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/text/80325w0022.htm#08032536001736">
	<p pid="b.98W.3/1">The principle followed is that an academy should be funded at the same level as a maintained school in the same circumstances, so far as circumstances allow. Therefore the largest component of an Academy's General Annual Grant (GAG), the school budget share, is calculated using the relevant local authority's school funding formula, together with the Learning and Skills Council's formula for sixth form provision. Other grants such as School Standards Grant and specialist school funding for which there is a national formula are calculated on the same basis as for maintained schools. Academies have certain additional grants to recognise additional responsibilities. They cannot reclaim value added tax, so a VAT grant is paid; and they also receive a grant based on the local authority's spend per pupil on central services. Start-up grants are also payable in the period after opening, to support the educational transformation required of an academy.</p>

	<p pid="b.98W.6/1">We do not collect information about the numbers of looked after children who achieve A*-C GCSE grades in English or mathematics separately. However, these data are available at a local level enabling local authorities to set targets for the attainment of looked after children at key stage 4 which include English and mathematics, These targets are negotiated with the National Strategies and Government offices and form a statutory part of a local authority's local area agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.6/2">As our Care Matters programme demonstrates we are committed to improving the education of looked after children. At national level the DCSF is matching data on looked after children to the National Pupil Database (NPD), which provides a wide range of data on the educational attainment of children and young people. From 2009 an initial analysis of looked after children to attainment data along with a range of other data will be available, including English and mathematics at GCSE.</p>

	<p pid="b.99W.2/16">Latest statutory guidance on exclusions advises that looked after children should be excluded from school only as a last resort and that schools in conjunction with the local authority should first consider alternative options for supporting the child or young person. Local authorities are under a duty to arrange suitable full-time education from the sixth day of exclusion for all permanently excluded children. The guidance makes clear the Government's view that for looked after children alternative provision should be arranged from the first day of exclusion.</p>

However, as part of the Children's Plan we have given a commitment to review best practice in effective sex and relationship (SRE) and how it is delivered in schools. We have listened to young people and recognise that many feel that they do not currently have the knowledge they need to make safe and responsible choices about relationships and sexual health. The review is being overseen by the SRE Review Steering Group which I co-chair alongside a member of the UK Youth Parliament and a member of the National Council for Educational Excellence. We are involving young people fully in the review to make sure that future SRE better their needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.8/1">Recent research published by Sheffield Hallam University on secondary school admissions in 2006 (Research Report DCSF-RR020) which included a survey of parents' experiences with the admissions system, indicated that common reasons for parents favouring their preferred secondary school included that the school has a good reputation in the community (40 per cent.) and that the school has good discipline/behaviour (19 per cent.). Reasons for parents not applying to their nearest maintained school included that the school has a poor reputation in the community (38 per cent.) and that the school has a problem with behaviour/discipline (21 per cent.). Both of these reasons could be linked to parents' fears about crime, but we have no direct evidence for this. As the Practitioners' Group on School Behaviour and Discipline has noted, incidents of the most serious misbehaviour in schools remain rare and are carried out by a very small proportion of pupils.</p>

This is why we have given schools the support as well as flexibility of funding to enable these decisions to be taken by school in line with the needs of their pupils. As part of personalising learning for children and young people, the Government are encouraging schools to consider the opportunities to children beyond the school day, and in particular through extended schools. The extended school core offer includes a varied menu of activities for children and young people, with study support as part of this. The Government have committed over &pound;1.3 billion over the next three years to support the development of extended schools, and included in this is funding to support small group tuition in some secondary schools, with funding for this becoming available in 2009-10.</p>

However, it is important to bear in mind that other countries' experiences are not directly transferable to England because the wildlife population, farming practices and general environment are all different. As a result, while we can learn from other countries' experiences, directly applying such policies here is not possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.125W.6/1">Signatories to the 2006 Courtauld Commitment between major food and drink retailers, manufacturers and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) agreed to support WRAP's business plan target of securing 100,000 tonnes/year of household food waste reduction by March this year. WRAP is currently assessing the programme's success and new targets are being drawn up which extend to 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.6/2">As part of the strategy for delivering this reduction, WRAP and its partners are also running a 'Love Food Hate Waste' campaign. This campaign is being delivered in partnership with the WI, local authorities, the UK grocery sector, food industry, Government and organisations such as the Food Standards Agency. Its aim is to help people get the most from the food they buy, and waste less of it.</p>

We continue to urge the Chinese to respect fully the human rights of those detained; to avoid use of excessive force in dealing with riots; and to respect freedom of expression and religion in Tibet. And we have called on the protesters, in Lhasa and elsewhere, to desist from further violence. We believe the best way to resolve the situation is for dialogue without pre-conditions, working towards a long-term solution acceptable to everyone.</p>

	<p pid="b.134W.5/1">The EU-China Arms Embargo and EU Code of Conduct are separate. The European Council text on the embargo is politically binding and does not have the force of law. The embargo is narrowly defined by most major European exporters as covering lethal exports only. The UK's interpretation of the embargo was set out in a written answer the then Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Derek Fatchett) gave to <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the then Member for Reading East (Jane Griffiths)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-03">3 June 1998</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1998-06-03.246"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 246-47W</phrase>. The EU Code of Conduct is the primary means of controlling arms sales and the UK regularly meets with its EU partners to discuss, enforce and strengthen it.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.5/2">There is currently no consensus within the EU to end the arms embargo. The European Council in December 2003 agreed to launch a review of the embargo, which is still under way. The matter was last discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December 2005</phrase>. The embargo will not be discussed at the next GAERC and is not scheduled to be discussed in the near future. As set out in the December 2004 European Council Conclusions, the result of any decision on the embargo should not be an increase in arms exports from EU member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms. The Government continue to fully implement the embargo.</p>

	<p pid="b.138W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth officials and I regularly discuss issues connected with the Middle East Peace Process with counterparts and senior government figures and officials in the region. The Government have made their position on Hamas, its policies and its activities clear. The international community continues to urge Hamas to renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept existing agreements and obligations, including the Roadmap. As such, Hamas compliance with international law has not been part of the discussions.</p>

	<p pid="b.138W.8/1">We are aware of reports of attacks against the house of Reverend Bedali Hulu and the difficulties facing his congregation from the Jakarta Christian Baptist Church. Christians in Indonesia, in general, enjoy a high degree of religious freedom. Their right to worship is protected under the Indonesian constitution. Regrettably there are sporadic incidents of inter-religious violence in certain areas. We continue to call for religious tolerance across Indonesia.</p>
