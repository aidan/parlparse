	<p pid="c.604W.8/1">I have been asked to respond to this question, which appears to relate both to those cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) pre-charge, in which the decision of the Service was that no further action should be taken; and post charge, to those in which a decision was taken to drop proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/2">Under statutory charging, the CPS is responsible for deciding whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence in all indictable only, either way and specified summary offences (which represent approximately 40 per cent. of all cases). In the remaining 60 per cent. of cases either the police retain the decision to charge, or proceedings are commenced by way of a summons.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/3" class="italic"> Pre-charge</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/4">CPS records show that during the year ending March 2007, the CPS took a pre-charge decision in 524,111 cases. Of these, the CPS decided that no further action should be taken in the following number of cases:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.604W.8/7"> <td><i> Pre-charge decision</i></td> <td><i> Number</i></td> <td><i> Percentage of all pre-charge decisions</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.604W.8/8"> <td>No further action-evidential grounds</td> <td>169,821</td> <td>32.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.604W.8/9"> <td>No further action- public interest</td> <td>16,276</td> <td>3.1</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/12" class="italic"> Post charge</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/13">Where a defendant has been charged with a criminal offence, the case is subject to continuing review by the prosecutor. This process can reveal where there is no longer sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, or where new information weighs against a prosecution in the public interest. In these circumstances, the CPS will decide to stop the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/14">During the year ending March 2007, the CPS stopped proceedings in respect of 107,651 defendants in the magistrates' court, representing 10.8 per cent of the 998,910 cases completed in the magistrates' court; and a further 12,102 defendants in the crown court, representing 13.1 per cent. of the 92,340 cases completed in the crown court.</p>
	<p pid="c.604W.8/15">The aim of statutory charging is to determine the correct charge and build an evidentially strong case from the outset. One of the major benefits of statutory charging agreed with the Police Service is a reduction in the post charge discontinuance rate.</p>

	<p pid="c.610W.9/1">Every one of the 64 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts provides support to victims via an Independent Domestic Violence Advisor service (comprising at least one IDVA). As there is a wide range of work patterns across the 64 areas, we do not have precise employment numbers; we prefer to focus on ensuring delivery of a service that holistically supports individuals who are victims of domestic violence. By autumn of this year, there were 130 Government-funded graduates or students on the accredited training for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, with a further 75 Government-funded places in the spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.610W.9/2">In 2006-07 the Home Office provided &pound;1.85 million funding to support Specialist Domestic Violence Courts including Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs). In 2007-08, the Ministry of Justice has secured &pound;3 million to contribute towards the Independent Domestic Violence Advisors services supporting the existing 64 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts and for services outside these areas, with a commitment to ongoing funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.610W.9/3">A review of the original Specialist Domestic Violence Courts, selected in 2005-06, (which will include the specific contribution of the Independent Domestic Violence Advisors) is being undertaken at the moment which will be disseminated in November. Part of this review will include a quantitative data analysis of all Specialist Domestic Violence Courts. The review will examine what success looks like for Specialist Domestic Violence Courts in terms of criminal justice and safety measures. Based on the findings of the review, local areas will be advised on how they can measure performance, but we do not plan to have any national performance indicators.</p>
	<p pid="c.610W.9/4">In addition to Specialist Domestic Violence Courts, IDVAs are also integral to the success of the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences. These conferences are the cornerstone of our approach to the safety of victims of domestic violence through the agreement of safety plans for identified high risk victims. Early data from those areas which have been trained in Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference are promising with significant reductions in repeat victimisation, not least due to the work of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors who often carry out over 80 per cent. of the actions agreed at the conference.</p>

	<p pid="c.612W.2/1">Closing the pay gap between men and women is a key priority for us, as I made clear in my statement to Parliament on priorities for the Ministers for Women. We see tackling the pay gap as an essential part of enabling families to have real choices about how they live their lives because the pay gap plays such a large part in the unequal division of labour in the home, preventing fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and preventing women from fulfilling their opportunities to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.612W.2/2">To galvanise this, closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new equalities public service agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as: giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working; since 1997, doubling the number of registered childcare places to 1.28 million; and guaranteeing all three and four-year-olds a free, 12&amp;frac12; hours a week 38 weeks a year Government funded, early education place.</p>

Under the delegated arrangements, it is for individual departments and agencies to determine what levels of pay are appropriate to recruit, retain and motivate their own staff, taking into account local labour markets where relevant. Where staff are required to transfer between civil service organisations, it is for the departments and agencies involved to ensure that there is no overall detriment to individuals' terms and conditions.</p>

Such negotiations take place within the parameters set by the Treasury in its annual pay remit guidance and pay policy for the wider public sector. There are no central records for 2001. Pay for the Senior Civil Service is not delegated to departments (recommendations to the Government are made by the Senior Salaries Review Body).</p>

	<p pid="c.633W.0/1">The National Audit Office measures spending performance against plans by comparing outturns against final provision following Supplementary Estimates&mdash;rather than against plans at the start of the year&mdash;as plans can change during the year for a number of reasons, such as machinery of government and classification changes. The definitive figures for final provision and provisional outturn are published each year in the Public Expenditure Outturns White Paper. Changes to plans arising in-year are published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, as are differences between provisional and final outturns.</p>
	<p pid="c.633W.0/2">In 2001-02 the Capital outturn for DCMS was &pound;48 million less than planned expenditure. The under spend was due in the most part to the slow start to the Capital Modernisation Fund project &quot;Spaces for Sport and Art&quot;.

	<p pid="c.643W.0/1">Both of these reports found no conclusive evidence of a link between playing violent games and behaving violently in real life. Both reports confirmed therefore that the current regulatory regime is satisfactory. However, following concerns expressed by some people, we worked with the games industry on a package of measures designed to ensure that parents had sufficient knowledge about a game's contents so that they could make an informed decision when purchasing the game for their children. These measures included bigger classification symbols; advice explaining the type of content; strengthened guidance for retail staff; all games for adults to be classified by the British Board of Film Classification even if there is no statutory requirement to do so; and a website publicised by five million leaflets where parents can learn about the content of games and their classification.</p>

	<p pid="c.643W.7/2"><i> :</i> The correct information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.7/3">The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister before it has since 2000 provided a system of performance incentivisation for local authorities in England across a range of service areas. This system operated via the Local Public Service Agreements (LPSA), which have since been merged with Local Area Agreements (LAA). These agreements offered a reward grant to local authorities who could deliver outcomes over and above the level of performance Government would otherwise expect.</p>
	<p pid="c.643W.7/4">64 local authorities chose to include in their LPSA or LAA a measure performance on adoption and/or stability of placements for looked-after children, though the targets would not refer specifically to babies under the age of six months. Reward would be payable to local authorities and their partners for achievement of these particular targets, and in a number of cases this has now been claimed. Details on each target have been made available in the Library of the House, though we do not have data on the age of the children adopted in local authority areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.646W.5/2">This amount relates to a wide range of start-up expenditure that is necessary to regenerate difficult brownfield sites and create thriving new communities, such as providing essential infrastructure, sustainable urban drainage systems, community facilities and so on. The Millennium Communities programme as a whole is bringing forward seven new schools and colleges, five new health centres, 10 new public parks and play areas, and eight new community buildings. In addition, over 70,000 sq m of commercial and retail accommodation will be created. As an example, at the New Islington Millennium Community in Manchester the public investment is creating a new canal network, roads and infrastructure, a new primary school, a state of the art health centre, car club, child care facilities, an energy centre and 6,000 sq m of employment floorspace in addition to the 1,400 new homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.5/3">It is anticipated that some 75 per cent. of this public investment will be recouped in due course through receipts. The precise final figure will be known when the sites have been completed and developments sold. In addition, a significant amount of private sector investment has been levered in to these seven regeneration areas. This is currently some &pound;749 million, which represents a private:public ratio of 8:1.</p>

	<p pid="c.647W.2/1">Since 1997, 127 local authorities have completed 198 transfers involving 831,481 homes. Since 2001 the number of non-decent homes on the date of transfer has totalled 246,781; numbers of non-decent homes transferring were not recorded prior to this date but we estimate between 1997 and 2001 there were around 155,000 non-decent homes that were transferred. Nearly 139,000 of transferred dwellings have been tackled since 2001 according to RSL data returns, representing a 56 per cent. reduction in the number of non-decent homes.</p>

These reports have been accepted by the European Commission, and CLG and the programme managers have been acting on the recommendations within these reports.

	<p pid="c.665W.3/1">In April 2006 four social landlords began piloting Social Homebuy on a voluntary basis. The pilot scheme, which will run until March 2008, allows participating local authorities and housing associations to offer tenants living in social rented accommodation the opportunity to purchase discounted shares of their home starting with an initial share of 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.665W.3/2">The majority of the 88 sales to date have come from completions with the first phase of participating landlords, most of whom joined in late 2006. 85 were from housing association and three were from local authorities. Since April this year a second phase of landlords have joined the pilot scheme and are now offering Social Homebuy to their tenants. As with normal home purchases it can take several months to reach completion.</p>
	<p pid="c.665W.3/3">In all there are now 77 housing associations and nine local authorities who are offering tenants the chance to purchase a share in their home.</p>

	<p pid="c.666W.0/1">The Government set up the Affordable Rural Housing Commission to look into ways to improve the affordability of rural housing. Since its report in May 2006 we have taken a series of measures to help address rural problems, including changes to planning rules and a commitment to set a rural target for affordable housing over the next three years in light of the advice from regional housing boards which is done later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.0/2">The Government set out measures in the Housing Green Paper which will help rural as well as urban areas. The detail of where new homes should be built is a matter for local planning authorities to determine.</p>

	<p pid="c.666W.6/1">It is vital that non-statutory organisations such as voluntary and community sector groups and businesses are fully involved in partnership working to agree and deliver local area agreements. Indeed in most areas they are already involved in collaborative working through the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) for the area. The 2006 LSP survey showed that over 80 per cent. of LSPs have voluntary sector umbrella organisations among their membership and nearly two thirds involve businesses. We want LSPs to develop this further because these sectors have a valuable contribution to make to discussions and can help to deliver in ways in which mainstream public sector providers can find difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.6/2">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, requires that the upper-tier or 'responsible' local authority must consult such other persons as appear to it to be appropriate, during the preparation of both the Sustainable Community Strategy and Local Area Agreement. While this will allow local authorities to exercise their discretion in this matter, we would expect responsible local authorities to consult with appropriate representatives of the local voluntary, community and business sectors. We will make this obligation clear through the statutory guidance to accompany the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.6/3">In addition, all local authorities now have a local compact in place which, if utilised, can help deliver real change for communities by recognising the third sector's independence, partnership working, diversity and right to campaign. Local authorities and their partners should consider how compact principles can be embedded in local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.6/4">To help ensure third sector organisations are effectively involved in the LAA process we have also worked with national third sector organisations to develop guiding principles of representation, based on their experience of what has proved successful. We will shortly be releasing these principles as a discussion paper.</p>

Accordingly, the roles MPs take on Local Strategic Partnerships are varied and can range from non-representation through to chairing the partnership.</p>

	<p pid="c.681W.2/1">Estimates of the type sought will vary substantially according to the assumptions made on matters such as the range of developments to which local policies arc applied, the expected number of developments to be completed, their energy demands, the extent to which the provision of installed equipment complies with the original planning permission and whether the technologies installed in practice provide the predicted savings. However the Government have set out a timetable for all new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. This will require significant increases in the use of renewables and we have assessed that overall implementation of this policy will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.2/2">Using their own assumptions, the London of borough of Merton have estimated the demand for renewable energy arising from Merton style policies and, more recently, a study for the Greater London Authority by the London South Bank University has considered the energy performance of applications referred to the Mayor. More generally, an overview of the estimated impact of our energy measures is provided in our White Paper, &quot;Meeting the Energy Challenge&quot; and supporting publications.</p>

	<p pid="c.682W.0/1">The London borough of Merton adopted their Unitary Development Plan in 2003 with a policy that expects new non residential developments above a threshold of l,000 sq m to incorporate renewable energy production equipment to provide at least 10 per cent. of predicted energy requirements. In doing so they were the first local authority in the UK to include a policy of this kind in a UDP. The council has been heavily involved in promoting the approach leading it to be coined the Merton Rule.</p>

Winter fuel payments significantly help with fuel costs in coldest months.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.5/50">Other measures that have had a positive impact include CLG's Decent Homes Standard; local authority programmes; and the systematic approach adopted in a number of warm zone areas. The Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2005-08 requires electricity and gas suppliers to meet targets for the promotion of improvements in domestic energy efficiency to a priority group of low income consumers.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.5/51">We have taken further steps to increase efforts to tackle fuel poverty in the Energy White Paper and we are currently taking forward the implementation of these actions, which include improved Government communications during winter, further encouragement of suppliers to direct assistance at their vulnerable customers, improvements to Government schemes and better use of information held by Government. Next steps will be set out in the Fifth Annual Fuel Poverty Progress Report.</p>

BERR does not collect information on regional petrol prices. A range of factors determine retail petrol and diesel prices. Price differentials between rural and urban areas reflect different costs in distributing and supplying petrol and diesel. Price setting is a commercial matter for individual companies. The Office of Fair Trading continues to monitor the UK petrol market to ensure that anti-competitive behaviour does not occur. Customers should refer any complaints concerning pricing and anti-competitive behaviour to the Office of Fair Trading. In the past five years there has been one investigation, carried out by the Office of Fair Trading in 2006, and this did not result in any action against the companies concerned.</p>

	<p pid="c.697W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.697W.5/2">Such mechanisms already exist. As part of its economic regulation of airport charges at Heathrow (under Part IV of the Airports Act 1986), the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) put in place in 2003 a regime of service quality targets for BAA with financial penalties if these targets were not met on a month-by-month basis. Similar targets and penalties are also in place at Gatwick airport. As part of the current review of price controls and other economic regulation of Heathrow and Gatwick, the Competition Commission has recently recommended strengthening and extending this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.697W.5/3">In addition, the CAA through its price controls encourages timely investment in facilities, many of which are designed to improve conditions for passengers. This has provided sufficient incentive for BAA to bring forward investment in Terminal 5, which is scheduled to open in March 2008 as planned, and which should significantly enhance passenger experience across the airport. Looking forward, the Competition Commission has recently recommended that future investment at Heathrow be further incentivised through greater financial penalties for later delivery of projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.697W.5/4">The CAA will be consulting on its regulatory proposals, in light of the Commission's recommendations, in November, with a view to setting new controls on Heathrow and Gatwick in early 2008 for the five years 2008-13.</p>

	<p pid="c.701W.11/1">Steps have been taken to raise migrant workers' awareness of their workplace rights and how to report instances of abuse. All accession country (A8 and A2) workers required to register under the Home Office's Worker Registration Scheme now receive a one page 'Know Your Rights' leaflet alongside their registration documents. The leaflet&mdash;available in six languages&mdash;includes telephone numbers and website addresses for the workplace enforcement bodies and other advice bodies. 'Know Before You Go' leaflets are also available to Lithuanian, Polish and Portuguese nationals before they leave for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.701W.11/2">It is now easier for migrant workers, whose main language is not English, to report instances of abuse to the workplace enforcement bodies. Translation services are available for those who wish to use the various enforcement helplines, and complaints can be submitted by e-mail. Reports about abuses of the National Minimum Wage regulations, for example, can be made to the helpline on 0845 6000 678 or via e mail using the complaint form at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/nmw/complaint.htm">www.hmrc.gov.uk/nmw/complaint.htm</a>. Where migrant workers work through an employment agency, and they have concerns about mistreatment, they can contact the Employment Agency Standards helpline on 0845 955 5105, or send an email to eas@berr.gsi. gov.uk.</p>

	<p pid="c.706W.8/1">As stated in the Government's response to the public consultation on the post office network, closures will principally affect a combination of branches in areas of over-provision and those that are least used. Post Office Ltd. will be tasked with taking a strategic overview of service provision to ensure that in areas of over-provision, people should be able to find an alternative branch nearby and the vast majority will still be within walking distance of their nearest office. With the least used, the number of people affected will, by the nature of the offices, be low. The introduction of new access criteria will minimise the impact by ensuring that the network remains readily accessible across the UK&mdash;with far greater coverage than any other retailer, financial service provider or public service provider.</p>

	<p pid="c.716W.2/1">Under the EC habitats and birds directives, the UK has established a network of sites to protect habitats and species. There are currently 182 marine protected areas in UK inshore waters (up to 12 nautical miles), which include 81 Special Protections Areas with marine habitats for birds, 98 Special Areas of Conservation with marine habitats or species, and three statutory marine nature reserves. We are carrying out surveys of marine areas to identify further sites that will meet the obligations under the directives.</p>

Through the Marine Bill, the Government will deliver a new framework for the sustainable development of the UK marine area. The MCZ mechanism will provide a flexible tool which allows for the designation of a full range of sites, from areas of limited protection to areas of very high protection. It will be possible to designate MCZs anywhere within marine waters over which the UK Government exercises jurisdiction, namely UK offshore waters and the territorial sea adjacent to England.</p>

	<p pid="c.717W.0/1">The Department is in regular contact with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and has provided, when required, the latest scientific information on the state of the key EU fish stocks, based on advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The FSA is currently gathering a range of material to support a sustainability assessment on its advice that consumers should eat more fish, and will seek further input from DEFRA as necessary. In the meantime, the FSA advice, which I support, remains that consumers should be encouraged to eat two portions of fish per week (including one of oily fish).</p>

It is not however possible to assess what proportion of these increases has been as a direct consequence of the FSA advice.</p>

	<p pid="c.719W.2/1">Officials from the four UK Administrations have explored a number of methods for dividing the UK European Fisheries Fund (EFF) budget. These include the use of metrics (such as value of fishing industry output), numbers employed in the fisheries sector, number of fishing businesses and dependence on fisheries. It was concluded that none of these offered an allocation that was considered reasonable by all four Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="c.719W.2/2">For this reason, the Administrations agreed that a budget-split based on the split for the previous grant scheme, Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), offered the most reasonable compromise.</p>
	<p pid="c.719W.2/3">While provisional agreement has been reached for use of the FIFG split for the non-convergence budget, Administrations have failed to reach final agreement on the use of this method for the convergence budget. I am continuing to seek a resolution and, if necessary, will do so through the dispute resolution procedures set out in the devolution agreements.</p>

	<p pid="c.720W.8/1">Flycapture, the national database of fly-tipping incidents, was set up in 2004 by DEFRA, the Environment Agency and the Local Government Association, to record the number of fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the Environment Agency and local authorities. Flycapture does not record fly-tipping tonnages.</p>
	<p pid="c.720W.8/2">However, WasteDataFlow, the online system for local authorities to report on their municipal waste, does include a category for fly-tipping tonnages. In 2005-06 (the only year for which complete data are available), authorities reported around 140,000 tonnes of residual waste arising from the clearance of fly-tipped materials. However, this figure is likely to be an underestimate where authorities collect fly-tipped tonnages as part of their street cleaning or other regular waste collection rounds, or are able to send this waste for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="c.722W.6/1">Gyrodactylus salaris (Gs) is a parasite that has the potential to cause widespread losses in both wild and farmed Atlantic salmon. The UK is free of Gs and we have robust legislative safeguards on trade in live fish to help ensure this remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.722W.6/2">DEFRA has carried out publicity campaigns in recent years to raise awareness among the public and advice on how to keep Gs out of the country is contained in our &quot;Keep Fish Diseases Out&quot; series of guidance leaflets. We are planning a further campaign before the summer of 2008 and although details have yet to be finalised, a key theme will be the danger of introducing Gs through travel to and from high-risk areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.722W.6/3">DEFRA also has comprehensive contingency plans for combating Gs and officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in other Departments and the devolved administrations on measures to update these plans and awareness campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="c.726W.6/1">The Waste Strategy Board has been established to drive forward and monitor delivery of Waste Strategy 2007 targets across Government. The board will develop new policy actions to achieve Waste Strategy objectives as necessary and in light of progress made in specific areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.6/2">The Waste Strategy sets out measures that the Government have put in place to secure the investment in infrastructure needed to divert waste from landfill. This includes working with Communities and Local Government to take forward specific aspects of the strategy, including planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.6/3">It remains vital that regional spatial strategies and local development documents look forward and make adequate provision for the appropriate types and scales of infrastructure and waste treatment facilities needed, including biological treatment plants.

The programme aims to prove the economic, social and environmental viability of each selected technology, half of which are biological treatment technologies. Each site will have a visitor centre, which will be open throughout the plant's participation in the programme. These will enable representatives from local authorities and the waste sector to learn more about the particular strengths and weaknesses of each technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.6/6">As mentioned in the Waste Strategy 2007, DEFRA is also considering ways to raise public awareness of the options and issues relating to waste management infrastructure, including biological treatment plants. The aim is to provide evidence-based information which will aid public comprehension of the options. Communications activity is tentatively planned for early 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.728W.4/1">DFID monitors the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan very closely. We receive regular updates from The United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan and other UN agencies such as the High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Office for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.4/2">Since 2001 over 4.8 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan, but it still has the largest number of refugees in the world. Over one-quarter of the country's population is reported to have sought refuge outside the country. As of August 2007, more than 120,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were spread across the country but mainly in the south. More long term IDPs are occurring in the south, caused mainly by drought and insecurity. Recent displacement is caused by human rights violations, inter-communal tensions, floods or drought. According to government figures, conflict in the south this year has displaced 15,000-20,000 families. Afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world and estimates suggest that mines and unexploded ordinance kill or injure an average of two Afghans every day; 50 per cent. of these victims are children.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.4/3">According to recent reports from the United Nations, humanitarian access has become a growing challenge, with at least 78 districts rated as extremely risky and inaccessible to UN agencies. At the end of August this year, the total number of reported incidents show that 41 humanitarian workers had been killed, and 70 had been abducted, with one tenth of those abducted killed by their captors.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.4/4">In 2006-07 DFID provided &pound;1.6 million in bilateral humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Afghanistan is also one of the largest recipients of UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) support, to which the UK is the largest contributor (23 per cent. of total CERF value in 2006). Afghanistan received $32.3 million from CERF in 2006. We also provide core funding to UNICEF, the World Food Programme, and UNHCR, all of whom have operations in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.729W.6/1">Detail from the European Commission on how the blue card scheme would work is not yet available. This makes it difficult to assess the potential impact of the scheme on technical and engineering capacity of developing African countries both in conflict and post-conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.729W.6/2">However, DFID is very conscious of the consequences for developing countries of 'brain drain' and is taking measures to address skills shortages in key sectors in Africa. For example, DFID is working to strengthen the capacity of health systems in countries such as Malawi to retain health workers, and in some countries we are supporting efforts to attract skilled professionals back to key sectors. Countries in conflict are prone to losing skilled staff through out-migration. Post-conflict reconstruction and development programmes can create new job opportunities for engineers and some technical specialists, although it takes time to rebuild an adequate pool of skilled people.</p>

We are providing &pound;4 million over four years through the United Nations Development Programme to improve food security and enable people in rural areas to increase their family incomes, and we are funding community development programmes through non-governmental organisations. We are also providing &pound;1.8 million over three years to help meet the needs of Burmese refugees on the Thai border.

The Pooled Fund&mdash;now totalling some $100 million&mdash;allocates resources for priority humanitarian food, health, water and sanitation and protection activities. A recent emergency allocation of $5 million from the Pooled Fund was provided to UNICEF, WFP and others for additional food, health and shelter items for the displaced population. The UK is the largest humanitarian donor in DRC and the largest contributor to the Pooled Fund. The Humanitarian Co-ordinator has also called upon the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to provide an additional emergency allocation of $5 million for the current crisis in the east. DFID is one of the main contributors to the CERF.</p>

In addition, we have lobbied for all agencies to focus all available resources on those areas most in need in DRC at this time.</p>

	<p pid="c.737W.5/1">The humanitarian situation in Darfur is deteriorating. The seasonal 'hunger gap' has been more acute this year with higher than expected rates of malnutrition, particularly in the camps. Furthermore, ongoing clashes have meant that the number of people displaced continues to rise: a further 260,000 people this year alone, adding to the more than two million people already living in camps across the region. The camps are overstretched and becoming increasingly volatile. Recent violence in Kalma camp, South Darfur, has re-displaced up to 30,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="c.737W.5/2">The increase in needs has been compounded by an escalation of attacks by armed groups against humanitarian agencies. Since the start of the year, over 100 humanitarian vehicles have been hijacked, often violently, and five humanitarian aid workers have been killed. This is having a serious impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver vital aid to those in need.</p>

	<p pid="c.738W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/2">Multiple sclerosis is a disorder whose cause is currently unknown. There is no published peer-reviewed scientific or medical evidence to suggest any link with particular occupations including between any factor of service in the armed forces and the development of multiple sclerosis.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/3">Information is not held centrally as to the total number of serving and retired service personnel suffering from multiple sclerosis and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/4">Records do however show that there are 380 former service personnel currently in receipt of a war disablement pension under the War Pension Scheme (WPS), with an accepted claim for multiple sclerosis. The records do not identify when these pensioners were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or whether it was the reason for their discharge.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/5">The WPS provides no-fault compensation for all former service personnel disabled as a result of their service in the armed forces before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. Awards are made under the WPS where, on the individual case facts and under the legislation, a causal link to service can be accepted. The WPS onus and standard of proof mean that causal links may be lawfully recognised which do not reflect contemporary medical evidence. Where a disablement has clinical onset during service and leads to medical discharge, claims are automatically considered. In that situation or where a claim is made within seven years of service termination, entitlement will be certified unless it can be shown by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that service has played no part in the cause or course of the disorder. In these circumstances claims for multiple sclerosis may succeed on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/6">Any service personnel who develop multiple sclerosis in service and are medically discharged may be entitled to ill-health benefits under the terms of their occupational pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/7">Information is not held centrally which can identify former service personnel released on non-medical grounds, who have subsequently been awarded war pensions for suffering the symptoms of multiple sclerosis while in service. To obtain the information would involve the examination of individual files which could be done only at disproportionate cost&mdash;there are currently around 178,000 people in receipt of a war disablement pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/8">No service personnel have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and awarded attributable benefits under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. Less than five service personnel have been discharged without benefits. The scheme provides no-fault compensation for all serving and former service personnel for injury/illness caused on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. It awards benefits where the evidence shows, on the balance of probabilities, that service is the predominant cause of the injury or disorder.</p>

	<p pid="c.740W.3/3" class="italic"> Letter from Duncan Gilchrist, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-29">29 October 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what contracted-out IT projects for the Child Support Agency have been concluded since 1997; how many times the specification for each such project was changed; and what changes in specification were made. (160372)</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/6" class="indent">All contracted out IT projects since 1997 were incorporated into the Child Support Reforms programme and subsequently the Operational Improvement Plan supplied by EDS and BT. Although the CS2 system developed by EDS still had residual defects the Child Support Reforms programme was technically concluded in August 2005 with a &pound;107m downward adjustment to the contracted cost, which was used by the Department to help fund the Operational Improvement Plan. In addition to the contracted scope for the Child Support Reforms programme, the Agency requested 130 detailed changes, plus the development of a management information system.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/7" class="indent">Following a period of requirements development an outsourced programme to deliver the IT Strand of the Agency's Operational Improvement Plan was started in November 2006. This programme comprises a number of interconnected projects some of which have been delivered. Completed projects with the Operational Improvement Programme IT Strand are:</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/8" class="indent">CS2 bulk conversion capability</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/9" class="indent">CS2 top priority defect fixes</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/10" class="indent">Support for external debt collection agencies</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/11" class="indent">Clerical database enhancements</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/12" class="indent">Interim telephony enhancements</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/13" class="indent">Interim workflow enhancements</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/14" class="indent">CS2 performance enhancements</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/15" class="indent">Incorporation of the DWP Customer Information System (as a replacement to the Departmental Central Index)</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/16" class="indent">Upgrades to the complaints handling system</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.3/17" class="indent">The major components of the programme, fundamentally enhanced CS2 and telephony applications to support the Agency's new business model, are scheduled for delivery by EDS and BT to the Agency in the current financial year. So far there has been one change to the detailed requirements for the CS2 project, which has been absorbed by EDS without any impact on cost. This change involved numerous low level detailed changes to support more efficient running in the operational environment.</p>

	<p pid="c.742W.2/5" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. It should be noted that that an outstanding or uncleared application is not necessarily the same as an unprocessed one. The amount of work required to clear a case and the time involved varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they co-operate with the Agency. Uncleared applications will be at varying stages in the application processes, with very few being completely unprocessed.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.2/6" class="indent">As at the end of September 2007, the Agency had 160 uncleared new scheme cases over 5 years old in the East of England of which 20 were in Suffolk. New scheme uncleared cases over 5 years old are those which were previously under the old scheme, and have been converted to the new scheme via a new scheme calculation. When a new child support application is made, it may be established that the case has one or more links, through the parent with care or non-resident parent or their partners, to existing cases. If a link is established to one or more cases on the old computer system (CSCS), these cases will be transferred to the new computer system (CS2), along with any further cases that are linked to this chain. This is known as reactive migration.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.2/7" class="indent">As at the end of September 2007, the Agency had, 1,750 transitional cases uncleared over 5 years old in the East of England of which 130 were in Suffolk. Transitional cases are those subject to the rules of the old Child Support Scheme but which are held on the new scheme computer system, CS2.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.2/8" class="indent">Management information on the number of uncleared cases broken down into regions or counties for old scheme cases processed on the CSCS system is not available.</p>

The cost of meeting the higher child maintenance disregard from 2010-11 has been factored into the planning that will inform that value for money agreement.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.2/2">The three page claim form that has been introduced means less bureaucracy and better service for pension credit customers. One phone call can give customers access to four benefits&mdash;pension credit, state retirement pension, council tax benefit (CTB) and housing benefit (HB). This form is completed for the customer. All they need to do is check it, sign it and send it back.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.2/3">We are taking other measures to promote the take up of CTB. There are annual awareness campaigns. We have provided local authorities with best practice guidance that contains information about barriers to claiming, ways of overcoming them, and case study examples of good practice to improve take-up. We have supported the three page form arrangements with computer scans run by the Pension Service to discover people getting pension credit but not CTB and this information is passed to local authorities. We encourage local authorities to do take-up activity through our performance standards and have awarded &pound;2.2 million to 38 authorities to increase CTB take-up.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.2/4">In the longer term, we want to deliver CTB as accessibly, simply and securely as possible. We want to research the feasibility of using data held &quot;across Government&quot; to build profiles of people likely to be entitled. We also want to develop the concept of a &quot;single point of contact&quot; for pensioners, coupled with alignment of application processes that will provide greater efficiency and a better public service.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.2/5">Our assessment shows that enabling people to access CTB and HB via the Pension Service has resulted so far in over 65,000 more people being paid those benefits.</p>

This was the last of DWP's major assets to be disposed of as it moves from asset ownership to contracting for services. There are no material disposals planned for 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.747W.5/2"><i> </i>In the 2006-07 financial year the Department for Work and Pension's total expenditure (including VAT) on contracted provision was &pound;4,270 million. This represents 3.36 per cent. of the Department's total budget. In line with Treasury guidance the total budget figure used in this calculation comprises both the Department's departmental expenditure limit and annually managed expenditure. It should be noted that the Department's annually managed expenditure largely covers the cost of benefit payments.</p>

During the 2003-04 financial year DWP reviewed its accounting policy in respect of capitalisation of expenditure on improvements to leasehold properties.

These will be provided by the ETS in its annual report. ETS does not routinely collect information on the age and sector of claimants, but BERR does carry out periodic surveys of employment tribunal findings. The last was carried out in 2003 (DTI/Pub 7531/0.9k/08/04/AR. URN 04/1071).

	<p pid="c.756W.2/1">The 'core' pension as defined by the financial assistance scheme standardises some pension features for ease of administration and to protect the public purse. For example, payments start from 65 rather than scheme pension age and no indexation is provided. The cash and NPV costs of paying 90 per cent. of core pension are in the following table and sum to approximately &pound;10 billion in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.2/2">We do not have the data to estimate accurately an 'expected' pension. Schemes that qualify for the financial assistance scheme have very different scheme rules, for example, on indexation and revaluation (particularly for pre-1997 pension accruals), and it is not possible to make precise estimates of these differences.</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.2/3">In the Government response to the report by the parliamentary ombudsman on occupational pensions (Trusting in the Pensions Promise, June 2006), we estimated the total cost of meeting expected pensions at between &pound;13 billion and &pound;17 billion in cash terms to reflect this uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="c.759W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-29">29 October 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.759W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>

	<p pid="c.759W.3/5" class="indent">and</p>

	<p pid="c.759W.3/7" class="indent">At the end of September 2007, the Child Support Agency had 67,900 cases assessed under old rules where the non-resident parent lived in Scotland and in 1,400 of these cases, the non-resident parent lived in the Angus constituency. These figures cover all cases, including those with a positive assessment as well as those currently with a nil maintenance liability. The available information relates to cases only, a non-resident parent may have more than one case.</p>
	<p pid="c.759W.3/8" class="indent">The number of cases transferred from the old to the new system of assessment is provided in the attached table. When a new child support application is made, the case may have one or more links, through the parent with care or non-resident parent or their partners, to existing cases. If a link is established to one or more cases on the old computer system, then these cases will be transferred to the new computer system, along with any further cases that are linked to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.759W.3/9" class="indent">It is expected the number of old scheme cases will reduce from around 740,000 to around 300,000 before cases move into the new statutory maintenance service expected to start in 2010-11. The reason for this is predominantly the age and nature of these cases. It is also expected that a number of clients will wish to leave the statutory maintenance service and make their own arrangements following the removal of compulsion. Separate estimates have not been made for Scotland or the Angus constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.759W.3/10" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.764W.17/2"><i> </i>The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is intended to pay compensation based on those benefits generally provided on the winding up of a pension scheme, and so does not incorporate additional benefits beyond basic retirement and survivor's benefits. The Government took a policy decision to focus the PPF compensation on these basic benefits to avoid an excessive burden on the Pension Protection Levy, which is paid by other pension schemes. For that reason, the costs of providing additional benefits such as ill-health early retirement were excluded from consideration at an early stage and were not costed during policy development for the Pensions Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.17/3">The Department has, however, estimated indicative costs for the PPF introducing early compensation on ill health grounds; these estimates are highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions. If, for example, 5 per cent. of PPF deferred members qualified for ill-health compensation without actuarial reduction, they lived on average until the same age as those retiring in normal health and the average age at which they qualified was 50, the reserves of the PPF in respect of deferred members would have to rise by approximately 2 per cent. The PPF estimate that such an increase would require an increase in the Pension Protection Levy from &pound;675 million by 10 per cent.</p>

Current guidance is that calls provided by BT will be charged at up to four pence per minute at all times. A call set up fee of three pence per call applies to calls from residential lines. Mobile and other providers' charges may vary.</p>
	<p pid="c.767W.5/3" class="indent">0800 99 1234 Pension Credit Application Line is a free phone number and there is no charge for calls to this number from a BT Landline. Mobile and other providers' charges may vary.</p>

	<p pid="c.767W.5/9">The Pension Service always offers to call customers back if the customer expresses any concerns about the costs being incurred.</p>
	<p pid="c.767W.5/10">All Public Service providers are currently assessing the impact of migrating call numbers to the new '03' range. The Pension Service will also review the existing range of telephone numbers and consider simplifying access to our services for our customers.

	<p pid="c.768W.11/35">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Based on income measured after housing costs the number of pensioners in Great Britain living in relative poverty has fallen by more than one million between 1996-97 and 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.11/36">We will continue to build on this good progress. A new Public Service Agreement 'Tackle poverty and promote greater independence in later life', published as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2007 clearly demonstrates that tackling the problems of low income amongst older people remains a key Government priority.</p>

	<p pid="c.774W.5/2">Following the review of Remploy last year by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, we asked the Remploy board to bring forward a five-year restructuring plan both to modernise the business and to support substantially larger numbers of disabled people into work, ensuring that there would be no compulsory redundancies of disabled employees, and that their full terms and conditions&mdash;including rights to final salary pensions&mdash;would be protected.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.5/3">Remploy announced their initial proposals on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-19">19 August</phrase>, the Secretary of State appointed Roger Poole to chair the negotiations over the proposals between Remploy and the trade unions. Although substantial progress was made, these talks concluded with a formal failure to agree.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.5/4">The Secretary of State has now requested a final report from the Remploy board on the modernisation of the company, no later than <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November 2007</phrase>. We recognise that despite substantial progress, significant issues remain unresolved. Nonetheless, these remaining differences can and should be bridged. We continue to believe that a negotiated settlement represents the best outcome for Remploy.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.5/5">A decision on the future of Remploy will be made by the Secretary of State once a final report from the board is received. Until then, no Government decision will be made concerning Remploy's factories.</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.2/1">At July 2007, &pound;264.3 million was outstanding in social fund loans to beneficiaries no longer in receipt of benefits from which deductions can be made. This figure is, generally speaking, obviously inversely proportional to success rates in moving customers off benefits and into work</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/2">To ensure that the recovery of theses monies continues once benefit deduction is no longer possible, these cases are in the process of being transferred to the Department's Shared Services Debt Management organisation. This transfer will be completed by the end of March 2008. This will ensure that Debt Management's specialist skills and technology can be used to the best effect to recover these loans.</p>

	<p pid="c.783W.2/2"><i> </i>The figure of 0.8 million was a calculation of the number of foreign nationals estimated to have arrived in the United Kingdom since 1997 and be in employment (1.4 million) less the number of foreign nationals in employment in 1997 who are no longer in employment (or no longer foreign nationals) (0.6 million). Using a revised methodology we now estimate the net difference to be 1.1 million rather than 0.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.2/3">In addition, there are an estimated 0.05 million foreign nationals in employment in 2007 who were in the United Kingdom in 1997 but not in employment. Adding this figure to the 1.1 million gives a total net increase of foreign nationals in employment of 1.1 million rounded to the nearest 100,000, as set out in the answer to PQ/07/158012.</p>

	<p pid="c.788W.2/1">We took this decision as part of the comprehensive spending review in order to target resources on our top priorities and the country's long-term needs. Our policy not only responds to the challenge in the Leitch report to increase the proportion of the work force with higher level skills from under 30 per cent. now to over 40 per cent. by 2020 but is also fairer to both taxpayers and students who have not yet entered higher education. The overall effect of these changes on the income of individual institutions will depend on how successful they are in attracting students who meet our priorities. Every institution will have an incentive to maximise its share of the &pound;100 million which will be redistributed through this change and no complete assessment of these changes on any institution can be made until that &pound;100 million has been re-distributed.</p>

	<p pid="c.791W.2/2"><i> </i>We took this decision as part of the comprehensive spending review in order to target resources on our top priorities and the country's long-term needs. While the policy has been set, we have asked HEFCE to consult widely on how it should be implemented. Our policy not only responds to the challenge in the Leitch report to increase the proportion of the work force with graduate level skills from under 30 per cent. now to over 40 per cent. by 2020 but is also fairer to both taxpayers and students who have not yet entered higher education. The overall effect of these changes on the income of individual institutions will depend on how successful they are in attracting students who meet our priorities. Every institution will have an incentive to maximise its share of the &pound;100 million which will be redistributed through this change.</p>

	<p pid="c.795W.0/2">However, we can give an indication of the number and proportion of year 11 leavers taken at <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase> in the year that they leave school and this is in the tables attached. Information cannot be broken down by parliamentary constituency, and figures for Jarrow are not available. Information is available at local authority level after 2001. Data from 1997-2000 is only available by Careers Company area and the figures for these years show Tyneside as a whole.</p>

Figures for 2006 will be published in the &quot;Judicial Statistics&quot; report, planned for release in late November. Data for earlier years are not available.

	<p pid="c.799W.0/2">Provisions in the Children and Adoption Act 2006 enable the court when making a family assistance order to require the CAFCASS officer or a Welsh family proceedings officer, appointed to work with the family, to report on such matters in relation to any contact order in force as the court may direct.

	<p pid="c.799W.0/4">The Ministry of Justice has carried out research &quot;Making Contact Happen or Making Contact work: The process and outcomes of in-court conciliation&quot;.

	<p pid="c.799W.0/5">Between six and nine months after a contact order was made, a fifth of agreements had not worked at all, most agreements were intact or had been extended, most cases were closed with low relitigation rates, many more children were having increased contact and more parents were satisfied with the quality and quantity of contact.</p>

	<p pid="c.804W.11/2">The Youth Justice Board are currently piloting 'Intensive Fostering' in three areas. There is funding available for thirteen places across the three pilot sites. So far thirty six young people have been on the programme. We are working closely with the Youth Justice Board to monitor the progress of these pilots and they are being evaluated by York university.

	<p pid="c.814W.12/1">Poppy eradication in Helmand Province is performed by Afghans in the Poppy Eradication Force (PEF) and in the Governor Led Eradication (GLE) forces. There are approximately 615 personnel in the PEF. Governor Wafa has not confirmed how many personnel he will commit to the GLE force this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.12/2">UK personnel do not conduct eradication, but do provide support to the planning and targeting work. Implementation of eradication is the responsibility of the Afghan Government. No eradication targets have been set for Helmand for 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.12/3">The Government's main involvement in livelihoods diversification in Helmand is through the Department for International Development (DFID)&mdash;funded Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP). This is a three-year programme designed to increase the economic opportunities for rural poor people in Helmand, including those that make a living from growing poppy. Activities include construction of rural roads, wells and latrines; provision of legal credit; support for small-scale community development projects; and agricultural support. The overall target for the programme is to deliver improved livelihood opportunities for 590,000 people by the end of the third year.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.12/4">HARDP is managed by the four-person DFID Livelihoods team based in Kabul. Additional programme support is provided by the three-person DFID Helmand team which is split between Kabul and Lashkar Gah. However, actual implementation is carried out by the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), and by a number of non-governmental organisations working under the auspices of MRRD and the Ministry for Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock.</p>
	<p pid="c.814W.12/5">Additional livelihoods diversification activities are provided through the Government's programme of Quick Impact Projects, which is managed by two staff members based in Lashkar Gah.</p>

	<p pid="c.816W.2/1">The Government continue to be concerned about the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus&mdash;in particular, the intimidation of civil society activists, detention of political prisoners and the situation of minority groups. Trade unions also face major difficulties&mdash;an International Labour Organisation Commission of Inquiry concluded that many of the basic civil liberties of trade union members and leaders in Belarus have been seriously infringed. The European Commission, fully supported by member states, conducted its own investigation which confirmed these findings leading to the temporary suspension of the Generalised System of Preferences from Belarus in June this year. We also take 'every opportunity to express our continuing concerns about Belarus' human rights record with the Belarusian authorities and within the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's Third Committee, Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.2/2">It is encouraging that the recent opposition rally on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-14">14 October</phrase> was allowed to take place and that the security services had exercised restraint, but that the march was preceded by a wave of arrests and confiscation of property and materials on spurious grounds is of concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.2/3">The UK and EU are committed to supporting democratisation and demonstrating to the people of Belarus the benefits of closer co-operation. The UK and EU have stated that they are willing to deepen the relationship with Belarus, but the Belarusian authorities must clearly demonstrate their respect for democratic values, fundamental rights and the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.2/4">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has funded projects over the past two years in a number of key human rights areas, principally through the Global Opportunities Fund Reuniting Europe programme and the Devolved Programme Budget. Projects have focussed on local grassroots democracy building and youth participation in democracy activities. Funding has also been provided to expand the knowledge and understanding of human rights law, and provide assistance to local non-governmental organisations and independent media. We will, in co-operation with our partners in the EU and US, continue to help develop civil society and will look for every opportunity to improve contacts at official levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.818W.2/1">Human rights is at the heart of our Burma policy. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-10-08.12"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 12-15WS</phrase>, on the situation in Burma. He issued a further statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-11">11 October</phrase> in response to the presidential statement, unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-11">11 October</phrase>, which the UK co-sponsored. This was the first formal action ever taken by the Security Council on Burma and called upon the Government of Burma to release all political prisoners and take all other measures to address human rights issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.818W.2/2">A compilation of the information we have on the recent human rights violations in Burma has been placed on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website. It was updated on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.818W.2/3">The belated decision of the Burmese Government on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October</phrase> to agree to a visit by the UN Secretary-General's special rapporteur for human rights in Burma, Professor Sergio Pinheiro is a positive step. We hope Professor Pinheiro will be able to visit soon and call upon the Burmese regime to co-operate fully with him so that he is able to fulfil the mandate of the Human Rights Council Resolution passed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October</phrase>. The resolution, sponsored by the EU, with the strong support of the UK, expressed deep concern about the situation in Burma. In our statement to the Human Rights Council, we drew attention to the regime's violations, including restrictions on the freedom of speech and association, and the suffering of Burma's ethnic communities. We have voiced our concern about the lack of co-operation the Burmese Government has given to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and call on the regime to grant urgent access to the ICRC so that they can resume their much needed activities in supporting human rights on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.818W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October</phrase>, the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council called for a thorough and impartial investigation of the deaths of demonstrators, imprisonment of protesters and other continuing violations of human rights. In response to the Burmese Government's failure to exercise restraint in their treatment of the demonstrators, the Council of the EU agreed to implement stronger restrictive measures against the regime. The strengthened measures include a ban on the import of metals, minerals, timber and semi-precious stones and a ban on investment in these sectors. These measures are designed to target the interests of the Generals, rather than harm the people of Burma.</p>
	<p pid="c.818W.2/5">Earlier this year, a memorandum of understanding was agreed between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Burmese Government which allows civilians to report on forced labour cases to the ILO representative in Rangoon. We hope the ILO will be able to continue working without interference by the regime.</p>
	<p pid="c.818W.2/6">We consistently raise human rights with the Burmese regime and we have pushed for strong resolutions on Burma at the Human Rights Council and UN General Assembly, Third Committee.

	<p pid="c.820W.3/1">The UK is committed to promoting democratic principles and values around the world. Our approach is grounded in our support for upholding universal human rights standards to which all countries are bound. Countries currently governed by dictators, military forces and by a single party structure usually have a poor record of non-compliance with human rights norms, denying rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, association, movement or information, on which democracy is built. We and our European partners regularly raise human rights concerns directly with these Governments and in international bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.3/2">In this context, we welcome the decision of the Burmese Government to agree to a visit by the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burma, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro. We hope he will be able to visit soon to fulfil the mandate of the special session of the UN Human Rights Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.3/3">We also actively promote human rights and the development of the foundations of democratic societies through project assistance, including through the Government's support for the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. Details of their work can be found on their website: <a href="http://www.wfd.org">www.wfd.org</a>. We also support development of civil society. For example, the Government have given &pound;500,000 over three years for grass-roots support to civil society organisations in Burma; and a programme of &pound;3 million has been established to help build the foundations for democracy in local level political decision-making bodies in that country.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.3/4">Further information on the Government's work on human rights, democracy and governance can be found in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 2006 Annual Report on Human Rights. Copies of the report are available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.823W.0/1">The National Audit Office measures spending performance against plans by comparing outturns against final provision following Supplementary Estimates&mdash;rather than against plans at the start of the year&mdash;as plans can change during the year for a number of reasons, such as machinery of Government and classification changes. The definitive figures for final provision and provisional outturn are published each year in the Public Expenditure Outturns White Paper (available in the Library of the House). Changes to plans arising in-year are published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, as are differences between provisional and final outturns.</p>
	<p pid="c.823W.0/2">Capital underspends should be seen in the context of estate and information and communications technology programmes that stretch across a number of years. We fine tune spending across programmes towards the end of each financial year to get as close to our annual targets as possible but it is very difficult to turn the flow of capital spend on and off easily. A prudent approach is taken which resulted in underspends in some relevant years.</p>

	<p pid="c.825W.11/1">We have been seriously concerned by reports that have criticised parties to the Sri Lanka conflict including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Karuna faction for the recruitment and use of child soldiers in violation of applicable international law. We deplore this practice: there can be no excuse for failing to observe such basic human rights. The UK is a member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict. We fully support the Working Group's conclusions of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June 2007</phrase>, which strongly condemned the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers and all other violations and abuses committed against children by the LTTE and the Karuna faction and called for an immediate end to these practices. The UK also supports the Working Group's call for further steps to be taken in the coming months if parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka do not heed this call for progress to be made.</p>

The EUBAM mission is standing by at minimum operational strength, ready to resume its border-monitoring role at Rafah as soon as the situation allows. In the meantime, EUBAM staff are concentrating on the capacity building part of their mandate and offering support to the European Security and Defence Policy police mission in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (EUPOL COPPS). As one example of this, EUBAM Rafah experts recently assisted EUPOL COPPS in the delivery of public order training to the Palestinian civil police in the west bank.</p>

We have emphasised our willingness to assist efforts to help bring about a peaceful solution. We continue to stress to the Government of Sri Lanka the need to set out a credible framework for a negotiated settlement that can satisfy the legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans.</p>
	<p pid="c.830W.3/2">We continue to raise our concerns about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, Lord Malloch-Brown, did so most recently last month with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Bogollagama. There are reports of serious abuses by Government forces as well as by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Karuna faction. Abuses include extra-judicial killings, disappearances and the use of child soldiers. Addressing human rights violations is a central part of our approach to finding a long-term solution to the conflict. We believe it is vital that reports of human rights violations in Sri Lanka are investigated fully and that those responsible are brought to justice. We have supported calls by the EU for the introduction of a UN-backed Human Rights Monitoring mission.</p>

If an academy acted in contravention of its funding agreement to the detriment of any pupil or parent, any person disadvantaged by the contravention could raise the matter with the Secretary of State.

	<p pid="c.833W.5/1">There is no universally applicable definition of affordability. Individual family circumstances will determine how affordable childcare is in relation to family income and is relative to the different levels of wages in different regions. We know however that childcare costs can have a substantial impact on the family budget, especially those in lower income households, which is why we are providing substantial help (over &pound;3 million a day) through the tax credit system and 12.5 hours of free early education for all three and four year olds.</p>
	<p pid="c.833W.5/2">The Childcare Act 2006 requires local authorities in England to assess childcare in their areas by April 2008, and then to secure sufficient childcare for working parents and those in education or training leading to work. The affordability of childcare will be an important factor in determining whether there is sufficient childcare in a local authority area.</p>

	<p pid="c.838W.2/1">Since 1998 schools and local authorities have set targets for pupils' performance in National Curriculum tests and public examinations. The impact of targets on the educational system has been evaluated through the annual test and examination results and through consultation with head teachers and local authorities. We have always made clear that we will consider sensible suggestions for how targets can be refined and improved to help teachers.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.2/2">The evidence from the test and examination results since 1997 shows clearly that targets have been a powerful stimulus for improvements in standards over the last 10 years. Literacy and numeracy skills have increased significantly across all key stages, This year, 100,000 more 11 year-olds achieved the target level 4+ at Key Stage 2 in English and 90,000 more did so in mathematics compared with 1997. At secondary level, 62,000 more pupils achieved five good GCSEs including English and mathematics compared with 1997. Such rapid improvements would not have been achieved without the challenge of specific and focused targets related to performance outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.2/3">In 2004 following an extensive consultation with head teachers we moved to empower schools to set pupil-driven targets that give them ownership of the goals and help them focus on improving teaching and learning in the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.2/4">Targets continue to play an essential part in the Government's commitment to raising educational standards. As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review we have announced new targets which will place a focus on improving progression throughout the education system. We want to ensure that more pupils make the expected progress through the key stages at school as well as ensuring they reach the expected levels at the end of each key stage, especially pupils from disadvantages backgrounds who have not kept pace with their peers. The progress targets are an important step in helping all pupils reach their potential.</p>

	<p pid="c.838W.5/1">National curriculum tests at each Key Stage provide a fully objective means of assessing all pupils in England on a consistent basis. This in turn provides information on standards nationally, in the priority subjects, improves accountability of schools to parents and to taxpayers and helps inform parents and teachers how individual pupils are progressing so that they can effectively plan their future learning and development. In short, national tests equip us with the best data possible about performance in Key Stages 1, 2 and 3 to support the education system as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.5/2">The national curriculum tests are designed by the National Assessment Agency (NAA) to differentiate fairly between pupils of different attainment, in line with the level descriptions in the national curriculum. They use statistical and judgemental procedures, as laid out in the National Curriculum Assessment Code of Practice to ensure that the standards of performance required for the award of each level are maintained consistently from year to year.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.5/3">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is responsible for ensuring that standards are maintained over time and its processes for doing so in relation to national curriculum tests were found by the independent Rose Panel (1999), an independent panel commissioned by the Secretary of State to review the procedures to set and maintain standards, to be robust and to bear comparison with best practice in the world.</p>

	<p pid="c.839W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/2"><i> </i>Extra-curricular activities can help increase the attainment of individual children and young people, as well as increase their aspirations and motivation to learn, enabling every child to fulfil their potential. Since 1997, the Government have been firmly committed to giving children and young people the opportunity to benefit from a wide range of extra curricular activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/3">Study support is recognised as a key tool in raising pupil attainment and Improving behaviour and attendance. Since 1997 a range of activity has been undertaken, spearheaded by the publication in 1999 of the strategy document &quot;Extending Opportunity: A National Framework for Study Support&quot;. As part of this, all schools were given access to ring-fenced Government funding for study support activities via the Standards Fund; this was subsumed into mainstream funding In 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/4">Playing for Success (PfS) was introduced in 1997 as part of the commitment to tackle under-achievement in urban areas. PfS is establishing study support centres at sports clubs' grounds with the aim of raising standards in literacy, numeracy, information and communication technology (ICT) among young people aged between nine and 14 years. The centres use the environment and motivating factor of sport to help pupils to re-engage with education. Typically, pupils attend for two hours per evening, after school, over a 10-week period. Attendance is voluntary. PfS has grown over the past 10 years, and in that period over 220,000 pupils have benefited from attending PfS.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/5">Study support is now part of the extended schools programme, which promotes participation in extra-curricular activity. Starting with 60 local authorities (LAs) in 2003-04, and increasing to include all LAs in 2005-06, the Department piloted Full Service Extended Schools (FSES), delivering a full core set of services to pupils, families and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/6">Building from the success of FSES, the Government are committed to every school providing access to the core offer by 2010. The core offer is: a varied menu of activities (including study support and play) and child care; community access to facilities, swift and easy access to targeted and specialist services; and parenting support. The varied menu aspect of the core offer will give all children and young people the opportunity to engage in voluntary out of school hours activities, both before and after school. Activities can include breakfast clubs, homework clubs, sport, music and the arts and opportunities to pursue particular interests. There are currently over 8,000 schools delivering access to the core offer.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/7">Significant funding has been provided to support extended schools. &pound;680 million was made available between 2005-06 to 2007-08 to support the start up of extended schools. In July 2008, over &pound;1 billion funding was announced for extended schools between 2008-09 to 2010-11. As part of this, &pound;265 million will be made available to support children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefiting from additional out-of-hours tuition and after-school clubs.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/8">Extended schools can already be shown to be making a positive impact. The Universities of Manchester and Newcastle study into the effectiveness of Full Service Extended Schools (published in June 2007) found that FSES had a positive impact on the attainment of pupils and on engagement with teaming, family stability and enhanced life chances and generated positive outcomes for families and local people, This adds to an analysis undertaken by the Department for Education and Skills, which found progress in the percentage of pupils achieving five plus A*-C at GCSE in extended schools was around double the rate of the national average between 2005 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.841W.5/1">The availability of AS level in year 12 offers choice to young people. Many choose to take a wider range of subjects at AS in year 12, before perhaps specialising further for their full A levels. Taking an exam in year 12 gives them a clear basis for taking such decisions and can encourage further study. Having a discrete award also means this study is recognised by a qualification, so those that do not go on to complete a full A level are not left empty handed. The design of the A level means that the AS forms half of the overall assessment; the option to take them in year 12 allows the whole A level assessment to be spread over two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/2">AS levels do not have to be taken in year 12. For young people and schools that prefer a linear approach to A level assessment, the structure also allows for the exams to be taken at the end of the course, alongside the A2 component.</p>

	<p pid="c.842W.2/1">It is for the awarding bodies to moderate coursework marks and ensure that the grades they award are fair and consistent. Accreditation of A-levels and GCSEs includes consideration of the quality assurance and controls they have in place. It is for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) as the qualifications regulator to oversee standards and fairness within the exams system. Its Regulations and Standards Division runs monitoring and scrutiny programmes of awarding body practice on coursework.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.2/2">The QCA's 2005 review of coursework in GCE and GCSE identified concerns about the nature and amount of support that it is appropriate for teachers to give. In response to this QCA issued guidelines to teachers and pupils on how much help centres can give to candidates. The Joint Council for Qualifications also provided a set of rules, which took effect from September 2006, which cover how much help teachers can give students. Awarding bodies use these rules to challenge and deal with any individual instances of inappropriate behaviour. There is no evidence to suggest that breaches of the rules are in any way widespread.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.2/3">The changes being made to strengthen further GCSE and A-level arrangements include changes to coursework arrangements in many subjects and the introduction of controlled assessments. These will bring tighter controls around: task setting by teachers or awarding bodies; supervision of task taking and task marking by teachers or awarding bodies. Teacher set and marked tasks will not be allowed in GCSE.</p>

	<p pid="c.846W.2/1">We have not collected any data on language learning in year 2, as there is no requirement for schools to teach modern foreign language in Key Stage 1. Research published by the National Foundation for Educational Research in June 2007 found that 70 per cent. of primary schools are teaching a foreign language in class time in Key Stage 2. We do not have accurate data that break this down into individual year groups so cannot provide a figure for year 6 pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.846W.2/2">Languages are compulsory at Key Stage 3 so all pupils in year 9 should be taught a modern foreign language. We do not know the exact proportion of pupils who were taught a language at Key Stage 4. 46 per cent. of all pupils at the end of Key Stage 4 took a GCSE in a modern foreign language in 2007, but a few of these pupils may not have been taught, and some may have been taught but decided not to take the exam.</p>

	<p pid="c.846W.8/1">Improving standards of literacy and numeracy at all stages of education has been one of the Governments top priorities. Since 1997 the results achieved by 11-year-olds and 14-year-olds as measured by National Curriculum tests in English have risen dramatically with provisional figures for 2007 showing that 80 per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached the target level 4 and above (an increase of 17 percentage points over 1997) and 74 per cent. of 14-year-olds reached the target level 5 and above (an increase of 17 percentage points over 1997).</p>
	<p pid="c.846W.8/2">The National Curriculum provides a clear description of the literacy skills that children are able to demonstrate at different levels of attainment. At age 11 (the end of Key Stage 2) the expected level of achievement is level 4. Children achieving level 4 have literacy skills that mean they can access complex forms of language and complex ideas. They can use inference and deduction and can locate and use ideas and information. Their writing in a range of forms is lively and thoughtful. Handwriting style is fluent joined and legible. Full stops, capital letters and question marks are used accurately and pupils can use punctuation within a sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.846W.8/3">Although level 4 is the target that we expect children to reach by the end of primary school, provisional figures show that 93 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved at least Level 3 in English in 2007. Children assessed at level 3 can read a range of texts accurately and independently; and their writing is organised, legible and clear. Children who are assessed at level 2 will show confidence in talking and listening and their reading of simple texts will be accurate and show understanding.</p>

They show understanding of the different things they are reading and can explain how writers influence readers. They can write in different ways that are interesting to the reader, using different sentence structures, putting writing in paragraphs and using punctuation accurately.

	<p pid="c.848W.2/2">We do not have a measure of functional literacy. However; information on the attainment of pupils in Key Stage 2 English tests is shown in the following table. The expected level of achievement at Key Stage 2 is Level 4.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/3">The characteristics of Levels 2 to 5 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/4" class="italic"> Level 2</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/5" class="indent">At level 2 children begin to show confidence in talking and listening, and reading of simple texts shows understanding and is accurate.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/6" class="italic"> Level 3</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/7" class="indent">Children achieving level 3 are able to read a range of texts accurately and independently, tackle unfamiliar words and self correct when their reading doesn't make sense.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/8" class="indent">At level 3 pupils' writing is organised, legible and clear. Punctuation to mark sentences&mdash;full stops, capital letters and question marks&mdash;is used accurately. Handwriting is joined and legible. Pupils are aware of standard English and when it is used.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/9" class="italic"> Level 4</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/10" class="indent">A level 4 child has access to more complex forms of language and can access more complex ideas. They can use inference and deduction and can locate and use ideas and information.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/11" class="indent">At level 4 children's writing in a range of forms is lively and thoughtful. Handwriting style is fluent, joined and legible. Full stops, capital letters and question marks are used accurately and pupils can use punctuation within a sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/12" class="italic"> Level 5</p>
	<p pid="c.848W.2/13" class="indent">Graduating to level 5 pupils can confidently read and discuss a range of texts, selecting essential points using inference and deduction where appropriate. Writing conveys meaning clearly in a range of forms using a more formal style where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.850W.11/1">In 2003 the Departments for Transport (DfT) and for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) established the joint Travelling to School Initiative to encourage more sustainable travel to school, thereby improving child health and activity levels and reducing congestion and pollution caused by the number of cars on the school run. The primary tool in helping schools achieve a reduction in car travel is the development of a School Travel Plan (STP). This helps to identify specific measures which could reduce the number of car journeys and promote and encourage more walking and cycling to school, or the use of public transport for longer journeys.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.11/2">In September 2003 the Departments published 'Travelling to School: An action plan' and 'Travelling to school: a good practice guide'. These outline how schools and local authorities can increase the number of children travelling to school on foot or by other sustainable methods.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.11/3">The Government (DfT and DCSF) are providing a total of over &pound;100 million during 2004-08 to help support the development of STPs. This includes &pound;7.5 million each year for local authority based School Travel Advisers who help schools carry out surveys and prepare plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.11/4">DCSF also allocates capital funding to help those schools upgrade their sustainable travel facilities. Between 2004 and 2007 more than 14,000 schools have developed STPs and been allocated more than &pound;77 million to invest on capital items which promote or enable sustainable travel. We want every school to have a STP by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.11/5">In addition to STPs schools have, for the first time in 2007, been able to apply for DfT funding to establish Walking Buses. 3,231 primary schools have received funding under this scheme in 2007-08 to enable them to set up Walking Buses to encourage children to walk to school.</p>

	<p pid="c.857W.2/1">Measures to improve road safety for cyclists include providing better infrastructure, promoting cycle training, improved training and testing for motorists and encouraging cyclists to protect themselves, by making themselves conspicuous and by wearing a safety helmet.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.2/2">The new edition of the Highway Code, published in September 2007, includes enhanced advice to all road users to look out for and be aware of vulnerable road users, including cyclists. To make drivers more aware of cyclists the theory test question bank contains a large number of questions about vulnerable road users. The screen-based theory test allows the use of digitised video clips to help test hazard perception with moving images, which include cyclists. The practical driving test has been lengthened, providing a greater opportunity for encountering cyclists.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.2/3">We have doubled Cycling England's budget to fund additional links to schools and to fund grants to enable more children to receive Bikeability, the new national cycle training standard.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.2/4">We concentrate our cycle safety publicity on teenagers and younger children, as these are the most vulnerable groups. We have run various cycle safety campaigns over the last 10 years. Currently, cycling safety messages for younger children are included on the Hedgehogs website including advice and games. Last year we produced an online advertisement for children called 'No helmet, no ride', which encourages children to wear a cycle helmet, which last ran in the summer of this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.2/5">There is also the cyclesense website aimed at teenage cyclists, giving advice and tips of cycling safety. This year in an MTV/THINK! competition teenagers were asked to come up with ideas for TV commercials about road safety, including cycling, aimed at their peers. This activity ran over five months and the three best ideas were produced as TV commercials and teens voted for their favourite ad online. Invisible, about being seen when out cycling and wearing a helmet, came second.</p>
	<p pid="c.857W.2/6">The Department's leaflet 'Drive Safe Cycle Safe' also encourages drivers and cyclists to share the road safely. The Department has grant funded a number of projects to improve road safety for cyclists including a RoSPA produced DVD on safety for cyclists and lorries.</p>

	<p pid="c.859W.2/1">Defra is the single Government sponsor of British Waterways (BW) in England and Wales. It provides core funding towards the upkeep of its waterways. Other Government Departments have the flexibility to fund the inland waterways direct where they can deliver specific policy requirements, eg through grants for regeneration and freight projects where funds are provided to reflect the contribution of inland waterways to departmental objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.859W.2/2">Earlier this year, the Department provided BW with Freight Facility Grant (FFG) funding of &pound;1.37m towards the cost of constructing the lock in the Prescott Channel. When complete, the lock will enable the transport of construction materials by water to the Olympic site. BW has also applied for an additional &pound;0.5 million relating to the transport of materials by water to the Stratford City development site. A decision on whether to agree to this additional funding has not yet been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.859W.2/3">The Department has had no other discussions with BW on funding. However, I understand that Defra and BW were working closely together on planning for the CSR07 period in the context of the Department's overall priorities and financial pressures. Defra is also working with BW on a new long term strategy for a sustainable network that delivers wider government priorities including regeneration, protection of historic and natural environment, well-being and freight.</p>

	<p pid="c.868W.6/1">The Department provides two grants to encourage the migration of freight from road to rail. The Freight Facilities Grant helps offset the capital cost of providing rail freight handling facilities and the Rail Environmental Benefit Procurement Scheme assists companies with the operating costs associated with running rail freight transport. These grants are not targeted at particular roads but are available to freight flows which would otherwise move by road where rail is more expensive. During 2007-08 these schemes will secure the removal of over 1 million lorry journeys from our roads.</p>

The COT considered that it was not possible to conclude whether cabin air exposures (either general or following incidents) cause ill-health in commercial aircraft crews. It recommended further work, in particular and as a priority, to ascertain whether substances in the cabin environment during fume events could potentially be harmful to health. COT considered that this work should be designed to detect 'any' potentially harmful substances, rather than focus on named substances.</p>

	<p pid="c.876W.3/1">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) will include a reporting mechanism under which any transport fuel supplier wishing to earn a certificate for the supply in the UK of any litre of renewable transport fuel will be required to complete a report on the carbon savings associated with, and wider sustainability impacts of, the fuel in question. The Renewable Fuels Agency is expected to publish regular reports highlighting the different performance of different transport fuel suppliers, and allowing consumers to compare the extent to which different suppliers make efforts to source sustainable biofuels. We believe that this will create a very strong incentive on transport fuel suppliers to source only the most sustainable biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.3/2">We have also announced that we aim, from April 2011, to reward biofuels under the RTFO only if the feedstocks from which they are produced meet appropriate sustainability standards, provided that this is compatible with World Trade Organisation rules and EU Technical Standards requirements, and is consistent with the policy framework being developed by the European Commission as part of the review of the existing EU biofuels legislation. We have recently published an informal policy paper (available via <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/secrtfostake/informalpolicypaper">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/secrtfostake/informalpolicypaper</a>) setting out in more detail how we intend to take this commitment forward.</p>

	<p pid="c.880W.0/1">The decision to include clause 26 in the draft Local Transport Bill was prompted by a recommendation of the Bus Partnership Forum's Innovation and Inclusion Task and Finish Group. The recommendation that holders of private hire vehicle (PHV) licences should be allowed to obtain a special public service vehicle operator's licence to provide local bus services, in the same way as licensed taxis can do already, was seen as giving added flexibility to meet local transport needs, particularly in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.0/2">In the knowledge that there would be full consultation on the draft Bill, clause 26 was not discussed specifically with the taxi and PHV trades before being included in the draft Bill. We have received a small number of representations&mdash;both for and against the proposal. Those against the proposal referred in particular to the particular circumstances of PHV operation in London. We are now considering all the responses as part of the post-consultation analysis process which will determine the final content of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.0/3">We have made no estimate of the potential uptake of the proposal, but expect it to be relatively modest (in line with the use made of the existing power for taxis to provide local bus services). The proposal is simply intended to give PHV owners an added flexibility where they see an opportunity to use it. We would expect the provision to be of more value in rural areas where a smaller vehicle might be more cost-effective on a particular route.</p>

	<p pid="c.885W.0/1">The estimated effects on revenues to the Exchequer of suggested reforms to capital gains tax taper relief for business and non-business assets are given in the following table. The estimates are given on the assumption that the new regime had been introduced in April 2007 and take account of the estimated impact of behavioural responses to changes in taxation regime. As the initial behavioural response is assumed to be greater than that in subsequent years, figures are provided for 2008-09 as well as 2007-08. These estimates are calculated on the basis of changes to the current regime and take no account of capital gains tax reforms announced at PBR 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.913W.4/1">We will replace the test used to assess the potential of chemical substances to cause irritation to human skin with the non-animal EPISKIN-SIT test (or any other suitable and validated non-animal model) where scientifically justified and amend existing licences, as necessary, once the agreed protocols for regulatory testing are agreed and published.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.4/2">The determination for regulatory purposes of a material's potential to cause skin irritation is currently largely done by animal testing. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-27">27 April 2007</phrase> the European Centre for the Validation of Alternatives Methods (ECVAM) Scientific Advisory Committee issued a validation statement with respect to two non-animal tests methods, EPISKIN and EpiDerm, for predicting skin irritation potential. The validation statement described the EPISKIN system as being a reliable and relevant stand-alone alternative method for this purpose, and the EpiDerm system as having the potential to reliably identify skin irritants within a tiered-testing strategy. Work is now under way within ECVAM to develop internationally agreed protocols for the use of these methods for regulatory purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.4/3">We have already advised the relevant project licence holders of the validation statement, and the need to use the in vitro methods once the agreed protocols for regulatory testing become available. Thereafter, it will be possible for the Home Office to authorise the use of the animal test only in cases where it can be demonstrated that the in vitro methods would not produce scientifically satisfactory results.</p>

	<p pid="c.924W.2/1">The Home Office has implemented a number of new policies since <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-27">27 June 2007</phrase>, and we have kept Parliament fully informed of these. Following the terrorist incidents in Glasgow and London in June, we have spent much of the last few months focused on counter terrorism and security. The Prime Minister has asked Lord West to conduct a review of the protection of crowded places, critical national infrastructure, and transport infrastructure from a critical terrorist attack.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.2/2">On July 19 The Home Secretary launched the new Crime Strategy. This includes a stronger focus on serious violence, continued pressure on antisocial behaviour, a renewed focus on young people, a new national approach to designing out crime, and continuing work to reduce re-offending. The newly created National Crime Reduction Board to oversee delivery across government departments held its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-10">10 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August 2007</phrase> immigration officers began wearing uniforms at Gatwick's border control, creating a stronger and more visible presence at the border.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-09">9 September</phrase> we launched the Tackling Gangs Action Programme with focused work in areas of London, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool where gun crime and gangs are a particular issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-27">27 September</phrase> the Home Secretary announced a new &pound;50 million fund to give the police access to 21<sup>(st)</sup> century crime fighting technologies. This includes the provision of 1,000 new mobile computers we intend to roll out this year followed by a further 10,000 more next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.926W.2/1">Dispersal Orders are one of a number of measures to tackle antisocial behaviour and have succeeded in tackling underage drinking, joyriding, noise nuisance, the antisocial use of fireworks and the harassment and intimidation of residents. They are not intended to be used in isolation, but should form part of a tiered and integrated response to tackling crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour in local areas. This includes work by YOTs to prevent young people getting involved in offending and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.926W.2/2">While no assessment has been made of the efficacy of dispersal orders on their own, a study and report by the National Audit Office (&quot;Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour&quot;, HC 99 Session 2006-07, <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase>) confirmed that a tiered approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is highly effective. This is also borne out by the fact that we have driven down perceptions of antisocial behaviour by 4 percentage points from the baseline of 21 per cent. in 2002-03 to 17 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

These show that for 2006, the UK voted against two proposals and abstained on a further two. For the period to May 2007, the UK voted against three proposals and abstained on one.

	<p pid="c.937W.11/2"><i> </i>The Government have a statutory duty under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act to eradicate racism by the promotion of equality of opportunity and good race relations. Every police force is also bound by this duty and must have a Race Equality Scheme in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/3">The recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry and the work of the Lawrence Steering Group, now disbanded, have been central to the real progress on race which has been made in the police service. Together with the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (formerly the CRE) and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the procedures and practices within the police service have been strengthened to ensure that race equality is embedded within the work force and across all policing activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/4">A number of initiatives have been adopted as part of the Race Equality programme to modernise the police service's organisational culture and include:</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/5" class="indent">more in-force training and the move away from residential group training with the new Initial Police Learning and Development Programme;</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/6" class="indent">taking probationers in training out into the community earlier and giving them more exposure to community groups;</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/7" class="indent">changes in the assessment process with greater emphasis on recruits demonstrating the competencies for race and diversity (which must be met and at a higher level than other competencies);</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/8" class="indent">more focused training of assessors to assess the required competencies; and</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.11/9" class="indent">increased monitoring of all processes and practices.</p>

	<p pid="c.938W.2/1">Frontline policing is measured using the Frontline Policing Measure, which is based on the proportion of police officers engaged in frontline activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.938W.2/2">The Frontline Policing Measure is not a measure of visibility. It measures time spent carrying out core policing duties. Examples of roles considered as front line include: burglary, CID, firearms, community safety, dogs, drugs, foot/car/beat patrol, hate crime, mounted police, special branch, marine, air, underwater, and vice.</p>
	<p pid="c.938W.2/3">CID, foot/car/beat patrol and traffic are also subject to activity analysis to determine more accurately the proportion of officer time spent on frontline activities within those roles. Examples of frontline activity include dealing with incidents, visible patrol, searches, dealing with informants, interviewing suspects and special operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.938W.2/4">Full details of the formula used to calculated the measure and complete lists of frontline roles and activities are contained in the 'Guidance on Statutory Performance Indicators for Policing 2006-07', published by the Police Standards Unit and available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.940W.8/2">Temperate sleeping bags are issued to all personnel as part of their standard kit. Additionally, troops deploying to Afghanistan during the hotter months are issued with the warm weather sleeping bag as part of their personal kit, prior to deployment.</p>
	<p pid="c.940W.8/3">The Department does not procure sleeping bags to a tog rating. The temperate sleeping bag is designed to allow 6 hours sleep under normal conditions down to a temperature of -19 degrees Celsius. Under survival conditions, the sleeping bag is designed to allow 6 hours rest at -32 degrees Celsius, with clothing appropriate to the conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.940W.8/4">The warm weather sleeping bag is suitable for desert and jungle use. Over the past 12 months, 28,534 warm weather sleeping bags have been issued in all areas including Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.942W.2/2">Some pinch points record no harmony breaches. These groups, often with very small populations of specialists, have to be managed on a tri-Service basis in order to maintain harmony. This is successfully done by the use of reserves or contractors to solve the problem in the short term or to call upon the other two Services to assist. For example, the Defence Medical Services may deploy tri-Service teams to field hospitals on operations. This enables individuals' harmony to be maintained and enables Force Commanders to retain operational capability, although undermanning in the trade still means it is categorised as a pinch point.</p>

	<p pid="c.950W.5/2">It is not possible to quantify what liability would have been needed for all three Services to maintain all personnel within harmony guidelines. This is because of a number of factors:</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.5/3" class="indent">a. There are two sets of Harmony Guidelines. Unit harmony is applied to units&mdash;such as a ship or an infantry battalion&mdash;and governs our force structure. Individual harmony is intended to indicate the degree of turbulence experienced by individuals due to their service in the armed forces and acknowledges that people move between units.</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.5/4" class="indent">b. Due to the particular requirements of operational commitments, at any given time some units may fail to achieve their harmony guidelines while others will not be in such demand and therefore exceed their harmony guidelines. It is therefore perfectly possible to have the required number of people overall in the Services, but face specific shortfalls in certain specialisations. The MOD actively manages such 'pinch points' and has re-roled some units to attempt to mitigate some of the more acute harmony shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.5/5" class="indent">c. The MOD focuses its effort on, wherever possible, seeking to head off harmony problems before they arise, by looking ahead into the mid-term. As a result, detailed management information on historic harmony achievement is not available. This means it is not possible to produce an extrapolation of the number of additional people required to deliver harmony guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="c.951W.3/1">Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder whose cause is currently unknown. There is no published peer-reviewed scientific or medical evidence to suggest any link with particular occupations including between any factor of service in the armed forces and development of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.3/2">Information is not held centrally as to the total number of serving and retired service personnel suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.3/3">Records do however show that there are 380 former service personnel currently in receipt of a war disablement pension under the War Pension Scheme (WPS), with an accepted claim for Multiple Sclerosis. The records do not identify when these pensioners were diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis or whether it was the reason for their discharge.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.3/4">The WPS provides no-fault compensation for all former service personnel disabled as a result of their Service in the armed forces before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. Awards are made under the WPS where, on the individual case facts and under the legislation, a casual link to service can be accepted. The WPS onus and standard of proof mean that casual links may be lawfully recognised which do not reflect contemporary medical evidence. Where a disablement has clinical onset during service and leads to medical discharge, claims are automatically considered. In that situation or where a claim is made within seven years of service termination, entitlement will be certified unless it can be shown by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that service has played no part in the cause or course of the disorder. In these circumstances claims for Multiple Sclerosis may succeed on that basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.951W.3/6">Information is not held centrally which can identify former service personnel released on non-medical grounds, who have subsequently been awarded war pensions for suffering the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis while in service. To obtain the information would involve the examination of individual files which could be done only at disproportionate cost&mdash;there are currently around 178,000 people in receipt of a war disablement pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.3/7">No service personnel have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and awarded attributable benefits under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.

	<p pid="c.958W.2/3">In assessing export licence applications, the Government do not differentiate between military equipment to be exported or re-exported from the UK. All UK export licence applications are rigorously assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, which includes, inter alia, a thorough consideration of the risk of diversion to undesirable end-users. Should it be judged that an export would contravene any of the Criteria, the application would be refused.</p>
	<p pid="c.958W.2/4">The Government do not control the re-export of military equipment once it has been exported from the UK. The control of military goods once they have been exported from the UK to a licensed end-user would require UK export controls to be enforced exterritorialy within another country's jurisdiction. The Government are opposed to this approach, and believe that its current approach, based on a rigorous risk assessment at the pre-licensing stage, to be a more effective means of guarding against the risk of military equipment falling into the hands of an undesirable end-user. In addition it would be difficult to enforce extraterritorial controls once the goods have left UK jurisdiction.</p>

	<p pid="c.965W.0/2">Since the introduction of a 'national default retirement age' of 65, men and women have been able automatically to continue in employment up to this age. This means that women employed by the MOD are able routinely to work beyond the current state pension age for women of 60. Moreover, the MOD has introduced procedures which enable its civil servants to apply to work beyond 65 in accordance with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. Such applications are submitted to individual line managers and appeals, where they are raised, are dealt with at a more senior level within the business unit.</p>

We have worked closely with a range of scientific and humanitarian organisations and concluded that this expenditure does not pose any significant danger either to coalition forces or the general population. The Iraqi authorities have the lead in any post-conflict clean-up operations, with coalition forces providing support as necessary. UK forces have carried out ordnance disposal activities and removed surface-lying fragments of depleted uranium as and when they are discovered. We have also exchanged information with humanitarian and other organisations working in Iraq, and issued precautionary warnings through signs and leaflets, advising the local population of the more general dangers of approaching or touching any debris on a battlefield.</p>

In other words, they have not been recruited through fair and open competition in the UK under the Civil Service Order in Council and they are not therefore members of the Home Civil Service or the Diplomatic Service. LECs are also employed on terms and conditions analogous with local employment law and market forces, and not those of the UK.

A number of influencing factors, however, led to a review of the MARS procurement strategy in May 2007: market developments, namely the rapidly changing shipbuilding market conditions; confirmation of the CVF order; and the changing industrial landscape under the Defence Industrial Strategy. The decision not to proceed with the MARS Integrator Competition was taken in this context.</p>

No radiation doses were recorded for any Fijian national.</p>
	<p pid="c.979W.2/2">At Operation Mosaic, which took place in 1956 at the Monte Bello Islands off the North West coast of Australia, 32 Fijians were onboard HMS Newfoundland. Two Mosaic trials were held. At the first on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>, HMS Newfoundland was docked at Singapore.

The flagship acted as the control centre for a group of ships stationed off Maiden Island during the trials.</p>
	<p pid="c.979W.2/4">At a later trial, Operation Grapple Y, 23 Fijians were stationed at HMS Resolution. The Grapple Y trial took place on <phrase class="date" code="1958-04-28">28 April 1958</phrase> off the south east point of Kiritimati (formerly Christmas Island). From December 1957, HMS Resolution was the name used for the group of naval personnel based onshore at Kiritimati. HMS Resolution was situated at Port London, on the north west side of the island, approximately 43 km from the point of detonation.</p>
	<p pid="c.979W.2/5">At a subsequent series of trials, Operation Grapple Z, 16 Fijians were attached to 269 Squadron.

The organisation of services is therefore a matter for local NHS organisations, working with their strategic health authorities and stakeholders. The NHS should seek to provide care as close to home as is compatible with clinical safety and therefore how the NHS responds to emergencies needs to focus not just on getting the patient to a particular location, but also on taking care to the patient. In addition, in order to provide patients requiring particular specialised services with safe, high quality care, it may be appropriate to have the expertise, experience and equipment in fewer locations.</p>

Not all practices participate in QOF and some participate in only some parts (especially PMS practices who are paid under different arrangements for providing services which are part of QOF for CMS practices). Most indicators in QOF have rules which allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease. Note also that some indicators have age limits and so exclude some patients on the register.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1027W.2/4">The Secretary of State announced last month that the Department will publish a comprehensive strategy in 2008 for reducing health inequalities, which will address unjustified gaps in health status, fair access to NHS services for everyone and good outcomes of care for all.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.2/5">The NHS in England Operating Framework 2007-08 identified tackling health inequalities as a key priority for the NHS. Incentives for the NHS and local authorities have also been aligned to encourage partnership working to deliver the 2010 target, with health inequalities a mandatory target for Spearhead PCT local delivery plans for 2007-08, and for local authority local area agreements from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.2/6">The Department and the Association of Public Health Observatories have developed an interactive &quot;Health Inequalities Intervention Tool&quot;. Launched in August 2007, and available from the London Health Observatory website, the Tool translates national modelling on what is driving the life expectancy gap into local area analysis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.2/7">The &quot;Review of the Health Inequalities Infant Mortality PSA Target, 2007&quot;, published earlier this year, will help improve further delivery of local services to vulnerable populations by working in partnership with local government and others. An implementation plan is on schedule for publication in autumn 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.2/8">We have established national support teams on health inequalities and on tobacco control and smoking cessation that will disseminate best practice across Spearhead areas, and areas with high infant mortality rates, providing tailored, intensive, assistance to areas that face the biggest challenges in delivering the 2010 target.</p>

There must be no evidence that it was present or incubating at the time of hospital admission unless the infection was related to a previous admission to the same hospital (i.e. the hospital under surveillance.)<sup>(3)</sup></p>

	<p pid="c.1031W.6/1">An appropriate diet, based on acceptable standards, requires good food with the right nutritional content, properly prepared and available when patients need it. The National Health Service Plan stipulated that dieticians should advise and check on nutritional values in hospital food. Nutritional information is available for all recipes in the National Dish Selector, and this can be used to assess local nutritional levels. Ingredients specifications for the recipes have been developed by the Purchasing and Supply Agency to ensure that wholesome, high quality and value-for-money ingredients are used.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.6/2">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) Strategic Plan for 2005-10 includes a commitment to support other Government Departments to set targets to improve the nutritional quality of meals served in major institutions. Work is under way to develop nutrient and food based guidance for institutions that will support cross-Government action on diet and food procurement. The first set of guidance, including an example menu, for those providing food to older people in residential care who do not have specific diet-related medical needs, was published by the FSA in October 2006. Guidance for institutions providing food to adults who do not have specific diet-related medical needs, will be published before the end of October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.6/3">The quality of hospital food is measured annually via Patient Environment Action Team (PEAT) assessments. These showed an increase from 17 per cent. 'good' in 2002 to 32 per cent. 'excellent' in 2006 (there was no 'excellent' category in 2002, when a three-point scale was used).</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.6/4">Older people in hospital may prefer to eat little and often, and this was provided for in the NHS Plan. For the last year in which statistics were collected, (2004) 89 per cent. of hospitals had introduced ward kitchen services to provide light snacks, 80 per cent. were providing snack boxes for patients who missed a meal and 84 per cent. provided extra snacks during the day.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.6/5">It is known that older people in hospital are vulnerable to malnutrition. To identify and deal with patients at risk, we have introduced protected mealtimes and have renewed the emphasis on nutritional screening. These two areas of work are being actively pursued by the National Patient Safety Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.6/6">A national action plan to tackle the issue of older people and nutrition more generally was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March 2007</phrase> by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Lewis). The action plan followed a nutrition summit on the same day, attended by leading charities, clinicians, nutrition experts and care home representatives. It will be published in November 2007 and will outline a range of measures that NHS and social care managers can take to address nutrition, hydration and nutritional care issues in all settings. FSA guidance to improve meals served in major institutions contributes to this national action plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.1041W.5/1">Policy branches typically work with analytical support staff to cost the impact of their policy developments. The Policy Costing Handbook brought together good practice that already existed within the Department, codifying it and presenting it in as a step-by-step process. Before it was issued some policy documents contained guidance on costing; for example, &quot;Policy Appraisal and Health&quot;, amended November 2004, contained a section on how to quantify resource costs and cost data sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.5/2">Prior to the Department's restructuring exercise, the sign-off by the finance director for all policies with significant financial implications had not been formally required. However finance in the majority of cases was typically consulted on revenue implications of policies, but did not have a dedicated team to scrutinise the costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.5/3">The majority of policy proposals are included in the Department's comprehensive spending review bids, typically every three years. The proposals are assessed and costs are examined in finance by a team of staff that compile the bid.</p>

	<p pid="c.1049W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May 2005</phrase> the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) issued to all national health service organisations in England and Wales, via their safety alert broadcast system, the guidance Protecting People with Allergy Associated with Latex, which recommended that a comprehensive working policy on the use and purchasing of latex products be developed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/2">The policy should include measures to:</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/3" class="indent">substitute, control or eliminate latex where appropriate and possible;</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/4" class="indent">ensure staff are aware of, and have access to, safe and effective latex-free alternatives;</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/5" class="indent">identify and protect sensitised patients; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/6" class="indent">raise awareness about latex sensitivity among patients and staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/7">They further recommended that this policy should be backed up by efficient management arrangements, and the policies audited and reviewed to check compliance. A deadline of January 2006 was given for all these actions to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/8">In addition, a website-based toolkit has been developed by the Health and Safety Executive, in partnership with the Department, the NPSA, the Latex Allergy Support Group, the National Association of Theatre Nurses, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the healthcare industry and other relevant bodies. This toolkit includes example policies and materials to help local NHS organisations raise awareness of latex allergy with both staff and patients.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-10-29c.161457.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-10-29c.1051W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="1051W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071029/text/71029w0100.htm#07103119003596">
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/1">Between 1996-97 and 2007-08, spending on the NHS has increased from &pound;33 billion to just over &pound;90 billion, representing an average annual increase in real terms of 6 per cent. The improvements seen in stroke services have undoubtedly benefited from these increases over the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/2">The National Service Framework (NSF) for long-term conditions was published in 2004 to improve the quality of life and independence for people with long-term neurological conditions. It set out general guidelines for a range of conditions, including stroke, to establish faster diagnosis, more rapid treatment and a comprehensive package of care based around individual patient needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/3">Prior to this the NSF for Older People, published in 2001, included a chapter on stroke services. It set out a range of measures to reduce the incidence of stroke and improve stroke treatment, which have led to a widespread development of services: the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) shows that all trusts caring for people who have had a stroke now have a specialist stroke service and 97 per cent. of hospitals in England now have a stroke unit; these were uncommon a decade ago. The audit also shows that in 2006, around two thirds of stroke patients were treated on a stroke unit. This is a significant improvement since 2004 when the figure was less than half. Length of stay in hospital for stroke patients is falling from 34 days in 2001 to 28 days in 2004. The results of the RCP audit also show that the proportion of trusts with a stroke unit meeting five or six of the audit's criteria has increased from 33 per cent. to 41 per cent. between 2004 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/4">Stroke mortality is falling. For people under 65, the three year average death rate from stroke has fallen by 23 per cent. over the period from 1993-95 to 2002-04. For people aged 65-75 the death rate has dropped by 30 per cent. over the same period. We have made greater progress in reducing premature deaths from coronary heart disease than from stroke. This is because we have begun by focusing on coronary heart disease, the biggest killer in the country. However, because of the significant progress we have made in this area we are now able to redouble our efforts in addressing the challenge of stroke. This is why the Department launched a stroke strategy document for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July 2007</phrase>. It followed an 18-month programme of work, setting out the views of six expert working groups who represented a wide range of key stakeholders. The strategy aims to accelerate the emergency response to stroke, by setting out a framework for care of stroke patients, and raising awareness about stroke symptoms and risk factors. It is due for publication by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/5">In addition to developing the strategy, in 2006 the Department published 'Mending hearts and brains', a report by Professor Roger Boyle, the National Director for Heart and Stroke. The report makes the clinical case for reconfiguring stroke services. In particular, it emphasises the need to treat stroke as an emergency, including the delivery of thrombolysis at specialist centres and a possible 'hub and spoke' model for stroke services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/6">Last year the Department also launched ASSET (Action on stroke services: an evaluation toolkit) to help health care providers compare their performance with others. It considers four aspects of acute treatment setting out how these mean fewer people experiencing death or disability, and more efficient hospital services with people able to return home faster. An additional version, ASSET 2, for commissioners has also been introduced which uses analytical modelling to advise hospitals and primary care trusts of what the impact of making specific changes to their services would be. We have also published a guide for commissioners, setting out key questions they need to consider and a series of best practice case studies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.5/7">As well as helping to improve existing stroke services, the Department is investing &pound;20 million over five years (2005-10) into the development of the UK Stroke Research Network.</p>

	<p pid="c.1052W.2/1">It is illegal for tobacco products to be sold to young people under 18 from vending machines, and the code produced by the National Association of Cigarette Machine Operators states that machines should be sited and monitored in supervised areas so that staff can be sure of preventing their use by those under 18.</p>
	<p pid="c.1052W.2/2">Local trading standards departments will continue to monitor vending machine sales along with all retail points on compliance with the minimum age of sale.</p>
	<p pid="c.1052W.2/3">The Department has not undertaken specific research between the levels of smoking among under 18-year-olds and the availability and accessibility of tobacco vending machines, but relies on the annual &quot;Smoking Drinking And Drug Use among Young People&quot; survey and on reports from trading standards departments.</p>

	<p pid="c.1053W.5/3">The NHS North West Strategic Health Authority reports that chiropody provision in Eastham has been relocated to the Treetops Surgery in Bromborough, and the capacity in Parkfield Medical Centre has been doubled in the new premises. From October 2007, the eligibility criteria for treatment in the former Bebington and West Wirral PCT area have been extended to include more vulnerable and elderly patients which has resulted in additional investment. This includes the recruitment of an additional podiatry post which has been funded and created to facilitate this and the Wirral Primary Care Trust is currently actively recruiting to this post. No chiropody clinics in the Wirral Primary Care Trust have closed within the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.5/4">Accurate information on the number of patients receiving chiropody treatment in the years requested is not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1054W.2/1">The Department's vision for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) was set out in the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity, published in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/2">The Department has a Public Service Agreement (PSA) Standard to ensure that CAMHS are available to all children and young people who need them. Achievement of the standard is measured by the attainment of three proxy targets, one of which is the commissioning by primary care trusts (PCTs) of twenty-four hour, emergency CAMHS assessment. The latest information, which relates to June 2007, shows that approximately 99 per cent. of PCTs are commissioning this element of service, and it is expected that coverage will be universal by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/3">In June 2007, the Department wrote to Chief Executives of Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) to give advice on the use of adult psychiatric wards for children under 16 years of age. The letter advised that, in the exceptional case where a child of 16 or under is placed on an adult psychiatric ward, SHAs should use the &quot;Serious Untoward Incident&quot; protocol to notify the Department, setting out how the child will be moved to appropriate accommodation within 48 hours and how the ward and staffing have been made appropriate for the child's needs.</p>
