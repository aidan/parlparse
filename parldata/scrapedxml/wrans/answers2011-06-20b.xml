On <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-05">5 April 2011</phrase> the Government brought into force the new single Equality Duty contained in the Equality Act 2010.

Over a 10-year period the net benefit is expected to be in the region of around &#163;110 million to &#163;205 million (net present value terms) compared to the cost of the previous duties.</p>

	<p pid="b.11W.0/1">The effect of removing eligibility of organ repairs, bells, clocks and pews from the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will be to return it to its original scope before it was widened to include these items in 2006. We estimate that the overall effect on money claimed under the scheme will be to reduce it closer to the available budget of &#163;12 million. We have not made an individual estimate of the specific impact on organ repairs, but it is worth noting that they took place continuously and successfully before being included in the scheme in 2006, so we do not expect a serious permanent reduction.</p>

These include the Nations and Regions Group established by the Government and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) to ensure UK-wide engagement and to make the most of the opportunities London 2012 brings now, and to maximise the potential benefits that will be realised locally post Games.

	<p pid="b.12W.5/3">Over the next four years VisitBritain will be running the &#8220;You're Invited&#8221; programme, which will capitalise on the international interest in the recent Royal Wedding, as well as next year's Diamond Jubilee and Olympic and Paralympic Games, and showcase Britain to the world. The programme aims to attract 4 million extra visitors, spending &#163;2 billion in the UK economy, which will support businesses, jobs and growth. The programme is backed by a &#163;100 million marketing fund, match funded by the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.12W.5/4">VisitEngland is working closely with local areas and destinations, in line with Government's localism agenda, to grow the value of local tourism economies. This is co-ordinated through the National Strategic Framework for Tourism, which includes an action programme developed in consultation with the tourism sector. VisitEngland is currently working with local areas on a campaign to deliver economic growth from the domestic market, and to support employment and job creation. &#8220;The time to be in England&#8221; will maximise the impact of the unique events of 2012, including the Queen&#8217;s Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, helping to spread the benefits of the games outside London and maintain a legacy of domestic tourism growth. The campaign is the subject of a bid to the second round of the Regional Growth Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.12W.5/5">Tourism policy seeks to help improve the sector's productivity and competitiveness, in particular to address the burden of regulation affecting the industry. The Government's Red Tape Challenge focused on the hospitality sector in May, inviting the industry and the public to identify regulations holding back the industry and stifling growth. Alongside this, the Government are setting up an industry task force, led by senior industry figures, to identify rules, regulations and inspections impeding the sector, and which might be cut, modified or abolished.</p>

	<p pid="b.22W.8/1">The Government do not subscribe to a particular view on when oil production is likely to peak. However, we recognise that there are significant challenges for investment in future oil production and that we have a role to play in working towards enhancing energy supplies, and reducing demand for fossil fuels.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.8/2">In partnership with other Government Departments, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office works internationally to reduce barriers to investment in the oil sector. Bilaterally and multilaterally, we promote the regulatory norms and business climates that enhance confidence and investment. We also use our network of international posts to promote policies such as increased energy efficiency, and the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, to reduce demand for oil and transition to the low carbon economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.24W.2/1">We voted against the resolution at last year's UN General Assembly which established a High-Level meeting of the UN General Assembly in September 2011 to commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of the Adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The Government recognise that it is common practice for the UN to convene meetings at regular periodic intervals to commemorate the adoption of its various social and human rights-related agendas. For these reasons, we were ready to agree to a limited commemorative event. However, in light of the lengthy and difficult 2009 Durban Review Conference, we felt the proposed size and scope of the 2011 event was inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.2/2">We have not yet taken a final decision on our participation in the 2011 high-level meeting. We will nonetheless work closely with EU and colleagues from other countries in the run-up to the September event to try to ensure that the meeting does not become another platform for the kind of anti-Semitic rhetoric and behaviour that was evident at the 2001 World Conference against Racism and to a lesser extent at the 2009 Durban Review Conference. We will also work to make sure that the meeting addresses all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, and that any outcome from the meeting includes a clear statement on the need to combat anti-Semitism as part of wider efforts to tackle racism.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.2/3">We are aware that the Government of the United States of America has recently announced its decision not to participate in the September 2011 event. Their announcement follows that of the Governments of Canada and Israel. To date, we have not received reports that any other government has decided against participation.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.2/4">The Government's participation and representation at the September meeting will remain under review in light of our efforts to achieve our objectives as set out above. We will also engage with interested British non-governmental organisations in reaching our final decision.</p>

We do not match other donor contributions to other organisations on this basis; we exert choice in how we allocate our aid. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI) came out very well in our root and branch review of multilateral aid so we know that investing in GAVI offers very good value for money. I and my Cabinet colleagues, including the Prime Minister, have lobbied hard to bring other donors with us in stepping up our contributions to GAVI. Several donors have more than doubled their contributions. Australia has increased its contribution ten fold. Bill Gates has added another $1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.9/2">We have brought in new donors over the last year (Korea, Japan, Brazil) and we will continue to encourage others to come on board. Our efforts to date helped GAVI raise $4.3 billion at their pledging conference on June 13. With this they will exceed their ambition of vaccinating more than a quarter of a billion children and saving four million lives. They will expand and accelerate their coverage, immunising more children with more vaccines.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.5/1">It is crucial that the international system starts planning early to help the Libyan people stabilise a future peace. The UK is also working closely with a range of partners on post-conflict planning, including NATO, the UN, the EU and the Libya Contact Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is working with Whitehall partners in supporting and planning for post-conflict efforts in Libya. Within DFID there are a range of departments contributing to this work; within the DFID Libya Unit there is a team of five working on stabilisation and transition issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.5/3">There are also seven UK personnel working on post-conflict planning as part of the International Stabilisation Response Team. Stabilisation Response Teams (SRT) provide an integrated and bespoke approach to post-conflict stabilisation, reconstruction and development. The SRT, comprising UK and international staff, travelled to eastern Libya in late May to assess and set out a well coordinated and effective response to the needs of the Libyan people by the international community in coordination with the UN.</p>

	<p pid="b.30W.2/1">Moving on to more active benefits will give our customers a real opportunity to get back to work.

	<p pid="b.30W.2/2">Through the groundbreaking Work programme we are giving those in the private and voluntary sector with the best expertise the freedom to design tailor-made back to work support built around the needs of the individual. In return for that freedom to innovate we will pay providers by results and we will incentivise them to focus their resources on our hardest to help customers, including those customers who claim JSA or ESA after reassessment. Following reassessment, most of those who go on to receive ESA will be able to access the Work programme immediately, while those who go on to claim JSA will be able to access the Work programme from three months into their claim, recognising the additional challenges they may face in preparing for and finding work compared with other jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="b.30W.2/3">We are also modernising the way Jobcentre Plus delivers its services to customers outside of the Work programme. Jobcentre Plus advisers will have the flexibility to assess customers' individual needs and offer the support they see fit, drawing from a flexible menu of provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.30W.2/4">Our mainstream provision will be complemented by specialist disability employment programmes including Work Choice, which will continue to help people with more severe disabilities or complex needs to prepare for work and to undertake supported employment, with the aim of progressing into unsupported employment where possible.</p>

At its heart are the principles of work, fairness, responsibility and support for the most vulnerable. It draws together our radical programme of reform of welfare and education, increasing children's life chances, with a greater concentration on early intervention and on whole-family and whole-life measures. Our strategy establishes a UK-wide framework for tackling child poverty and builds on strategies developed by the devolved Administrations, including that published by the Scottish Government in March this year.</p>

Prior to this ADF was only available to people who had been in continuous receipt of JSA for 26 weeks or more, unless they were participating in one of the New Deal schemes.

	<p pid="b.40W.3/1">Information on the total number of veterans who committed suicide in each of the last 20 years is not held. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) currently publish data of detailed causes of the mortality, including suicide, of veterans of the 1990-91 operation in the Gulf, together with comparative data for a matched cohort of personnel who did not deploy. The latest data, produced by Defence Analytical Services and Advice (DASA), was released on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.3/2">The MOD also commissioned research from Manchester university to investigate the level of suicide among those leaving the UK armed forces, over the period 1996 to 2005, and to make comparisons with matched personnel remaining in service and the general population. This work was published in March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.3/3">Copies of both reports will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.40W.3/4">The MOD is currently undertaking research into the causes of death, including suicide, among those who served in the Falklands campaign. This research, which is expected to be completed by the end of March 2012, will assist us in continuing to develop our support for our former personnel and those leaving the services. The MOD is also undertaking a similar study on veterans of operations Telic and Herrick. This will monitor the causes of death, including suicide, and cancer morbidity of all serving members of the armed forces from 2003 until the end of operations in Afghanistan. The intention is to run the study for the lifetime of the cohort; therefore the population will include both serving and discharged personnel.</p>

Although this presumption exists, the presumption does not mean that no rural school will ever close, but it does ensure that the case for closure is strong and that the proposals are clearly in the best interests of educational provision in the area.

	<p pid="b.56W.9/1">The NHS Information Centre and the Department use a common method to estimate alcohol-related admissions, based on research undertaken by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO).</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.9/2">The method makes use of the internationally applied concept of attributable fractions. In the case of alcohol-related admissions, an attributable fraction represents the estimated percentage of admissions that can be attributed to alcohol consumption. The NWPHO estimated fractions for the 47 conditions for which there was sufficient epidemiological evidence that the risk of morbidity is affected by alcohol consumption. In some cases, such as alcoholic liver disease, the conditions are wholly attributable to alcohol, in which case the attributable fraction is 1, or 100%. In the case of partially attributable conditions, the fractions often vary by age and sex. The list includes chronic conditions such as some cancers, acute conditions such as ethanol poisoning, and external causes such as road accidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.9/3">Further details about how the fractions were generated can be found in the NWPHO report &#8220;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&#8221;, available at:</p>

It is essential that proper arrangements are made for the safe and satisfactory transfer of residents to other suitable homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.61W.2/1">For 2009-10, we do not have the data requested. Based on strategic health authority (SHA) estimates, approximately one million NHS Health Check-type checks were offered to people and about 700,000 were delivered in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.61W.2/2">The programme was included in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 NHS Operating Framework, but it was for local implementation and not national performance management. This meant that primary care trusts (PCTs) could decide locally when to start implementing the programme. In addition, there have been issues with establishing a new data collection and ensuring that reporting on the programme has been accurate. We estimate that during 2010-11 approximately 1.4 million checks were offered and about 820,000 were delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.61W.2/3">In 2011-12, the programme has a supporting measure in the 2011-12 NHS Operating Framework. This has enabled us to work closely with SHAs to ensure that PCTs' plans for implementing the programme are aimed at reaching 18% of their eligible cohort and that the data they return are of better quality. This will enable the data on the number of NHS Health Checks carried out to be published on a quarterly basis from Quarter 1 of 2011-12 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="b.76W.3/2">Fractional reserve banking is a term to describe how the modern banking system operates. Fractional reserve banking means that only a fraction of banks deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and available for withdrawal. A non-fractional reserve banking system would operate on the basis that where a deposit was lodged in a bank, the bank would safeguard this deposit, usually by placing in a vault. It would do nothing with the money and would charge a fee for the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.3/3">Banking capital requirement guidelines are set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In November 2010, G20 Leaders endorsed the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; reform package proposed by the Committee. The package will more than triple the amount of high quality capital banks will be required to hold, helping them to survive losses and continue to lend. Ending the fractional reserve banking system has not been considered as a viable policy option for the UK economy; no assessment of the likely effects on industry has been made.</p>

	<p pid="b.80W.11/1">The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England is operationally independent in setting monetary policy to meet the inflation target, including bank rate and the level of asset purchases under quantitative easing (QE). The MPC takes all relevant factors, including the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers, into account in its assessment of the balance of risks to inflation in the medium term. The Bank's May 2009 Inflation Report explains how asset purchases work to stimulate nominal spending along various channels. The Bank's analysis, for example in the Quarterly Bulletin 2011 Q1, is that QE has had a positive impact on spending by households and businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.85W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice announced in the Green Paper, &#8216;Breaking the Cycle&#8217;, published in December 2010, that it will test a local approach to payment by results. The aim is to encourage local statutory partners to reduce crime and reoffending, and enable them to reinvest any savings that their success realises for the justice system in further activity to prevent reoffending in their communities. The pilots will be fully evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="b.85W.2/2">The evaluation will describe and explain what happened during the tests, what outcomes were observed across the criminal justice system, why these may have occurred, and what aspects of the schemes were successful. The evaluation will monitor reoffending and crime rates, as well as a wider range of criminal justice system data trends, in each local area. It will use a mix of qualitative and quantitative data.</p>

	<p pid="b.94W.2/1">Of the Crown court cases listed for trial in 2010, around 39% ended on the trial date before the jury was sworn (no further trial time required) due to a defendant entering a late guilty plea or pleading guilty to an alternative charge which was accepted by the prosecution. Information on the proportion of Crown court cases listed for trial that resulted in a guilty plea being entered after the announcement of a trial date can be obtained only at a disproportionate cost as the announcement date is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.94W.2/3">Table 2 contains the number of cases in the Crown court that ended in a guilty plea in each of the years from 1995 to 2010. A case is treated as a guilty plea only if pleas of guilty are recorded in respect of all defendants involved. A guilty plea is recorded when a defendant: (i) pleads guilty to all counts; (ii) pleads guilty to some counts and not guilty to others and no jury is sworn in respect of the not guilty counts; and (iii) pleads not guilty to some or all counts but offers a guilty plea to alternatives which are accepted (providing no jury is sworn in respect of the other counts).</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice has information in respect of cash equivalent transfer values (CETVs) for civil servants that are board members only. These are disclosed in the Remuneration Report in the annual Ministry of Justice Resource Accounts (of which a copy for the financial year 2009-10 can be found in the Library of the House and on the Ministry of Justice website).

Cases fall into the court system often for the wrong reasons, sometimes because people are unaware of alternatives or have not used the advice services that are available to help resolve disputes.

	<p pid="b.101W.3/1">The grading structure in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) differs from the rest of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The definition of grade C is different in each case. Senior Manager C in NOMS refers to a more senior responsibility level than a Band C in MOJ. The equivalent of a Senior Manager C within MOJ is Band A. It is this level for which information is supplied in the answer.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.3/2">The number of senior managers (Bands A and above) that left the MOJ between <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> was 348. The number of senior managers (Senior Manager C and above) that left NOMS during the same period was 109. Of these, 38 staff were operational grades.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.3/3">The MOJ and NOMS do not keep records of employment taken up by former staff after they have left. NOMS is however aware that a small number of senior managers resigned in 2010 to take up posts in the private sector, including the Governors of Holloway, Whitemoor, Moorland and the Isle of Wight prisons. One former Director of Offender Management also took up an appointment with Sodexo in May 2011. There may have been others who joined private sector providers but there is no requirement for those leaving to advise the Department or agency of their future employment plans, save for any obligations under the Business Appointment Rules. These rules were applied in the appointment of the former Director of Offender Management with Sodexo.</p>

The overall average resource cost per prisoner held in an adult establishment in England and Wales for 2009-10 is &#163;39,000. The average resource cost per place is &#163;43,000.

The primary consideration is whether the risk of harm posed by the offender to others would be most effectively managed by the enhanced supervision provided in an approved premises. The decision to admit an offender to a particular approved premises is based upon an assessment of the risk of serious harm posed by the offender to the public, victims, and other residents or staff.</p>

The figures for 2008-09 and 2009-10 are taken from the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Agency annual accounts and supporting data.  3. Following standard accounting practice, local boards. and trusts. pension contributions are not fully reflected in the figures.  4. Expenditure on probation met centrally by the National Probation Directorate (as was) and the National Offender Management Service is not included in local areas&#8217; expenditure.  5. Comparisons over time are difficult due to changes in accounting methodology.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.108W.2/2">In addition to the measures in the formal performance assessment, the probation contracts contain a number of targeted output measures including Sustained Employment, Education Awards, Sex Offender Treatment Programmes Completions, Domestic Violence Completions, Offending Behaviour Programme Completions, Drug Rehabilitation Requirement Completions, Alcohol Treatment Requirement Completions and Community Payback Completions among other measures used for assurance purposes.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.0/1">The Government have decided to abolish the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and deliver its main functions from a newly created youth justice division within the Ministry of Justice. These functions include the oversight of youth offending teams, disseminating effective practice, commissioning a distinct secure estate and placing young people in custody. The YJB is responsible for offenders aged under 18 so its abolition will not impact on provision for young adult offenders.</p>

I will be very interested to see the impact of proposals developed by the Ministry of Justice to tackle the &#8220;litigation culture&#8221;, in the wake of Lord Justice Jackson's consideration of the &#8220;no win, no fee&#8221; conditional fee arrangements (November 2010).

	<p pid="b.115W.6/1">This Government have been very clear about the importance of widening participation and improving access to further and higher education. Adult carers have been given consideration as part of the enhancements to adult learner support for students in further education. Representative bodies were invited to discussions earlier this year to help formulate the policy. Carers are eligible to apply for learner support funds as appropriate and this will remain the case for 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="b.115W.6/2">In higher education we are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation. Higher education institutions will be encouraged to identify candidates with the ability and potential to succeed, offering those that might need extra support the appropriate assistance. For full-time students in higher education a comprehensive package of grants and loans is available through the student finance system, with extra support for students with adult or child dependants in the form of an Adult Dependants' Grant, Childcare Grant and Parents' Learning Allowance. From 2012/13 eligible new part-time students will not pay upfront tuition charges and will be able to access loans in order to pay for their tuition, as is the case for full-time students.</p>

	<p pid="b.118W.3/1">The Department does not hold information about the use of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) working definition of anti-Semitism. It is public knowledge that it has been adopted by the National Union of Students. We have not held discussions with universities about definitions of anti-Semitism, or about any specific definition used by the Department with the Jewish community.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.3/2">The UK Government currently uses the Macpherson definition of a racist incident which is an incident that is perceived as racist by the victim or any other person, and this would include anti-Semitism.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.3/3">I met with the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) towards the end of last year, alongside <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" name="John Mann">the hon.

My officials have met with the UJS to discuss the Prevent strategy, and the recent motion concerning the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC, now the FRA) working definition of anti-Semitism agreed at the University and College Union's annual congress.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.3/4">The Government's position is clear, anti-Semitism and intolerance have no place in our society and no place in higher education. Staff and students from all backgrounds, cultures and communities must be welcome in our higher education sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.3/5">The UK has in place one of the strongest legislative frameworks to protect people from harassment and abuse, and specifically racial or religious persecution. This framework provides protection to Jewish people alongside other ethnic and religious groups. As independent organisations, higher education institutions are directly accountable for compliance with the law and hold the primary responsibility for ensuring that their staff and students are not subject to threatening or abusive behaviour on campus.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.3/6">In addition to legal requirements, institutions have access to a range of practical guidance to help them ensure fair treatment of their staff and students, and to help them deal effectively with instances of intolerance, racism and harassment in their institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.3/7">The Government would expect institutions to vigorously tackle intolerance on campus when it arises.</p>

	<p pid="b.121W.3/2">The benefits to the EU from tackling non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in free trade agreements (FTAs) can be substantial but in all trade deals there will be some adjustment costs. For the EU-South Korea, the elimination of NTBs in the final agreement was the major factor behind the anticipated gains increasing from &#8364;19 billion (in earlier estimates) to &#8364;33 billion. Negotiations on the EU-India FTA are ongoing, and negotiations with Japan are yet to be launched. In both, the reduction of NTBs will be a key UK objective.</p>

	<p pid="b.121W.9/2">In all free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations, the UK undertakes its own analysis and consults widely with business stakeholders to ensure that we identify and prioritise those issues, including non-tariff barriers, which matter most to UK business. Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have formed a key part of the market opening of the EU FTAs with developed countries such as EU-South Korea. The removal of NTBs in EU is very much in our interests to improve the functioning of the single market, which is our largest export market.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.0/2">Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) can be a more significant barrier to trade than tariffs, especially for trade between developed countries.

	<p pid="b.124W.2/1">To date, engagement by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) with Ofgem on the visual impact of overhead power lines has been at official level as part of Ofgem's next transmission price control review (RIIO-T1). This has involved bilateral discussions, correspondence and participation at stakeholder events such as the Price Control Review Forum and RIIO Working Groups. Where new and replacement pylons are required, DECC is keen to support the development of the most visually acceptable overhead solutions. The Royal Institute of British Architects is therefore running a competition on behalf of DECC and National Grid that calls for designs for a new generation of pylon. A key element to the competition will be a public consultation exercise in September which will provide members of the public with a chance to comment on the best designs.
