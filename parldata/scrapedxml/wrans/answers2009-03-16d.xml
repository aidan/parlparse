	<p pid="d.818W.3/1">The Creative Sparks initiative developed into the Cultural Hubs programme, which ran from autumn 2005 to summer 2008. This comprised a consortium of cultural organisations and schools working together in three areas of England to create inspirational learning opportunities for young people.</p>
	<p pid="d.818W.3/2">The total budget for each Cultural Hub was &pound;1 million. Creative Sparks identified 10 areas of work which the schools were asked to deliver on. By 2008, 33 per cent. of Cultural Hubs schools had delivered 100 per cent. of the 10 areas and 78 per cent. had delivered 80 per cent. of the 10 areas outlined in the original Creative Sparks initiative.</p>
	<p pid="d.818W.3/3">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport continues to support the initiative's aims through a range of work including new audiences, young talent and a cultural offer for children and young people.</p>

The advice has prioritised capital funding for a number of road infrastructure schemes which fall within Essex. This includes the Sadlers Farm local major road scheme and &pound;60 million towards introducing new traffic management measures to improve safety, reduce delays and tackle congestion along the A12 from London through Essex and Suffolk to the Felixstowe and Harwich Ports.</p>

The agency is currently finalising its plans to allocate this additional funding to ensure best use of available resources and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.0/5">Finally, through the Community Infrastructure Fund (CIF), the Department for Transport has funded &pound;37.6 million towards road infrastructure improvements. Further CIF schemes in Essex are also now being assessed, with an announcement expected shortly.</p>

Individuals serving on or after this date were provided with the opportunity to make additional contributions so as to qualify former service for the half rate of widows' pension.

	<p pid="d.835W.2/1">The UK Defence Medical Services do not procure stocks of blood products locally in either Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/2">For routine transfusions, deployed UK military hospitals maintain stocks of blood sourced from UK National Blood Service (NBS) donor centres, which screen and test their donors according to nationally mandated standards. For most patients, this blood is all that is used or needed for their trauma care. However, in circumstances when standard blood stocks might not be sufficient, or where the properties of whole fresh blood are needed, an emergency blood transfusion from donors at a field hospital on or near the battlefield can be the only way of saving lives of gravely wounded UK personnel.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/3">To enable blood to be obtained in such an emergency, UK field hospitals maintain an Emergency Donor Panel (EDP), consisting of a group of pre-screened volunteer donors who are available to donate blood at short notice. The volunteer donors will have been screened for suitability in accordance with UK NBS guidelines prior to deployment. Prior to donating at an EDP, a further check is made through use of a health questionnaire and an examination of the veins of the potential donors. Blood samples are taken to confirm a donor's blood group, and for retrospective testing by the UK NBS to confirm that the blood transfused remained free from transfusion transmitted infections.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/4">The military forces of our coalition partners in both Iraq and Afghanistan have their own procedures for pre- and post-screening of blood obtained from their equivalent of an EDP. If seriously-injured UK casualties are treated in a coalition medical facility, they may be given a life-saving transfusion of such blood for the same reasons as apply in a UK field hospital, with the coalition facilities using the same procedures as would be used to treat one of their own nationals. On a few occasions UK field hospitals have also made use of blood and blood components provided by US Forces, to support UK casualties in an emergency.</p>

	<p pid="d.839W.0/1">Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most off-track against the water and sanitation targets. The European Union (EU) is addressing this problem and last year disbursed nearly &pound;1 billion to the water sector in Africa. The EU Africa Working Group (AWG) works with the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) to improve the effectiveness of this aid. The European Commission recognises that improvements can be made to the way the AWG is structured and recently carried out an internal evaluation of the group that concluded that its roles, responsibilities and procedures need clarifying. The AWG has responded by agreeing to redesign the Project Logical Framework, so that the roles of all stakeholders are more clearly identified and the activities of the group can be more closely monitored.</p>
	<p pid="d.839W.0/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is this year co-chairing the AWG with AMCOW. This has led to a strengthened engagement with African partners and donors to ensure that future aid provided to Africa more closely matches the needs of those countries to meet the water and sanitation targets. Other progress has also been made by the AWG, notably the development of the Africa-EU Statement on Sanitation that supports the eTekwini Declaration on Sanitation signed by 32 African Ministers in Durban in February 2008. Strong and clear commitments were given by African leaders to give higher priority to sanitation, make further funds available and take concrete action to meet the MDG target.</p>

	<p pid="d.840W.3/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) approach to strengthening health systems seeks to diagnose critical problems and identify needs for strengthening in each country. This enables us to design the best response and set appropriate priorities, including assessing the needs of women and girls, their use of services and any barriers they face. There may be a need for targeted services or approaches to reach specific groups, such as reproductive health services for adolescent girls. DFID also recognises that monitoring the implementation and results of health systems strengthening needs a gender dimension to see if strategies are working.</p>
	<p pid="d.840W.3/2">Progress on strengthening health systems in poor countries is also vital if we are to accelerate progress towards achieving the maternal health millennium development goal. This is why, along with UN health agencies and a wide range of donors and country partners, DFID has championed the International Health Partnership designed to strengthen health systems and improve in-country donor coordination. To help ensure that investments in health systems reach women and children we are working with countries to help remove barriers that stop poor people using health services. This includes support to countries to remove health user fees so that services for children and pregnant women are free at the point of use.</p>

	<p pid="d.841W.2/2">In most of our 22 priority countries, we are either supporting the development of strategies for educating young people about the threat of AIDS (e.g. in Mozambique) or encouraging countries to mainstream AIDS in their education sector plan (e.g. in Zambia). All of our 22 priority countries are addressing the impact of HIV in their education sector plans (i.e. on teacher attrition).</p>
	<p pid="d.841W.2/3">Education, including sexual and reproductive health education, is one of the most significant factors in preventing the spread of HIV in the next generation. The UK Government continue to work with partner governments to raise awareness about the importance of education as a means for preventing and mitigating the impact of the AIDS pandemic. The UK also provides substantial support for UNAIDS, UNICEF and UNFPA who are particularly active in AIDS education work.</p>

Five UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) require Iran to suspend enrichment related activities, three of which impose sanctions. The UNSCRs require states to freeze assets owned or controlled by individuals, entities and organisations involved with, or supporting, nuclear activities in Iran. They must also exercise vigilance over Iranian banks.</p>

	<p pid="d.861W.8/1">For the procurement of flexible New Deal in the 14 Phase 1 contract packages, DWP will let contracts with a single lead entity. The 'Lead' entity will be accountable for overall delivery but may choose to subcontract out all, part or none of the provision. For Flexible New Deal a two stage tendering process was adopted.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.8/2">The use of a two-stage 'restricted' procedure, involves an initial Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) stage and then the issue of Invitation to Tenders (ItT) to those short-listed at PQQ stage. This helps to keep the amount of work, both for DWP and for potential suppliers within manageable limits, as we have a high level of interest. The two-stage process brings the dual benefits of maintaining competition and excluding (either voluntarily or directly) those organisations that have no realistic capacity to deliver a contract. This process includes a separate financial capability assessment at both stages of the evaluation process.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.8/3">The PQQ stage includes a number of questions to assess which bidders appear to have the strongest capacity to proceed to tender. The second stage tenders are evaluated based on the optimum combination of quality and price.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.8/4">Phase One FND procurement is now proceeding to a revised schedule and has taken account of the current economic climate and potential for volume increase. Short listed organisations have been given time to impact these changes on their tenders. We expect to identify preferred bidders during April and announce contracts by the end of May 2009. We still aim to begin delivery in October 2009. We plan for FND Phase Two to commence in spring 2009 and details will be published on the DWP website.</p>

	<p pid="d.866W.0/2">The White Paper, 'Raising expectations and increasing support', announced measures to smooth the transition to employment and support allowance for existing incapacity benefit customers by starting to align their benefit rates with employment and support allowance rates from April 2009. To begin the process of achieving alignment with employment and support allowance, those on contributory incapacity benefit with an age addition, including former invalidity benefit customers, will see their overall benefit increased in April 2009 by half of the Rossi index<sup>(1)</sup>, rather than by the full Rossi index. Customers in receipt of severe disablement allowance with an age addition will receive an increase equivalent to the full Rossi increase.</p>
	<p pid="d.866W.0/3">In 2009-10 there will be an estimated 660,000 customers receiving incapacity benefit with age additions<sup>(2)</sup>. As a result of the White Paper changes, from April 2009 the benefit rate for these cases will be on average &pound;3.20 per week higher than in 2008-09, an increase of 3.4 per cent.<sup>(3)</sup> For example, those on incapacity benefit with the higher age addition, and no other additions, will see their benefit increase from &pound;102.25 per week in 2008-09 to &pound;105.45 per week in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="d.866W.0/4">Despite the increase in benefit rates for people with age additions, the total expenditure on these cases is expected to fall by nearly &pound;180 million from 2008-09 to 2009-10 due to an expected reduction in the number of people claiming incapacity benefits<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>

This allows all local authorities to start to shield a small proportion of records on ContactPoint. This precautionary measure is appropriate for the records of children who would be at risk of significant harm if their whereabouts was disclosed. This might include children in particularly vulnerable circumstances, such as children from families on police protection schemes; where one parent has been the victim of domestic violence or abuse; or, in certain cases, where the child has been adopted.</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.2/3">We are working closely with 17 early adopter local authorities to identify and help them work through any issues. In their assessment at the end of January, 4 of these early adopters raised issues concerned with the effective implementation of this first operational stage and we are now working with them to resolve these issues. We remain committed to a prudent and incremental approach to implementation, and will continue to evaluate progress and adapt our approach as required.</p>

	<p pid="d.871W.2/2">Our guidance 'Safe to Learn' provides specific advice to schools on complaints procedures for parents. It recommends that the first contact point to report concerns about bullying should be the class teacher or form teacher. The guidance provides a sample anti-bullying information sheet to be sent to parents, which could include a named contact for reporting concerns about bullying. We introduced legal provisions in the 2006 Education Act which gave school staff new powers to discipline pupils for bad behaviour outside the school gate. We have asked the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to work with local authorities and schools to ensure the 'Safe to Learn' guidance is effectively implemented on the ground, and that schools make effective use of the other materials.</p>

	<p pid="d.880W.14/1">Initiatives to bring empty homes back into use are, rightly, channelled through local authorities who are best placed to assess what measures are appropriate to their local circumstances. In the first instance, we encourage local authorities to work with owners to persuade them of the benefits of bringing their property back into use.</p>
	<p pid="d.880W.14/2">However, where it is clear that owners are not prepared to co-operate with efforts to get their property occupied through agreement, we have provided enforcement powers to deal with them. Key powers are compulsory purchase and enforced sale which were added to by the Housing Act 2004 which introduced a new power for local authorities to make Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) in respect of long-term empty homes. An EDMO allows a local authority to take over the management of an unoccupied dwelling in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.880W.14/3">We are keen for local authorities to make use of EDMOs, where appropriate, and are supporting the independent Empty Homes Agency's new guidance on EDMOs, which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-10">10 March</phrase>. The guidance is internet based and interactive and takes local authorities through the EDMO process step by step. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning provided a foreword for the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="d.880W.14/4">Later this month we are also hosting a seminar at which I will address local authorities encouraging them to take action and to share best practice on tackling empty homes, including the use of EDMOs.</p>
	<p pid="d.880W.14/5">In addition, local authorities and other public sector bodies must do more to resolve the problems within their own housing stock, but this does not mean they should be prevented from pursuing reoccupation of privately owned dwellings.</p>

	<p pid="d.882W.2/1">The Government Mortgage Rescue aims to support up to 6,000 'vulnerable' households in England at risk of repossession over the next two years. Under the scheme's criteria, a 'vulnerable' household is termed as one that falls within one of three priority need categories and who would be owed a duty to secure accommodation under the homelessness legislation (section 189(1)(a)-(c) of the Housing Act 1996) if they became homeless through no fault of their own.</p>

The Government have not made any estimate of the number of households it expects to benefit from the scheme by individual parliamentary constituency.

The Places of Change programme grant will enable &quot;BOSCO&quot; to transform a poor physical environment into an attractive, welcoming living space, and also to improve established training facilities and opportunities for social enterprise for residents.</p>

The issue of whether a fee should be charged for the collection of such waste, and the level of that fee, is a matter for the relevant local authority to consider in the light of the circumstances that apply in each individual case. Local authorities have strong powers under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, to deal with any incidences of fly-tipping that might arise if the council cannot come to an agreement with the occupiers of the site about the level of fee.</p>

	<p pid="d.892W.5/3">As yet, there is no available blood test for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). However, there are a number of measures in place to reduce the risk of vCJD transmission via blood transfusion. A copy of these will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.5/4">There are additional measures in place for the reduction of risk of donor skin contamination of blood during donation, such as diversion of the first portion of blood into a sample pouch rather than the main pack, and enhanced arm cleansing prior to venepuncture. Both measures significantly reduce risk of contamination.</p>
	<p pid="d.892W.5/5">No blood donation is 100 per cent. safe, and therefore blood should be used only when clinically appropriate. Significant action has been taken to promote appropriate use of blood and tissues and alternatives throughout the national health service, such as the Better Blood Transfusion programme, see &quot;Health Service Circular 2007/001&quot;, a copy of which has been placed in the Library and is available at:</p>

Finished admission episodes: a finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes.

Primary diagnosis: the primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> 4. The ICD-10 codes used to identify heart attacks are as follows; I21&mdash;Acute myocardial infarction and I22&mdash;Subsequent myocardial infarction.<br/> 5. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: these figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a HES record.<br/> 6. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the NHS in England. The NHS Information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.897W.2/1">Clinical psychologists, counselling psychologists, nurse therapists, primary care counsellors and other qualified mental health professionals are eligible to train in delivering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety disorders, high intensity therapy, as part of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. Those without a core professional background are required to complete a knowledge, skills and attitudes portfolio to be eligible for training.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/2">All those currently delivering CBT are required to be accredited by the BABCP (British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies), the United Kingdom's leading organisation for CBT.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/3">People from a wide range of backgrounds with a special interest in therapeutic approaches are eligible to train in delivering low intensity interventions.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/4">IAPT programme training courses can be described as &quot;state of the art&quot; courses principally because they are based on the CBT competency framework, which was a piece of empirical science.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/5">In addition, these training courses focus on clinical skills development for low and high intensity therapists; they have national curricula developed through expert and lay consultation; they are supported by clear national learning materials, and techniques developed in clinical trials are taught by experts in the relevant therapeutic discipline.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/6">All the educational institutions delivering these courses around the country are subject to an accreditation regime that provides quality assurance.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/7">The IAPT programme has one principal aim&mdash;to help primary care trusts (PCTs) implement the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for people suffering from depression and/or anxiety disorders.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.2/8">CBT is an evidence-based intervention and is recommended by NICE for the treatment of depression and/or anxiety disorders. However, all IAPT services are required to collect routine clinical outcomes at every session so that clinical teams can evaluate the effectiveness of the service and so patients can see and discuss their progress with their therapist. The data also enable PCTs and practice based commissioners to commission psychological therapy services for the outcomes they are expected to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="d.902W.3/2">This Government have rescued and expanded the apprenticeship programme. We will meet our target of 130,000 completions by 2010-11. Completions have more than trebled since 2001-02, from 39,000 to 113,000 in 2007-08. This means that over the 10-year period from 2001-02, to the end of the CSR period in 2010-11, around 900,000 young people and adults will have successfully completed their apprenticeship. Completion rates also reached an all-time high in 2007-08 of 64 per cent., compared to 48 per cent. in 2005-06. By 2020 we aim to deliver over 250,000 apprenticeship starts and 190,000 successful completions in order to meet the Leitch ambition for apprenticeships in England. We are on track to meet this ambition with a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007-08.</p>

However, there has been one payment through the Central Office of Information to OLR, on behalf of DIUS. This payment was for OLR to organise two citizens' juries, which took place on 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-11">11 December 2007</phrase> in London and Hull.

	<p pid="d.905W.5/1">The Learning and Skills Council provides funding for English for Speakers of Other languages (ESOL) courses to private providers as part of their overall allocation of funding for adult learning. Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data show that around 50 private providers received funding to deliver ESOL courses in 2008-09. It is not possible to list individual providers and these figures do not include Train to Gain as these data are not available at the present time.</p>
	<p pid="d.905W.5/2">Private providers funded by the LSC to deliver ESOL courses are selected by the same process as other providers. The process for choosing providers begins with the LSC's annual Statement of Priorities document which sets out the key policy and investment priorities for the further education sector. Each LSC region produces a Regional Commissioning Statement which sets out the totality of provision to be secured in each region for the next academic year and which sets national priorities in a regional context. Private providers receiving LSC funding to deliver ESOL will be liable to meet the same quality criteria as FE colleges.</p>
	<p pid="d.905W.5/3">On the basis of the priorities and investment set out in these documents, the LSC then enters a commissioning process with its current provider base (which includes private providers) to secure provision for the next academic year.</p>
	<p pid="d.905W.5/4">In some regions, where there has been a strategic need to meet gaps in provision or to improve quality, ESOL provision has been tendered. The LSC commissions providers in light of their performance, the quality of their delivery, their capacity and capability, including their financial health. Allocations and contracts are then agreed with providers based on a planning assumption of the volumes the provider will deliver. Contracts are monitored regularly and robustly for all provision and increases or decreases applied to delivery volumes where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="d.905W.5/5">ESOL courses are delivered using a variety of methods by accredited ESOL teachers. ESOL Skills for Life qualifications have been designed to meet the needs of the broad range of learners who want to live and work in this country and if, appropriate, intend to become citizens of the UK and are based on the National Standards for Adult Literacy. At levels 1 and 2, the ESOL Skills for Life assess reading through the same national tests as are used for Key Skills Communication qualifications and the level 1 and 2 Certificate in Adult Literacy.</p>

	<p pid="d.906W.5/1">The Higher Education Funding Council is under a legal duty to consider the financial health of those institutions it funds. The Council's board periodically receives papers on the small number of institutions which are considered to be 'at risk'. Following discussion with the Information Commissioner those papers are published after a suitable interval, to both protect the financial integrity of that institution and ensure the public interest is maintained. This is set as a minimum period of three years. Data on those institutions at risk extracted from the board's papers are now publicly available and the tables have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

The latest available figure is 39.8 per cent. in 2006-07. For young people (aged 17-20), the figure is 31.6 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.913W.6/26">The reason for leaving information on the HESA Student Record should be treated with some caution, because the 'Other personal reasons and dropped out' and 'Other' fields are used extensively. Institutions are not always able to record the precise reason for leaving. Furthermore, HESA allows only one reason for withdrawal to be recorded, however it is likely that many students leave for a combination of reasons.</p>

	<p pid="d.916W.0/1">The Union Learning Fund does not provide funding to trade unions to promote awareness of trade union members' right to opt out of political funds. Its primary objective is to help trade unions and their Union Learning Representatives drive up the demand for learning in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="d.916W.0/2">There are now over 20,500 trained Union Learning Representatives who have helped more than 600,000 workers into learning since the Union Learning Fund was introduced. Over 200,000 were helped last year alone, many from those hard to reach groups who employers and training providers find it so difficult to engage with, including over 34,000 workers with poor basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
	<p pid="d.916W.0/3">With their real-life experience and credibility in the workplace, Union Learning Representatives inspire trust and foster ambition in others, giving them the confidence to seek new ways to improve their skills. They are making a big difference to the lives of working people right across the country, helping them to learn new skills and update existing ones and giving them a real stake in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.916W.0/4">That is why we will continue to support the Union Learning Fund and unionlearn, the TUC's learning and skills organisation, to develop and promote the work of Union Learning Representatives so that by 2010 there will be 22,000 trained Union Learning Representatives helping over 250,000 workers back into learning each year.</p>

	<p pid="d.923W.2/1">Since the phasing-out of embarkation controls in 1994 no Government have ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately and that remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.923W.2/2">As part of the Government's 10-point plan for delivery, by 2010 over 95 per cent. of non-European Economic Area foreign nationals will be counted in and out of the country, rising to 100 per cent. by 2014. This is part of a sweeping programme of border protection which also includes the global roll-out of fingerprint visas, watch-list checks for all travellers before they arrive or depart from the UK and ID cards for foreign nationals.</p>

	<p pid="d.939W.2/1">Government's spending priorities are not, in general, determined by the way in which the money is raised. Hypothecating revenues to particular spending programmes imparts inflexibility in spending decisions and can lead to a misallocation of resources, with reduced value for money for taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="d.939W.2/2">However, the Government recognise the need for investment in low carbon energy and other technologies, and their policy framework is already driving significant activity in this sector, for example, through the renewables obligation and the Environmental Transformation Fund.</p>
	<p pid="d.939W.2/3">The revised EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) directive, to apply from 2013, does not contain any legally binding requirements on member states to hypothecate auction revenues. The UK Government support this approach.</p>
	<p pid="d.939W.2/4">In addition to the directive, EU member states have made a non-legally binding commitment to spend at least half of the revenues from auctioning to tackle climate change both in the EU and in developing countries. This will include reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, reducing deforestation and developing renewable technologies. The Government are content with this approach, which we believe will provide a strong signal of the EU's willingness to invest in a low carbon economy and offer support to the international community ahead of negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.939W.5/3">In 2006, of 15.2 million vulnerable households in England, 1.9 million (13 per cent.) were fuel poor. The following table gives a detailed breakdown for each vulnerable group and is based on the latest figures available for England, for 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.939W.5/14">As the majority of fuel-poor households also have the lowest incomes, the Government has taken the approach that the most cost-effective, fair and efficient method of identifying vulnerable householders most likely to be at risk of fuel poverty is through the receipt of benefits (primarily means tested).</p>
	<p pid="d.939W.5/15">The Government recognise that not all cancer patients will necessarily be fuel poor or entitled to receive assistance aimed at those most vulnerable to fuel poverty. However, where those cancer patients are in receipt of benefits&mdash;whether income or pension related&mdash;with children under 16 or on disability living allowance, this will qualify them for additional heating and energy efficiency help under the Warm Front Scheme, for example.</p>
	<p pid="d.939W.5/16">Any household can qualify for subsidised energy saving measures from their energy supplier under the carbon emissions reduction target.</p>
	<p pid="d.939W.5/17">Older people are targeted as they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather during the winter months and of course the winter fuel payment helps older people with cancer to pay their fuel bills.

	<p pid="d.940W.2/1">The Department publishes data on fuel poverty annually. The data used to calculate fuel poverty estimates for England come from the English House Condition Survey (EHCS), compiled by the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG), and energy price information, published by DECC. The EHCS collects data on features of each dwelling, including fuel sources and efficiency measures, which enable energy required to achieve the adequate standard of warmth to be derived.</p>
	<p pid="d.940W.2/2">The EHCS also collects information on householders, such as their income. Combining required energy consumption with prices and incomes, each dwelling covered in the survey is classified as either fuel poor or not, and the results aggregated to produce data for the whole of England. The EHCS additionally contains a range of other data that allow DECC to split fuel poverty by various other measures, for example, age of householders, type of dwelling, etc.</p>

	<p pid="d.949W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated March 2009:</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.5/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking how many people registered as disabled have been unemployed in (a) Jarrow constituency, (b) South Tyneside, (c) the North East and (d) the UK in each year since 1997. (263812)</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.5/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles estimates of unemployment from sources in which limiting health problems are recorded, rather than whether or not people are registered as disabled. Table 1 shows the estimated number of people who had a limiting health problem lasting more than 12 months and who were unemployed. Estimates are available for the 12 month period ending February 2001 onwards. They are derived from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS), following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.5/6" class="indent">Sample sizes for Jarrow and South Tyneside are too small to calculate reliable estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.5/7" class="indent">Estimates for the United Kingdom as a whole are not available prior to the 12 month period ending February 2004. Estimates for Great Britain have therefore also been provided.</p>
	<p pid="d.949W.5/8" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population, and some are for small geographical areas, they are all based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. A guide to the quality of the estimates is given in Table 1.</p>

	<p pid="d.954W.3/1">The enforcing authorities in respect of the HIPS provisions are local weights and measures authorities, typically trading standards services. The OFT is not an enforcer and has no powers under the Act. The OFT cannot direct local authorities as to the priority they give or level of enforcement activity they take in relation to compliance with the HIP provisions. However, the Act requires that where a penalty charge notice (PCN) is issued the local authority informs the OFT. This is because the OFT has a duty, as the national regulator for estate agents, to consider the fitness of a person to be allowed to work as an estate agent and to take appropriate action, including warning or banning an agent, where their conduct falls short of legal requirements. The OFT would consider the receipt of a PCN as part of that process and a &quot;trigger&quot; to consider fitness under the Estate Agents Act 1979.</p>

	<p pid="d.960W.2/1">In the 2008 White Paper on Lords reform, the Government confirmed that in a wholly elected second chamber there would be no reserved seats for Church of England Bishops or for any other group. However, the position of the Church of England is that of the Church by law established, with the Sovereign as its Supreme Governor. The presence of Bishops in the House of Lords reflects the relationship between Crown, Parliament and the Church. The Government propose, therefore, that if there is to be an appointed element in a reformed second chamber, then there should be a number of seats reserved for Church of England Bishops.</p>
	<p pid="d.960W.2/2">The White Paper also proposed that the Appointments Commission should encourage applications from church and faith leaders as it likely that many would be strong candidates for appointment.

	<p pid="d.962W.5/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is committed to eradicating all forms of racism. The recently published 'Race Review 2008', which is available in the library of the House, sets out the current assessment of race equality in the Prison Service and recognises that there has been considerable success in moving towards the elimination of more blatant forms of racism.</p>
	<p pid="d.962W.5/2">Among the ways in which this has been achieved is by making racist incident report forms (RIRFs) more accessible, we have also introduced a level of confidentiality, and improved confidence through increased external scrutiny of the reporting process locally.</p>
	<p pid="d.962W.5/3">This has resulted in an increase in the number of reported incidents. While all reported incidents are taken seriously, few consist of serious allegations of misconduct by staff, and all such matters are subject to disciplinary investigation under the code of conduct and discipline.</p>
	<p pid="d.962W.5/4">The following table presents the number of incidents of alleged racism reported by prisoners from 2004-05 to the present&mdash;prior to this there was no central record. The table distinguishes between reports about the behaviour of other prisoners and those concerning service provision or the actions of members of staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.967W.2/1">The YRO will be introduced towards the end of 2009. It is designed to combine existing sentences into one generic sentence and will be the standard community sentence used for the majority of young offenders, replacing nine existing community sentences. It will offer practitioners and sentencers greater clarity and flexibility in the community sentencing framework and provide a more risk based approach to community sentencing for young offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.967W.2/2">The YRO will have attached to it a number of requirements and this will consist of a menu of interventions including programmes, reparation, treatment for drug misuse, supervision and curfew which the court can choose from to suit the individual offender taking into account the seriousness of the offence.</p>

Subject to parliamentary approval of the secondary legislation required to implement the YCC, we propose to begin pilots for 16 and 17-year-olds later in 2009. The process to identify pilot areas will begin shortly: publication of the draft code of practice gives potential pilot areas a clearer understanding of what piloting the YCC will involve. We will monitor the pilots closely to ensure that the YCC is used only in appropriate circumstances and that persistent offenders and those committing more serious crimes are dealt with by the courts.</p>

	<p pid="d.968W.0/1">In the Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008, we asked for views on how to increase the engagement of parents in the Youth Justice System, including whether measures of compulsion should be used. The Government response to this consultation is due for publication in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="d.968W.0/2">Many of the initiatives in the Youth Crime Action Plan ensure increased involvement of parents when young people are at risk of offending or have offended.</p>
	<p pid="d.968W.0/3">For example, we have committed to ensuring that families with children most likely to become prolific offenders benefit from better targeting of existing services, and to increase the reach of intensive family interventions.</p>
	<p pid="d.968W.0/4">We are also working to increase the take up of parenting support when a child is at risk of offending or has offended, by improving training provision for parenting workers, and reminding sentencers of the effectiveness of making parenting orders. We want all parents who would benefit from support to be offered it, and for those who need it but do not engage voluntarily the support should be non-negotiable.</p>
	<p pid="d.968W.0/5">In addition, under Operation Staysafe (due to take place in 69 areas in 2009-10), child protection legislation is used by police to remove young people on the streets at night who are at risk of offending or becoming a victim. Young people are not simply returned to their homes. Parents are required to collect them from a place of safety, to drive home the message that parents must be engaged in relation to their child's risk of offending behaviour.</p>
