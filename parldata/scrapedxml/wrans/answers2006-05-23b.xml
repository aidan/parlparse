<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-23b.69653.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-23b.1597W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" colnum="1597W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060523/text/60523w0001.htm#06052520005350">
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/1">In the last three years some 97,000 Work Orders were issued for Maintenance, Minor Works and Major Capital Refurbishment Projects at Government buildings, totalling approximately &pound;174 million in respect of estimated work value. Asbestos removal work would be an item on many of these orders. It is not possible to determine the full extent of any asbestos removals with any degree of accuracy without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/2">Asbestos was, in the past, routinely used in construction by the building industry and as such, many of the older properties in the Government Estate contain this material.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/3">In late 1987, a plan of action was instigated to prepare Asbestos Registers for many properties within the Government Estate. Asbestos Surveys commenced from 1988 onwards, involving over 1,000 properties, many of which are currently known to contain Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs). Each Asbestos Register records the precise location, use, type and condition of all ACMs known to be present.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/4">In the intervening years, these Asbestos Registers have been maintained through various programmes of inspections, including the introduction of effective management and control procedures. These actions have maintained Government properties in a safe and occupiable condition, ensuring that any recorded ACMs present at each location do not present any significant risk to the health and safety of staff employed there or the visiting public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/5">The Health and Safety Executive (NI) advises that asbestos is dangerous only if fibres are released into the atmosphere. There is no requirement to remove such ACMs if they are in good condition and unlikely to be disturbed. The HSE (NI) further advises that, where possible, ACMs should be left undisturbed, but that their presence should be effectively managed. Where ACMs are deemed in poor condition and require removal, such action is undertaken by specialist Asbestos Removal Contractors accredited by the HSE (NI), using a recognised and legislatively compliant safe system of work. Such work is also notifiable to the HSE (NI).</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/6">Government Departments do not, therefore, have a general plan to remove asbestos from their buildings, but will remove such materials where regular inspections dictate such a recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1597W.3/7">Asbestos removals, where not deemed necessary through regular inspections, i.e. as a result of planned disturbance, are normally carried out as an integral part of ongoing Maintenance, Minor Works or Major Capital Refurbishment Projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.1599W.2/1">The Cost of Doing Business Survey published by the Economic Research Institutefor Northern Ireland (ERINI) in December 2005 concluded that, on balance, business costs in Northern Ireland are relatively competitive when compared to GB and the Republic of Ireland. While some elements such as energy and insurance costs were found to be higher in Northern Ireland than in GB, these 'uncompetitive' costs together make up only a small proportion of business turnover.</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.2/2">Industrial de-rating should not add significantly to the cost burden of manufacturing. In 2004 turnover in manufacturing was around &pound;13.7 billion and even if rates liabilities had to be met in full (which is not due to happen until 2011) this would represent less than0.4 per cent. of this level of turnover. In addition, the revenues raised will enable significant investment in priority public services, which will benefit the economy. A policy review of industrial de-rating will take place in 2007 which will look at both its impact on manufacturers and also the implications for budgets and future levels of planned public expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1602W.0/1">Invest NI's role is to increase competitiveness in its client companies by helping them become more entrepreneurial, innovative and capable of operating in export markets. Investment in business competitiveness leads to greater wealth-creation and better employment opportunities for all. This was seen, for example, in last year's reinvestment by Seagate where Invest NI worked in partnership with the company to create 300 additional jobs in the area. The agency will continue to pursue all such opportunities within its client base.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.0/2">Since 2003 Invest NI has secured over &pound;240 million of investment into the North West promoting over 1,100 new jobs. During the last financial year the Agency secured agreements for three new Foreign Direct Investment projects to be based in the North West generating further investment of &pound;1.5 million in the region. These projects will promote 50 new jobs and contribute approximately &pound;700,000 to the local economy through annual salaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.0/3">Increasing the number of new business starts is another key source of job creation and, through partnerships with local stakeholders, Invest NI is also actively promoting enterprise and business start-ups in the area. Since the Agency was established in 2002, 574 new businesses have been assisted in the East Londonderry constituency. These new businesses are forecast to create over 700 additional jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.0/4">The first phase of the North West Action Plan has been successfully delivered. This has resulted in additional total investment in the area of over &pound;60 million. The second phase of the plan is currently being prepared and we will build on the success of phase 1, working with a wide range of interests, to further increase employment opportunities in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.0/5">The Department for Employment and Learning will support employers who are expanding their work force or creating new jobs by providing job brokering services and suitable training programmes where appropriate. The Department will also provide advice and support for all employees who lose their jobs as a result of redundancy. Staff from the local jobs and benefits office will provide advice on alternative job opportunities and access to training courses and will also ensure that those who have lost their jobs are able to access advice on a range of other issues such as benefits and taxation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1603W.8/1">In 1998 when the Patten Commission was conducting its investigation, only 8.3 per cent. of regular officers were from the Roman Catholic community. In less than five years, under the temporary 50:50 provisions Catholic composition among regular officers has risen to 19.68 per cent. with a total of 2,219 recruits having been selected for appointment on a 50:50 basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.8/2">Our goal is to increase Catholic representation to30 per cent. by 2010-11; the date envisaged by Patten to achieve this aim. The Government recognise that 50:50 recruitment is an exceptional means to addressing an exceptional problem and we firmly believe that these temporary provisions are justified to rectify an acute historical imbalance in the composition of the Police Service in Northern Ireland. These exceptional measures are reviewed every three years, with the next, and hopefully final, such review due later this year. While we envisage that the provisions will be renewed in March 2007, this will be subject to detailed review of the policy, extensive consultation, and debate in both houses. If the 50:50 provisions were not in place then it would not be possible to achieve our 30 per cent. target by 2010-11. I am pleased to say that we are very much on target to reach this goal with a further interim target of 23.5 per cent. set for March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.8/3">In the first eight competitions there were over 28,000 applications from non-Catholics, of which 541 will have been rejected directly as a result of these temporary provisions. In other words less than 2 per cent. of all non-Catholic applicants will have been rejected as a direct result of the 50:50 provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.8/4">Although the Patten Report focused on the imbalance between the number of Catholics and Protestants in the composition of the Police Service, it rightly recognised the importance of gender and ethnic minority representation. It is notable that female composition has risen from 13 per cent. to 20.42 per cent. and the ethnic minority background composition compares favourably with the overall level of the working age ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland and continues to rise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.8/5">In terms of the steps taken to recruit police officers, the oversight commissioner has commented that the advertising programme has been both imaginative and assiduous. It has varied between competitions, but has included press, television, billboard, cinema and online advertising, all designed to reach groups currently under-represented in the Police Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.8/6">The responses from all communities have been extremely positive and the results have exceeded expectations. The latest campaign (10) saw the highest number of applications yet, with 7,691 applications competing for 220 places. 37 per cent. of these applications were from the Catholic community which is the highest rate to date and the number of ethnic minority applications doubled.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.8/7">In addition to a large number of Northern Ireland applicants, applications have been received from Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, as well as from a number of other countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1608W.6/1">The December 2005 defence industrial strategy (DIS) white paper recognised the need to address shortages of project, programme management and acquisition leadership skills. Seven specific skills areas within the acquisition organisations have been identified for attention; leadership, programme management, project management, commercial management, procurement, logistics, science and technology management and resource management. senior professionals have been appointed as 'skills champions' for each of these areas and will undertake an assessment of the levels of skills currently available in these areas. Their work will include an assessment of skills shortfalls linked directly to MOD's business needs, and of the likely causes of shortfalls, including problems relating to recruitment, retention and development. This work will be completed by the end of May 2006 and will form the basis of urgent action to train and develop our workforce.</p>

	<p pid="b.1613W.4/1">Arsenic contamination in Bangladesh's water supply is naturally occurring, and mainly affects shallow tube wells. DFID is currently providing &pound;1 million to the Government of Bangladesh's (GoB) Arsenic Policy Support Unit to ensure that arsenic contamination is addressed as part of the GoB's safe drinking water policy. A new programme is being developed in conjunction with the GoB and the World Bank to prepare a groundwater management strategy, which will promote and enable greater use of deep tube wells which are uncontaminated by arsenic.</p>
	<p pid="b.1613W.4/2">In addition, DFID is providing &pound;15 million to the Advancing Sustainable Environmental Health (ASEH) programme in Bangladesh, implemented by WaterAid. ASEH has provided a rigorous and effective system for testing and monitoring arsenic in all new groundwater supplies provided since 2002. ASEH also provides information and support to enable communities to access arsenic free water supplies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1613W.4/3">DFID is also planning to contribute up to &pound;40 million to the GoB/UNICEF Sanitation, Hygiene, Education and Water Supply&mdash;Bangladesh (SHEWA-B) programme. SHEWA-B includes a significant arsenic mitigation component, and will target almost 4,000 villages (6,400,000 people) where over 80 per cent. of tube wells are affected.</p>

	<p pid="b.1617W.5/1">In recent years there has been a good deal of progress in reducing protectionist trade policies which impact on poor countries. Within the EU for example, agricultural import tariffs declined by an average of 36 per cent. between 1995 and 2000. Our current projections are that once the reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy agreed in 2003 have worked through, EU reliance on export subsidies will have reduced by approximately 65 per cent. compared with 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1617W.5/2">But there is still much to be done outside the EU as well as within, which is why the UK supports an ambitious outcome to the current round of World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations in areas such as agriculture, industrial products and services, with meaningful special and differential treatment for developing countries built in. It also includes the elimination of export subsidies and other equivalent measures by 2013, which was agreed at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December. Time is running out for such an ambitious outcome to the current WTO negotiations, and discussions between the key players have intensified since the Hong Kong meeting to try to narrow the gaps that still remain, and reach a consensus on a balanced package of agreements across the main negotiating areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1631W.3/1">DTI currently has no plans to develop or introduce a consumer advice handbook. However the introduction of Consumer Direct, a national telephone and online consumer advice service, has considerably raised the profile of consumer advice. By the end of June 2006, with the launch of the last three contact centres, Consumer Direct will be a fully national service providing a single national phone number that makes it easier than ever for consumers to get the advice and information they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.3/2">The service is very popular and currently receives around 25,000 calls per week across England, Scotland and Wales. A recent customer satisfaction survey reported that 87 per cent. of callers were satisfied and eight out of 10 callers feel that they now have the confidence to deal with similar problems should they occur in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.3/3">We are also funding a &pound;45 million, two-year programme to provide face-to-face debut advice. About &pound;16 million will go to citizens advice projects,&pound;7 million to other voluntary sector advice agencies and the remaining &pound;22 million to partnership projects involving both Citizens Advice and other advice agencies. The funds will pay for 500 new advisers who will help tens of thousands of families to tackle debt.</p>

	<p pid="b.1632W.0/1">Although the IT and telecommunications sectors are not specifically being targeted, the Patent Office, as the DTI agency responsible for IP, is continuing to work with a range of partners to deliver a programme of IP awareness raising among all sectors of business. This builds on the success last year of the 'What is the key?' initiative, and includes responsible use of other people's intellectual property, as embodied by the CREATE principles. These principles were developed and endorsed by the Creative Industries IP Forum, which was chaired by Lord Sainsbury and the then Minister for Creative Industries and Tourism.</p>

	<p pid="b.1632W.3/1">East Midlands Development Agency ('emda') does not organise specific cross-council meetings, but does work closely with a wide range of local authorities (counties, unitaries and districts) within the region on specific issues. Meetings are set up as and when they are needed and many involve wider partnerships, often including more than one local authority, 'emda' also works through existing groupings such as local government association where appropriate. During 2005 these meetings covered all aspects of the agency's agenda, including formal groups to consider issues such as Urban Policy and Rural Action Zones and ad-hoc meetings to cover specific issues (for example planning issues associated with major projects), 'emda' also consulted all local authorities on their strategy development, in particular related to the current revision of the Regional Economic Strategy, and invited councils to events such as their annual public meeting. Bassetlaw district council has attended two such events and Mansfield district council four events.</p>

	<p pid="b.1633W.3/1">In 2004 the DTI commissioned MORI to complete a survey on over-indebtedness and its link to income levels, unemployment and social group (&quot;Over-indebtedness in Britain: a DTI report on the MORI Financial Services survey 2004&quot; <a href="http://www.cst.gov.uk/ccp/topics1/pdfl/debtdtionmori.pdf">http://www.cst.gov.uk/ccp/topics1/pdfl/debtdtionmori.pdf</a>).</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.3/2">This followed a similar piece of work commissioned by the DTI in 2002 when Elaine Kempson of Bristol university carried out research into the links between over-indebtedness and income and unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.3/3">In terms of a link between income and the likelihood of over-indebtedness, the survey concluded that those earning less than &pound;9,500 a year were more likely to be over-indebted. On the issue of a link between unemployment and over-indebtedness the results were less clear, although it was noted that unemployed individuals are more likely to find keeping up with bills and credit commitments a 'heavy burden', as well as being more likely to have been in arrears on credit commitments for more than three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.3/4">The Wealth and Assets Survey that is due to enter the field in summer 2006 will provide a much more detailed assessment of over-indebtedness and its links to income, assets such as houses and savings, employment and the educational background of survey participants. The survey is to be carried out over a substantial time period, taking multiple assessments of the participants over the period in order to map changes between areas such as employment, income and assets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1652W.8/3">Arrangements for European grants and grants to local authorities are similar, except that for local authorities, instead of a reporting accountant, the Audit Commission appoints an external auditor to carry out the work. Some grants provided to local authorities from Government Departments are on a non ring-fenced basis, that is with no conditions attached. However, local authorities are subject to a comprehensive statutory framework which governs the uses to which their income can be put, and the control and accountability of their financial transactions. Since 2002 local authorities have also been subject to a comprehensive performance framework which provides a rounded picture of local councils' performance. The framework provides the basis for establishing a more effective and efficient relationship between central and local government, based on performance and on risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.1654W.2/2">The partial Regulatory Impact Assessment for Home Information Packs published in March 2003 (a copy of which is deposited in the House Library) covers the anticipated effect of the Home Information Pack on the estate agency sector. The Department also commissioned research &quot;Litmus Test of Impact of Regulations on Small Businesses&quot;, DETR 2000, that examined the impact of the proposals on a range of small businesses, including estate agents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1654W.2/3">Currently costs in the estate agent sector are not fully transparent. Over the last 10 years property prices have doubled allowing estate agents who keep their percentage fee broadly constant to significantly increase their income per transaction. The introduction of Home Information Packs will increase transparency over information and services provided to both sellers and buyers. This has the potential to increase competition and demand for transparency across the estate agency sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1655W.8/2">There has been no such guidance. The Home Information Pack will include standard local searches derived from local authority records. The Government are considering how to implement the recommendations of the Office of Fair Trading market study into property searches, including the provision of clear guidance for local authorities on how they should recover the costs of providing property information in compiled and unrefined forms. Under the current rules, the Lord Chancellor sets the charge for an &quot;official&quot; search of the local land charge register and local authorities may set their own charge for supplementary inquiries that covers the cost of providing information. We intend to apply this principle to any new charging arrangements for dealing with the provision of search information and will provide the appropriate guidance to cover them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1656W.5/2">Neither the Housing Act 2004 nor the regulations made under the Act will prescribe a validity period for Home Information Packs. However, we do not expect many properties to remain on the market for more than six months. The regulations to be made in June will provide that certain time-sensitive items in the pack (e.g. local searches and the Home Condition Report) are no more than three months old when marketing begins, but they will not require sellers to renew these documents thereafter. In practice, local authority searches are normally considered acceptable for six months as will Home Condition Reports. Where sellers choose to update time-sensitive documents in the pack, we expect the market to provide a means for them do so at a relatively small cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1661W.5/1">The Government have not specifically commissioned projects to improve relations between black and Asian communities; however it has supported a range of initiatives which will improve community relations in general. For example, &pound;18 million will be provided over three years by the 'Connecting Communities Plus' grant programme, and &pound;.5 million was provided in 2005-06 by the 'Faith Communities Capacity Building Fund', in support of the Government's race equality and community cohesion strategy 'Improving Opportunity Strengthening Society'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1661W.5/2">In addition public authorities have a statutory duty to promote good relations between persons of different racial groups. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) oversees this duty and published 'Promoting good Race Relations: A Guide for Public Authorities' in July 2005. The Equality Act 2006 prepares the ground for a new Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) which will absorb the activities of the CRE in 2009, and transfers this good relations duty onto the new body. To carry this out the CEHR will have new powers to monitor, as well as to make, co-operate with or assist in any arrangement s designed to reduce hate crimes. The CEHR will have particular regard to the importance of its work with different groups reflecting the historical origin of the duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1661W.5/3">The CRE also gives grants to organisations concerned with the promotion of race equality and good race relations through the 'Getting Results' programme. The programme will distribute c&pound;4.2 million in the current financial year. In particular, Race Equality Councils (RECs) aim to improve relations between all communities, and over &pound;2.5 million of the CRE's funding this year will go to RECs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1666W.4/1">Jobcentre plus is responsible for the management of the adviser discretion fund (ADF) which enables the purchase of virtually anything that will help people obtain a job, or, if already offered a job, to enable them to accept that offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1666W.4/2">To maintain effective controls on expenditure, the level at which an adviser can authorise payment from the fund, without requiring a supporting business case, was reduced in May 2005 to &pound;100 per customer within any 12 month period. Awards above that level are authorised at a higher management level to ensure efficient and effective use of public funds. There is no limit on the individual amounts that can be awarded as long as they are supported by a business case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1666W.4/3">Improved financial control has been achieved by delegating budgetary accountability to local managers and further value for money has been achieved by the implementation of the retail trade framework (RTF). Advisers can refer recipients of the ADF to suppliers who are part of the RTF and this has enabled jobcentre plus to achieve savings of up to 40 per cent. on high street prices and obtain more for less.</p>

	<p pid="b.1666W.7/1">The Department's 'Be Ready' National Guidance campaign, developed in conjunction with leading business organisations, was launched in May 2005. Approximately 1.4 million employers were mailed information designed to raise awareness of age discrimination legislation, due to come into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>, and to provide practical guidance to help employers become more age diverse in their employment practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1666W.7/2">The next stage of the campaign will be launched in June with fully updated materials mailed to over 1.4 million employers. Materials will also be freely available from the website, <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk/agepartnershipgroup">www.agepositive.gov.uk/agepartnershipgroup</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1666W.7/3">An evaluation of 1,650 employers, who had ordered the products, has been carried out and the results are due to be published shortly. Preliminary results show that respondents overall were very happy with the materials they received and found the products clear, easy to use, well designed, helpful and useful. A further evaluation of the second phase of the campaign is planned for later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1668W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what recent estimate he has made of the number of claimants who decline to identify the father of their child for Child Support Agency purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/5" class="indent">Any application made by a parent with care for Income Support or Income- Based Jobseekers Allowance should be accompanied by an application for Child Support maintenance, which requires the identification of the relevant non-resident parent. A parent with care can refuse to provide this identification, in which case one of two outcomes can result:</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/6" class="indent">1. If there are reasonable grounds for believing that a risk to the parent with care or to any of their children living with them exists, and that harm or undue distress could result from identifying the non-resident parent, then 'Good Cause' will be granted and no further action will be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/7" class="indent">2. If it is determined that no such reasonable grounds exist, then a continued withholding of this information can lead to a loss of benefit under a Reduced Benefit Direction (for old scheme cases) or a Reduced Benefit Decision (for new scheme cases).</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/8" class="indent">In the financial year 2005/06, a claim for Good Cause was approved in 14,800 cases, and a Reduced Benefit Decision/Direction imposed in 14,400 cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/9" class="indent">It should be noted that these figures are derived from management information held by Jobcentre Plus, and thus differ from the information provided by the Agency in Table 2.2 of the Agency's latest Quarterly Summary Statistics (QSS). There are three main reasons for this:</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/10" class="indent">The data in Table 2.2 of the Quarterly Summary Statistics only shows the initial clearance type for those cases that have been cleared, and thus will not show those cases where a claim for Good Cause or the imposition of a Reduced Benefit Decision has been approved, but the case itself has yet to be cleared.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/11" class="indent">Table 2.2 only shows new scheme cases, whereas the cases above include old scheme and new scheme cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/12" class="indent">Table 2.2 only shows the method by which a case was initially cleared, whereas the numbers given above are for the total number of Good Cause and Reduced Benefit Decisions/Directions approved or imposed in the financial year 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.5/13" class="indent">Note that the information given is recorded on the basis of cases, rather than claimants. The data therefore reflects this, and volumes are rounded to the nearest hundred.</p>

	<p pid="b.1675W.5/1">The Government have given a commitment that, by 2025, disabled people in Britain should have full opportunities and choices to improve their quality of life, and will be respected and included as equal members of society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675W.5/2">Following a recommendation in the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report, &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot;, we have set up an Office for Disability Issues (ODI) to drive forward our strategy to meet this challenge. The work of the ODI is overseen by a ministerial group, involving Ministers from several key Departments (Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills, Department of Trade and Industry, Department for Transport, Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Communities and Local Government).</p>
	<p pid="b.1675W.5/3">The Government have also put in place a comprehensive and enforceable set of civil rights for disabled people. For example, provisions introduced in October 2004 substantially improved rights in employment and required service providers to make reasonable adjustments to tackle physical barriers to disabled people accessing their services. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 amended the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) to provide rights for disabled pupils and students in education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675W.5/4">Most recently, the DDA 2005 extended rights for disabled people in a number of areas including transport, functions of public bodies, private clubs and the renting of premises. It also extended protection to around 250,000 people, effectively from the point they are diagnosed with cancer, multiple sclerosis or HIV, freeing them from pre-symptomatic discrimination. In addition, people with mental illness will avoid the unnecessary burden of being required to prove their condition is clinically well-recognised to get redress against discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675W.5/5">Importantly, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>, the DDA 2005 places a new duty on public authorities to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. This will mean that public bodies must take account of the needs of disabled people as an integral part of their policies, practices and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675W.5/6">The ODI is responsible for raising awareness of the Disability Discrimination Act and improving attitudes to disabled people. A campaign aimed at small and medium-sized businesses was launched on in December 2005 and will initially run until the end of May 2006. The ODI also sponsors the Images of Disability initiative to promote representation of disabled people in Government advertising and publicity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1678W.2/4" class="indent">A series of actions has been put in place to address the recent increase in the average actual clearance times for income support assessments to 12.2 days.

	<p pid="b.1679W.2/2">The funding for welfare reform has been drawn from the budgets provided to the Department through the 2004 Spending Review settlement which covered the financial years 2005-06 to 2007-08. Details are available in The Departmental Report 2005 (Cm 6539) published in June 2005. The &pound;360 million funding is largely to be spent extending the Pathways to Work programme beyond the pilot areas and covers 2006-07 and 2007-08, but may also be used to fund other measures dependent on responses to the Welfare Reform consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1679W.2/3">A detailed costing of the various parts of our proposals is not possible at this time.

	<p pid="b.1683W.11/2">Seasonal unemployment fluctuations are however more marked in seaside towns than elsewhere. Such local economies rely on tourism to provide employment opportunities and investment in the area. This may lead to higher unemployment out of season.

We have achieved more than 21,000 Pathways to Work job entries, and the number of recorded job entries for people with a health condition or disability has almost doubled in Pathways areas.

	<p pid="b.1686W.2/2">The most reliable and comparable data on days lost due to stress in the workplace in Britain are provided by the surveys of self-reported work-related illness (SWI) in 2001-02, 2003-04 and 2004-05. They relate to sickness absences taken by people who believed that they were suffering from work-related stress, depression or anxiety and are given in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1686W.2/5"> <td></td> <td><i> Estimated full day equivalent working days lost (in millions) due to work-related stress, depression or anxiety</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1686W.2/6"> <td>2001-02</td> <td>12.9</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="b.1686W.2/8"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>12.8</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.1686W.2/11">Data from an earlier SWI survey in 1995 provides an estimate of 4.6 million days lost due to work-related stress, depression or anxiety in Britain. This is not comparable with later SWI survey estimates because of differences in design, coverage and the level of information collected. Indications suggest that if it was possible to put this estimate on the same basis as later SWI data it could be up to 3 to 4 million lost working days lost different. Despite this uncertainty it is clear that days lost to work-related stress, depression or anxiety were lower in 1995 than 2001-02 and subsequent years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1686W.5/1">Carer's allowance is available to young carers aged 16 or over who undertake training or part-time education, but it is not available to those in full-time education involving 21 hours or more of supervised study a week. This is because young people aged 16 or over who remain in full-time non-advanced education are regarded as financially dependent on their parents, who can receive child benefit and child tax credits on their behalf. Support for those who choose to undertake full-time advanced education is provided by the student support system rather than by social security benefits. We keep social security rules under constant review, but we have no current plans to change the full-time education rule in carer's allowance.</p>

The first column of numbers gives percentage contributions with emissions from power generation shown separately. The second column of numbers shows percentage contributions with emission from power generation reallocated to the sectors which use the power generated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1695W.3/2">The data are consistent with the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory published in 2006, which contains data to 2004, the most recent year for which data are available for all gases by sector. The aviation estimate covers domestic flights only because international aviation is not included in the UK emissions total, in accordance with international guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1695W.3/3">The estimates include emissions from carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the hydrofluorocarbons, the perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. Radiative forcing is accounted for by using Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as weighting factors in adding together emissions estimates of the different gases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1695W.3/4">The GWPs are listed in table 2 and apply by gas and not by sector. The effect of emissions from aviation at altitude may be significantly greater than at ground level. This would increase the radiative forcing effect from aviation but there is no agreed value to account for this and it remains a matter of scientific investigation. The IPCC Third Assessment Report estimates uncertainty in the GWPs relative to carbon dioxide as +/-35 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1696W.2/1">My Department has not banned the use of tallow as fuel, so no assessments of this kind have been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696W.2/2">The effect of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) is to require a range of animal by-products, and substances derived from them (e.g. tallow), to be disposed of as waste. Where the method of disposal is incineration or co-incineration (i.e. use as a fuel), the ABPR requires it to be carried out in compliance with the Waste Incineration. Directive (WID). Installations may burn tallow provided they comply with these requirements. The ABPR is directly applicable in all EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696W.2/3">In response to representations by the UK Government, the European Commission has set up a study to help establish whether such controls are proportionate and necessary to the protection of the environment. The study is expected to report by the autumn, and the Government are pressing the Commission for the study to be completed as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1697W.12/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) routinely provides information on the number of incidents of domestic violence against men and women (but not on the actual number of victims), but this is not broken down by whether the perpetrator is a current or former partner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.12/2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) also collects information on whether victims report crimes to the police, but this is not broken down by victim's sex or by whether it was a domestic violence incident or not. Reporting rates for 2004-05 are available from the latest annual crime statistics publication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.12/3">The 2004-05 British Crime Survey estimated that there were, in total 308,000 incidents of domestic violence against women in England and Wales, and 92,000 against men. The number of incidents of domestic violence as measured by the BCS has decreased by 48 per cent. from 1999 to 2004-05 BCS interviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.12/4">The BCS figures are estimates only. As they are derived from a sample they are subject to sampling error, also the context of the face-to-face BCS interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the true extent due to the fact that some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. To address this, self-completion components for those aged 16-59 on domestic violence have been included in the 1996, 2001, 2004-05, and 2005-06 BCS. Results from the 2001 BCS self-completion module on domestic violence were published in Home Office Research Study No. 276. According to this more confidential approach to measurement prevalence (per cent. of population victim at least once) rates for last year domestic assault were approximately five times higher than in the main face-to-face BCS. Also according to this report, 80 per cent. of the domestic violence incidents suffered by women in the 12 months prior to interview were from current spouses or partners, and 20 per cent. from ex-spouses/partners. The respective figures for men were 86 and 14 per cent. It also showed that the police came to know about the (worst) incident of domestic violence suffered in the 12 months prior to interview in 23 per cent. of cases suffered by women, and 8 per cent. of cases suffered by men. Overall, in 72 per cent. of the cases that the police came to know about, the victim reported it (rather than someone else such as family member or friend, or police came to know about in another way).</p>

	<p pid="b.1703W.2/2">Section 9 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 does permit the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) to verify identity information provided by applicants against data held by other organisations as part of the enrolment process, subject to secondary legislation.

However, as stated, such checks cannot occur unless they have received the prior approval of Parliament in secondary legislation under the affirmative resolution procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1703W.2/3">IPS is currently working with other Government Departments, including Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to identify which government data sources would provide the most accurate verification of identity information provided by applicants.

	<p pid="b.1703W.2/4">It is also possible that data sources used as part of this check may in turn have verified their data through conducting a check against electoral roll registers.

Police are partners in multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), which are statutory arrangements operated by criminal justice and social care agencies to manage serious sexual and violent offenders and protect the public. The police are therefore involved in the management of potentially dangerous offenders, generally those sentenced to 12 months or more for a sexual or violent offence. All fixed-term prisoners serving 12 months or more, or aged less than 22 years at the point of release, and all prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence are subject to statutory supervision upon release. The only exception is the small number of prisoners released at the end of their custodial term under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967.</p>

	<p pid="b.1706W.0/1">The documentation required from passport applicants is that which establishes the person's claim to British nationality. For persons born in the UK since the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1983-01-01">1 January 1983</phrase>, this depends on a parent having been a British citizen or settled in the UK at the time of the birth. The Act provides that for the purposes of determining British nationality, the relationship of father and child shall be taken to exist only between a man and any legitimate child born to him. Therefore a passport applicant who wishes to establish that he is a British citizen because his or her father was a British citizen when the applicant was born needs to provide his or her father's marriage certificate. To establish the number of applications which were unsuccessful because this certificate could not be provided would require a search of individual case records and could not be done without disproportionate expense.</p>
	<p pid="b.1706W.0/2">This provision of the 1981 Act is to be amended by Section nine of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 when that provision is brought into force but it will not apply retrospectively. This will extend the definition of father for the purposes of the 1981 Act to include any person who satisfies prescribed requirements as to proof of paternity. The requirements for passport applications will be reviewed when this change in the law on nationality comes into effect.</p>

	<p pid="b.1709W.0/2">The Green Paper makes clear that delivery of learning and skills for all offenders is changing, with the Learning and Skills Council taking responsibility for its planning and funding. This new role introduces a number of substantial changes, including an early, significant focus on assessing the offender learner's needs, and recording them on an Individual Learning Plan that will follow the offender as they progress through the criminal justice system. The Individual Learning Plan will encourage, support and record progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1709W.0/3">A new, broader curriculum for offender learners supports the new delivery arrangements, setting out clear quality requirements and a strong focus on learning needs that will help more offenders into suitable and sustained jobs by meeting the needs of employers. A juvenile version of the curriculum acknowledges the specific needs of younger learners.</p>

The number of vulnerable prisoners held at Lewes will be substantially reduced to around 40 and none will be eligible for the Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (SOTP). Since December 2002 this treatment has been provided at Maidstone and Elmley with Lewes as the feeder establishment working together to assess and prepare sex offenders to undertake treatment. Following refurbishment in 2008 it is expected that Lewes will no longer house a vulnerable prisoner population.</p>

Prisoners are assessed and, if ready and suitable, are transferred to Elmley or Maidstone where specialist cognitive behavioural courses are available. Since 2004 the prisoners addressing substance related offending (PASRO) course has been available at Lewes and will continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1713W.0/1">Outside London, the police are at present solely responsible for the enforcement of bus lane infringements in England and Wales. Civil enforcement is expected to begin in some areas in the autumn. Suspected offenders will be told that a vehicle of which they are the registered keeper has been detected committing a bus lane offence. The provision of further information is a matter for individual chief officers of police. Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers is that the registered keeper or person named by the keeper as driver at the time of the alleged offence should be allowed to view photographic evidence on request. Any person who receives a fixed penalty notice for a bus lane offence and wishes to dispute the alleged offence is required to request a court hearing, the procedure for which is explained on the notice. If a case went to court, the prosecution would have to furnish the evidence to support the proceedings and relevant material would be disclosed under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1713W.0/2">In London, the police can still enforce bus lane infringements if they consider it appropriate. Most enforcement is however undertaken by Transport for London and the London boroughs under the overall co-ordination of the Association of London Government's Transport and Environmental Committee (ALGTEC). Recipients of penalty charge notices issued for bus lane offences are entitled to view the record of the contravention free of charge at the offices of the issuing authority. Alternatively a copy of the recording can be provided at a small cost. Penalty charge notices describe the procedure for making representations against a notice to the enforcing authority and for appealing to adjudicators.</p>
	<p pid="b.1713W.0/3">Information is not held centrally on the number of occasions when a penalty charge notice or a fixed penalty notice has been issued in error.</p>

Activities to tackle alcohol-related disorder have included intervening early in the evening with a view to preventing the escalation of violence, and conducting multi-agency visits to problem licensed premises.

	<p pid="b.1720W.2/1">To be awarded qualified teacher status (QTS), all trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory SEN code of practice, know how to seek advice from specialists where necessary, and can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/2">The National Standards for qualified teachers status and the Induction Programme for Newly Qualified Teachers (NQT) both cover SEN, including specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. NQTs are required to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their class with SEN, with or without a statement, and in consultation with the school's SEN Co-ordinator, contribute to the preparation and implementation of individual pupils' education plans or the equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/3">The Department is working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to take forward a range of specific initiatives designed to improve the skills and confidence of trainee, newly qualified, and established teachers in supporting pupils with SEN and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/4">All schools have a school development grant that they can use, amongst other things, for the purposes of supporting the continuing professional development of teachers in relation to their understanding and knowledge of SEN and disability issues. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN, including dyslexia, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/5">No information is collected centrally which would enable the Government to make an estimate of the number of children and adults with dyslexia. However, since 2004, the Department for Education and Skills have collected data on pupils by type of SEN as part of the annual school census. Dyslexia is included within specific learning difficulties (SpLD)&mdash;which also covers dyscalculia and dyspraxia. We have data on pupils with SEN at 'School Action Plus' and with a statement of SEN where SpLD is recorded as their primary need. The number of pupils aged under 16 with SpLD in maintained schools in 2006 was just under 77,000. We do not have data on pupils whose needs are met at 'School Action' or where SpLD is a secondary or other need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.2/6">The Department has not commissioned any recent research on dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid="b.1723W.5/10">To respond to the second part of your question, I need to clarify that the Entry to Employment scheme is still being operated and will not be replaced by EMA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1723W.5/11">From April 2006, the package of financial support provided to 16 to 19-year-old learners in school sixth forms/further education colleges, has been extended to young people participating in unwaged training programmes (Entry to Employment and Programme led Pathways) funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The extension of EMA to unwaged trainees should not be regarded as simply the replacement of the training allowance by EMA. It is a full package of financial support which will extend EMA to unwaged trainees and extend child benefit and child tax credit to their parents/carers. This will mean more money for the majority of unwaged trainees and their families, who are typically low to middle income households. Those young people who are estranged from their parents/carers, and entitled to claim benefits in their own right, will also be much better off as they will be able to claim income support in addition to their EMA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1723W.5/12">The LSC will monitor and evaluate the impact of these reforms and will report progress on implementing them to my officials at the Department for Education and Skills.</p>

	<p pid="b.1730W.9/1">The information is as follows: <i> (a)</i> Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs) enable solicitors to undertake cases on the basis that they will only charge their fee in the event of success and nothing in the event of failure. The Government have extended the use of CFAs so that they are now available for all civil proceedings, except family proceedings. We recently completed a major simplification of the regulation of CFAs to make the process easier for consumers to understand. In January this year the Government launched a straightforward guide for consumers to help them to get the information they need to make an informed choice about the most appropriate legal adviser for them. My Department is working closely with Community Legal Service Direct to develop this guidance further to ensure that those consumers that are not eligible for legal aid have the confidence to shop effectively for their legal services. The Government's proposals for legal service reform will also improve access to justice by promoting competition within the legal profession and building consumer confidence in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1730W.9/2"><i> (b)</i> The Legal Services Commission (LSC) continues to work with suppliers to fill potential gaps where possible through outreach services and telephone advice. The LSC consulted last year on its strategy for the Community Legal Service (CLS), Making Legal Rights a Reality. The Commission's final strategy for the CLS was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March 2006</phrase>. One of the proposals is the development of Community Legal Advice Networks which will be particularly beneficial in less densely populated and larger geographical areas, as they will operate to ensure that services are joined up so as to provide a wider range of services to the client than previously available. Clients can find a local legal adviser through the Community Legal Service (CLS) Direct telephone helpline. Their telephone number is: 0845 345 4345 or alternatively their website is <a href="http://www.clsdirect.org.uk">www.clsdirect.org.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="b.1738W.2/1">The Department has not undertaken research on the following issues. However:</p>
	<p pid="b.1738W.2/2">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist's (RCOG) report 'Fetal Awareness, Report of a Working Party (1997)' concluded that before 26 weeks gestation the nervous system has not developed sufficiently to allow the fetus to experience pain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738W.2/3">Guidance from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine introduces the concept of a threshold of viability as being from 22 to 26 weeks gestation. At low gestation age, even if the fetus is born alive, there are high risks of death due to immaturity. Indeed, while the possibility of survival of extremely pre-term babies has improved, data suggest that, even with modern intensive care, chances of survival at 22 weeks gestation are only approximately 1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738W.2/4">There are currently variations in antenatal screening practice across England. The Government's aim is to move towards a more integrated policy to give women more informed choice in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738W.2/5">Research shows that newer tests will lead to more accurate screening results. The aim of the research has been to identify the most effective and safe method of antenatal screening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738W.2/6">In the confidential inquiry into maternal and child health's 2004 triennial report 'Why Mother's Die 2000-2002', none of the maternal suicides are attributed to abortion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738W.2/7">The RCOG's evidence-based guideline 'The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2004)' recommends that referral for further counselling should be available for the small minority of women who experience long-term post-abortion distress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1743W.5/1">The Department supports two broad programmes of research into the potential effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and health: one on radiofrequency fields (as emitted by mobile phones) and the other largely on extremely low frequency (ELF) fields (such as associated with power lines and domestic electrical supply).</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.5/2">The mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme has been running since 2001. It is funded jointly by Government and industry and is managed by an independent scientific committee. A description of the programme and a list of ongoing and completed studies are available on the MTHR's website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.5/3">The Department's radiation protection research programme supports a number of studies investigating the possible health effects of other electromagnetic fields (largely ELF-EMF). These range from laboratory work investigating possible cellular effects to large population studies. Descriptions of these studies are available on the World Health Organisation (WHO) EMF research database at <a href="http://www.who.int/peh-emf/research/database/en/">www.who.int/peh-emf/research/database/en/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.5/4">In addition, the Department, along with the Health and Safety Executive, has supported the WHO's international EMF project since it started in 1997. Information about the EMF project is available on its web site at <a href="http://www.who.int/peh-mf/project/en/">www.who.int/peh-mf/project/en/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.5/5">In the United Kingdom, the Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) keeps the world-wide research findings on EMF and health continually under review. In 2004, the HPA-RPD, previously the National Radiological Protection Board, published a comprehensive review of scientific evidence in support of its current advice on limiting EMF exposure which is available on HPA's website at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents_of_nrpb/abstracts/absd15-3.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents_of_nrpb/abstracts/absd15-3.htm</a>.</p>

For example, you are to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels your operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.<br/> An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The quarterly monitoring of cancelled operations collection does not record the number of postponements.<br/> Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1765W.5/14">The Department is working with key partners and stakeholders to deliver the objectives of the chief medical officer's action plan for stopping tuberculosis in England (October 2004).</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.5/15">The plan includes a commitment to have a high quality surveillance system which aims to provide the information required at local, national and international levels to prevent and control TB. Following consultation with various stakeholders, the HPA intends to create a new web-based system for TB surveillance within the next financial year. The new surveillance system will enable the provision of information on TB cases at local, regional and national level that is timely, relevant, complete and accurate. It will facilitate monitoring of disease trends and treatment outcomes and will help with commissioning services for TB.</p>
