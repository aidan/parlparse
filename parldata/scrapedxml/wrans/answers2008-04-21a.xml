	<p pid="a.1349W.2/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, hon. Members have been entitled to claim mileage allowances in line with Inland Revenue rates (now HM Revenue and Customs rates), which are 40p per mile for the first 10,000 business miles travelled in a year and 25p per mile thereafter. This was decided by Resolution of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-03">3 November 2004</phrase>. The Resolution was in line with a recommendation by the Senior Salaries Review Body of October 2004, Cm 6354-1, paragraphs 4.50-52, which gave the following rationale:</p>
	<p pid="a.1349W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The approved IR rate is calculated to represent the actual cost of motoring, including fuel costs, wear and tear (including servicing and depreciation), road fund licence, and insurance.

	<p pid="a.1354W.3/1">Local authorities are required to work towards meeting the air quality objectives in the Air Quality Regulations 2000 by designating air quality management areas where concentrations of any of the seven pollutants in the regulations exceed, or are likely to exceed, the stated objectives. To help local authorities do this, DEFRA operates an air quality grant scheme, a capital grant for which local authorities bid. The total amount of this grant, which is divided between successful authorities, is approximately &pound;2.3 million per year.

	<p pid="a.1357W.2/1">The England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative has been in place since April 2006 and is being delivered jointly by Natural England and the Environment Agency on behalf of DEFRA. It is currently based in priority catchments covering a little over a third of the agricultural area of England and its purpose is to encourage farmers to take voluntary action to tackle diffuse water pollution, mainly from nitrates, phosphorus, sediment, pesticides and livestock faeces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/2">The main elements of the initiative are: forty priority catchments served by a network of 42 catchment sensitive farming officers working locally; a programme of farmer workshops, farm demonstrations and farm visits; partnership with the pesticides voluntary initiative; local catchment steering groups bringing together farmers, water companies and other stakeholders; a capital grant scheme. In its first two years the initiative also supported 20 projects, with similar aims and objectives, in other catchments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.2/3">In February 2008 DEFRA launched Future Water, the Government's new water strategy for England. This stated that DEFRA will continue to support farmers on catchment sensitive farming for a further three years. DEFRA has since confirmed that the England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative will receive funding of &pound;12.9 million in 2008-09. Most of the initial programme is being rolled forward for a period of six months, with a new programme planned from October.</p>

	<p pid="a.1357W.8/1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report includes 'high-end' projections for global temperature rise from an ensemble of climate models. These are based on close to business-as-usual Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (for example, A2 and A1B).</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/2">Using these projections, our current best estimate for a high-end UK-wide average annual temperature increase by 2050 (relative to 1990) is approximately 1.75&deg; C.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357W.8/3">In general terms, there is relatively little differentiation in temperature projections at 2050, no matter what emissions scenario is chosen. However, later this century, the gap between high-end and low-end scenarios will widen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1358W.8/1">DEFRA is working hard to identify where we can reduce the need to travel, through the use of video conferencing and other alternatives, and when travel is necessary, to encourage staff to make the most sustainable choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/2">We are working with our IT strategic supplier IBM and Tandberg to install the infrastructure necessary to make available the next breed of video conferencing services based around IP rather than ISDN telecommunication protocols and fixed v/conf studios. This will improve the availability, quality and mobility of the v/conf service and make it a more attractive alternative option for staff to choose when travelling to meetings would normally be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/3">But we recognise it is not a panacea for all meetings. Initial contacts and team building often require physical, face-to-face meetings to ensure good team relationships are built before moving to electronic meeting spaces. We also recognise that there are other technologies that can impact on the need for meetings&mdash;e.g. a quick teleconference session can often be appropriate and sufficient if there is a single issue to resolve among a small number of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/4">We will also be setting up SharePoint team spaces to provide a repository of shared resources, discussion threads and wikis etc. that should reduce the need for meetings in the first place and support the move of the core department to a more project-orientated structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/5">DEFRA is looking to these new technologies to assist in meeting its new travel targets to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/6" class="indent">reduce carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles by 15 per cent. by 2011-12 (from a 2005-06 baseline)</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/7" class="indent">achieve a new fleet emissions average of 130g/k by 2010</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/8" class="indent">reduce carbon dioxide emissions from air travel by 5 per cent. by 2008-09 (from a 2006-07 baseline)</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/9" class="indent">achieve an overall reduction in the amount of travel undertaken across the core-department</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/10">More specifically we will look to see an increase in take-up and use of the new v/conf services following implementation of the new IP infrastructure, though a target has yet to be set.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.8/11">You may also wish to know that DEFRA worked with IBM to produce a White Paper on methods and techniques for assessing and reducing the carbon footprint of office IT services entitled &quot;Environmentally aware governance of the distributed IT infrastructure&quot;. This has now received two awards&mdash;a Gold Award from BCS link:</p>

	<p pid="a.1360W.5/2">The criteria for undertaking an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Regulations provide that the consenting authorities must ascertain, before granting approval to the works, that the proposals will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of a European protected site. In this case the authorities agreed that an assessment should be undertaken which would also take account of the possible effects of operating the new ferries on the Solent and Southampton Water protected site. The developers engaged consultants who produced a report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-28">28 March</phrase> to underpin that assessment. This is currently being considered by Natural England and the Marine and Fisheries Agency. In determining their respective consents the regulating authorities must make an assessment of the potential effects of the proposals on the site and on any mitigation necessary to protect the site from damage.</p>

	<p pid="a.1362W.9/1">As soon as we became aware that Pirbright was a potential source of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak we put in place a number of additional safeguards at the site. We immediately asked the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Professor Spratt to carry out reviews of biosecurity, and subsequently accepted all of the recommendations in their reports. Since then, stringent new biosecurity conditions have been applied to work on the Pirbright site, providing several independent layers of safety and ensuring that the process is contained. For example, a comprehensive programme of preventive maintenance of the contained drainage system has been implemented and sections have been re-lined. These measures will ensure the highest level of biosecurity at Pirbright.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.9/2">In addition, a Safety Alert was issued last September to all similar laboratories, which has been followed up by a joint programme of inspections by HSE and DEFRA inspectors to these labs. The inspections of containment level (CL) 4 laboratories revealed no breaches of the legislation and no formal enforcement action was taken. This process has provided both the regulatory bodies and the operators of the laboratories with the assurance that their facilities are well managed. HSE will continue this series of Safety Alert inspections to consider CL3 facilities based on risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.9/3">The Government accepted all of the recommendations in Sir Bill Callaghan's independent review of the regulatory framework for the handling of animal pathogens, published in December 2007. These included that responsibility for the regulation of animal pathogens should transfer to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). DEFRA is working closely with the HSE and other departments, to implement all three phases of the work recommended by Sir Bill Callaghan. The formal legal transfer of the Specified Animal Pathogens Order enforcement and inspection responsibilities is well under way and is nearing completion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.9/4">We have worked closely with the HSE and are satisfied that all necessary measures are in place to provide assurance that the risk of accidental release is as close to zero as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1365W.5/1">Waste incineration plants, including those in hospitals, are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (the &quot;PPC Regulations&quot;) which were superseded from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April 2008</phrase> by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2007. These regulations require each incinerator to have a permit to operate which is issued by the regulator only after detailed consideration of the environmental and health impacts of the operation. Each permit contains operating conditions which incorporate the requirements of the waste incineration directive (the WID), among which is a maximum emission limit to air for dioxins of 0.1 ng/m<sup>(3)</sup> expressed as International Toxic Equivalents (ITEQ). This limit is considered to provide adequate protection to the human health and environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.5/2">Waste incinerators are responsible for a small proportion only of emissions of a range of pollutants. An independent, peer reviewed, study published in 2004, 'Review of the Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management', concluded that based on the evidence from studies so far:</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;risks to human health from incineration are small in comparison with other known risks&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.5/4">Of the 65 incinerators regulated by the Environment Agency, five were reported to have breached the 0.1 ng/m<sup>(3)</sup> emission limit during 2007. In four of these cases a formal warning was issued by the Environment Agency. In the last case the Environment Agency is considering what enforcement action is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.5/5">Crematoria are not waste incineration plants and so are not regulated in that way, although they are subject to controls upon emissions to air under other parts of the EPR regulations.</p>

The Government have been pressing for their removal for some time as they encourage producers to produce to a quota rather than to meet market demand. In addition, they are an unnecessary cost and regulatory burden. We look forward to their abolition in 2015. Consequently, we have no plans to encourage greater milk production to fulfil the new quota ceilings. we believe producers should produce for the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.1367W.9/1">The UK list of priority species provides a focus for conservation action over the next decade and will be used to inform statutory lists under legislation in each of the countries of the UK. The list has been published with an indication of the most important types of action necessary for the conservation of each species. The UK Biodiversity Partnership is adopting the ecosystem approach and, in addition to legal protection and management for single species and sites, these actions include habitat expansion and restoration, wider action on cross-cutting issues such as climate change, and research. Biodiversity conservation is a devolved matter, and implementation is being taken forward under biodiversity and environment strategies in each of the four countries of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.1371W.3/2">Fridges form a relatively small proportion of the material handled by fragmentisers and the associated emissions of green house gases are not routinely measured or recorded. However, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires that all greenhouse gases with a global warming potential above 15 must be extracted before items are sent through a fragmentiser.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.3/3">Any fragmentiser handling separately collected waste electrical and electronic equipment&mdash;including fridges&mdash;must be an approved authorised treatment facility and deal with WEEE in accordance with the guidance published by the environment agencies on best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques.</p>

	<p pid="a.1372W.5/1">Planning Policy Statement 25 on Development and Flood Risk (PPS25) advocates that regional planning bodies and local authorities incorporate policies for furthering the use of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) in their regional spatial strategies and development plan documents. They should also ensure that their policies and decisions on applications complement building regulations on sustainable rainwater drainage. This gives priority to the use of infiltration drainage systems over watercourses and then sewers. PPS25 also encourages local authorities to promote the use of SUDs by developers when they design their developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1372W.5/2">However, the principal obstacle to the increased take-up of SUDS is the lack of clarity over where responsibility for the ownership and long-term maintenance and renewal of SUDS infrastructure should lie. These issues are currently being addressed through a specific DEFRA work stream and have been the subject of informal consultation with the National SUDS Working Group. DEFRA is consulting on options for the responsibility for ownership and maintenance of SUDS as part of the current consultation on Improving Surface Water Drainage. This consultation was launched alongside the Government's Water Strategy in February 2007 and will close on <phrase class="date" code="">30 April 2008</phrase>.</p>

The London Development Agency and the newly appointed masterplanning team have started the process to develop the LMF and will engage closely with local people and businesses to ensure the masterplan reflects their ideas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1384W.5/1">The Northern Ireland Policing Board has a statutory requirement to assess the effectiveness of district policing partnerships in performing their statutory duties. To fulfil this requirement the Board undertakes an annual performance assessment of each DPP against a performance management framework. The framework requires a number of key performance indicator targets to be met in relation to the DPP statutory duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/2">The Policing Board also commissions the Central Survey Unit in the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) to conduct the Policing Board module in its Omnibus Survey twice a year and the biennial District Policing Partnership (DPP) Public Consultation Survey. These surveys meet the Policing Board's statutory obligations under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 to &quot;assess the level of public satisfaction with the performance of the police and district policing partnerships&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/3">The Policing Board makes its annual assessment of the effectiveness of district policing partnerships (DPPs), using a range of performance indicators and targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/4">Information reported to the Board on the performance of DPPs during 2006-07 confirms that overall DPPs are fulfilling their statutory responsibilities:</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/5" class="indent">The targets that assess the performance of DPPs in identifying local policing priorities for input to the local Policing Plan and NI Policing Plan were achieved by 23 of the 26 DPPs;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/6" class="indent">The targets that assess the performance of DPPs in monitoring police performance were achieved by all but one DPP;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/7" class="indent">The targets that assess the performance of DPPs in engaging with the community to gain the co-operation of the public with the police in preventing crime were achieved by 23 of the 26 DPPs;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/8" class="indent">The targets measuring the performance of DPPs in acting as a forum for discussion on policing were achieved by 24 of the 26 DPPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/9">The targets that assess the effectiveness of DPPs in consulting with the public were taken from the 2006 NISRA DPP Public Consultation Survey and the results were assessed against baseline results from the same survey carried out in 2004. Results were compared for 24 DPPs and the four Belfast sub-group areas. Dungannon and South Tyrone did not establish a DPP until December 2004 and no baseline was available for the 2006-07 assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/10" class="indent">21 DPPs/Belfast sub-groups increased the survey respondents who had heard of the DPP;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/11" class="indent">Six DPPs/Belfast sub-groups increased the percentage of survey respondents who think that the DPP does a good job;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/12" class="indent">15 DPPs/Belfast sub-groups achieved the target to increase the percentage of survey respondents who are confident that the DPP is addressing local policing problems;</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/13" class="indent">one Belfast sub-group showed an increase in the percentage of NISRA survey respondents who had heard of DPPs and are prepared to contact their DPP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/14">It is the Policing Board's view that DPPs have made an important contribution to increased confidence in policing. Through working in partnership with the police to prevent crime DPPs have also contributed to a 15 per cent. reduction in recorded crime in the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1396W.8/2">The estimates are derived from the information on available staff years published by Cabinet Office in their report Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1397W.2/1">The activities of the Digital National Framework (<a href="http://www.dnf.org">www.dnf.org</a>) are agreed by an Expert Group formed of officials representing local and central government, non-Department Government bodies and the private sector. Their aim is to promote linkages across national and local datasets, which have a geographic component, to support the sharing of information about a common location. The majority of their resource comes from &quot;in kind&quot; contributions of individual members, supplemented by limited financial sponsorship to cover promotional activities and some technical documentation. Therefore there is no single body taking the lead of the Digital National Framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.1400W.5/1">Targeted Response Vehicles (TRVs) are used as an extra resource by Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) at specified times and locations to provide a more flexible and increased service in specific areas. Effective use of new midi fire appliances or TRVs crewed with three firefighters can, in certain circumstances, provide a better service for local communities. As well as tackling small fires, using TRVs in identified 'hot spots' can act as a deterrent to miscreants and free up staff for major incidents and community safety work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.5/2">FRAs are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. The IRMP enables the authority to tailor cover for fire and other incidents to local circumstances&mdash;evaluating where risk is greatest and allocating resource accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.5/3">It is not the role of Ministers to intervene in the operational proposals of an individual FRA's IRMP; that is rightly the decision for elected members of the authority concerned to determine following full consultation with the local community.</p>

The number of staff employed by each Fire and Rescue Authority including those in the South West is a matter for them and consequently the total figure fluctuates around this mark.

	<p pid="a.1404W.14/4">Every Regional Control Centre will be able to mobilise any Fire and Rescue unit anywhere in England, which is currently not possible. This new network and the associated Firelink communications project will deliver a more efficient and resilient control service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1409W.8/2">However, it is recognised that the council would not wish to produce a Local Development Framework that sets out a strategy based only on expansion at Heathrow (beyond T5) and therefore advice on a possible approach has been given. The approach is for the council to consider appropriate strategic spatial options for development in the borough that take as a starting point a range of scenarios for the future development of the airport, including for example, additional capacity by addition of a third runway. This approach would allow the core strategy strategic spatial options to take account of the impact of these scenarios on future development patterns for housing and employment land within the borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1409W.8/3">The council has been advised that it is not appropriate for realistic strategic spatial options, that are not supported by the council, to be excluded from consideration, particularly in relation to the expansion of Heathrow (beyond T5) which is Government policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1420W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is planning to continue its humanitarian engagement with a further &pound;5 million in 2008-09. DFID's support will focus in particular on internally displaced persons (IDP) and host populations. DFID will continue to support immediate relief interventions, to improve humanitarian co-ordination and look for ways to encourage early recovery. DFID is working with a range of implementers from the United Nations (UN) agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Red Cross to ensure that the final distribution of assistance is carried out in a transparent and appropriately targeted way, with particular attention taken to ensure that partners are acting with independence and impartiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1420W.5/2">The relief initiatives supported by DFID are ongoing in spite of a security environment that makes access to vulnerable populations difficult. DFID has chosen partners that have a proven track record of delivery even in the most insecure areas at the Chad/Sudan border. The European Union Force (EUFOR) is mandated to protect IDPs, host populations and aid workers, and to promote the conditions for IDP return; as EUFOR deploys, we expect that it will become easier to deliver aid. DFID is making provision to allow the expansion of relief and early recovery efforts if and when the security environment is improved.</p>

DFID is now working to stimulate the UN's planning in this area, and to ensure that the UK's own planning is complementary to the plans being put forward by European partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.1426W.5/1">A key element in the operational response to the humanitarian situation in Somalia is the logistical effort to deliver food and other relief supplies to Somalia by sea but the threat of piracy in 2007 made delivery hazardous. The introduction of military escorts has been useful, with no incidents of piracy affecting escorted vessels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.5/2">Since December 2007 the French and Danish military forces have escorted in total 70,000 metric tonnes of humanitarian aid to Somalia. Consignments included relief materials for UNICEF and UNHCR in addition to World Food Programme food aid. The Dutch military have recently taken over escort duties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1426W.8/1">Officials at the Department for International Development, together with colleagues at the British high commission in Nairobi and the British embassy in Addis Ababa, are in regular contact with the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, including the President and Prime Minister, and with the Government of Ethiopia. The discussions are varied, and the humanitarian situation has been regularly discussed, specifically on allowing agencies and NGOs unhindered access to areas in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/2">Officials based in Nairobi meet regularly through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to co-ordinate humanitarian assistance. The United States of America, European Commission and member states of the European Union are all represented at these meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/3">The UK Government maintain regular contact with all parties the hon. Member lists. The Minister for Africa at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), my right hon. Friend Lord Malloch Brown, raised humanitarian issues when he met President Yusuf in January 2008 and with Prime Minister Hussein and the Government of Ethiopia at the African Union summit in February 2008. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn)&mdash;former Secretary of State for DFID&mdash;met with President Yusuf last year and discussed the humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.8/4">Most of DFID's humanitarian assistance (which includes medical supplies) is not earmarked to regions within Somalia. This enables our implementing partners (e.g. the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme) to remain flexible and to react to changing circumstances on the ground. However, some of the NGOs that we support work in specific areas, e.g. a nutrition programme with the International Medical Corps (IMC) in Bakool and a nutrition, water and sanitation programme through Action contre le faim (ACF) in Galgadud.</p>

	<p pid="a.1433W.3/1">Halifax is in the area covered by the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority (WYPTA) and the Department's support for bus services is allocated to WYPTA rather than to individual local authorities in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.3/2">In the last five years a total of &pound;4.9 million was allocated to WYPTA in rural bus subsidy grant. In the same period WYPTA also received &pound;5 million in funding from the Department's urban and rural bus challenge and Kickstart schemes. Four of the projects, totalling &pound;2.4 million, supported under these schemes involve services in Calderdale district which includes Halifax.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.3/3">Bus companies operating in and around Halifax also receive bus service operators grant from the Department. This is a payment equivalent to about 80 per cent. of the fuel duty operators incur in providing local bus services. However, as BSOG is a payment direct to operators, statistics are not kept of payments by local authority or geographical area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.3/4">Local authorities may also use funding from the Government's unhypothecated revenue support grant (formula grant) to support local bus services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1433W.6/1">The Government have looked at various times at the issue of bus regulation, starting with the 1998 White Paper which led to the Transport Act 2000; and last year's review which has led to the proposals in the Local Transport Bill giving among other things, more scope for local authority involvement in bus services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.6/2">On each occasion in the past, we concluded that constructive partnership between a largely private sector industry and local authorities is a better way forward than wholesale re-regulation in delivering the services needed by passengers. Indeed, we feel that the private sector strengths in management, innovation and investment are central to the future of the industry.</p>

As the Heathrow consultation document states, under current proposals aviation emissions would effectively be capped at the average level over the period 2004 to 2006. This means that when the trading scheme is established, any additional aviation emissions above that level would lead to no increase in total emissions, since airlines would have to pay for the equivalent emissions reductions in other sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.1445W.3/1">Before scheduling the roadworks at Gateway services, the Highways Agency carefully considered the potential impact on road users. Based on the typical traffic flow over recent years on this part of the M1, and keeping the same capacity by ensuring all existing lanes are open during the day, any delay was assessed to be minimal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1445W.3/2">It is normal practice to maintain a separation of at least 10 km between concurrent major roadworks on motorways, where possible. The Gateway services are more than 10 km from junction 6a.</p>

The results of TRL assessment indicated that the noise levels on the section of the M20 between Junction 8 (Maidstone) and Junction 9 (Ashford) were three dB(A) more than predicted and therefore it qualified as a high priority site for resurfacing.

	<p pid="a.1448W.0/1">Prosecutions are carried out by the police and the new parking regulations make no changes to their activities. 230 English local authorities have taken over from the police the enforcement of parking and that number increases each year. In those areas the number of penalty charge notices served by an individual local authority, and paid by motorists, will increase or decrease primarily according to local circumstances and local parking behaviour. The new regulations are aimed at improving parking behaviour, thereby improving traffic flows in the interests of other road users.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.3/1">Following publication of the Department for Transport's &quot;Towards a Sustainable Transport System&quot; in October 2007, we intend to look at the full range of options for putting transport on to a less carbon-intensive path.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.3/2">More specifically, we have been considering with stakeholders whether changes to the existing arrangements for the subsidy of bus services, which are the main form of urban public transport, would increase the contribution of buses to delivery of our environmental and other objectives. A key consideration is whether particular subsidy changes would incentivise improvements to the fuel efficiency of the bus fleet and the use of environmentally friendly vehicles. We published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March</phrase> a consultation document, entitled &quot;Local Bus Service Support&mdash;options for reform&quot;, which invites views on our proposals; and copies are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.3/3">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation which comes into effect in April 2008 will require the major oil companies and fuel suppliers that supply fossil fuels for road transport to ensure that a proportion of the road fuel supplied in the UK comprises renewable fuels such as biofuels. The level of the obligation will be 2.5 per cent. of total fuel supplied by the supplier in the first year (2008-09), rising to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.3/4">We are working with the rail industry to trial the use of biofuels which could, subject to satisfying concerns about carbon benefits and overall sustainability, reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuels. We will also keep under review the case for more strategic electrification of the rail network.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.3/5">We also support the Commission's intention to legislate to improve the average g/km carbon dioxide emissions performance of passenger cars. This should reduce use of fossil fuels, both by encouraging use of other fuel sources and by encouraging more efficient use by those vehicles that continue to be powered by oil products. We have pressed the Commission to commit to a target of 100 g/km CO2 average for 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.1456W.2/1">The testing of food additives is carried out to satisfy the requirements of the Food Safety Act 1990, for which the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has responsibility, and is an example of specific legislative requirements under which procedures on animals are carried out. The number of animals used varies from year to year and depends on the requirements of industry and the regulators concerned. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to place a limit on such testing. However, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that the procedures authorised must cause the minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the least sentience and we will continue to ensure that these requirements are met in all categories of animal use, including the testing of food additives.</p>
