It is envisaged that they will remain in place until the current phase of the project is completed, expected to be at the end of December 2011. Commons Court is an area suitable for site huts and from time to time in the future huts are likely to be sited there in connection with various works projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.754W.6/1">Estimates of the median equivalised household incomes After Housing Costs are published in the Households Below Average Income series. The median income is the income of the middle person in the population, such that half the population have incomes below the median and half the population have incomes above the median. The median is used instead of the mean income because the mean is affected by outlying cases with very high income values.</p>

For example, the process of equivalisation would adjust the income of a single pensioner upwards, so that we can use income to directly compare their standard of living with a pensioner couple.</p>

	<p pid="a.758W.6/1">The Government Olympic Executive publishes quarterly reports on progress towards delivering the Olympic and Paralympic games. These reports include the latest position on the status and level of contingency remaining within the &#163;9.3 billion public sector funding package for the games. The most recent report, published in July 2011, showed that the balance of contingency and other savings in the programme stood at &#163;643.5 million. For more information see:</p>

In 1997, following the tragic shooting incident at Dunblane, Parliament legislated to place most pistols within this category.

	<p pid="a.764W.2/1">Hydrogen is regarded as having the potential to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in the UK and globally in the period 2020-50.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/2">Hydrogen is an energy carrier (like electricity) which has to be produced using a primary energy source. If used in fuel cells, hydrogen offers zero emissions at the point of use. It can be produced using low carbon routes such as electrolysis using renewable electricity, but currently the most economic route is from fossil fuels such as natural gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/3">Hydrogen has long-term potential for both transport and distributed energy applications, but further research, development and demonstration will be needed before the market can make a realistic assessment of its prospects. It is technically feasible to use hydrogen to store power from wind farms but with the exception of some remote or island installations it does not appear so far to have found favour with wind farm developers. This may reflect the costs of hydrogen relative to that of other energy storage options, or the non-storage option.</p>

	<p pid="a.765W.6/2">We have thought carefully about whether the different road safety risk faced by older and younger drivers might justify a blanket exception. While these groups clearly do have different risk profiles from other drivers, a blanket exception would be an excessively blunt instrument, and inconsistent with what the Equality Act is trying to achieve. Under the exemption planned for financial services, firms will be able to reflect in their prices the link between age, risk and insurance costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.6/3">In addition, and irrespective of what is finally decided on any exception, it will be still open to firms to justify objectively any restrictions they may wish to place on who may rent their cars. For example, a firm might require a minimum level of driving experience of those renting vehicles This would be consistent with the road safety evidence which suggests that it is experience, rather than just age, which is a key determinant of road safety risk. We believe such a practice is likely to meet the objective justification test if challenged as indirect age discrimination.</p>

In 2010-11, approximately &#163;1.9 billion, around a fifth of UK ODA, supported fragile and conflict-affected states, tackling the drivers of instability, building more responsive and accountable governments and strengthening security and justice overseas. Increasing such spending to 30% of UK ODA means we could double the amount spent on such activities by 2014-15.

DEFRA is co-funding a project with industry (LK09106) investigating the use of legume-based mixtures to enhance the nitrogen use efficiency and economic viability of cropping systems. The Department is also funding research on the genetics of grass and clover mixtures (project IF0145) to develop more sustainable and productive pasture systems, and maximise opportunities for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This represents an investment of &#163;1.7 million in research into nitrogen fixation on farms.</p>

	<p pid="a.771W.2/1">Our most recent estimates relate to two pilot areas of 350 km<sup>(2)</sup> each. For each area, the costs to the public purse are expected to be &#163;0.6 million for licensing, &#163;0.3 million for monitoring and &#163;0.1 million for testing and compensation costs in cattle TB incidents arising from perturbation impacts in the areas neighbouring the pilots. If the pilot areas were 150 km<sup>(2)</sup>, these costs would be slightly lower at &#163;0.4 million, &#163;0.2 million and &#163;0.1 million respectively. All the costs are expressed in present value terms. The savings to the public purse from reduced costs of cattle TB incidents prevented by a successful cull are estimated to exceed these costs.

The ICF will use a set of high level indicators to measure impact and value for money, including an assessment of ecosystem services saved. In line with commitments set out in the Natural Environment White Paper, all funding decisions will be based on strong scientific evidence. We will ensure environmental monitoring systems are in place to assess impact, thus aiding the design of future programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.774W.2/1">DEFRA has made no funding available under the English Rural Development Programme to egg producers in England to enable them to convert out of conventional cages. Our position is that this aid should not be available for meeting minimum legal standards. It would also be totally unfair to all those producers who have already invested heavily in conversion to give those late in doing so financial assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.788W.3/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Miriam Rosen, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Miriam Rosen, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-06">6 September 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/3">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/4">Since 2005, maintained school inspections have been carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Ofsted records all judgments made by inspectors in section 5 inspections, including the judgement for overall effectiveness of the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/5">Maintained schools inspected under section 5 include nursery, primary, secondary (including academies and city technology colleges), special schools and pupil referral units.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/6">Tables A to F show the number of maintained schools judged to be outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate for overall effectiveness at their section 5 inspection during each academic year between 2005/06 and the end of the spring term 2010/11 inclusive in the Reading West Constituency, Reading local authority and England as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/7">Statistics covering the outcomes of all inspections carried out in each academic year since 2005/06 can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/8"><a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/advanced-resources-search/results/%2A/all/all/any/200/any?solrsort=im_search_date_mktime">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/advanced-resources-search/results/%2A/all/all/any/200/any?solrsort=im_search_date_mktime</a>%20desc</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/9">The most recent official statistics release covering the outcomes of maintained school inspections carried out during the autumn and spring terms 2010/11 were released on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-15">15 June 2011</phrase> and can be accessed at the same link. Outcomes of inspections carried out during the full academic year 2010/11 are due to be published in November 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/10">In September 2009 Ofsted implemented a policy of more proportionate inspection using risk assessment and deliberately set out to inspect a greater proportion of previously satisfactory or inadequate schools and a smaller proportion of previously good or outstanding schools. This led to a skew in the sample of schools inspected and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.3/11">A copy of this reply has been sent to Nick Gibb MP, Minister of State for Schools, and will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

The regulations also provide for enforcement action to be taken through the courts of the country in which the person is now residing, subject to the domestic rules in force in that country.

The general rule of principle&#8212;and a SFEDI (the sector skills body for enterprise and enterprise support) recommendation&#8212;is that a volunteer mentor should have no more than three mentoring relationships at any one time. However, this can vary according to the policy of the mentoring organisation, the type of mentoring being offered, the geography involved and the needs of the small business. Ultimately, the frequency of contact will be agreed between mentor and mentee. Full-time or professional mentors will be able to take on more mentees as time permits.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.3/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what the (a) life expectancy, (b) cancer survival rate and (c) infant mortality rate was for (i) the five wealthiest primary care trust areas in England and (ii) the five poorest primary care trust areas in England in each year since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.3/4">There is currently no indicator available for the wealth of the population of primary care organisations in England, and an individual's wealth is not recorded at either death or cancer registration. However, there is an income deprivation indicator available for primary care organisations, based on the percentage of the population of each area living in low income families reliant on means tested benefits<sup>(1)</sup>. This indicator has been used as a proxy for defining wealthy and poor areas in this answer, although it should be noted that populations and families could be wealthy but have a low income and vice versa.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.3/5">Life expectancy figures are calculated as three-year rolling averages and are available for primary care organisations, from 2001-03 to 2007-09, for males and females separately. Table 1 provides the period life expectancy at birth for (a) males and (b) females living in (i) the five primary care organisations with the lowest percentage of the population living in low income families, and (ii) the five primary care organisations with the highest percentage of the population living in low income families.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.3/6">One-year cancer survival index figures are available for individual years 1996 to 2006, all cancers combined, persons resident in each primary care organisation, for patients diagnosed during 1996-2006 and followed up to the end of 2007. Table 2 provides one-year survival index figures for all cancers combined for persons living in (i) the five primary care organisations with the lowest percentage of the population living in low income families, and (ii) the five primary care organisations with the highest percentage of the population living in low income families.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.3/7">Table 3 provides infant mortality rates for each year from 1997 to 2009 (the latest year available), for (i) the five primary care organisations with the lowest percentage of the population living in low income families, and (ii) the five primary care organisations with the highest percentage of the population living in low income families.</p>

The concept of the creative industries is not easily constructed from the SIC and so economic indicators are not regularly published as an aggregate.

	<p pid="a.811W.8/1">The Government published the White Paper &#8216;Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales&#8217; on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-15">15 November 2010</phrase>, which set out proposals for the fundamental reform of the legal aid system and the rationale for those reforms. As set out in the White Paper, and the Consultation Response which followed in June 2011, our proposals have taken into account our domestic, European and international legal obligations, including the European convention on human rights, and a number of other factors. We have no plans to restrict the availability of legal aid based on the nationality of the claimant.</p>

	<p pid="a.822W.9/1">The Safe and Sustainable review is being conducted by the NHS National Specialised Commissioning Team. However, we have been following its progress. The review focuses on improving care for children with congenital heart disease. While paediatric surgery in some centres may cease, these centres may continue to provide specialist, non-interventional services for their local population. The review wants to ensure that as much non-surgical care is delivered as close to a child's home as possible through the development of local congenital heart networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.9/2">No decisions have yet been made on the proposed location of specialist surgical centres. The Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts (JCPCT) is expected to make a decision by the end of the year. In making its decision, the JCPCT will consider the Ipsos MORI independent analysis of the consultation responses, reports from Overview and Scrutiny Committees, a health impact assessment and other relevant evidence.</p>

NHSBT had 4,920 forms returned of which 1,805 have been converted into new registrations.</p>

One of the key standards of the national health service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) screening programme is that all surgeons treating patients identified through the NHS AAA screening programme must submit data to the National Vascular Database and participate in regular reviews of their practice and outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.827W.0/1">The Department has not undertaken an assessment of the reconfiguration of vascular surgery in the Black Country. The reconfiguration in the Black Country is part of a wider review of vascular services being led by the national health service at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.0/2">The Government are committed to devolving power to local communities&#8212;to the people, patients, general practitioners (GPs) and councils who are best placed to determine the nature of their local NHS services. The Government have pledged that, in future, all service changes must be led by clinicians and patients, not be driven from the top down. To this end, we have outlined new, strengthened criteria that we expect decisions on NHS service changes to meet. They must focus on improving patient outcomes, consider patient choice, have support from GP commissioners and be based on sound clinical evidence.</p>
