	<p pid="b.47W.3/1">I have no plans to introduce a legislative change which will include alpacas to be defined as livestock.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.3/2">I am unsure of the context of the question but there is some existing legislation which may be relevant to this issue. For example, the Agriculture Act 1947 provides that 'livestock includes any creature kept for the production of food, wool, skins or fur, or for the purpose of its use in the farming of land'. Alpacas could conceivably fall within this definition. Also, the Department issued guidance last year that, for the purposes of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981, alpacas should be considered to be 'domesticated' rather than 'wild' animals.</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.6/1">There is increasing scientific support for the view that the increase in antimicrobial resistance affecting human health is primarily the result of the use of antibiotics in human rather than veterinary medicines.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.6/2">Nonetheless, we take this issue very seriously and in June 2000, published a cross-Government strategy to address the issue. In 1999 the Defra Antimicrobial Resistance Co-ordination (DARC) Group was established. Details of the work of this group, together with other information about antimicrobials and links to related websites, are available on the VMD website (<a href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk">www.vmd.gov.uk</a>). We recognise that veterinary medicines, including antimicrobials, are required to ensure healthy food animals in the UK, but we believe that their use should not replace good farm management and animal husbandry systems. We believe that antimicrobials should be used responsibly in food animal production and have issued guidelines in the Code of Practice on the Responsible Use of Animal Medicines on the Farm, produced by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). We also support the industry's Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance (RUMA), which has also published responsible use guidelines for antimicrobials that have been adopted by assurance schemes for the five major food-producing species. Also, as a precautionary measure, the use of antimicrobial growth promoters in the EU will be banned from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.6/3">The VMD annually collates and publishes figures on the UK sales of all veterinary antimicrobials. These are likely to reflect usage of antimicrobials in animals. The figures illustrate that, whilst sales of some groups of antimicrobials have increased, others have decreased or remained relatively constant over time. The VMD, in collaboration with the Department of Health, has prepared and published a list of all antimicrobial therapeutic ingredients authorised for use in animals and humans. This illustrates that many antibiotic substances used in human medicine are not used in animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.6/4">A number of research projects designed to provide scientific data to inform further consideration of relevant issues are also underway. These range from investigating the mechanism of antimicrobial resistance transfer in organisms, to investigating the husbandry factors on farms which might lead to reduced antimicrobial usage, thereby reducing the potential for the development of antimicrobial resistance. Details of these projects can be found on the VMD website.</p>

Our aim with this White Paper is to help even more adults to get the skills they need to move from welfare into jobs and to progress in their careers. It builds on the infrastructure established through the national Skills Strategy published in 2003. It announced our plans for further improving adult provision, including the roll out of the National Employer Training Programme, the creation of new Skills Academies to deliver training in each sector, the national roll-out of the entitlement to free tuition to NVQ Level 2, and an improved and extended service to deliver advice and guidance on careers, training and support.</p>

DfES has published Healthy School Lunch guidance in which the Secretary of State strongly recommends that the value of a free school meal should be set to enable eligible children to have a standard two course lunch and drink. Schools are strongly encouraged to provide drinking water free of charge. Pupils entitled to free school meals cannot substitute other school food such as breakfast or break-time snacks for food served at lunchtime.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-05-24b.45.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-05-24b.54W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="54W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050524/text/50524w03.htm#50524w03.html_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.54W.8/1">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas and energy prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas or energy a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.</p>
	<p pid="b.54W.8/2">Despite recent rises, UK gas and electricity prices for industrial users in 2004 were lower in real terms than they were in 1994. In January 2005, UK gas and electricity prices for small, medium and large energy users were still below the EU median; for extra large electricity users their electricity prices were at the level of the EU median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices which might differ from these averages.</p>
	<p pid="b.54W.8/3">Data on the average industrial gas and electricity prices in the UK over time can be found in tables 3.3.1 Real Terms and 3.3.2 Real Terms at:</p>
	<p pid="b.54W.8/4"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy_prices/tables/table_331.xls">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy_prices/tables/table_331.xls</a></p>
	<p pid="b.54W.8/5">Average gas price comparisons for different size categories of energy users across the EU can be found in tables 5.8.1, 5.8.2 and 5.8.3 at:</p>
	<p pid="b.54W.8/6"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy_prices/tables/table_581.xls">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy_prices/tables/table_581.xls</a> and for electricity prices in tables 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 at:</p>

	<p pid="b.54W.8/8">There is anecdotal evidence that, for very large users of gas, gas prices in the UK are above those on the Continent. The Department is in discussion with the Energy Intensive Users Group and other industrial stakeholders to develop ideas for improving the operation of the forward market and to identify ways users can mitigate the effects of high forward gas prices. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-16">16 May</phrase> the DTI held a seminar with major users to discuss forward gas prices and we are planning a further similar seminar with smaller users. We have undertaken research into the operation of the forward gas market.

The review will consider the concerns of sports clubs, and its results will inform any necessary adjustments to the levels of fees introduced under the Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.68W.2/2">Interchange opportunities between staff in local and central Government are arranged by individual Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister currently has 10 members of staff on secondment to local authorities and 26 local authority staff working in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on secondment in areas including Housing, Homelessness, Social Exclusion, Local Government Legislation, Urban Policy Unit, and Local Government Strategy Unit. Such opportunities provide useful development and training opportunities for individuals to develop new skills and new ways of working and for organisations to benefit from the exchange of new ideas and ways of working. An evaluation process is in place to assess the benefits of each secondment.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.2/4">It is however for the local authorities to develop their own interchange policy and make decisions on the number of their staff they can release on secondments. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no input into these policies.</p>

Our expenditure plan for the Financial Year 2005&ndash;06 includes an allocation of approximately &pound;80,000 for the support of various human rights groups in Nepal and &pound;75,000 on human rights training support.

The UK is funding the World Health Organisation to conduct a new mortality survey, and preliminary results are expected by mid-June.

	<p pid="b.83W.5/1">This information is not collected directly as it is not possible to identify individual patients affected by air pollution. The link between air pollution and hospital admissions is derived from statistical correlations between daily air pollution levels and routine daily statistics on total respiratory hospital admissions. The national health service costs given as follows should be regarded only as rough estimates based on average figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/2">The Department's committee on the medical effects of air pollutants (COMEAP) estimated in 1998 <sup>1</sup> that there were 10,500 respiratory hospital admissions (additional or brought forward) per year due to PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> (PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> refers to the mass of particles less than 10 mm in diameter per cubic metre of air) in urban areas of Great Britain. The equivalent estimate for sulphur dioxide (SO <sub>2</sub> ) was 3,500 respiratory hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/3">Assuming that two thirds of the PM10 <sup>2</sup> and the vast majority of SO <sub>2</sub> in urban areas is due directly or indirectly to fuel emissions from transport or from industry, as a rough estimate it can be assumed that up to around 10,500 respiratory hospital admissions in urban areas of Great Britain may be related to emissions from fuel products.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/4">The Department's ad-hoc group on the economic appraisal of the health effects of air pollution estimated in 1999 that the average cost of an emergency respiratory hospital admission was around &pound;1,400. This gives a rough estimate of NHS costs due to emissions from fuel products of up to &pound;14.7 million (&pound;17.3 million in 2004 prices). This is an upper bound assuming that all respiratory hospital admissions are additional rather than simply brought forward as a result of higher air pollution days. The estimate does not include respiratory hospital admissions due to ozone <sup>3</sup> as an estimate of the proportion of ozone formed from fuel product precursors was not easily available. The estimate also does not include NHS costs of cardiovascular hospital admissions due to PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> or NHS costs of exacerbations of respiratory symptoms due to SO <sub>2</sub> or PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> .</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/5">Further work on this issue may be considered as part of the work of the new COMEAP sub-group on quantification.</p>

Many of the actions required at level 1 and 2 are being taken anyway as part of normal care, and all of them can reasonably be thought of as essential contributions to emergency planning required by 'duty of care'.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.2/3">National health service organisations and local authorities are expected to include in their financial planning the need to fund contingencies, of which costs associated with levels 3 and 4 of the Heatwave Plan are an example, along with those arising from, for example, widespread flooding.</p>

The OFT have established the Payment Systems Task Force, which is working to resolve competition, efficiency and incentive issues relating to payment systems. The Taskforce has recently agreed that a faster payments service be introduced for telephone banking, internet banking and standing order payments, and plans to examine a number of other topics including cheques, price efficiency and access and governance of the UK's major payment schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.2/1">Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/2">No judge may hear a case involving rape or a serious sexual offence in the first instance without first having received appropriate JSB training, and the designated course for this is the Serious Sexual Offences Seminar (SSOS). Those authorised will be called to continuation training every three years from the date of their first attendance. SSOS is currently designed to cater for both those newly authorised and those receiving continuation training on the basis that a strong element of the training is in the sharing of experiences in general discussions, and in particular during the syndicate work for sentencing and practical problems. However, the question as to whether there should be separate seminars for those attending for the first time, and those receiving continuation training, is kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/3">The seminar is currently a residential two-day (over three) event and past programmes have included talks on the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/4" class="indent">(1) research into public attitudes to sexual offending and the views of complainants and victims on the way in which sexual offences proceedings are handled.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/5" class="indent">(2) The policies and practices of the police and Crown Prosecution Service in handling serious sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/6" class="indent">(3) Issues of evidential and procedural law and practice which bear on the conduct of trials in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/7" class="indent">(4) Sentencing issues and the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders in the community and in prison. Also included in the programme is a series of discussions, in small groups, of trial and sentencing issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/8">In addition, judges of every rank, including the High Court and the Court of Appeal, who exercise the criminal jurisdiction, also received some training on the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as part of a programme of training on the Criminal Justice Reforms that ran between January and March 2005. This was supplemented with written material provided at the time the Act came into force.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/9">Newly appointed High Court Judges attend a Serious Sexual Offences Seminar at the earliest opportunity if they have not recently done so in a previous capacity. Further continuation training for High Court Judges is arranged at their request.</p>

	<p pid="b.104W.5/1">Regional spatial strategies (RSSs) contain housing numbers by district, and the draft revisions are prepared by the regional planning body (RPB) for the region. RPBs in all regions have not less than 60 per cent. of their members drawn from local authorities, including county councils.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.5/2">RPBs are required to seek the advice of certain authorities, including county councils when preparing, keeping under review and implementing RSSs, and these authorities are required to give the RPB their advice. These authorities must have the opportunity to prepare the detailed proposals for different provision for different parts of the region, if the RPB decides to make such provision. The RPB must also consult statutory consultees including county councils prior to examination in public of the strategy.</p>

Government receipts from rental income are not hypothecated to the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.8/2">Before April 2004 the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) comprised two elements: a housing element and a rent rebate element. Where an authority's housing element generated an assumed surplus, it was offset against the rent rebate element simply as an accounting convenience to ensure simplicity of administration. It did not fund the costs of housing benefit to central Government.</p>
