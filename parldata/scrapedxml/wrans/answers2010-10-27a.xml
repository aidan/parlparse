The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br/> 4. Figures are based on survey data and as such are subject to a degree of sampling and non-sampling error.<br/> 5. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 children.<br/> 6. Each of the measures is defined as:<br/> Relative poverty: percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.<br/> Absolute poverty: percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of 1998-99 median household income held constant in real terms.<br/> Low Income and Material Deprivation: percentage of children living in households in material deprivation and with less than 70% of contemporary median household income, before housing costs.<br/> 7. Income after housing costs (AHC) is derived by deducting a measure of housing costs from the before housing costs (BHC) measure of income. These include (1) rent (gross of housing benefit), (2) water rates, community water charges and council water charges, (3) mortgage interest payments, and (4) structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers), ground rent and service charges.<br/> 8. BHC and AHC figures are given for the relative and absolute poverty measures. The combined material deprivation and low income measure is defined using before housing costs income.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Poverty and Income Inequality in Scotland: 2008-09</td> </tr>

Such carers are usually entitled to benefits available to birth parents, including child benefit, child tax credits or pension credit, subject to meeting the normal conditions of entitlement. Relevant discussions with ministerial colleagues have therefore focused on wider issues concerning benefits for parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.319W.0/1">The Food and Environment Research Agency's (Fera's) National Bee Unit's BeeBase database is a vital tool in controlling bee pests and diseases. Knowing the location of apiaries is essential if these harmful organisms are to be controlled quickly and effectively. An action plan is in place to increase the number of beekeepers who are voluntarily registered on the database. Depending on the success of this plan, compulsory registration may be considered but current policy remains one of encouraging voluntary registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.0/2">The action plan, which is a key part of the Healthy Bees Plan, includes the National Bee Unit's bee inspectors encouraging beekeepers to register, and a campaign by Fera in partnership with beekeeping stakeholders to raise awareness of BeeBase, and promote its aims and benefits. As a result, BeeBase registrations are increasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.0/3">Since its creation in 1992, BeeBase has been regularly updated to reflect the turnover in beekeepers and currently over 21,000 beekeepers are registered compared to approx 18,000 in 2008.</p>

However, he concluded that no changes were required as there was little evidence of a detrimental impact on access to postgraduate education. They will however continue to benefit from access to Professional and Career Development Loans.</p>

Repayments are based on 9% of income above the threshold of &#163;15,000 per annum (or monthly/weekly equivalent). The following table provides examples of how much a borrower would expect to repay each month based on repayments of 9% of income over the current &#163;15,000 threshold; and how much a borrower may expect to repay if the threshold was raised to &#163;21,000, as proposed in the Browne review of higher education funding and student finance.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.7/1">The Learning Disabilities Development Fund forms part of the personal social services grant, which is currently allocated from the Department to local authorities. The personal social services grant will increase by &#163;1 billion in real terms by 2014-15. However, to reduce the administration burdens and increase flexibility for local authorities, after March 2011 this grant will be rolled into local government formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.7/2">The coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with a realistic programme of efficiency, that there is sufficient funding available both to protect people's access to services, meet demographic pressures and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes. We expect that this will benefit all users of social care services, including people with learning disabilities.</p>

The Department is currently monitoring the Station Travel Plan pilots being run by the rail industry which include a focus on improving the integration between rail and other transport modes including cycling.

	<p pid="a.349W.3/1">The Winter Resilience Review's interim report concentrated on actions that can be taken by local and national highways authorities, salt suppliers, the Government and others to improve resilience for the coming winter, as well as some longer term actions. The findings were welcomed by the Government and the Secretary of State for Transport instructed his officials to take forward recommendations directed at the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency. This included sourcing 250,000 tonnes of imported salt to establish and manage national strategic stockpiles, reflecting the exceptional re-stocking challenges for local highway authorities for this coming winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.3/2">Among its recommendations, the review panel recommended that this Department produce guidance for members of the public on clearing the footways outside their property.

	<p pid="a.357W.8/1">Allegations of inappropriate relationships, as with other information relating to prison security, are reported using a Security Information Report (SIR). All SIRs have to be evaluated for quality, accuracy and intelligence value. Reporting levels can be driven by interpretation and subjective perceptions of particular circumstances and individuals, malicious reporting and the possibility of duplication. The number of SIRs submitted, therefore, does not provide a true reflection of risk. As with other concerns relating to potential corrupt activities, SIRs relating to potential inappropriate relationships are forwarded to the NOMS Corruption Prevention Unit for further development, analysis and potentially tasking activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.8/2">NOMS will always seek to deal robustly with any member of staff engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner and will look to use internal disciplinary and/or criminal proceedings depending on the circumstances of the case. Data collected from each prison shows that 258 individuals (directly and non directly employed) have been convicted, dismissed or excluded by NOMS since January 2008 for corruption related offences. 126 of these individuals are recorded under the category of 'Inappropriate Relationship' (five convicted, 85 excluded and 36 dismissed).</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.8/3" class="indentitalic"> Note:</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.8/4" class="indent">These figures have been drawn from live administrative data systems maintained by the Corruption Prevention Unit which may be amended at any time. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. The 'results' data do not take account of those cases where there is an ongoing suspension, arrest or prosecution, or where there has been a resignation due to a corruption related reason, prior to a formal disciplinary or criminal outcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.358W.5/1">Delivery structures across probation areas vary as do the requirements of specific roles and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not routinely report on the proportion of working time spent in face to face contact with offenders. In December 2008, NOMS undertook a snapshot survey over a one week period, based on a small sample of probation officer (PO) and probation service officer (PSO) staff. It reported that across England and Wales 24% of PO/PSO time was spent in direct contact with offenders, 41% was involved in computer activity and 35% of time was spent on non-computer-dealing with correspondence, meetings, travel, etc.</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/2">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is taking a number of actions to increase the amount of contact time between probation staff and offenders. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/3" class="indent">initiating the Offender Engagement Programme to evaluate and improve the quality of face to face work with offenders and its impact on reoffending. This includes work to reduce the bureaucratic demands on operational staff to enable them to: spend a greater proportion of work time in one to one engagement, exercise their professional judgment in personalising the work and engaging with offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/4" class="indent">As part of this programme the current heavily prescriptive, process-focused national standards are being revised, switching the focus from practitioners to what offenders do and achieve during the course of their supervision period.</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/5" class="indent">the Specifications Benchmarking and Costing programme which is on track to publish specifications for approximately 75 services delivered to offenders, defendants, victims and courts. This work is supporting decentralisation by removing unnecessary prescription-specifying &quot;what&quot; must be delivered but not &quot;how&quot; it should be delivered by clearly stating the outcomes required from the services provided by probation. It supports innovation and localism-by offering clear choices to commissioners on the core services to deliver, to which types of offenders and with the flexibility to commission options to reflect local circumstances; and it is driving improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, allocating resources to the assessment and management of offenders according to the level of risk;</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/6" class="indent">as part of the Probation Trusts Programme all areas (including locally initiated mergers) have identified efficiencies through for example the reduction in management overheads, and development, of shared services, to the benefit of front line staffing levels;</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/7" class="indent">expanding the use of video conferencing to reduce the time probation staff spend travelling to interview prisoners; and</p>
	<p pid="a.358W.5/8" class="indent">A pilot in Surrey and Sussex Probation Trust to enable the use of professional judgement in deciding how to work most effectively with each individual.</p>

	<p pid="a.359W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice does not hold information on the number of transgender people who are serving custodial sentences. There are difficulties in collecting information on the numbers of transgender prisoners. It would require a prisoner to voluntarily provide information on their gender history, as it would not always be possible for a prison to identify a transgender person by any other means. Any monitoring of the numbers of transgender prisoners would thus likely be incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.2/2">A further obstacle to collecting information on the numbers of transgender prisoners is that the Gender Recognition Act 2004 makes it an offence to disclose any information concerning the gender history of a person with a gender recognition certificate.</p>

	<p pid="a.360W.6/1">The Academies Act 2010 brought in new provisions which mean that in future all state-funded schools will have the same obligations in relation to children with special educational needs, including requirements with regard to the naming of a school on a statement of special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.6/2">In practical terms, the new obligations on Academies are:</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.6/3" class="indent">An obligation to inform parents that their child has SEN and the special educational provision (SEP) being made;</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.6/4" class="indent">An unqualified obligation to admit a child to the school if the school is named in the statement; and</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.6/5" class="indent">An obligation to appoint a person as SENCO who is a qualified teacher and that new SENCOs will have to undertake prescribed training.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.6/6">This applies to any new Academy and any existing Academy which moves to the new Funding Agreement, the contract between the Secretary of State and the Academy which regulates how an Academy operates. As a result, local authorities can now name an Academy on a statement of special educational needs in the same way as they can name a maintained school on a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.6/7">Parents, either for or against the naming of an Academy in the child's SEN statement, have always had the same rights of access to the First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs and Disability). The First-tier Tribunal can determine that an Academy should be named on a statement of special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.361W.5/2"><i> </i>The Department for Education does not hold information on the funding of individual Connexions services funded by grant from the Department. It is for Brighton and Hove city council, and for councils in other areas, to decide the level of funding for Connexions and other services supporting young people, and where to make savings. While the Department's area based grant (ABG) to local authorities was reduced by &#163;311 million as part of the local government contribution to deficit reduction in 2010-11, the reduction in ABG does not imply a direct cut to the services funded by the grant. The Government have made it clear that local authorities should have the maximum flexibility to make efficiency savings from all their funding sources, taking into account their statutory responsibilities and the need to protect front line services as much as possible. We do not expect that cuts should fall disproportionately on Connexions services over others.</p>

	<p pid="a.363W.14/2">In November 2008 the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal (SENDIST) was transferred to the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal under the authority of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The Tribunal has jurisdiction in England only. The Tribunals Service regularly reviews the processes of the Tribunal and its rules of procedure in consultation with stakeholders and user groups, including parental representative bodies. Tribunals Service officials are in regular contact with officials at the Department for Education.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.14/3">The Tribunals Service Framework Document requires the agency to report the First-tier Tribunal-Special Educational Needs and. Disability's performance in its Annual Report and Accounts, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House and on the Tribunals Service website:</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.14/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.tribunals.gov.uk">www.tribunals.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.363W.14/5">The Tribunal aims for 75% of hearings to take place within 22 weeks of registration of the appeal. In 2009/10 the percentage of cases disposed of within 22 weeks of receipt was 82%. The Tribunals Service has also published detailed official annual statistics for the operational year 2009-10 and, most recently, for the first quarter of 2010-11. The performance has risen to 83% for this first quarter.</p>

Following the strategic defence and security review, it is too early to say what changes might be required to the programme at Rosyth and elsewhere in the SSSA.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.0/1">The Royal Air Force's (RAF) use of simulators already forms a key element through the full spectrum of training provided to RAF personnel from basic training onwards. The use of simulators offers cost-effective and practical training for a wide range of appropriate and relevant skills and the RAF is working closely with the Ministry of Defence, allies and industry to maximise the benefits available from this approach. In particular, the RAF is currently developing two major simulator based projects. The first links realistic simulation environments for training fast jet pilots, ISTAR (Intelligence Surveillance Targeting, Acquisition and Reconnaissance) and aviation specialisations. This is planned to enter service with the RAF in 2013. The second aims to deliver an enhanced training capability in support of the RAF's air transport capability, including the C130J and A400M aircraft. This project is also planned to be in use by 2013. However, it needs to be recognised that a significant irreducible element of live flying training by the RAF will be required to maintain the safe operation of front-line aircraft for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="a.370W.0/1">As stated in the White Paper on the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), the Army will significantly reduce its non-deployable administration structure in order to enhance its focus on front-line capabilities. The current four regional divisional headquarters will be replaced with a single UK Support Command and at least two regional brigade headquarters will close. This will generate savings in personnel and estate costs. It is too early to provide detailed estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.0/2">A project team was established in June 2010 to examine and rationalise the Army's non-deployable regional administrative structure after the publication of the SDSR. This team will continue the detailed work of identifying the most cost-effective way of achieving this transformation.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence is unable to estimate the number of former members of the armed forces of working age who are unemployed, however, all service personnel, regardless of time served are entitled to some form of resettlement. Data to improve our understanding of the situation are being gathered in order to make our system of resettlement more personalised and sophisticated. This can range from advice on how to find employment, through to formal training activity to complement the transferable skills they have acquired through service. All injured service personnel who are discharged will receive the full resettlement package, that in some cases can be deferred until they are well enough to undertake resettlement activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.6/2">The most recent data available from the NAO show that resettlement outcomes remain impressive: over 90% of personnel who transition using the services of the Career Transition Partnership (a partnering arrangement between MOD and Right Management Limited, a leading specialist outplacement company) are in employment within six months of being discharged. Nevertheless, the MOD recognises that making the transition from the armed forces into civilian life can be daunting and we are doing more to enhance the resettlement package.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.6/3">Prior to discharge, individual employment needs are identified from a mandatory interview with a trained service resettlement adviser who is able to signpost to a number of organisations and services ranging from the 'Flexible New Deal' programme available at Jobcentre Plus through to workshops and training delivered through the Career Transition Partnership. For those that have left, lifetime job finding support is available through the Officers' Association or the Regular Forces Employment Association. There are also various regimental associations, for example RAJA (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer (REME) Association Job Agency) who provide further help for former soldiers of certain regiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.6/4">In addition, the MOD has been working closely with the Department for Work and Pensions and armed forces champions have been appointed that aim to ensure Jobcentre Plus staff are providing the correct advice and support, not only to families of our armed forces but also to former service personnel.</p>

Reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and compulsory redundancy over the four-year planning round period. Initial numbers and profiles will be established over the next few months and refined in subsequent planning rounds. It is therefore too early to judge the effects on specific locations of the planned reductions in the number of Royal Navy personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.378W.3/1">The procedures for placing a Royal Navy warship into extended readiness vary depending on the length of time the platform is planned to be at this readiness level and the future plans for the vessel. The Surface Ship Support Alliance (SSSA) manage the work required to place warships in extended readiness through agreement between its members: the Ministry of Defence, Babcock Marine and BAE Systems Surface Ships.</p>
	<p pid="a.378W.3/2">The most recent warship to be placed in extended readiness was HMS Invincible. The work to prepare her for extended readiness took place during 2005-06 and cost &#163;2.5 million. The cost of keeping her in extended readiness is estimated at approximately &#163;52,000 a year. It is important to note that as HMS Invincible is an aircraft carrier at the end of her service life, these costs cannot be considered representative of the average cost of placing or keeping any other Royal Naval ship in extended readiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.378W.3/3">Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review announcement, further work is under way to identify the package of work required to ensure that ships placed in extended readiness in 2011-12 are maintained in the appropriate condition. It is not possible to say with any accuracy the level of manpower resource needed to support the Royal Navy ships in extended readiness until this is complete.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.5/1">The spending review announced a package of reforms to reduce the deficit while supporting the most vulnerable. This included withdrawing child benefit from families with a higher rate taxpayer, and using some of savings to fund above-indexation increases in the child tax credit. As a result, the spending review will have no measurable impact on child poverty in the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="a.385W.5/1">The Government have frozen the basic and 30 hour elements of working tax credit, reduced the proportion of child care costs that can be claimed from 80% to 70%, and changed the working hours rule so that couples with children have to work 24 hours between them to be eligible for working tax credit. To ensure support is better targeted at low income families with children, some of the savings from these measures have been recycled into increases to the child tax credit in 2011-12 and 2012-13 such that there is no measurable negative impact on child poverty.</p>
