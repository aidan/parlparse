The details of his qualifications and career in the House of Commons Service are available in a number of reference books. In common with other Accounting Officers, he has undertaken the centrally provided training given to Accounting Officers on their appointment. He is assisted in the discharge of his Accounting Officer responsibilities by appropriately qualified and experienced staff in the Directorate of Financial Management.</p>

The purpose of these meetings is to keep under continual review all matters relating to the steel barrier, with a particular emphasis on operating guidelines and the health, safety and welfare of staff operating the system. It was through this process that the issue of improved clothing was identified, and is being provided following discussions with uniform specialists within the Metropolitan Police Service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1574W.8/1">I understand that the overall hours worked at the Corus barriers by police and security officers are in line with other posts where there is limited protection from the elements. It is not the practice to give rostering details of security staff. These working arrangements continue to be discussed between the security team management and those representing both police and security officers. The Commission has not received any representations from either the Police Federation or others on this matter. Recognising the nature of these duties, the parliamentary authorities have been very supportive of reducing the operating hours of the scheme where possible; for example, during each parliamentary recess.</p>

The United Nations Development Programme is already providing modest support for this and it will be important to ensure that any DFID funding complements and does not duplicate existing funding. On this point, the DFID office is currently taking forward discussions with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). DFID's response will depend upon the outcome of these discussions.</p>

The Bill is expected to bring savings for business of some &pound;250 million a year, of which &pound;100 million will be for small businesses.

	<p pid="c.1578W.3/22">With the exception of British Energy, there have been no public subsidies to the nuclear generating sector since privatisation. In terms of British Energy, a loan facility was provided to the company in 2002 to support it through its restructuring. This loan was re-paid in full with interest in December 2003 and no further drawings can be made. As a result of the restructuring which completed in January 2005, the Government have taken direct financial responsibility for BE's historic spent fuel liabilities. The following payments have been made since restructuring to meet those historic spent fuel liabilities:</p>
	<p pid="c.1578W.3/23" class="indent">2004-05&mdash;&pound;185 million;</p>
	<p pid="c.1578W.3/24" class="indent">2005-06&mdash;&pound;189 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1578W.3/25">The Government are also underwriting British Energy's decommissioning fund to the extent that its liabilities outweigh its assets. In return, the company is making enhanced payments into the fund. On current valuations, the assets of the fund exceed the liabilities.</p>

The widening of these sections will be phased over approximately 10 years, scheduled to commence in 2008. The phasing of the works is to be determined with the successful bidder.

	<p pid="c.1589W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had no discussions with her US counterparts regarding proposals to crop-spray in Afghanistan. The Government of Afghanistan's eradication policy, as set out in the National Drug Control Strategy, is based on ground based eradication targeted where there is access to legal rural livelihoods. The UK has no plans to undertake or support aerial eradication.</p>
	<p pid="c.1589W.3/2">Eradication on its own will not solve the drugs problem in Afghanistan. It is a useful deterrent where there is access to legal livelihoods. But tackling the drugs trade requires a range of activities including arresting and convicting the traffickers who profit from the trade, and putting in place the development programmes which enable farmers to move away from growing poppy. That is why the UK is spending &pound;270 million over a three-year period on supporting the Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.1589W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has a number of programmes which seek to provide economic alternatives to farmers who grow poppy in Helmand Province. When in Afghanistan last week, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development announced a UK contribution of &pound;30 million over the next three years in Helmand. However, whether farmers choose to pursue alternative livelihoods to poppy in Helmand also depends on effective law enforcement and a credible threat of eradication. That is why the UK is supporting the multifaceted approach set out in the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy. We believe that the focus on the four key priorities&mdash;targeting the trafficker, strengthening livelihoods, reducing demand and developing effective institutions will together have a greater impact on the drug trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.1589W.6/2">In terms of measuring the impact of the Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy in changing farmers' behaviour, Afghanistan has a poorly developed data collection and management system. DFID is working closely with the Central Statistics Office of the Government of Afghanistan to put in place mechanisms to ensure we are able to do this. These efforts should start to bear fruit over the next few months. This will allow us to make more robust assessments about the progress we are seeing in changing the behaviour of those farmers that currently grow poppy.</p>

I understand from the corporation that savings stamps will remain redeemable from TV Licensing without limit of time.

In addition to the Department's 'Sex and Relationship Education Guidance' (2000) which includes guidelines on the coverage of sexual health issues, all teachers of SRE are encouraged to undertake the Government funded certificate in personal social and health education (PSHE). The certificate supports standards in the delivery of PSHE teaching including sex and relationship education and is also open to community nurses. To date, over 2,000 teachers and nurses have been certificated under the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1635W.8/2">The Department has also recently announced the launch of a subject association for PSHE. The association will provide a central support network for teachers giving them a focal point to receive advice, gather and share examples of good practice and promote existing guidance, on all areas of PSHE, including SRE and sexual health.</p>
	<p pid="c.1635W.8/3">In 2006-07, the National Healthy Schools programme, a key programme for driving up standards in PSHE, will also benefit from increased funding (&pound;12.4 million). Healthy Schools must demonstrate that they have a sex and relationship education programme in line with DfES guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1635W.8/4">Teachers have also been given a package of support from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. This has included guidance on assessment to help schools evaluate what young people are learning through PSHE as well as units of work on SRE.</p>

The number and size of the bonuses available each year therefore vary according to performance of staff and to the budget available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1642W.5/2">The increase in the overall value in bonuses awarded in 2005-06 as compared with previous years is due to an increase in the value of non-consolidated performance bonuses paid to non-industrial staff below senior civil service level as a result of the 2005-06 pay settlement. This reflects Government pay policy to reward higher in-year performance through the award of non-consolidated bonuses.</p>

The remainder comprises Management Development (&pound;6,669,954) and Sectoral Development (&pound;273,150). These figures exclude funding to universities for ICT courses.

E-Skills, the Sector Skills Council for the IT industry, has carried out research into employer needs, supply and demand and emerging gaps and this analysis of skills gaps has been published. The Department has also commissioned E-Skills to carry out an additional specialist project which specifically focuses on the demand for graduates in the industry. Also Invest Northern Ireland has been jointly involved with the Department in providing projections of the number of graduates likely to be needed for forthcoming emerging employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1647W.2/17">Alongside this research, the Department in co-operation with the Association of Northern Ireland Colleges and local employers, is developing a short-term course for graduates from a variety of disciplines to enable them to avail themselves of increasing employment opportunities in the ICT sector. This will provide an immediate response to the ICT sector employers' concerns, while longer term need is determined.</p>
	<p pid="c.1647W.2/18">There are no plans to establish a dedicated fund to encourage growth in the ICT sector. Invest Northern Ireland already encourages the growth of the sector through a programme of support for indigenous companies and through foreign direct investment. In addition to this individual company support, Invest Northern Ireland also undertakes a number of sector specific initiatives to ensure the continued development of the ICT sector in Northern Ireland.</p>

Following an individual financial assessment to calculate how much each individual can afford to pay towards the cost of their care, it is entirely a matter for each individual and their advisors to decide how best to meet any charges. Current Northern Ireland legislation provides a 12-week disregard of the value of a residents home following permanent admission to a care home. I am not, however, proposing to promote amending legislation to exclude totally the value of a resident's family home from the assessment of each individual's resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.1658W.2/1">The following table shows the number of mortgage possession orders made in all London county courts in the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1658W.2/2">These figures do not indicate how many houses have been repossessed through the courts, since not all the orders will have resulted in the issue and execution of warrants of possession.</p>
	<p pid="c.1658W.2/3">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, county courts' jurisdictions are not coterminous with London borough boundaries, and therefore any single court's repossession actions are likely to relate to homes in a number of different boroughs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1664W.8/1">A key element of the Government's respect programme is to ensure that all communities see and expect a robust response to antisocial behaviour. We have introduced the necessary tools and powers and expect local authorities to use them where appropriate. This Government have introduced a mandatory antisocial behaviour and respect outcome to all local area agreements (LAAs) to ensure that local authorities monitor and act on public concerns over antisocial behaviour. From April 2007 all areas will be covered by such an agreement. The respect programme is also about empowering the public to hold their leaders to account and have their say about the issues that matter most to them. We will ensure that senior representatives of all crime and disorder reduction partnerships hold regular 'face the people' sessions to promote greater accountability and visibility in local services. The Government are committed to introducing a 'community call for action', a power that will give local communities a formal way to request and ensure that action is taken by the police, local authorities and others in response to persistent antisocial behaviour or community safety problems, where action is not already being taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1665W.3/1">The respect programme places the emphasis on local agencies to use the tools and powers they have been given to tackle antisocial behaviour and its causes. The Government are determined that people should be confident that their local agencies will respond appropriately to antisocial behaviour. The roll-out Neighbourhood Policing teams and the increase in the number of Police Community Support Officers mean that there are more resources than ever before on the streets to make this happen. This, coupled with new and existing powers, will mean that there is no excuse for inaction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1665W.3/2">Through the Respect Academy programme, we are also outlining clearly how important communications, accountability and visibility are for public services in tackling antisocial behaviour. Getting the public to make demands on local agencies for action on antisocial behaviour and disrespect is an important part of sustaining these changes. It is essential that the public feel empowered to play their part in tackling antisocial behaviour through greater awareness of the powers available to them and their local agencies. We want to encourage people to come forward, complain and take a stand. The Respect &quot;Taking A Stand&quot; awards and action days held nationwide will continue to stimulate public debate about acceptable behaviour and inform antisocial behaviour practitioners about local activities. We will also ensure that public services can be held to account and deliver on local priorities by introducing regular and systematic &quot;face the people&quot; briefing sessions, involving senior representation from the police and local authorities. Dudley metropolitan borough council (MBC) has taken a number of steps to ensure that action to tackle antisocial behaviour is well publicised throughout the borough. Dudley Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) publishes and distributes two quarterly newsletters, &quot;Dudley Together&quot; and &quot;Home Affairs&quot; to all households and tenants. The local press also publicises details of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) and dispersal notices and most Dudley MBC Neighbourhood Managers hold local community safety forums to inform the community about initiatives and on-going action to reduce antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.1668W.14/1">The Home Office has made &pound;32.5 million capital funding available to the Police Service over a two-year period (2005-07) for the development of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR). This investment addresses the fight against serious and organised crime, terrorism, volume crime and road traffic offending.</p>
	<p pid="c.1668W.14/2">The Home Office has commissioned an independent evaluation of the national roll out of ANPR that is due for publication shortly. The report covers a period when ANPR is being mainstreamed in all police forces within England and Wales. The evaluation is expected to show that benefits have accrued as forces gain experience of operating ANPR in conjunction with the National Intelligence Model to target the detection and prevention of crime. Evidence from the previous 'Project Laser' pilot evaluations concluded that officers involved in ANPR achieve more arrests and contribute more offences brought to justice than those involved in general policing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1668W.14/3">The ANPR Evaluation Report is due for publication in July 2006 and will be circulated to ANPR stakeholders and a copy will be placed on the Home Office website. (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>)</p>

	<p pid="c.1669W.2/1">The Home Office has taken a number of steps to benefit biodiversity. A national Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) has been introduced across the public sector operated prisons estate, primarily an overarching document covering its designated sites, which encompass seven SSSIs, one NNR and RAMSAR site and a site within a National Park (HMP Dartmoor). There are now six individual designated sites which have their own BAPs, a further 11 locally biodiversity significant sites also have BAPs and a pilot scheme for eight inner-city/urban BAPs is being implemented. Further plans are now being incorporated that will see biodiversity management plans rolled out across the remaining public sector prison estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.2/2">As well as a BAP network the public sector Prison Service has in place a Statement of Commitment for biodiversity and a Statement of Action for biodiversity which were signed by the director general Phil Weatley in March 2003. Also supporting this the Prison Service has set up a strategic biodiversity group which involves a &quot;central partnership&quot; incorporating representatives from English Nature, the Wildlife Trusts, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.2/3">In support of this work the Prison Service has carried out biological surveys at 21 biodiversity significant sites to identify local flora and fauna for action. The service has now put in place over 43 habitat and species action plans involving over 20 separate lead partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.2/4">In recognition of the work that has been carried out on the prison estate operated by the public sector, in 2005 the Prison Service won the Liveable City award for biodiversity. The Sustainable Development Commission has commended these examples of biodiversity good practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.1675W.5/2">We are not aware of there being any safe houses specifically for accommodating victims of child trafficking. However, there are accommodation facilities in many locations that will cater for children in need who it is believed may have been trafficked. Planning for children's services is carried out on a locality basis throughout the UK. It is the statutory duty of local authorities under the 1989 Children Act to ensure that safe arrangements are in place to look after individual children at risk, including children from abroad.</p>
	<p pid="c.1675W.5/3">It is also the responsibility of the local authority to assess any risk of harm and to arrange for the provision of a suitable range of accommodation for all the children in their area. Any lone child in the UK in contact with any statutory or child welfare agency will be urgently referred to the appropriate local authority. The Home Office National Asylum Support Service (NASS) reimburses local authorities who receive unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC) into their care with a total of &pound;140 million p.a. Partnership plans to provide safer arrangements for children who have been trafficked are being incorporated in a Home Office/DfES joint review of how local authorities accommodate children from abroad.</p>
	<p pid="c.1675W.5/4">The review will aim to deliver improvements by ensuring UASCs are placed in local authority areas where specialist services are in place&mdash;including local authority social workers who can recognise and deal appropriately with UASCs who may have been trafficked to the UK. The review is also designed to increase specialisation, end inconsistencies in treatment and enable the retention and development of expertise.</p>

	<p pid="c.1677W.11/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has no current plans to visit any Invest to Save Budget (ISB) projects or to make a statement. However, he strongly supports the objectives of the ISB programme to create sustainable improvements in the capacity to deliver public services in a more joined-up manner. An example of a project that has continued to receive funding from the Home Office is the joint working pilot between the National Missing Persons Helpline and the Metropolitan police from ISB round four.</p>

We are also working closely with community organisations, providing support through the Connected Fund for gun, knife and gang related projects and supporting organisations such as Be Safe, which runs a programme of education for young people on the risks of carrying knives.</p>

	<p pid="c.1680W.0/1">No central guidance was in operation in 1994 concerning the storage and destruction of information relating to detected crimes. Forces were, however, subject to the relevant legislation that was in place at that time and may have issued their own internal guidance. A Code of Practice on the Management of Police Information (MOPI) was published in July 2005 and came into effect in November 2005. This requires police information to be periodically reviewed and consideration given to its disposal or retention in line with criteria set out in guidance. Guidance to accompany the Code of Practice, agreed with the Information Commissioner, was published in March 2006. This requires that information be deleted where there is no longer a policing purpose for retaining it, i.e. it is no longer necessary; it is no longer adequate or up to date; or it is excessive or not proportionate to the risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.1680W.0/2">The guidance states that all records will normally be held for a minimum of six years, but lists a number of issues that forces should consider when deciding whether to retain records for longer. The MOP guidance states that historical data&mdash;which it defines as anything recorded prior to the date that the guidance came into effect&mdash;must be reviewed when the subject of a record comes to police attention, and that resources dedicated to reviewing other historical records should focus on information relating to certain public protection matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.1680W.0/3">Retention of information must also be in line with relevant legislation including the Human Rights Act 1998, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>

The report shows the reoffending rates within one year for juvenile offenders who receive pre-court disposals, non-custodial disposals and those released from custody in the first quarter of 2004. The results show a 3.8 per cent reduction in reoffending when compared with the same period in 1997 and a reduction of 1.4 per cent. when compared with 2000.

	<p pid="c.1682W.3/1">Most recent figures held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform on the number of defendants found guilty of shoplifting in the South Wales police force area in 2003 and 2004 are 1,671 for 2003 and 1,712 in 2004. The information requested on arrests is not available centrally. There are a number of ways in which private security offices may engage with local police forces. Usually this is through active involvement with crime reduction partnerships, many of which are tailored specifically to address the needs of the business sector. The Home Office has supported the work of the British Retail Consortium in developing business crime reduction partnerships, and has provided over &pound;900,000 of funding for them to set up and run the Action Against Business Crime (AABC) Group. This group provides central co-ordination and support for a national network of business crime reduction partnerships in town centres, shopping centres and industrial estates across England and Wales in their work to prevent business crime. The Home Office also encourages businesses to set up 'Business Watch' schemes in their area, or to consider involvement in the business improvement district (BID) scheme. There is an accredited Business Crime Partnership in the 'Safer Swansea' Community Safety Partnership. One of the first actions of the partnership was to set up a panel which included local businesses and independent members to consider whether those caught shoplifting should be banned from the city centre shopping area. The scheme has been successful and will be rolled out to other retail sites in the borough. Additionally, South Wales police have been actively promoting the ShopWatch scheme in Swansea, which encourages shop staff to train as special constables in their area of employment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1684W.6/1">Processing times for disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) claims have improved steadily over the last four years. For DLA, it has gone from 42 working days in 2002-03, to 34.5 working days in 2005-06. For AA claims, it has gone from 24.2 working days in 2002-03 to 17.9 working days in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="c.1686W.3/1">Our long-term strategy to meet the child poverty target remains as set out in 'Opportunity for all' and in the Child Poverty Review, which was published alongside the 2004 Spending Review White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/2">A consultation around measuring child poverty was published in 'Measuring Child Poverty' in December 2003. This outlines the Government's measure of UK child poverty for the long term and will be used to measure progress against the 2010 target.</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/3">This consists of:</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/4" class="indent">Absolute low income&mdash;to measure whether the poorest families are seeing their incomes rise in real terms;</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/5" class="indent">Relative low income&mdash;to measure whether the poorest families are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/6" class="indent">Material deprivation and low income combined&mdash;to provide a wider measure of people's living standards and includes a higher low-income threshold of 70 per cent. of median income.</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/7">From next year, we will be collating those material deprivation figures. The material deprivation tier will not only give a wider measure of people's living standards, but it will also capture elements of persistent and severe poverty, as highlighted in the final conclusions of the child poverty consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.3/8">We remain firmly committed to our challenging goals to halve and then eradicate child poverty, and we are not resting on our laurels. We are currently re-examining our strategy for meeting the 2010 target, including a reinforcement of our labour market policies, complemented by increases in tax credits, and further improvements in public services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1686W.6/5" class="indent">In March 2006, there were around 304,000 cases that had yet to receive an assessment or calculation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.6/6" class="indent">Please note that this number is different from the total number of cases waiting to be cleared, which stood at 333,000 in March 2006. This is because new scheme cases are only considered cleared when they have received a calculation and have a payment schedule in place. In March 2006, there were around 29,000 new scheme cases that had received a calculation, but were awaiting a payment schedule.</p>
	<p pid="c.1686W.6/7" class="indent">Although the total volume of uncleared cases fell by 8% between January 2005 and March 2006, the Agency recognises that this remains unacceptably high. The Agency therefore has a 2006/07 target to ensure that, by March 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25%.</p>

	<p pid="c.1687W.2/1">There is no provision for applying for transfer from the old to the new child support schemes and for that reason information is not available. Legislation only allows transfer if a case has prescribed links to a new scheme application.</p>
	<p pid="c.1687W.2/2">The cost of transfer would depend on the volume of cases transferred, which in turn will be impacted by the date of transfer. This is because old scheme cases are continuously reducing in number as a result of both natural attrition and reactive (linked case) conversion.</p>

	<p pid="c.1693W.2/1">Since its introduction in April 2000, the only significant change that has occurred to New Deal 50 plus funding was in April 2003 when the New Deal 50 plus Employment Credit, paid by Jobcentre Plus, was replaced by the 50 plus element of the Working Tax Credit, paid by H.M. Revenue and Customs. Incorporating the in-work incentive for over- 50s into the tax credit system ensured that those households on the lowest income received the most support, rather than flat-rate payments being made regardless of personal circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1693W.2/2">Until March 2003, Employment Credit payments formed the bulk of the New Deal 50 plus programme spend, together with the New Deal 50 plus in-work Training Grant. In 2003-04 the programme spend for New Deal 50 plus still included the remaining Employment Credit payments but, by the 2004-05 financial year, all the New Deal 50 plus Employment Credit starts had completed and all that remained was the spend on the training grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1693W.2/3">Centrally recorded data on starts to the New Deal 50 plus programme are only available from January 2004 onwards. Information before this is not available as the data were not centrally held.</p>
	<p pid="c.1693W.2/4">From the start of the programme to February 2006, New Deal 50 plus has been successful in helping more than 150,000 people into jobs.</p>

We are committed to rolling out Pathways to Work across the country by 2008. We will also seek to ensure our proposals deliver the service in innovative and more cost-effective ways as we roll out to the rest of the country, learning from the experience of Jobcentre Plus and the private and voluntary sector. We are currently working through the specific detail of the funding plans for Pathways, which we will share more widely in due course.</p>

The data source is the Family Resources Survey.  3. As pension credit was introduced mid-way through 2003-04, estimates of the numbers entitled in 2003-04 are only based on six months' data, and should therefore be treated with caution.  4. For the purposes of this analysis, the unit of analysis is the benefit unit. This is either a single person aged at least 60 years old or, if a couple, both will be termed pensioners if one is aged at least 60 years old. This is consistent with both the definition used in &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-up&quot; publications, and with the fact any individual aged 60 or over is entitled to pension credit.  5. The data source for eligibility estimates is the Family Resources Survey. Estimates of eligibility for 2005-06 and 2006-07 are based on the Family Resources Survey data for 2003-04 and 2004-05, with incomes and benefits projected forward into the future in order to estimate the eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey. They are calibrated to the 2004-05 National Statistics estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting.  6. The latest estimates of the take-up of pension credit can be found in the DWP report entitled &quot;Pension Credit Estimates of Take-Up in 2004/2005&quot;. Copies of the publication are available in the Library.  7. Estimates have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.  8. Projections of eligibility may be adjusted following publication of future editions of the National Statistics take-up estimates.</td> </tr>

Defined-benefit schemes are schemes where all the benefits (other than benefits secured by additional voluntary contributions) are on a defined-benefit basis. Such benefits are most commonly based on factors such as earnings or length of service. The survey does not separately identify final salary schemes, which are a type of defined-benefit scheme  3. Estimates include both open and closed schemes.  4.

	<p pid="c.1699W.2/1">We offer support to offenders in a number of ways to improve their job prospects. Employment and benefit surgeries in prisons provide prisoners with interviews with Jobcentre Plus advisers prior to release to discuss employment and training opportunities. Our Freshstart programme guarantees a pre-arranged interview for prisoners who wish to claim Jobseeker's Allowance as soon as possible on release at which jobs, training and benefits are discussed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1699W.2/2">Offenders, together with others facing the most severe disadvantage in the labour market, are included in one of the priority groups within the Jobcentre Plus target and performance structure. This ensures our advisers are encouraged to provide particular help and support to people who have additional barriers to work. Because of their disadvantage in the labour market, offenders can also gain early entry into our new deal programme, which can provide them with the training and skills needed to get a job.</p>
	<p pid="c.1699W.2/3">Our progress2work LinkUP programme is designed to help those with multiple disadvantage, including offenders and ex-offenders, overcome the particular employment barriers they face. Jobcentre Plus advisers and other relevant agencies refer customers to specialist providers who work with prisons and local probation services to encourage offenders to make use of their services. The programme helps people get and sustain employment and is currently available in 15 Jobcentre Plus districts. We expect provision to be available in a further six districts by the end of the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1699W.2/4">In partnership with the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills, the December 2005 Green Paper, 'Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment', announced proposals for further work. For example, working with local employers to help offenders into jobs, and supporting Jobcentre Plus to focus on helping offenders into work rather then placing them on benefits.</p>

	<p pid="c.1700W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus in the South West Region do not currently operate a hotline for the Social Fund.

	<p pid="c.1700W.5/5" class="indent">Customers living in Gloucestershire who want to apply in person for a payment from the Social Fund normally approach their local Jobcentre office in the first instance. Staff at the Jobcentre will then telephone the Social Fund team in South Bristol. There are 10 extensions available for Jobcentre Plus staff to call, however if staff have problems getting through the customer may be given the direct telephone number to try again later.</p>
	<p pid="c.1700W.5/6" class="indent">Although direct calls to these numbers by customers is not free there are plans to introduce 0800 and 0845 numbers in 2007 as part of the centralisation of Social Fund work.</p>

	<p pid="c.1701W.5/3">Our recently published Green Paper 'A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work' sets out our Cities Strategy proposals for piloting new initiatives to help local organisations work together to improve economic regeneration through skills, employment and health. From 2007, the 'Cities' pathfinders will be charged with increasing employment and reducing social exclusion in our most deprived communities. Each area will be asked to develop a consortium with a shared interest in working together to raise employment rates and improve the economy. This may include local authorities, employers, learning and skills councils, regional development agencies, primary care trusts and Jobcentre Plus. The key aim of this initiative will be to provide solutions that offer the maximum degree of flexibility, so that local areas can provide local solutions to local problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1701W.5/4">This approach will provide a real focus for local efforts to help people move back into work, so that the current patchwork of programmes and support, provided by a number of organisations can be delivered in a more integrated, individually-focused and locally responsive way.</p>

	<p pid="c.1702W.2/1">Our welfare to work programmes have been successful in substantially reducing youth unemployment and, since 1997, long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated. In addition, youth claimant unemployment is close to its lowest level for 30 years. In Hartlepool, youth unemployment has been cut by 32 per cent. since 1997 and long-term youth unemployment by 75 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1702W.2/2">Our New Deal for Young People programme continues to contribute to this success, having already helped more than 666,000 young people into work, including 2,320 in Hartlepool, 84 per cent. of whom have gained sustained employment.</p>
