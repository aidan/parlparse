Part of this must also be about developing a CAP that is simpler, and reducing the administrative burden on farmers from unnecessary regulation. Negotiations on CAP will begin formally in the context of a communication which we expect to be published by the European Commission later this month. I look forward to working with my counterparts in the EU and devolved Administrations in order to further the simplification agenda as part of these negotiations.</p>

In 2009, seven treatment sites in England and Wales processed 1,594,962 refrigeration units (both household and non-household) for ozone-depleting substances.

Member for Glasgow South (Mr Harris)</phrase> by the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-08">8 November 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-08.108"><i> Official Report</i>, column 108W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.6/2">No specific assessments have been undertaken to estimate the contribution of the use of LPG as a domestic fuel to meeting air quality requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.6/3">Indicatively, LPG is used domestically as a cost-effective alternative to coal or gasoil predominately in rural areas, which are not connected to the gas grid. Emission calculations using the 2008 UK inventory for domestic sector emissions, found switching from LPG to either gasoil or burning oil has a negligible effect across all pollutants, with very small increases in emissions of sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. These calculations also showed that switching to coal from LPG would increase emissions for the majority of pollutants. If all the domestic energy produced using LPG was completely substituted by coal, increases in UK emissions would be observed; 4% for PM10, 3% for PM2.5, 3% for CO, 2% for SO2 and 1% for volatile organic compounds with a negligible effect on other pollutants.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.6/4">The majority of domestic LPG use takes place in rural areas where areas of exceedences of the limit values stipulated in legislation do not occur. The pollutants which are monitored as part of the Gothenburg Protocol and the National Emissions Ceiling Directive which the UK needs to reduce in order to meet its emissions ceiling are much lower when LPG is used compared to coal. However, the domestic sector is a small contributor.</p>

EADS has now supplied the Department for Communities and Local Government with a further draft plan which would allow roll-out to start early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.352W.9/4">My officials received an updated proposal from EADS regarding the solution for routing fire appliances to incidents. Many of the problems highlighted by the Secretary of State would not be satisfactorily resolved under this proposal, including, for example, reliable and consistent use of the dimensions of the fire appliance in setting a suitable route and easy adjustment of the recommended route if the crew on board find an unexpected blockage.</p>
	<p pid="b.352W.9/5">The issue with the gazetteer information showing West Yorkshire addresses as located in Wakefield appears to have been resolved by an EADS software maintenance release. However there is now a significant problem with this product in the way it handles FRS changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.353W.2/1">The onus is on individual fire and rescue authorities to consider strategies to mitigate the effect of increased levels of traffic, which research has shown to be the main factor accounting for increased response times. That will include liaising with partners such as local authorities and the Highways Agency, and applying locally appropriate measures such as green wave traffic light systems, GPS and improved local knowledge of fire crews, and use of secondary fire vehicles and reduced response to low risk incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.2/2">Response target-setting is a matter for individual fire and rescue authorities under Integrated Risk Management Planning (IRMP), according to local requirements and circumstances, and is not something that central government should direct or determine. The government has no plans to reintroduce national standards for fire and rescue service response times. Decisions made by local politicians and practitioners according to local circumstances will be more effective than blanket requirements across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.2/3">However, if the service chose to place consistent standards upon itself, then equally that is not something that central Government would seek to intervene in.</p>

	<p pid="b.366W.3/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) published service standards (PSS) are that 90% of enhanced CRB checks are issued within 28 days. The CRB received 326,401 in the month of September 2010. Of these 238,402 (87% against the 90% PSS) were processed within the PSS and 88,359 were issued outside the PSS by one day or more.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.3/2">The length of time a CRB check can take to process can include &quot;time out with customer&quot;. This occurs when the CRB has to contact the registered body (RB) for additional information about the applicant, when the application form has not been completed correctly or where the police require additional clarification about the applicant's identity. The CRB cannot continue to process the application until the RB provides this information; or the applicant resolves any question of identity to the satisfaction of the police force.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.3/3">There are a number of other factors that can affect the timely completion of CRB checks, including but not restricted to the length of time it can take for an employer to deal with the initial application; the accurate completion of the application form; the clarity of the information provided; the existence of conviction or non-conviction information; any ongoing or outstanding criminal investigations or proceedings; where more than one force holds relevant information and the operational effectiveness of the disclosure units of the police forces involved in the CRB checking process.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.3/4">The CRB have been working with police forces through joint operational performance reviews, to address the problems associated with delays and the impact that exceptional demand for CRB checks can have on police forces. The CRB has set up improvement plans with those forces that have been having problems meeting the demand for certificates. This is aimed at maintaining a steady output of applications on the system while also reducing the number of outstanding cases that have been with police forces for more than 25 days.</p>

	<p pid="b.372W.5/1">Voluntary organisations will continue to make a vital contribution to health and care, not only as the providers of services but also as advocates, partners in the co-design of services and involving and engaging local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.5/2">Voluntary organisations have valuable expertise, insight and experience that can improve local public services, often for the most excluded people in our communities. The voluntary sector is well placed to support commissioners in developing needs assessments and commissioning guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.5/3">Current examples of voluntary sector involvement include Mumsnet who have been particularly valuable in helping to shape maternity services and Turning Point on the Connected Care Audit.</p>

We plan to ensure that commissioners and providers across health care, public health and social care are able to harness the potential role of voluntary sector organisations in communities-helping to build strong and resilient communities as part of the big society.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.5/5">Commissioning consortia will be able to decide which commissioning activities they undertake for themselves and where they will choose to buy in expertise and support from external organisations, including from voluntary sector organisations. Voluntary organisations could potentially strengthen the process of public and patient engagement and needs assessment through their knowledge and understanding of local people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.5/6">As part of the reforms, we aim to free up provision of health care, so that in most sectors of care, any willing provider can provide services that meet national health service standards within NHS prices, giving patients greater choice and ensuring effective competition stimulates innovation, improves quality and increases productivity. We will look across government and public procurement to make sure that charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises have maximum opportunities to offer health and care services.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.5/7">We are committed to promoting continuous improvement in the quality of services for patients and greater opportunities for the involvement of voluntary providers in offering more responsive and personalised services.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.5/8">We are aware that this period of transition will be worrying for voluntary organisations. We are keen, therefore, that primary care trusts (PCTs) engage with all of their stakeholders during this transition period. This includes working in close partnership with all organisations that they hold funding agreements with through both grant and contract arrangements, recognising the principles of the Compact.</p>

	<p pid="b.373W.5/1">The spending review recognises the importance of social care in protecting most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/2">We have achieved this by:</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/3" class="indent">the national health service transferring some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will rise to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15, and will promote improved joint working between the health and social care systems. Further details will be set out in the NHS Operating Framework 2011-12; and</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/4" class="indent">additional grant funding, rising to &#163;1 billion by 2014-15, will be made available for social care. This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the revenue support grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/5">I recently attended the National Children and Adult Social Care Conference where I met with 11 members and directors of Adult Social Care to discuss the impact of the Government's decision to prioritise social care in the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.373W.5/6">Pressures on my diary mean that I am unable to accept the request for a meeting, but if the hon. Member or representatives from West Sussex county council have any questions about the spending review settlement, I would welcome correspondence on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.3/1">The primary role of the Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network (AAN) is to promote greater employer engagement with apprenticeships. I welcome the contribution which the AAN gives to the apprenticeship programme, both as our eyes and ears in respect of the quality of apprenticeships and the delivery system; and as ambassadors to encourage others to offer apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/2">In this time of fiscal restraint, it is both important and powerful to have such blue chip businesses and business leaders championing apprenticeships to employers, and therefore the role of the AAN becomes increasingly important. The AAN has provided valuable advice and feedback to Ministers and others since its creation in 2006. Issues covered have included:</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/3" class="indent">the skills strategy and the contribution of apprenticeships;</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/4" class="indent">apprenticeship framework design, content and levels of qualification;</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.3/10" class="indent">online vacancy matching service; and</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/11" class="indent">progression to HE.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/12">This is achieved through Ministers attending AAN meetings at which employer engagement and policy issues are discussed, Ministers and senior officials speaking at events hosted by members, correspondence and meetings on specific issues and the AAN responding to BIS and other consultation exercises. The feedback of the AAN helps to ensure that the programme is fit for purpose, that numbers increase and quality continues to improve.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.3/13">The AAN has also commissioned work in two important areas to inform the policy debate; the net benefit to employer investment in apprenticeships (IER 2008) and a comparative international study of apprenticeships (CEP, 2010). These reports, alongside details of the AAN's work and membership, minutes of meetings, consultation responses, letters and speeches are all published on the AAN website: <a href="http://www.employersforapprentices.gov.uk">www.employersforapprentices.gov.uk</a>.

	<p pid="b.376W.0/1">The Medical Research Council (MRC) has funded basic research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) since the late 1970s. The MRC continues to fund research across the spectrum from basic biological studies through to applied clinical research.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.0/2">In the last three years, MRC expenditure on TSE was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.0/3" class="indent">2007/08: &#163;6.8 million</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.0/4" class="indent">2008/09: &#163;8.9 million</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.0/5" class="indent">2009/10 : &#163;9.9 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.0/6">Much of this research is conducted by the MRC Prion Unit, an international centre of excellence focussing principally on human prion disease, as well as through other TSE researchers working in universities throughout the UK. As this research is still ongoing, it is too early to report on outcomes. MRC welcomes proposals in all areas of TSE research and particularly in the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutics. In addition, MRC encourages TSE research that may also inform on the basic mechanisms of other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

We will consult students and university organisations on the details. We will look to increase the leverage of Government funding by getting matched contributions from universities. Our current preference is for universities to offer scholarships to targeted students-including the principal beneficiaries of the pupil premium-that would mean at least their first year is free. Other attractive ideas include expanding the model of a foundation year for young people with high potential but lower qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.5/2"><i> </i>The Government are committed to the progressive nature of the repayment system. It is therefore important that those on the highest incomes post graduation are not able unfairly to buy themselves out of this progressive system by paying off their loans early. We will consult on potential early repayment mechanisms-similar to those paid by people who pre-pay their mortgages. These mechanisms would need to ensure that graduates on modest incomes who strive to pay off their loans early through regular payments are not penalised. For example, a 5% levy might be charged on additional repayments each year over a specified amount such as &#163;1,000 or &#163;3,000. Alternatively, those on higher incomes (eg over &#163;60,000) who made an additional repayment could be required to pay a 5% levy on this sum. We will consult with students, universities, higher education bodies and other experts.</p>

	<p pid="b.390W.2/3">The industrial implications of the key strategic defence and security review choices were given careful consideration, but we have not made a specific assessment of the impact on the aeronautical industry of the decision to proceed with the Carrier Variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, rather than the STOVL version. However, UK companies have a significant interest in the overall Joint Strike Fighter programme, including the carrier and Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variants.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.14/1">We deeply regret all civilian casualties. Protecting the Afghan civilian population is a cornerstone of the international security assistance force's (ISAF) mission, and all British troops undergo comprehensive training on the strict rules of engagement. Where incidents do occur procedures are in place to ensure they are promptly reported to the chain of command and follow up actions take place in accordance with ISAF and UK national procedures. This contrasts directly with the attitude of the insurgents, whose indiscriminate use of suicide bombs, roadside explosive devices and human shields cause the majority of civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan. We will continue our efforts to prevent insurgents harming civilians and to develop the capacity of Afghan security forces to protect the population.</p>

	<p pid="b.403W.5/1">The Government recognise that treatment is essential if we are to tackle the social and health costs caused by drugs. In prisons, a comprehensive framework of drug treatment is in place to address the drug needs of offenders, comprising clinical services, psychosocial interventions, case management and through care services. The Integrated Drug Treatment System (IDTS) is bringing improvements to the quality of prison treatment and is due to be rolled out to all adult prisons in England by March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.5/2">However, we believe more needs to be done to offer offenders the opportunity to get off drugs for good and into a position where they can stop offending and make a proper contribution to society. To achieve this we will run pilots to pay contractors by results to rehabilitate offenders with drug problems, launch drugs recovery wing pathfinders in a number of prisons and explore alternative forms of residential, treatment-based accommodation for offenders with drugs problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.5/3">These plans will be outlined in more detail in our Green Paper on Sentencing and Rehabilitation, which will be published for consultation shortly.</p>
