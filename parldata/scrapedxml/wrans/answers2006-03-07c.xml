	<p pid="c.1239W.8/1">No assessment has been made centrally. The Department has issued guidance which makes it clear that, under the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, a carer's assessment must include a consideration of whether the carer works or wishes to work, or is undertaking or wishes to undertake any educational training. It is for local authorities to ensure that they include these considerations in their assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1242W.9/1">No assessment has been carried out centrally. It is for primary care trusts in partnership with strategic health authorities, local authorities and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of services for children with dysfluency.</p>

	<p pid="c.1243W.5/1">To minimise abuse and neglect of older people, the Department has been active in promoting better and more consistent standards of care through the publication and implementation of the national service framework for older people and the introduction of national minimum standards (NMS) for a range of services provided to older people in their own homes or in care settings. Employers in regulated social care services have a statutory duty to ensure the safety of older people by training staff to prevent service users from being harmed or being placed at risk of harm.</p>
	<p pid="c.1243W.5/2">We also expect local councils and providers of non-regulated social care to comply by No Secrets&quot;, a statutory guide for developing a multi-agency framework for prevention and investigation of abuse to vulnerable adults. No Secrets&quot;, jointly published by the Department and the Home Office in 2000, provides a complete definition of abuse and a framework for councils to work with the police, the national health service and regulators to tackle and prevent abuse occurring. It encourages councils to publicise their adult protection procedures so that all older people are aware of how to seek help if needed. No Secrets&quot; gives local councils the lead for development of adult protection committees. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1243W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase>, I announced that the General Social Care Council is undertaking a consultation on registering the social care work force. This will allow us to set standards for people seeking social care jobs and to take sanctions against people if they fall below those standards of registration. A well-trained and fully registered work force will enable older people, parents and children to have confidence in the people who care for them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1249W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.2/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) Sentinel programme, began in 2002 following formal Government procurement processes. The expected life of the programme is 10 years and to date has cost around &pound;19 million, which incorporates enhancements to the scope of the original programme. The MHRA is currently using Sentinel to handle all applications for marketing authorisations and variations, for clinical trial certificates and for import and export licences, as well as a range of internal corporate functions, and will soon extend Sentinel to pharmacovigilence, including new capabilities for signal generation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.2/3">Recently assessment approval times have lengthened, mainly due to delays in validating applications, and assessment targets are not being met in a proportion of cases although urgent cases are being processed promptly. Some technical problems were encountered when parts of the Sentinel programme were implemented, which is not unusual for a project of this complexity, but those have been or are being resolved. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. Sentinel's development is founded in its ability to handle electronic submissions and as industry increases its use of the external portal for this purpose, the workflow will be further streamlined.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.2/4">Sentinel completely revolutionises the MHRA's approach to information management and processing and will put the them in a leading position in its ability to handle electronic submissions, attract revenues from within and outside the United Kingdom and to remain a centre of excellence for medicines regulation. It will enable improved access to information to assist in the protection of public health and provide a better service to all its stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="c.1255W.12/1">There are no current economic sanctions or restrictions on sourcing goods from Burma and so it would be inappropriate for my Department to set special contract terms for goods made in Burma.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.12/2">Government policy on trade with Burma is to offer no support to British companies who want to trade there, informing those who inquire about trade with Burma of the grave political situation, the regime's atrocious record on human rights and record of economic mismanagement. This is in line with the common position on Burma adopted by the EU in 1996 and renewed in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.12/3">As far as I am aware there is no evidence to suggest that my Department has purchased any goods from Burma recently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.12/4">As far as policy on forestry is concerned, the Government are working closely with the NGO Global Witness on how best to protect Burma's forests. Their recent report, A Choice for China&quot; calls for a ban on illegally logged timber. It did not, however, support a ban on all timber from Burma in recognition of the complexity of the problem. Instead, Global Witness called for timber companies not to import illegally logged timber, and for the Chinese Government to suspend importation of logs and processed timber across the China-Burma border. This is pending a review of the legality of all logging operations in Kachin state. Global Witness's work has had a significant impact in Burma, and as a result of their highlighting this problem, the State Peace and Development Council and the Chinese Government have taken steps to clamp down on the illegal trade. According to Global Witness, the destructive logging and vast timber trade on the China-Burma border have come to a near halt over the past four months although it is not clear how permanent such moves will be.</p>

The indicative figure for Welsh participation in the youth competition was &pound;5,000, equating to the inclusion of one young climate champion from Wales. Discussions on the challenge fund focused largely on the principle of participation, with an indicative contribution for the duration of the fund of the order of &pound;300,000-&pound;500,000 based pro-rata on population.

	<p pid="c.1261W.0/1">The Government are aware of the problems associated with private sewers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/2">Few records are kept of private sewers and a breakdown of how many houses in each local authority connect to private sewers is not available. It is estimated that up to 50 per cent. of properties in England and Wales connect to private sewers in one form or another. Householders are often unaware that their property is connected to a private sewer or that they are responsible for its maintenance (sometimes jointly with others) until a problem occurs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/3">The Government have taken action to tackle the problems associated with private sewers in two stages. The first stage is designed to prevent the creation of further private sewers. A voluntary protocol for the construction of new sewers was introduced in April 2002 which detailed a build standard to make sewers suitable for adoption by water and sewerage companies (WaSCs). A recent review of the protocol conducted on behalf of Government by WS Atkins Consultants Ltd. (Atkins) found that less than 1 per cent. of developers were adhering to it. The Government are currently considering whether the protocol should therefore be mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/4">The second stage looks at existing private sewers. Research commissioned from Atkins formed the basis of a public consultation reviewing existing arrangements for private sewers and drains in England and Wales. The consultation sought views on a number of possible solutions to the problems they pose. The majority of respondents favoured transferring ownership of private sewers to WaSCs. The Government published their initial response to the consultation in October 2004, which summarised responses, gave the Government's preliminary views and set out the issues that needed to be addressed before a final decision is made.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/5">Defra held a seminar in January 2005 with over 90 relevant stakeholders to agree sustainable options for transferring ownership of private sewers and lateral drains. The information gathered through discussions at the seminar will inform the Government's final decision. Further information on the seminar is available on Defra's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/6">Defra also commissioned market research to explore customers' possible views on the transfer of private sewers. A qualitative customer survey comprised 20 focus groups across England and Wales and a final report explaining the findings is available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/industry/sewers/existing/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1261W.0/7">The Government intend to publish their decision on how to deal with existing private sewers and lateral drains in England and Wales in the next few months,, but do not rule out further consultation on implementation options should a decision be taken to transfer their ownership to WaSCs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1262W.8/1">The Sustainable Procurement Task force was set up in May 2005 under the Government's Sustainable Development Strategy. The Task Force, under the chairmanship of Sir Neville Simms, is a business led group reporting jointly to DEFRA's Secretary of State and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The Task Force will deliver a Sustainable Procurement National Action Plan to DEFRA and HM Treasury before the end of April 2006, enabling the UK Government to bring about a step change in public procurement such that, by 2009, it can meet the goal in the Sustainable Development Strategy of the UK being recognised as amongst the leaders in sustainable procurement across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.8/2">The Task Force is addressing five key themes: international benchmarking; data and priorities; engaging with the supply base; accountability; and capacity and is building on existing and previous initiatives in sustainable procurement. These include the Market Transformation Programme; the Sustainable Procurement Group; the Quick Wins list published jointly by DEFRA and the OGC; the joint note by the OGC and DEFRA on environmental issues in purchasing; the Framework for the Government Estate, which required every Department to have published a sustainable procurement strategy by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>; the work of the Sustainable Development Commission, Envirowise, WRAP and The Carbon Trust amongst others; the work of the Strategic Supply Chain Group; the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative and the Catering Services Toolkit; the UK's timber procurement policy; and, most recently, the OGC's note on Social Issues in Purchasing. The UK is leading work in the EU on green public procurement under the Environmental Technologies Action Plan. The UK is a member of the OECD Steering Group on Green Public Procurement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.8/3">DEFRA is working closely with its suppliers to ensure that products, equipment and services supplied to it are from approved recognised sustainable sources; has grouped its commodities and services into categories and is implementing a category management strategy; seeks every opportunity to work collaboratively with the NAO, the OGC and other public and private sector bodies to adopt and implement sustainable best practice. Two recent examples include the cross public sector travel procurement tender and the pan Government printed paper contract.

	<p pid="c.1266W.3/1">The new affordability tariff in Northern Ireland is being introduced in response to particular circumstances which do not apply in England and Wales. A parallel cannot be drawn which might warrant extending the scheme to England.</p>
	<p pid="c.1266W.3/2">Northern Ireland has a public sector water service and there are no household water and sewerage charges. The costs are instead met by local and national taxation. This is set to change in April 2007, when charges will be introduced for the first time. As no charges have been paid before, the Government decided to ease the transition towards full cost recovery, phasing in the charges gradually over a three-year period. The new affordability tariff in Northern Ireland will be based on income and set at a level equivalent to 3 per cent. of the single person's pension credit guarantee, as updated by Parliament each year. The status of the protection will be reviewed after three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1266W.3/3">The water industry in England and Wales is within the private sector and costs are met by charges to customers, a system which is long established. It is not appropriate to subsidise private water companies with taxpayers' money. Subsidies would reduce incentives for companies to improve their performance, and to be accountable to their customers.</p>

The criteria under which the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decides whether to prosecute cases is first whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and secondly, whether it is then in the public interest to proceed. The CPS took the view, having obtained advice from independent counsel, that the requirements of both these tests were fulfilled and it was therefore right for the case to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1279W.17/1">Crowding is measured on those services in the West Midlands which are specified by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (CENTRO) and operated by Central Trains. Central Trains count the number of passengers on each train serving Birmingham during the morning and evening peak on two occasions a year. Count data are available from 1999 onwards and the figures have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1279W.17/2">Franchises which are not covered by the Passengers in Excess of Capacity or Passenger Transport Executive capacity regimes are under a contractual obligation to plan their timetable in such a way as to manage passenger demand and prevent overcrowding being concentrated on one route.</p>

	<p pid="c.1280W.2/1">The number of serious personal injury road accidents on motorways and other dual carriageway roads in Great Britain has decreased year on year over the last five years. Casualty figures for 2004 show a 10 per cent. reduction in the number of serious accidents on motorways and a 21 per cent. reduction in the number of serious accidents on other dual carriageway roads, compared to the 1994&ndash;98 baseline averages. This is against a background of increases of 37 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively in the total billion vehicle kilometres travelled on these roads in 2004, compared to in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="c.1280W.2/2">Driving in excess of the speed limit amongst car drivers on motorways and non-urban dual carriageways has remained largely constant over the last five years. In 2004, 56 per cent. of cars exceeded the speed limit on motorways, and 48 per cent. on non-urban dual carriageways.</p>
	<p pid="c.1280W.2/3">Tackling excessive speed on all roads is a priority for the Government and we work closely with the police to ensure the safe and reliable operation of Great Britain's strategic road networks. For example, the roll out of the Highways Agency Traffic Officer service across England's motorway network is enabling more police time and resources to be used on core police activities, including speed enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="c.1283W.14/1">The location of deployments undertaken by elements of the Royal Logistics Corps (RLC), Royal Signals (R SIGNALS) and Royal Engineers (RE) over the past five years has been placed in the Library of the House. Such deployments are normally conducted at sub-unit level and below, and vary in duration and composition of personnel involved, some involving a number of short visits to theatre. While the length of time between such deployments (or 'Tour Intervals' (TI)) is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost, in general terms the average TI's for each Regiment is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="c.1283W.14/4"> <th></th> <th>Months</th> </tr>

			<tr pid="c.1283W.14/7"> <td>RLC</td> <td>29.3</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1283W.14/12">Of course, it is recognised that these are pinch point&quot; trades where the TI's are much shorter. Future Army structures will address these concerns by investing in trade groups that have been in high demand (such as engineers and logisticians), whilst restructuring the Army to better enable Brigade level operations, including ensuring that each deployable Brigade has its own integral enablers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1285W.11/1">The formal framework for discussions between the two Departments is set out in a Concordat, first signed by my predecessor and his Department of Health (DH) counterpart in 2002, and revised in 2005 to include the other UK Health Authorities, which sets out how the Defence Medical Services and the NHS will work together to further their individual and mutual aims of delivering high quality healthcare to both the UK armed forces and NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.1285W.11/2">A joint MOD/DH Partnership Board, co-chaired by senior MOD and DH personnel, meets three times a year to monitor the effectiveness of the Concordat and to explore mutual areas of co-operation. I am kept informed of the work of the Partnership Board. In 2005, the Partnership Board approved revised Health Guidance for the NHS covering, among other things, arrangements for the continuing care of service personnel on retirement or discharge from the armed forces. This guidance specifies that, for a very small group who have a significant and debilitating illness at the time of medical discharge, ;it is essential that the MOD is able to engage as soon as possible with the Primary Care Trust of future residence to ensure that there is a seamless transfer of care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1285W.11/3">The MOD has work in hand to ensure that there is a coherent response to veterans' mental health issues, co-ordinating inputs from the NHS, Health Departments throughout the UK, the Services and ex-Service organisations including the specialist mental health charity, Combat Stress. In support of these developments, MOD is also working on a number of in-Service initiatives, for example relating to the prevention and management of problems arising out of operational stress and to the need to address issues of stigma and discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="c.1286W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence is exceptional among employers in the extent to which it seeks to maintain contact with and offer support to those who have left service. The Veterans Agency is the focus for maintaining contact and provides a helpline service that offer advice or puts the veteran in touch with Government or non-Government agencies that can offer the assistance sought. Particular assistance is offered to those who are discharged for medical reasons and, where the condition is due to service, pensions may be payable from the War Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme attributable pension; contact is maintained with the leaver to establish eligibility and to ensure that the appropriate payments are made. Those in receipt of a War Pension are provided with practical advice and assistance from the War Pensions Welfare Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1286W.5/2">There are wider welfare arrangements in the event of death or serious injury and the Department also works closely with ex-Service organisations to support their work in providing assistance and advice to those who have left the armed forces, particularly where they have welfare needs. Assistance is provided to eligible Service personnel to identify employment opportunities after they have left the armed forces and this can be provided up to two years after discharge. More generally, we are proud of the achievements of our veterans and take a wide range of opportunities to celebrate their successes and to commemorate their sacrifices. We seek to involve veterans closely in these events.</p>

	<p pid="c.1290W.5/1">We are aware that migrant workers arriving in the United Kingdom to work in a range of industries may face difficulties in understanding their rights. We have offered to work with the Governments of all the new EU member states, to prepare bi-lingual know before you go&quot; leaflets for migrant workers seeking temporary work, giving advice on questions to ask before leaving the country and on legal protections offered to workers including details of the national minimum wage and agricultural minimum wage and the relevant helpline numbers. It is particularly important to reach workers in the host country before they leave as it is often much harder to help workers, who may not speak English and have no accommodation arranged, once they arrive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/2">To date we have produced leaflets in partnership with the Portuguese, Polish and Lithuanian Governments and are still in talks with other Governments. These benefited from input from the TUC, the CBI and other stakeholders and have been distributed widely in both the workers' home countries and the UK, for example via Citizen's Advice Bureaux. In Poland, for example, they have been publicised on television and our embassy and the Polish authorities have worked hard to distribute them via job centres, recruitment fairs and other channels. The text of the leaflets is also available on the DTI website:</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/3"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant_workers.htm">http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant_workers.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/4">We are currently updating the three leaflets to ensure they contain up to date information on, for example, national minimum wage rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/5">HMRC enforce the national minimum wage on behalf of the DTI. Each month HMRC select a sample of employers with workers from the new European Union accession countries who have registered under the Workers Registration Scheme. These employers are inspected to ensure that they are complying with the requirements of the national minimum wage legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/6">The Home Office also provide information to workers from EU accession countries. Nationals of the new member states (except Cyprus and Malta) working in the UK are subject to the Worker Registration Scheme. When subject to the scheme, they need to register with the Home Office if they plan to work for more than one month for an employer in the UK. Workers subject to registering with the Worker Registration Scheme receive information on employment rights as a matter of course. A leaflet setting out the rights and responsibilities of nationals from the new member states is available on the Home Office website:</p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/7"><a href="http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/schemes_and_programmes/worker_registration.Maincontent.0003.file.tmp/Home%20Office%20WRS%2020pp%PROOF.pdf">http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_ uk/en/homepage/schemes_and_programmes/worker_re gistration.Maincontent.0003.file.tmp/Home%20Office%20 WRS%2020pp%PROOF.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1290W.5/8">The Government's decision that nationals from these countries should have, subject to the registration requirements of the Worker Registration Scheme, access to the labour market and freedom to change employers should mean that they are significantly less vulnerable to exploitation than they were previously.</p>

	<p pid="c.1293W.0/2">The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) is wholly owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). NERC science budget allocation has doubled since 1997 to 334 million for this year, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the quality of environmental research in the UK. NERC is responsible for determining the details of how this funding is allocated to specific activities. NERC is currently considering the input from a wide consultation with stakeholders on proposals on how best CEH can contribute on a sustainable basis to UK environmental science in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.0/3">NERC has set out the criteria used in developing the proposals in the CEH Business Plan (available on the NERC website). The proposals were informed by assessments by an international peer review and a moderating panel, leading to recommendations to NERC Council from NERC's Science and Innovation Strategy Board. This included assessment of the science quality, value for money and the fit of the CEH science proposal to NERC's strategy. In addition, there was input from a strategic review of CEH conducted by independent consultants in 2005, which enabled NERC to estimate the likely level of future commissioned research income that CEH could expect to win. NERC also factored in the necessary level of future investment in the facilities for the research carried out by CEH.</p>

	<p pid="c.1293W.3/2">The tree was presented to NPL in 1953 by the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and is derived from a graft from an old tree at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of Sir Isaac Newton and where, according to tradition, Newton was inspired by a falling apple in developing his theory of gravitation. The tree at NPL is one of a number of similar descendants around the world. Public access to this tree is not possible but a similar, and perhaps more directly related, tree can be seen at Woolsthorpe Manor, which is in the care of the National Trust.</p>

	<p pid="c.1294W.3/1">Under UN Treaties, the Government are internationally responsible for activities in outer space carried on by its nationals, and assumes certain liabilities for damage caused to third parties as a result of those activities. The Department administers the Outer Space Act 1986, which requires that such space activities be licensed. Anyone who carries on a licensable activity gives an unlimited indemnity to the Government against claims. The Department seeks to secure indemnification in part by requiring &pound;100 million insurance cover. If the insurance policy proved insufficient to cover a particular claim, the licensee would be required to indemnify the Government of the excess. However, if the licensee were unable to meet this, the Government would have to fund the remainder from its own resources. Hence, there is a contingent liability.</p>

	<p pid="c.1298W.6/1">We keep under review the use of reduced rates for construction work where these could help support regeneration and renewal, and to date have targeted relief at areas of specific need, such as certain residential conversions (including converting a non-residential property into single household dwellings or converting a house into flats) and the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years. These measures have helped bring vacant homes back into use and create new homes through better use of the UK's existing housing stock. However, a blanket reduced rate for all household repairs is unlikely to be an efficient or well-targeted use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.1298W.6/2">While agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones.</p>

	<p pid="c.1301W.5/1">PAYE has developed over the years and does not have one computer system, but rather a number of systems that process, hold and support PAYE data. Enhancements have been made to these systems over the last five years, and there is currently one ongoing major upgrade to the PAYE computer support for electronic filing of employer end of year returns. This is the modernising PAYE processes for customers (MPPC) programme. In 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 approximately &pound;27.5 million and &pound;38 million was spent by the project.</p>

	<p pid="c.1302W.3/1">Social exclusion is a problem with many dimensions, which is recognised and prioritised in the Treasury's objectives and closely linked to other aspects of the department's work. Treasury objective 2 is to increase the productivity of the economy and expand economic and employment opportunities for all; Treasury objective 4 is to promote a fair, efficient and integrated tax and benefit system with incentives to work, save and invest. The work of many of the Treasury's teams contributes towards these objectives, working with other Departments where appropriate. For example, the Treasury established the Financial Inclusion Taskforce to increase access to banking, affordable credit and face-to-face money advice. The Treasury's 2006&ndash;07 budget includes &pound;1 million to fund the work of the taskforce and the Treasury team supporting it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1310W.2/2">Current legislation dictates that compensation orders must be prioritised over other sums ordered to be paid on conviction by the courts. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March</phrase>, new enforcement sanctions will be available to all magistrates courts as part of the national rollout of the Courts Act 2003 fines collection scheme, which will greatly improve the collection and enforcement of all financial impositions, including compensation orders. The Green Paper Rebuilding Lives&mdash;supporting victims of crime&quot; (December 2005) proposes extending the current Courts Act 2003 Deduction from Benefit Orders sanction to all cases involving compensation, regardless of default. In addition, HMCS is planning further enforcement blitz operations in areas with sizeable amounts of compensation payments outstanding to specifically target monies owed to the victims of crime.</p>

I am aware that a number of documents relating to this case have apparently been leaked to the press.</p>

Regardless of this development, and considering the Government's policy to decline to comment on leaked documents, I consider it right to retain the confidentiality of these documents and as such they will not be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.1322W.9/1">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food (DAF) in the Republic of Ireland in taking measures to deal with the threat of avian influenza. Given the mutual interest in ensuring that any outbreak on the island is identified quickly as a first step to its eradication and recognising the importance of the poultry industry, DARD officials have had frequent contact with their counterparts in Dublin over recent months to exchange information and discuss the respective approaches. These discussions have covered such issues as wild bird surveillance, the assessment of risk, preventive actions taken to date in both jurisdictions, and contingency planning. DAF officials have participated as observers in the exercises DARD has held to test its contingency plan and DARD officials have participated as observers in the Republic of Ireland. DARD has been invited to send an observer to meetings of the recently convened Republic of Ireland's Avian Influenza Expert Advisory Group.</p>
	<p pid="c.1322W.9/2">The control of Avian Influenza is based on an EU legal framework, which means that the preventive measures being taken North and South, and the control measures that would be taken in the event of a disease outbreak, are broadly similar. Arrangements are in place to ensure that there is effective communication between the two Departments in the event of an outbreak and to regulate trade in accordance with EU requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.1331W.2/1">The Department has issued guidance to schools indicating that wherever possible preference should be given to newly qualified teachers, or experienced teachers seeking to return to employment, rather than prematurely retired teachers, when filling vacancies. Schools have also been advised that they should recruit to vacancies on a permanent rather than temporary basis unless the vacancy is clearly of a temporary nature.</p>
	<p pid="c.1331W.2/2">Moreover, following the review of teacher education in Northern Ireland which is being carried out jointly by the Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning, the Departments jointly will be exploring means by which newly qualified teachers can have greater stability in employment during their early years of teaching.</p>

	<p pid="c.1337W.2/1">The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirms that around 40 humanitarian organisations currently work in Chechnya. Not all have a permanent presence in Chechnya and very few have international staff based there. If international staff visit at all, they are usually sent in only for the day. We estimate that these organisations have over a 100 staff, both international and local, working on rotation in Chechnya. But we have no means of assessing with any precision the number of international aid workers who have passed in and out of Chechnya. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have offices in Chechnya staffed by locals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1337W.2/2">Human rights work complements much of the work done by the humanitarian organisations. We estimate that there are fewer than 10 human rights organisations operating in Chechnya, but there are no accurate estimate of numbers of either organisations or staff operating in the region. Specific human rights NGOs do have local staff in Chechnya, and human rights workers based elsewhere in the Russian Federation regularly travel to Chechnya.</p>

	<p pid="c.1338W.8/1">It was disappointing that the European Court of Auditors (EGA) was unable last November to give a positive Statement of Assurance on the EC Budget for 2004. It is encouraging, however, that there have been noticeable improvements since 2003 with pre-accession expenditure once again being cleared, as it was in 2002, and, for the first time, certain areas of agricultural expenditure also gaining clearance. This has meant that around 35 per cent. of EC Budget expenditure was cleared in 2004 compared with only 6 per cent. in 2003. Much of the European Court of Auditors' difficulty in giving a positive assurance on the EU budget payments as a whole arises in the budget sector managed by the member states, who are responsible for 80 per cent. of spending under the EU budget. That is why, during our Presidency, we encouraged member states to take on a greater share of the responsibility for signing off the accounts. We succeeded in securing an agreement that will contribute to bringing about a step change in the EU's financial management and control at a meeting of EU Economic and Finance Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>. We hope that, over time, implementation of the action points in these conclusions will enable the EGA to give positive Statements of Assurance to the EC Budget in future years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1339W.3/1">Since 2000, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has worked in partnership with leading representatives of national Muslim organisations on the Hajj Advisory Group to organise the annual British Hajj Delegation (BHD). The FCO provides funding for the delegation which this year was approximately &pound;85,000. The BHD is based in Mecca during the Hajj season and provides medical, pastoral and consular assistance to British Muslims at the Hajj. Lord Patel of Blackburn has led the BHD for the last six years. For the most recent Hajj in January 2006, the BHD included 10 volunteers (nine doctors who run a medical clinic and one counsellor) and two members of staff from our consulate-general in Jeddah enabling the FCO to give consular assistance on the ground. This was particularly vital this year following the stampede at Mina which involved the deaths of three British nationals. The medical clinic also operated over a 15-day period during which the doctors assisted over 7,000 of the estimated 25,000 British pilgrims taking part in the Hajj.</p>

	<p pid="c.1340W.8/1">Between December 2004 and August 2005, the E3/EU held talks with Iran under the Paris Agreement. These covered possible long-term arrangements for Iran's nuclear programme and other areas of mutual interest. During the course of these negotiations, Iran expressed concern about European export licence decisions. In August 2005, the E3/EU proposed a framework for a long-term agreement covering Iran's nuclear programme and other political, economic and technological issues. In these proposals, the E3/EU expressed their willingness to take part in a joint export control workshop in Tehran, which would allow for exchanges on the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 and national/EC laws. Iran rejected the E3/EU proposals without serious consideration. A few days later Iran resumed uranium conversion activities in violation of the Paris Agreement, since when there have been no further negotiations under the Paris Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1340W.8/2">The UK's national embargo on Iran was introduced in 1993, amended in 1998, and covers all goods and technology on the Military List as well as items entered in Group O (Nuclear List) in Annex 1 of the European Council Regulation (EC) 1334/2000 on the export of dual-use items and technology. There are two exceptions to this embargo, namely (i) goods essential for the safety of civil aircraft and air traffic control systems; and (ii) radioactive material in the form of sources for medical equipment and deuterium labelled compounds for medical use.</p>

	<p pid="c.1342W.2/1">The Kurdish people have a proud tradition of political participation. Following the removal of the former regime, the two Kurdish administrations agreed to form one unified Kurdish Regional Government (KRG). This will be a challenging task&mdash;merging the two governments involves downsizing from 27 to 16 Ministries and reunifying some 400,000 civil servants from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and more than 500,000 civil servants from the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).</p>
	<p pid="c.1342W.2/2">This decision is testament to the Kurds commitment to democratic rule. Nechirvan Barzani, from the KDP, has been named Prime Minister of the KRG and the position of Deputy Prime Minister will be filled by a member from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The KRG continues to play a crucial role in promoting the formation of a government of national unity, and has advocated a strong central government.</p>

These gains will be delivered from a number of distinct projects. Details of the projects, including baselines, are set out in the FCO's Efficiency Technical Note published on our website. Each project will have one or more baseline. For some projects the baselines are straightforward, for instance payments to BBC Monitoring (project 6) were &pound;7.1 million in 2004&ndash;05.

Demand for these services, and hence the income derived from them, is increasing and this enables the FCO to employ more staff to meet the demand. The civil service work force reduction targets in other areas of the FCO in full-time equivalents are 165 by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, 265 by <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> and 313 by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.1345W.9/3">The target relocations are 450 staff. Not all the functions which will be relocated are yet agreed but as relocations take place the baseline is set as the number of staff (if any) who were performing that function in the new location before the relocation takes place.</p>

Where it has deployed there has been a decrease in attacks by all parties, including the janjaweed&quot; Arab militias. In December 2005, the UK participated in an international assessment mission conducting an in-depth review of AMIS. This concluded that AMIS has had a positive effect on both the security and humanitarian situations in Darfur and recommended further steps to increase its effectiveness. We are working closely with the African Union to ensure these steps are taken. The UK has provided more than &pound;50 million to date to support AMIS.</p>

	<p pid="c.1355W.0/1">Our Welfare Reform Green Paper; A new deal for welfare, Empowering people for work&quot;; set out our proposals for the future of the welfare state and builds on the success of our welfare to work policies such as new deal and Pathways to Work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1355W.0/2">The funding for welfare reform has been drawn from the budgets provided to the Department through the 2004 Spending Review settlement which covered the financial years 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. Details are available in The departmental report 2005 (Cm 6539) published in June 2005. The &pound;360 million funding is largely to be spent extending the Pathways to Work programme beyond the pilot areas and covers 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, but may also be used to fund other measures dependent on responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1355W.0/3">While we are still in the consultation phase a detailed costing of the various parts of our proposals is not possible. This is especially the case in relation to the costs for each Pathways to Work scheme as we are looking to the private and voluntary sector to deliver many of the Pathways schemes and it is not possible to provide detailed costs prior to contract negotiations. This is also the case when it comes to the need for additional medical professionals where we are consulting to develop the detail of the new personal capability assessment. Medical Services will be contracting doctors and other health care professionals where required.</p>
	<p pid="c.1355W.0/4">However, I can tell you that if every current incapacity benefit recipient was given a work focussed interview at least once a year, we estimate the cost would be around &pound;80 million annually. The actual costs would be dependent on the numbers joining and leaving the benefit during any one year. But, although the cost savings from measures outlined in the Green Paper depend to a large extent on the final proposals following the consultation, we know that the existing Pathways pilots are already generating savings, and we expect further savings from further roll-out.</p>

	<p pid="c.1356W.2/1">It is important in the interests of fairness to genuine claimants and to the taxpayer, that we assure ourselves that those claiming incapacity benefits are entitled to do so. This requires regular review and other measures to ensure proper compliance.</p>

Where these checks produce doubt about the nature or extent of an individual's incapacity, a fresh personal capability assessment will be required.

	<p pid="c.1361W.8/1">The Supporting People programme was launched in April 2003 bringing together nine different funding streams that had previously been used to fund housing related support.

	<p pid="c.1361W.8/2">Authorities have been required to carry out a review of all legacy services and it is through this process that efficiencies have been achieved.

	<p pid="c.1361W.8/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently consulted on the development of a future national strategy for Supporting People and will be looking at the responses to this paper over the coming months. The consultation also asked questions about future funding approaches and an announcement will be made in the summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1362W.11/2">We continue to keep the impact of VAT on different types of building work under review, and have introduced reduced rates where they support our regeneration and renewal objectives. However, while agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones. This means that in order to harmonise the rates of VAT on new build housing and repair, we would first have to give up our current zero rate for construction of new housing. We have no current plans to give up any of our existing construction zero rates.</p>

	<p pid="c.1365W.9/1">The turnout at the May 2005 general election in social class DE was 54 per cent. This compares with AB turnout of 71 per cent. The gap of participation between AB and DE groups and low turnout of DE group is a concern to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1365W.9/2">The Electoral Administration Bill includes a new duty on Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take all necessary steps to ensure comprehensive registers. Those steps include the following specific measures:</p>
	<p pid="c.1365W.9/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> Sending the canvass form more than once to any address;</p>
	<p pid="c.1365W.9/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> Making house to house inquires on more than one occasion;</p>
	<p pid="c.1365W.9/5" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> Making contact by such other means as the registration officer thinks appropriate with persons who do not have an entry in a register;</p>

	<p pid="c.1365W.9/7" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> Providing training to others carrying out the duty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1365W.9/8">The Government has made available &pound;2.5 million to support the new power to encourage electoral participation included in the Electoral Administration Bill. It is intended that this money will enable Returning Officers and Electoral Registration Officers in England and Wales to undertake some promotional activity, such as posters, leaflets and outreach work, to encourage registration and/or participation in elections at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="c.1367W.3/1">As part of the Magistrates National Recruitment Strategy, to increase the numbers of young and ethnic minority magistrates across England and Wales, we have produced publicity material about the magistracy to encourage applications from all sections of local communities and to raise awareness among employers. The Lord Chancellor has set up a working group of the main employer organisations and the Trade Union Congress to seek their active support in encouraging employees to join the magistracy. We are funding the magistrates shadowing scheme run by Operation Black Vote to enable people from black and minority ethnic (BME) groups to shadow magistrates in order to gain valuable insight into the roles and responsibilities of a magistrate, and encourage applications. Magistrate courts in the Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale areas have participated in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1367W.3/2">In September 2005, the Lancashire Advisory Committee ran a concerted press and radio campaign which produced 206 applications. Of these, 18 were from BME applicants and the age composition of all applications was as follows:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="c.1367W.3/5"> <th>Age group</th> <th>Applications</th> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1367W.3/14">The figures for the number of magistrates appointed are not currently available, as the interview process has not yet started. Out of the 206 applications, 150 applicants have been short-listed for interview.</p>

	<p pid="c.1371W.5/1">For a number of reasons it will not always be possible to authorise the release within 24 hours of the death. The body of a homicide victim may, for example, require forensic analysis. Early release will also depend on the availability of pathologists to conduct post-mortem examinations. But coroners fully appreciate the need to release bodies quickly following a coroner's post-mortem examination, and are particularly sensitive to the requirements of faith groups.</p>

	<p pid="c.1372W.2/1">The Electoral Administration Bill takes forward a number of measures to improve voter registration, including a new duty on registration officers specifying the steps that they must take to ensure comprehensive registers and moving back the deadline for registering until after an election has been called (until 11 days before polling day). The Bill also includes a power for returning officers to encourage participation in elections, to promote current best practice already undertaken by some local authorities in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1372W.2/2">The Government are actively working with electoral registration officers and community groups to increase awareness on the voter registration in UK and working closely with stakeholders on improving the annual canvass form by making it clearer, simpler and easy to understand.</p>
	<p pid="c.1372W.2/3">The Government have embarked on a number of initiatives, such as the 1824 Collective&quot; campaign to promote awareness of voter registration amongst London's urban youth&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.1373W.0/1">In family and civil cases, the main witness is usually the victim/a party to the proceedings and, therefore, is already known to the alleged perpetrator.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.0/2">Family courts have wide powers when hearing cases where they consider a victim may be vulnerable or scared. For example: hearings are usually conducted in private and wigs and gowns are not worn; cases are not heard or decided by juries but by family judiciary who have been specially trained to deal with these sensitive cases; when a hearing date is set the victim and his/her legal representative should be advised of any special facilities that are available at that court such as separate entrances/exits or private waiting rooms; in cases of domestic or sexual abuse the court may help the giving of evidence with the use of screens and/or video links. We are also examining the benefits of specialist domestic violence courts where civil and criminal aspects of domestic violence cases will be heard in one court. This should also make the availability of special measures more readily available across the jurisdictions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1373W.4/1">The UK Government have pledged a total of &pound;544 million for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Iraq from 2003 until 2006, and has disbursed over &pound;460 million. DFID's contribution to this has been &pound;300 million. Our programme focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/2" class="indent">Capacity building in national and local government;</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/3" class="indent">Supporting participation in the political process;</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/4" class="indent">Improving infrastructure in the southern governorates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/5">To date, we have pledged &pound;72 million for infrastructure support projects in the south, of which &pound;44 million has already been spent. Our assistance is directed at improving power and water supplies, which will raise living standards for ordinary Iraqis as well as providing the necessary infrastructure to support business and economic growth. In the power sector, we have repaired transmission lines from Hartha power station to Basra city, securing electricity supplies for 1.5 million residents; we will improve power distribution to 13 areas of Basra (nine areas completed); and we have projects in progress which will add or secure 270MW generation capacity throughout southern Iraq. In the water sector we have repaired over 5,000 leaks, and have provided technical advice for sewage installation in Al Amarah&mdash;providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels. We are building water towers and reservoirs to provide clean water for 250,000 of the poorest people in Basra, and we are constructing a water training centre which will train 2,000 water officials and engineers from across the south.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/6">The Iraqi people will ultimately depend on their own Government to improve living standards, and to maintain and develop the country's infrastructure. To help the Government rise to this challenge, DFID is providing the following assistance:</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/7" class="indent">Support to the Government's macro-economic reform programme, in order to generate growth, reduce poverty and improve living standards. This includes helping Iraq to meet its IMF obligations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/8" class="indent">Building the capacity of key central government offices, including the Prime Minister's office, to manage Government business effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/9" class="indent">Strengthening institutional capacity, and supporting private sector growth, in the four southern governorates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/10">We are also supporting living standards in Iraq through the &pound;70 million contribution we made to the United Nations and World Bank Trust Funds in 2004, which includes support to essential services such as health and education.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/11">The rebuilding of Afghanistan cannot be achieved without significant investments in infrastructure, but given the scale of resources required, and the importance of donors working to their respective comparative advantages, we believe other donors are better placed to make these investments. The USA, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan in particular are investing in Afghanistan's infrastructure sector. A component of DFID's livelihoods work does however include support for small scale rural infrastructure through funding to the National Solidarity programme (&pound;9 million in 2005&ndash;06) and the National Emergency Employment programme (&pound;18 million in 2005&ndash;06).</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.4/12">The National Solidarity programme is implementing 8,709 community projects in 33 provinces including 3,779 water and irrigation related projects; 1,740 electricity and generator related projects; and 1,740 roads, bridges, culverts and other transportation related projects. Through the National Emergency Employment programme around 6,000 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated and/or constructed, including 11,000 running metres of structures (e.g. culverts, bridges).</p>

	<p pid="c.1374W.2/1">The Government of Iraq, together with the UK and other donors, has made significant progress with reconstruction since 2003; but there is still a long way to go. Once a relatively wealthy country with high levels of education and healthcare, by 2003 Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic under-investment from a brutal regime. The 2003 conflict, and the high levels of insecurity that have followed it, have exacerbated, not created, the need for reconstruction in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/2">Continued violence, especially sabotage directed at infrastructure, and low (but growing) levels of management capacity in Iraq's national and local Government have slowed progress. However, reconstruction has continued and much has been achieved:</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/3">In December 2005, the Iraqi people voted in democratic elections, putting in place a Council of Representatives for the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/4">The economy has rebounded quickly; Iraq's GDP is projected at $29.3 billion in 2005, up from $18.4 billion in 2002. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Iraq's economy to grow by 10.4 percent. in 2006. With help from donors, including DFID, the interim Government negotiated an emergency post-conflict agreement with the IMF, paving the way for the Paris Club debt reduction deal. In December 2005 Iraq secured a stand-by arrangement with the IMF, which provides an IMF-supported economic reform programme over the next 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/5">Iraq's infrastructure was badly maintained and underinvested in during the 1990s. Things are slowly improving. Over 4 million more Iraqis have access to potable water than before the conflict; 9.6 million more have access to a sewerage system. More than US$3.5 billion has been spent on electricity, but the gains in generating capacity have been off-set by continued sabotage, inadequate fuel supplies, a lack of Iraqi capacity to operate and maintain the new systems, and continuing failure of old infrastructure. Current generation averages 4,037MW, compared to 4,300MW pre-conflict and 2,500MW immediately post-conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/6">Iraq's health and education services are being restored. More than 50,000 teachers and healthcare professionals have been trained. 3,757 schools have been rehabilitated, and a further 432 are in progress. Hundreds of healthcare facilities have been rehabilitated and a new paediatric hospital in Basra is being built. Through extensive disease control programmes, there has been a decline in the prevalence of polio, measles, leishmaniasis, mumps, rubella, and malaria.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/7">Media and civil society is flourishing. 250 newspapers and magazines have been launched since the fall of the regime, and new, independent radio and TV stations are now up and running. 2,500 Iraqi NGOs are now registered with the Iraqi Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/8">DFID is committed to supporting Iraq's reconstruction progress. Our programme focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/9" class="indent">Investing in infrastructure works to deliver improved power and water services in Southern Iraq</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/10" class="indent">Building the capacity of local and national Government to manage Government business and deliver services effectively</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/11" class="indent">Supporting the Government's macro-economic reform programme which will help to generate growth and reduce poverty</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/12" class="indent">Helping the poor and marginalised to participate in the political process, and supporting the development of Iraqi civil society</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/13">Our contribution of &pound;70 million to the UN and World Bank Trust Funds, made in 2004, is also helping to finance reconstruction work in other areas, with a particular focus on health and education.</p>

	<p pid="c.1377W.2/1">DFID provided approximately &pound;250,000 in direct assistance to Cayman Islands in 2004, for emergency supplies and services in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ivan. DFID also funds a full time Disaster Risk Reduction adviser to the Caribbean Overseas Territories, who provides ongoing expertise to these countries to strengthen and improve their disaster preparedness. Accordingly, he visited the Cayman Islands in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ivan to advise on recovery planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1377W.2/2">DFID further funded a study of the impact of Hurricane Ivan to help learn from the Cayman Islands' experience of handling the emergency. The adviser has worked in the region throughout the 2005 hurricane season and will continue to do so until August 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1377W.2/3">DFID also placed a Humanitarian and Disaster Risk Reduction Adviser in the region, based in Barbados, for the 2005 hurricane season. The adviser liaised with, and provided advice to, regional agencies and other development partners dealing with Disaster Risk Reduction and the continuing response to Hurricane Ivan and to Hurricane Emily in July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1377W.2/4">The UK also had relief supplies on board one of the frigates based in the Caribbean in preparation for a disaster response in the region.</p>

	<p pid="c.1377W.5/1">There have been no recent bilateral discussions between DFID and the Government of Chad on the use of oil revenues. The Government of Chad has held recent discussions with the World Bank, including on their intention to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. In January 2006, the World Bank suspended all their lending to Chad due to their concerns about the use of oil revenues. The World Bank are continuing to discuss with Chadian officials how to safeguard the oil revenues intended for poverty reduction programs included in their original agreement.</p>

In December last year the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) jointly published a paper on 'A vision for the Common Agricultural Policy'. This sets out the UK Government's vision for European agriculture which is fundamentally sustainable and does not distort international trade.

	<p pid="c.1378W.2/1">DFID does not have a bilateral programme of assistance to the Republic of Congo. We are however aware of long-standing allegations of corruption, including the use of oil revenues, and share the concerns of many about this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1378W.2/2">Strengthening governance and tackling corruption in the Republic of Congo are essential if the country is to eradicate poverty and meet its development objectives. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank recognise this, and are addressing the issue through their programmes. We welcome the Republic of Congo government signing up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and urge it to continue to improve its performance in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1378W.2/3">As a heavily indebted poor country (HIPC), the Republic of Congo is eligible for debt relief through the HIPC Initiative. This is currently under discussion at the IMF and the World Bank, and we expect the institutions to make a statement once that discussion has been concluded. To qualify for debt relief, the HIPC Initiative requires countries to demonstrate a track record in poverty reduction and sound economic management; to get irrevocable cancellation countries must also complete a number of important actions and reforms. To date, many HIPC countries have undertaken to strengthen public expenditure management and accountability, as well as making progress in health, education and other areas. The IMF and World Bank are clear that resources released through debt relief must be used to reduce poverty, and they have a range of safeguards to achieve that.</p>

	<p pid="c.1380W.5/1">Since the Global Fund began its operations in 2002, the International Community, including public and private donors has pledged and/or contributed a total of US $8.6 billion to support the institution's work through to 2008. This is a substantial achievement for such a young institution and has helped to dramatically increase international funding to combat the three diseases over the last four years. During the September 2005 Replenishment conference, the Global Fund achieved pledges of US $3.7 billion against its estimated resource needs of US $7 billion for 2006 and 2007 which has allowed it to finance all ongoing projects. A further US $3.3 billion is needed to enable the Global Fund to finance new projects over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1380W.5/2">The UK has pledged &pound;359 million to the Global Fund for the period 2002 to 2008. Our contribution in 2005 was &pound;51 million, which brings our total contribution delivered to date, to &pound;159 million. Over the next two years we have pledged to provide &pound;100 million to the Global Fund for 2006 and &pound;100 million for 2007, to support the Fund's estimated resource needs of US $7 billion for this period. The two-year total of &pound;200 million represents 8.4 per cent. of the total pledged to date (i.e. &pound;3.7 billion) and 5.1 per cent. of the US $7 billion total resource needs. This is above our gross national income fair share and is consistent with our past support. The UK is currently the fourth largest donor for the period 2006 and 2007 (after France, the US and Japan) and the second largest in the European Union. At present, the UK has no plans to increase our contributions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1380W.5/3">There will be a mid-term review of the Global Fund's replenishment process in June. This will be an opportunity for the International Community to review further the Global Fund's performance and urge new and existing donors to put in more money. The UK (DFID) will continue to encourage donors to do as much as they can to fill any gaps in Global Fund resources&mdash;in particular we will be working to encourage support from new donors, especially the oil producing countries and the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.1381W.2/1">The first round of presidential and parliamentary elections took place in Haiti on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-16">16 February</phrase>, Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) declared Rene Preval the winner of the presidential elections with 51.15 per cent. of the vote. The European Union sent an observer mission to monitor the elections. The mission's preliminary declaration reports that polling took place in a calm environment, with only one or two instances of violence. There was a high voter turn out and we are hopeful that the elections mark a major step forward for Haiti's democratic process. The European Union mission will produce a full report on the election process once the second round of parliamentary elections has taken place.</p>

	<p pid="c.1381W.2/3">The UK Government will remain engaged with other members of the international community on issues concerning Haiti. We are providing over &pound;20 million through our share of the commitments made by the European Commission, Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank at the 2004 Donors' Conference. In addition, the UK made a significant increase in its contribution to the Caribbean Development Bank's soft loans fund for its poverty reduction programme in Haiti&mdash;our contribution will provide approximately &pound;3 million a year over the next three years for Haiti. We are currently negotiating the possibility of placing an advisor in Haiti alongside other donor partners to assist in enhancing the effectiveness of the donor response. The UK also pays 7.4 per cent. of the costs of the UN peacekeeping mission.</p>

	<p pid="c.1385W.5/1">The central fund is the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The UN has recently approved reform of the CERF, so as to enable UN humanitarian agencies, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to provide a more predictable and timely response to emergencies, including to internally displaced persons (IDPs). The fund aims to ensure that initial funding is available immediately to support rapid response to humanitarian crises and address critical humanitarian needs in under-funded emergencies.

	<p pid="c.1385W.5/2">DFID's assessment is that the CERF will be valuable in enabling the UN to respond faster when crisis strikes and to achieve more equitable levels of funding between crises.

	<p pid="c.1386W.2/1">I had frank discussions with President Kibaki about corruption when I visited Kenya in January 2006. Since then considerable action, including the removal of three senior Ministers, has taken place in response to public pressure following the release of the Githongo dossier and the release of the Goldenberg Report. This is an encouraging start but Kenyans are calling for more to demonstrate full political accountability.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.2/2">I do not agree that the UK should cut development assistance. Most of the development agencies, including DFID, feel that just because poor people live in a country where corruption is a major problem, it does not mean that they do not deserve our assistance. Indeed much of our assistance is directed towards trying to prevent future corruption through improved financial management, procurement, better governance, justice, law and order. The bulk of our assistance (over 70 per cent.) to Kenya improves lives. Our support will mean textbooks for each of the 18,500 primary schools in Kenya and 12,000 new classrooms. It will also deliver 11 million insecticide treated bednets, saving 167,000 children's lives. We have provided &pound;23.7 million to drought affected regions of Kenya since December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.2/3">The UK does not provide direct budget support to Kenya precisely because of our concerns about corruption, all DFID's projects have rigorous safeguards to ensure that our assistance is not being misdirected. Unless there is more evidence of Government of Kenya commitment to political accountability then the prospects for budget support from us and from others look very remote.</p>

	<p pid="c.1386W.5/1">According to national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, the percentage of the population living in poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 48.3 per cent. in 1990 to 42.9 per cent. in 2004. Levels of extreme poverty, whereby a person's basic food needs cannot be met, decreased from 22.5 per cent. to 18.6 per cent. over the same time period. Extreme poverty rates in the region differ considerably across countries. In Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, more than 30 per cent. of the population live below the extreme poverty line. More than half of the total population in Latin America living in extreme poverty is concentrated in the largest countries: Brazil (25 per cent.), Mexico (14 per cent.) and Colombia (12 per cent.). The extreme poverty rate is higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people, ranging from 1.6 times higher than the rate of the rest of the population in Colombia to 7.9 times in Paraguay.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.5/2">There are very high levels of inequality in Latin America. In most countries, the share of total income of the richest 20 per cent. of households is between 10 and 16 times larger than the poorest 20 per cent. of households. Income inequality levels are highest in Bolivia, where the poorest 20 per cent. of households receive only 2.2 per cent. of income and in Brazil where the richest 20 per cent. of households receive 62.4 per cent. of income. Between 1990 and 2003, income inequality increased in Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil and decreased in Colombia, Nicaragua and Honduras.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.5/3">At current rates of progress, Latin America is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Target to halve the proportion of people living on less than a $1 a day by 2015. Although substantial progress was made in reducing poverty in the early 1990s, progress slowed down subsequently due to the economic crises experienced in many countries in 2000 and 2001. Poverty has been reduced more rapidly in countries that have relatively high levels of human development such as Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. Conversely, countries with low levels of human development such as Honduras and Bolivia have made the lowest levels of progress. Latin America is on track to meet MDGs on universal primary education; gender equality and reduction of child mortality but faces huge challenges in meeting those for maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and environmental sustainability.</p>

	<p pid="c.1387W.5/1">DFID has provided support to Lesotho for HIV prevention and control, through two channels: first, through our bilateral programme when support for HIV/AIDS commenced in 2004; and second, through regional programmes since 2001&ndash;02. The bulk of this assistance is directed towards the adult population, though the general nature of it helps the entire population, including children. Due to the nature of the regional programmes DFID cannot provide, in all cases, detailed financial figures that solely reflect Lesotho's direct benefit from regional programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1387W.5/2">DFID's bilateral support to HIV/AIDS responds to the priorities identified in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy. Commencing in 2004, it provides a total of &pound;1.8 million over three years. Funding is directed towards mainstreaming HIV/AIDS in economic and poverty planning, strengthening the private sector's response to HIV, and facilitating the establishment of an effective National AIDS Commission and UN response.</p>
	<p pid="c.1387W.5/3">Over the last five years, we have supported the Southern African Development Community (SADC) implement a programme for HIV prevention.

	<p pid="c.1387W.5/4">DFID has supported the ground-breaking Soul City programme in Southern Africa. This &pound;14 million commitment is directed at both children and adults and provides information and guidance through multiple media channels.</p>

Throughout the last hurricane season the DFID Caribbean office was strengthened to enhance tropical storm monitoring, preparedness, assessment and response capacity. DFID also had relief supplies on one of the UK frigates based in the Caribbean.</p>

	<p pid="c.1390W.6/1">DFID is committed to monitoring the effectiveness of the multilateral organisations it supports. During 2004, we conducted an assessment of 23 multilateral agencies looking at their internal systems. We used a common multilateral effectiveness framework (MEFF) to better understand how well they were organised to deliver their objectives. The assessments were carried out in partnership with the agencies concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.6/2">DFID uses the results of the MEFF in conjunction with other assessments, such as the surveys carried out by the Multilateral Organisations Performance Assessment Network, and the reporting of multilateral themselves, to assess multilateral performance and to inform partnership decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.6/3">At the country level, we assess the impact and effectiveness of multilaterals with whom we have a relationship drawing on the views of partner Governments and donors. This evidence based approach helps us engage with multilaterals at a number of levels and informs our decisions around financing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.6/4">In addition, we undertake monitoring of multilateral organisations working on particular issues, for example the delivery of humanitarian services. These are framed by institutional strategies which set out jointly agreed objectives between DFID and the organisation linked to financial support. The aim is to foster a transparent relationship which set outs clear principals and targets linked explicitly to improving effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="c.1390W.9/1">2005 was an important year with real progress made as a result of a number of events; the publications of the UN Secretary General's 'In Larger Freedom' report and Commission for Africa report, the G8 summit, Live8, the Make Poverty History Campaign, the Millennium Development Review and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade talks. 2006 and beyond, presents significant challenges as we have to deliver on the commitments made in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.9/2">An effective multilateral system will be important to delivering on these commitments. Our vision and the role the UK is playing to support a consolidated and effective multilateral system will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper on international development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.9/3">We have already welcomed the announcement at the millennium summit review on the establishment of a Peace Building Commission and Human Rights Council, both of whom have an important role to play towards meeting the millennium development goals (MDG)s.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.9/4">We are committed to revisiting the structure of the multilateral system (the UN, EU, multilateral banks) and their mandates to ensure that overlap is reduced. We want to see the right agency or organisation, focusing on its area of strength, in the right context with the funding levels it needs to deliver. For example the proliferation of UN agencies has created a complex structure where overlap is evident. We are working toward a more effective and efficient multilateral system which is able to respond to the changing global context.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.9/5">We also strongly welcome the Secretary General's recent announcement of an international panel to review the UN's development work. My right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a member of this panel and we will be putting forward the case for a strong development role for the UN in the future, involving more stable and predictable financing to meet clear objectives. This would build on the considerable work already begun by the UN's various specialised agencies, funds and programmes to co-ordinate their efforts more closely at the country level. We will also take advantage of the opportunity presented by the White Paper to set out what we think are important roles for both the EU and the multilateral development banks in the 21st century.</p>

Today we are facing new challenges including energy security, climate change, health pandemics, corruption and organised crime. We need a new vision that is fit for purpose in today's world, within which we need to clarify the role of multilaterals.

Areas of both comparative strength and weakness were identified. The key areas of weakness are being given priority in the tracking over multilateral performance over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.2/2">A key aspect of effectiveness assessed by the MEFF was the degree to which multilateral were improving their focus on results, including by supporting national systems and poverty reduction plans, delegating more responsibility to country offices, and monitoring their own contribution to development outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.2/3">The assessments highlighted the positive impact of recent reforms.

	<p pid="c.1392W.5/4" class="indent">An agreed list of developing countries that should not be targeted for recruitment, which has prevented the NHS and other major health employers from actively recruiting from 150 of the poorest and middle income countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.5/5" class="indent">A memorandum of understanding has been signed with South Africa, for qualified healthcare professionals to undertake time limited placements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.5/6">Part of the problem is the chronic under-investment in health workers and health systems in developing countries. This results in low job satisfaction for health workers, which, combined with very low salaries, leads to migration of health workers to the UK and other developed countries. The UK Government support efforts to increase the supply of health workers, through, for example support to the health sector plan and budget or general budget support. This can support payment of salaries and allowances, and increased production of health workers. The UK support is also geared to improving conditions for health workers through improving health systems/health sector policies and increasing innovative approaches to service provision. This is an area which is covered in DFID's policy paper Moving Out of Poverty&mdash;Making Migration Work Better for Poor People&quot;, which has just been approved by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.5/7">Since 2000, the UK Government have spent over &pound;650 million on health sector support in Africa, primarily to strengthen health systems including training and retraining health workers. In Malawi for example, we have invested &pound;100 million over six years towards the Sector Wide Approach for health to strengthen health services and increase access to basic health services. The Malawi programme has three main elements:</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.5/8" class="indent">improving incentives for recruitment and retention of Malawian staff through salary increases for 11 professional and technical groups&mdash;5,400 health workers now receiving 52 per cent. salary top-up and over 700 new staff recruited.</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.5/9" class="indent">expanding domestic training capacity by over 50 per cent., including doubling the number of nurses and tripling doctors being trained;</p>
	<p pid="c.1392W.5/10" class="indent">using international volunteer physicians and nurse tutors as a stop-gap measure while more Malawians are being trained.</p>

	<p pid="c.1393W.2/1">Since 2004, UK and European Community (EC) financial support to the Palestinian Authority's (PA) budget has been provided through a Reform Trust Fund, managed by the World Bank.

	<p pid="c.1394W.8/1">Although difficult to calculate, it is estimated that about 8&ndash;10 per cent of all external aid to Rwanda in recent years has been allocated to health.</p>
	<p pid="c.1394W.8/2">The Government of Rwanda (GoR) attaches great importance to health in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The GoR Ministry of Health (MoH) has a strong national health strategic plan (2005&ndash;2009) which includes improvement of health care facilities. The health strategic plan is funded through the GoR budget, which is partly funded by general budget support (GBS) provided by donors. Health is also funded through donor support provided off-budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.1394W.8/3">The Government of Rwanda (GoR) budget allocation to health has increased substantially over the last five years. In 2003 total government expenditure allocated to the health sector was 4.4 per cent. This increased to 8 per cent. in 2005 and 8.4 per cent. in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1395W.2/1">DFID has funded an adviser to the President of Sierra Leone since July 2002 to work on the development of a diamond strategy for the sector for Sierra Leone, as part of its overall policy on minerals which the Government of Sierra Leone ratified in 2003. Since that time, we have been working with the Government of Sierra Leone and other donors, including the World Bank, European Commission and the United States Agency for International which includes establishing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework; creating the right business environment; strengthening the capacity of relevant government departments; and supporting non-governmental organisations. These steps will improve the transparency of management of diamonds in Sierra Leone. We also continue to actively support the implementation of the Kimberley process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1395W.2/2">A DFID programme of assistance is supporting the objectives set out in the mineral policy. It has two main aims: to maximise the economic and social benefits of the diamond sector to both the Government and the people of Sierra Leone; and to ensure that the benefits accrued from the sector are divided more equitably among those involved. The programme includes: provision of technical advice to the Office of the President; support to review and redraft the Mines and Minerals legislation; technical assistance to the Gold and Diamond Department (GDD) of the National Revenue Authority (NRA); support for the design and implementation of a cadastre system; technical assistance for the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR); support to build the capacity of the United Mineworkers Union (UMU); and support for the development of a business and statistical information service. Alongside the UK, the EC is also supporting capacity building in the Ministry of Mineral Resources through the provision of an adviser who is working on the reopening of Sierra Leone's Rutile Mine. The World Bank aim to begin implementing a sector-wide Mineral Project before the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1395W.2/3">The problems of illegal fishing are considerable, with losses to sub-Saharan Africa estimated to be $1 billion per annum. DFID, in partnership with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), governments of the West Africa region and local fishing communities, supports a programme to increase local capacity to address poverty in fishing communities through better management of resources. Sierra Leone has participated in this programme and has access to the support that it provides.</p>
	<p pid="c.1395W.2/4">More recently, the UK along with a number of other governments has created a programme designed to address illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities, which both DFID and the Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) support. In addition to the support being provided by the UK, the European Commission has recently approved a programme of support in Sierra Leone aimed at providing stock assessments to enhance the country's fisheries management capacity.</p>

Since then DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff have been closely and continuously involved in international efforts to encourage Somali leaders to resolve their differences, and to make the transitional institutions work effectively for stability and reconstruction of the country.

	<p pid="c.1397W.2/1">The drought affecting parts of southern Somalia is considered to be the most severe for at least 10 years. This has meant that many wells have dried up entirely, and that those remaining are being overused. Many of the people in southern Somalia live by raising livestock and due to the exceptionally dry conditions this year they are having to travel further than usual to find pasture for their animals. We have also heard reports that in some cases this has resulted in people arriving at wells only to find them dry or unusable, but without the resources or ability to reach another well. This is a desperate situation. In addition, water is a commodity that is bought and sold in southern Somalia, so it is possible that people simply do not have the means to pay, although it is widely understood that people who are in desperate personal need are given water even if they are unable to pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.2/2">Deaths from thirst may well have occurred in some extreme cases, although the impact of reduced and poor quality water is much wider than this. There are additional deaths from water borne diseases, and the deadly combination of these diseases and malnutrition, plus the sheer burden in terms of time and money on households to keep themselves supplied with water are also taking a terrible toll.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.2/3">The UK is one of the leading donors to humanitarian relief efforts in Somalia. We are providing &pound;7 million to the immediate relief effort to help enable the UN, NGOs and regional authorities to deliver urgently needed food aid, nutritional therapy, emergency water supplies and health care to those areas worst affected by drought.</p>

Forecasts for 2005&ndash;06 predict that &pound;922 million will be channelled through programmatic support, an increase of &pound;242 million over the baseline. Efficiencies in the first nine months therefore amount to &pound;36 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1402W.0/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> For the value for money of bilateral projects: Data from quarter 3 2005&ndash;06 does not yet show any improvement on the baseline.</p>
	<p pid="c.1402W.0/5" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> For the level of EC aid going to low income countries: Figures will become available from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) after the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1402W.0/6" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> For DFID's contribution to the International Development Association: The conclusion of negotiations for IDA 14 (the latest replenishment, covering the period 2005&ndash;08) has resulted in a 59 per cent. increase in the basic contribution over IDA 13. Efficiency gains will be declared as promissory notes are drawn down. This will now take place in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="c.1402W.0/7" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> For administration costs: Efficiency gains for this target will commence in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="c.1402W.0/8" class="indent"><i>(f)</i> For procurement savings: Results from the last nine months show greater than expected success, with &pound;5.1 million of cashable savings made against a target of &pound;3 million by March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1403W.2/17">St. Helena also benefits from DFID's 'regional' Overseas Territories programme. Individual country shares of this cannot be attributed without incurring a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1403W.2/18">The European Development Fund also allocates funds for the UK Overseas Territories. Cumulative allocations since 1993 total approximately &euro;86.33 million (the UK share of which is about &euro;10.79 million or about &pound;7.2 million). This sum, some of which is still being committed to or spent on approved development activities, has been shared among eligible UK Overseas Territories. St. Helena's share (which includes provision for Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha) is &euro;18,150 million (approximately &pound;12.3 million).</p>

Peace support operations there are at present being conducted by African Union personnel (AMIS) on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding between the African Union (AU) and the Government of Sudan. The UK and other international partners recently participated in a joint assessment mission with the AU. This concluded that AMIS' current mandate is adequate but that the African Union Mission's capacity needs to develop further if it is to be able to carry out the tasks required. We will continue to assist the AU in this.</p>

	<p pid="c.1404W.0/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) second White Paper, Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot;, December 2000, drew attention to the dangers for developing countries of tax competition&mdash;the process whereby Governments offer ever more generous tax concessions (such as tax holidays) in an attempt to attract new investment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1404W.0/2">Tax competition can have harmful effects if it compromises Governments' ability to raise revenue to fund essential services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1404W.0/3">DFID has supported several international studies in this area (for example, by the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). While specific features of a tax regime may influence some investment decisions in some countries at some times, the general conclusion of this work is that selective tax incentives can unnecessarily reduce Government revenues while having little effect in attracting new investment. Consistent with this finding, DFID's policy work emphasises that developing countries should focus on improving the quality of their overall investment climates for domestic and foreign investors alike, rather than competing on taxes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1405W.9/1">Citizenship became a statutory subject in the National Curriculum in 2002. Promoting the development of skills of participation and responsible action is a fundamental part of the citizenship curriculum. Local education authorities and school governing bodies are now legally obliged to take account of guidance from the Secretary of State on consulting pupils when making decisions that affect them. Similarly, we have legislated to allow governing bodies to appoint young people as associate members. In addition, the Government are actively promoting school councils and mock elections in all schools, and encouraging schools to engage pupils as peer mentors and mediators. Young people are also engaged in the school inspection process as Ofsted now seek pupils' opinions when writing inspection reports. We are also funding the dissemination of guidance to help schools implement Active Citizens in Schools, which extends the principles of the successful Millennium Volunteers to 13 to 16-year-olds through citizenship lessons.</p>

	<p pid="c.1406W.2/1">The Department allocates funds for the post-16 education and training sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices. The LSC was established in 2001 bringing the planning and funding of post-16 education together under one body within a framework set by Government. In 2001&ndash;02 the LSC spent &pound;2,236 million on adult programmes including further education, work based learning, adult and community learning and other programmes. This increased to &pound;2,427 million in 2002&ndash;03 and to &pound;2,866 million in 2003&ndash;04. These figures are available from the LSC's published accounts. Figures for adult education for the years prior to 2001 are not comparable as the budget was split between a range of different organisations. My Department does not hold figures for adult education funding at local or regional levels. Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive has written to my hon.

	<p pid="c.1408W.2/2">In 2001&ndash;02 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) spent &pound;2,236 million on adult programmes including further education, work based learning, adult and community learning and other programmes.

Mark Haysom, the Council's chief executive has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/4" class="indent">I am writing to follow up the written answer given by the Minister of State, Bill Rammell, in response to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding funding for adult education courses in Coventry and the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/5" class="indent">I understand that you have recently met with Mike Bell, the Executive Director for Coventry and Warwickshire, and at that meeting you clarified the fact that your interest is in budgets for adults in general, not just those undertaking courses designated as adult education courses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/6" class="indent">In the academic year 2004&ndash;05, the West Midlands was allocated a budget of &pound;266.2m for adults. In addition, a further &pound;38.8m was allocated to Additional Learner Support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/7" class="indent">In the academic year 2005&ndash;06, the West Midlands was allocated a budget of &pound;246.3m for adults, with an additional &pound;40m for Additional Learner Support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/8" class="indent">I am unable to give you specific figures for Coventry South, as we allocate funds to individual institutions, which do not confine their recruitment to only part of the city.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/9" class="indent">I can, however, tell you that in 2004&ndash;5 Colleges in Coventry as a whole were allocated &pound;21.4m for adults, and &pound;20.5m in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/10" class="indent">As a whole, Coventry and Warwickshire LSC was allocated &pound;36.7m for adults in 2004&ndash;05, plus &pound;6.6m for Additional Learner Support, and &pound;36.6m in 2005&ndash;06, plus an additional &pound;6.7m for Additional Learner Support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/11" class="indent">Budgets are allocated to individual colleges and institutions based on their performance in previous years. Overall the LSC's budget has increased significantly since we were created in 2001 and has risen again this year. We welcome this increase in resources provided for post-16 learning by Government year-on-year but we also recognise that there will never be enough public money to meet all needs. Therefore we are seeking to encourage individuals and employers to engage in learning, but also make an appropriate contribution to the costs as I will explain below.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/12" class="indent">The reason for the slight drop in adult budgets between 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 is because of our focus on our priorities, as agreed with Government, We are committed to providing a place for every 16 to 18 year old, and Coventry and Warwickshire saw growth in participation by young people between 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. Our funding allocations to individual institutions in 2005&ndash;06 sought to recognise and address this achievement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/13" class="indent">Our adult budgets are therefore increasingly focused on fully-funding those adults who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills&mdash;'Skills for Life'&mdash;and those who lack a first Level 2 qualification, without which entering the labour market is very difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/14" class="indent">We continue to part-fund adults who already have a first level 2, and a wide range of Level 3 qualifications as our contribution to meeting skills needs at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/15" class="indent">We do, however, expect adults outside our fully-funded priority groups to make a contribution towards the cost of their learning as there will be beneficiaries economically. In 2005&ndash;06 we increased our expectations regarding the proportion of the cost of learning to be met by individual learners from 25%, where it had been fixed for some time, to 27,5%.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/16" class="indent">This increase in what we expect adults to pay will continue, by 2007&ndash;08 we expect adults to contribute 37.5% of the cost of learning. This will still mean that the public purse will subsidise 62.5% of the cost of adult learning, outside our fully-funded priority groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/17" class="indent">This clear focus of the LSC's resources on what we should fully-fund and part-fund is essential if we are to ensure that we make the greatest impact with public money, while encouraging others to recognise and invest in the true costs and benefits of learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1408W.2/18" class="indent">I know that you are meeting Mike Bell again shortly for a briefing on Coventry and Warwickshire LSC's plans. Mike will be happy to go into more detail on both the policy issues and budget issues if you wish.</p>

Its purpose is to provide administrative and operational support for the Bologna Follow Up Group leading up to the next meeting of Bologna Ministers in London in May 2007. The Department is working closely with the devolved UK Administrations and with the UK higher education sector to ensure effective implementation across the UK of commitments made under the Bologna Process.</p>

In doing that, we require all LAs to give serious consideration to whether the establishment of an academy would benefit one or more schools. It is only right that when we are making unprecedented levels of capital investment in schools, rising from &pound;5.5 billion in 2005&ndash;06 to &pound;6.3 billion in 2007&ndash;08, all LAs have robust plans in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.1413W.9/1">Funding for the Communication Aids Project comes to an end in March 2006. This DfES-funded initiative for school-age children has been successful but we have always made it clear, through the referral process and otherwise, that CAP was there to supplement, not replace, provision made locally. With other pressures on funding arising from the Government's ambitious agenda for education, it has not been possible to extend the funding for CAP.</p>
	<p pid="c.1413W.9/2">The Department has received a number of representations about funding for CAP, mainly approaches from hon. Members on behalf of constituents. These have been prompted either by the SCOPE Speak for Yourself&quot; campaign or a circular letter from the Manager of the ACE Centre North, one of the centres working within CAP.</p>
	<p pid="c.1413W.9/3">The Department has not recently initiated or evaluated any research on children who may require communication aids. We have, however, published an independent evaluation of the Communication Aids Project, work undertaken by University College London in conjunction with the University of York. The report was published in October 2004 as DfES Research Report 580 and it confirmed that CAP had positive benefits for the children being assisted and those working with them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1413W.9/4">Local service providers have a central role in meeting needs, including the needs of individuals with severely impaired communication. Where children are concerned, we would be looking to children's services, through children's trusts, to provide appropriate support and equipment to all disabled children. Adult needs would be met by local authorities and primary care trusts working together through their integrated community equipment services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1413W.9/5">Questions relating to research on adult needs, and funding associated with same, would be for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. I understand there has been no recent research on adults needing communication aids. However, guidance on communication aids is available on the Department of Health's Care Service Improvement Partnership Integrating Community Equipment Services (ICES) website. Getting Started&quot; is intended to support local commissioning and provision of appropriate services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1416W.2/2">Newly qualified dental graduates are required to undertake one year's vocational training before they may practise independently in the national health service. These vocational dental practitioners (VDPs), none of whom would have started specialist training in orthodontics at this stage, undergo the training in approved vocational training dental practices distributed across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1416W.2/3">In 2005, there were 14 training places in the Leicester area, 24 in Surrey and 624 in England as a whole. In 2005, 598 VDPs were appointed to these vocational training practices including 14 in the Leicester area. Information for earlier years is not held centrally. Given that the number of VDPs is largely determined by the number of dental undergraduates and there had been no significant increase in admissions to dental schools until we funded a major expansion from autumn 2005, it may, however, be assumed that these figures have remained fairly constant since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="c.1420W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1420W.5/4" class="indent">You asked which schools in the Peterborough local education authority area were rated <i>(a)</i> grade 1, <i>(b)</i> grade 2, <i>(c)</i> grade 3 and <i>(d)</i> grade 4 when last assessed by the Office for Standards in Education.</p>
	<p pid="c.1420W.5/5" class="indent">Inspectors have made a judgment about schools' overall effectiveness since January 2000. Until July 2005 this judgment was made using a seven point scale: excellent (1), very good (2), good (3), satisfactory (4), unsatisfactory (5), poor (6) and very poor (7). Since September 2005 the judgement has been made using a four point scale: outstanding (1), good (2), satisfactory (3) and inadequate (4). This response relates to schools' most recent inspection after January 2000. Four new schools were not inspected during that period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1420W.5/6" class="indent">The information is in the two tables attached. The first shows results from inspections in the period January 2000 to July 2005 and the second for inspections since September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1425W.8/1">The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are jointly implementing the national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy in England. In the five years to 2008 over &pound;1.5 billion is being invested (including &pound;686 million lottery funding) to implement the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1425W.8/2">The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of 5&ndash;16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week. The 2004/05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,498 schools taking part were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. In 2003/04 this figure was 62 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1425W.8/3">Spearheading this strategy is the creation of a national PE/sports infrastructure, by establishing a network of Sports Colleges and School Sport Partnerships (families of schools which work together). Hendon is in the London borough of Barnet, which currently has 85 schools within a School Sport Partnership. By September this year all maintained schools in the borough will be included within a partnership.</p>

Colleagues in the Communications and Media Team at Ufi have created a detailed spreadsheet, giving full contact details for each of these centres, including e-mail and website addresses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.5/4">This spreadsheet includes centres across three groupings, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.5/5" class="indent">Public library&mdash;As these are based in public libraries they are therefore open to the general public; and the access points in the libraries were funded through government money from the Capital Modernisation Fund (CMF) via the People's Network project.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.5/6" class="indent">Funded non library centres&mdash;These centres were funded through public money via the CMF, the vast majority of these are open to the public but some are restricted to specific user groups. The spreadsheet indicates whether they are open to the public or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.5/7" class="indent">Non funded&mdash;These centres did not receive government money. They were approved to use the UK online brand through one of three sponsor organisations, (Becta, Niace or e-skills), but received no public money. Most of these are open to the public, but some are not. Again the spreadsheet identifies these.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.5/8">Those centres not open to the public are likely to be for use for people in specific workplaces, residential care or community specific organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.5/9">The data on funding provided is not necessarily comprehensive, but are based on the information gathered since Ufi took on the management responsibility of UK online centres.</p>

The findings were published in a report entitled Improving the Take-Up of Free School Meals&quot; in May 2001. The report shows that pupils and parents considered that the quality and choice of food on offer can discourage take up.</p>

	<p pid="c.1432W.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills does not collect information on how many schools in Hendon serve healthy school meals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.5/2">The Government are determined to transform the quality of food in schools and supports the work local authorities and schools are doing to raise the nutritional standards of school meals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.5/3">In March 2005 the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, Ruth Kelly, announced a &pound;235 million package to transform the quality of school meals. In October 2005, as part of a three year package and paid as part of their Standards Fund Allocations, schools received a share of &pound;30 million to enable them to fund local improvements such as increased training and working hours for school cooks. A further &pound;60 million (&pound;30 million/&pound;30 million) will be paid in 2006 and 2007. Over the same period, local authorities will receive, &pound;130 million (&pound;30 million/&pound;50 million/&pound;50 million).</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.5/4">Barnet local authority received &pound;176,529 from the Targeted School Meals Grant for 2005&ndash;06. In addition, schools were each awarded a lump sum of &pound;1,070 per primary school and &pound;1,500 per secondary school, with an additional amount per pupil. The per pupil amount for PRUs and all schools except nursery schools is 50p; for nursery schools it is 50p for half of FTE pupils, to reflect the fact that fewer pupils in nursery schools take school meals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1433W.5/1">The Department does not hold information to be able to identify all the schools that have, or are, tackling this issue. It does support programmes which target underperformance, such as the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust's project for Raising Achievement Transforming Learning, which aims to challenge and empower schools to review their current practice and look at how to move this forward through engaging with mentor schools. In addition, the National Education Breakthrough Programme has successfully used rapid cycle change management to help schools raise the motivation, attendance and attainment of cohorts of underachieving boys.</p>
	<p pid="c.1433W.5/2">The Department also encourages schools to identify where there is underperformance, for example by using the Pupil Achievement Tracker, and to offer appropriately targeted support to those pupils. The introduction of School Improvement Partners for all schools will provide a further opportunity for schools to analyse and reflect on the progress made by all groups of pupils and to develop targeted improvement strategies to support those pupils whose progress has fallen behind expectations. Advice, guidance and resources are also available to schools and teachers from the Secondary National Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.1435W.5/1">Since September 1999 decisions on school closures have been determined by either <i>(a)</i> the relevant local authority (for proposals it published where there were no objections), <i>(b)</i> the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or, <i>(c)</i> where the SOC has been unable to agree a unanimous decision, the independent school adjudicator. Provisions contained within the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 do not allow Ministers to intervene in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/2">At their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">15 September</phrase>, Shropshire SOC unanimously agreed to approve the proposal submitted by Shropshire county council and the Governing Body of Bicton Primary school to discontinue Grafton Primary school and enlarge Bicton Primary school. Approval being conditional upon planning permission being granted for an enlargement to Bicton school.</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/3">As they were already reported, their reasons were:</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/4" class="indent">significant deficiencies in the present premises at both schools;</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/5" class="indent">the children of both schools would benefit from education provided in 21st century surroundings;</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/6" class="indent">implications of further travel to school did not outweigh the clear benefits of the new provision;</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/7" class="indent">the proposal did not reduce denominational provision and admissions and the admissions policy was not based on denominational criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.1435W.5/8">Overall, the Committee considered that the evidence presented was strongly in favour of the proposals and that the best interests of both staff and pupils would be met by SOC approval. Shropshire county council are now under a statutory duty to implement the proposal as approved by the SOC. Given this statutory position the Secretary of State is unable to meet the parents of children from Grafton school.</p>

	<p pid="c.1445W.3/1">The LSC is embarking upon a major transformation programme that will make it a smaller, more dynamic and more customer-focused organisation. This will build upon its existing strengths; further develop its relationships with providers and with its partners, and help push the highest proportion of its funding out through colleges and providers into front line delivery. At local level, the LSC will develop small teams of professional staff who will support the delivery of its priority objectives through strategic relationships with colleges, providers and other key stakeholders and so ensure that the needs of local employers and learners are met. I fully support the changes the LSC is making as I believe it will help bring about an organisation that is fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/2">The LSC continues to consult widely on the detail of the restructuring proposals. The effects on organisation and staffing are matters for the LSC. Mark Haysom, the LSC's chief executive, has written to my hon. Friends with further information. And a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/4" class="indent">I write in response to your Parliamentary Question on the future of the Learning and Skills Council in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/5" class="indent">As we have previously discussed the LSC has embarked on our agenda for change this is a radical and transformational programme of six themes to change the further education sector to better meet the needs of employers, to continue to raise quality of provision, simplify funding, share data collection, build business excellence within the sector, and to build the sector's reputation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/6" class="indent">If we are to do this, the LSC must change too. We have introduced a seventh theme of transformation of the LSC itself, strengthening our ability to work locally, while sharing a number of common functions at the regional level. I believe that we can achieve this at a cost saving of approximately &pound;40m and with around 1,300 fewer posts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/7" class="indent">Across the country there will be some 183 local partnership and economic development teams. These teams of highly skilled and experienced education and training professionals will be responsible for developing strategic relationships with colleges, schools and training providers and with our key local stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/8" class="indent">To support them, we will provide more efficient and effective services at regional level. Building on our experience of regional working to date, we want to create centres in each region from which operational services will be delivered. We will also strengthen the regional level in order that we can respond to regional skills priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/9" class="indent">With a stronger regional tier, we have the opportunity to reduce the size of out National Office, We will only do nationally that which must be done nationally-for example, building relationships with national stakeholders and providing clear frameworks to ensure consistency across the LSC.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/10" class="indent">These changes will mean that for the Coventry and Warwickshire LSC area we will have approximately 27 people working in two local partnership teams-one for Coventry and one for Warwickshire-and a single economic development team. The new arrangements will provide a closer working relationship between the employers, the LSC, colleges and providers, and other local stakeholders, making the system more responsive to local needs and better able to work for the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1445W.3/11" class="indent">Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further information you require.</p>

	<p pid="c.1448W.2/1">My hon. Friend and I receive regular performance reports and have regular meetings with the LSC to discuss performance. The LSC leads on delivering four PSA targets: skills for life, apprenticeships, level 2 at 19 and adult level 2. Since its inception in 2001, the LSC has had a strong record of success. It has delivered two key PSAs: the 2004 skills for life target and the 2005 apprenticeship target. It is leading on delivery of the level 2 at 19 target set for 2006 and 2008&mdash;current indications are that the 2006 target is likely to be met. The LSC also lead on the adult level 2 target for 2010 and current estimates show that the 2007 milestone will be met.</p>
	<p pid="c.1448W.2/2">As well as reporting to Ministers, the LSC has its own internal performance management system. This includes performance reporting and review by its council and management group on a regular basis and a six monthly scrutiny by the chief executive of each of the nine regions, including London, through a formal performance review with the regional directors. In addition, the LSC's annual report includes details of the performance against targets of each of the local LSCs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1448W.2/3">In line with overall performance the LSC is performing well in London. Mark Haysom, the LSC's chief executive, has written to my hon. Friend with an assessment of the LSC's performance in London and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="c.1452W.0/1">The London Academy opened in September 2004 and has already made excellent progress in improving educational opportunities for young people in the Barnet area. The proportion of pupils gaining 5 or more good GCSEs increased in 2005 to 48 per cent. up nine percentage points from the 39 per cent. achieved in the last year of the predecessor school.</p>
	<p pid="c.1452W.0/2">Ofsted have recently made a monitoring visit to London Academy and reported that Pupils' rapid progress is a testimony to the positive ethos for learning.&quot; The Academy has risen to the top five per cent of schools nationally for progress for 11 to 14 year olds, and the top three per cent for 14 to 16 year olds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1452W.0/3">This is a particularly impressive achievement given that the Academy serves some of the most socially deprived wards in the country. Over 45 per cent. of the pupils in Years 7 to 10 are entitled to free school meals, increasing to 57 per cent. in Year 11; over half of the pupils are from minority ethnic groups; well over a third of the pupils have a language other than English; and a similar percentage have a special educational need. The Academy is also a local authority-designated base for 30 pupils with speech and communication difficulties.</p>

A number of other factors outside a school's control, such as pupils' gender or their level of deprivation, have been observed to affect pupil results, even after allowing for prior attainment. Contextual Value Added (CVA) measures aim also to take into account other pupil and school factors which have a significant effect on pupils' progress. CVA measures, by adjusting for these intake differences, reflect more realistically the impact each school makes.</p>

The PANDA Reports inform school inspections, but data do not determine the judgements made by inspectors. The reports can also be used by schools to help their own self-evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1457W.2/2" class="indent">All providers must ensure that, as part of the selection procedures, candidates admitted for training have taken part in a group or individual interview.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/3">Guidance is provided on pages 70 and 71 of the Handbook&quot; and provides examples of the kinds of evidence that would be used in order to assess whether candidates have the full range of qualities needed to be a successful teacher. Guidance also notes the requirement for partnership schools to be involved in the selection process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/4">The monitoring of selection and entry procedures is undertaken by Ofsted. Every Ofsted inspection of an accredited ITT provider will provide a judgement about the quality of the management and quality assurance of training provision Through interview and other mechanisms, all providers must make judgments of every applicant in accordance with the Requirements. These include judgments relating to:</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/5" class="indent">Capability of an applicant to meet the Standards</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/6" class="indent">GCSE or equivalent entry criteria</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/7" class="indent">Physical and mental fitness to teach</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/8" class="indent">Criminal background</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/9" class="indent">Communication skills</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/10" class="indent">Degree held (in the case of PGCE)</p>
	<p pid="c.1457W.2/11">However, providers may set their own entry requirements additional to those prescribed by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="c.1460W.3/1">Every Child a Reader (ECAR) is a three-year programme which aims to help 5,000 five- and six-year-olds learn to read by placing specialist literacy teachers, trained in 'Reading Recovery', into schools to provide intensive one-to-one support to children most in need. The programme will also explore the potential for those teachers to support tailored literacy teaching more broadly within a school. ECAR is currently funded by the KPMG Foundation, the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, the Indigo Trust, JJ Charitable Trust, and the SHINE Trust in partnership with the DfES. Further sponsors are being sought. The KPMG Foundation are also funding the appointment of an experienced educationalist to manage the programme, working with the Primary National Strategy and the Institute of Education.</p>
	<p pid="c.1460W.3/2">Every Child a Reader began in September 2005. It is too early to say what the overall results of the programme will be. ECAR has commissioned an evaluation study to compare the progress of 200 children in London schools supported in 2005&ndash;06 through the ECAR programme with the progress of 200 children in schools not involved. The study will also evaluate the impact of the ECAR programme on overall standards in the schools involved. The results of the evaluation study will be available in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1462W.2/1">All local authorities now have a named individual responsible for receiving details of children found missing education, and for brokering support for them through the most appropriate agencies. From contacts with the named individuals, we know that while some local authorities and their partners have improved their wider arrangements to identify such children, progress is patchy. The Government have recently commissioned a research organisation to conduct an independent survey of all local authorities to assess in more detail their progress in this area. We expect to publish the results in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1462W.2/2">The Government are concerned about any child missing education, as it is not just the child's educational attainment that is at risk, but also potentially his/her safety and welfare. That is why we signalled our intention, in the White Paper 'Higher Standards Better Schools for All', to introduce in the Education and Inspections Bill a new statutory duty on all local authorities to make arrangements to identify children missing education.</p>

	<p pid="c.1465W.3/1">Every maintained primary, secondary nursery, special school and pupil referral unit in Swindon local authority received a school meals grant in October 2005. Schools were each awarded a lump sum of &pound;1,070 per primary school and &pound;1,500 per secondary school, with an additional amount per pupil. The per pupil amount for PRUs and all schools except nursery schools is 50p; for nursery schools it is 50p for half of FTE pupils, to reflect the fact that fewer pupils in nursery schools take school meals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.3/2">The funding distributed in October 2005 was the first of three years of transitional funding which we have encouraged schools to put towards making sustainable improvements in school food and drink. The allocation formula to schools will remain the same for all three years of the grant.</p>

	<p pid="c.1475W.6/1">The Sector Skills Council (SSC) license does not contain any specific obligations or requirements around the level of employer sourced funding for SSCs. Consequently, there are no network level explicit targets for employer financial contributions for SSCs to be assessed against.</p>
	<p pid="c.1475W.6/2">It should be stressed however that SSCs are encouraged to source funding from employers and other sources where appropriate, recognising that SSCs have been set up to be the voice of employers. The current level of Government sponsor funding for the network is a contribution to the core cost of an effective SSC so alternative funding sources need to be developed. In this context, the SSDA aims to facilitate employer income contributions where appropriate and there is the long term expectation that SSCs, as employer led organisations, will seek to develop additional funding sources.</p>

	<p pid="c.1476W.5/1">The Department supports parents who wish to learn sign language through a public subsidy of sign language courses delivered through further education colleges. In 2004/05 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), the body that plans and funds post-16 education and training in England, supported 21,491 learners on sign language courses, at a cost of more than &pound;6.7 million. Although we can not specifically identify parents of deaf children separately among these learners we know the majority of them (90 per cent.) were not people with a learning difficulty and/or disability. Therefore, the vast majority of learners on sign language courses do not have a hearing impairment but are undertaking the course for a variety of other reasons which will commonly include being a parent or other relative of a hearing impaired person. We do not currently have comparable data available for 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.1476W.5/2">Throughout the prioritisation of funding for 2006/07 we have been clear that provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities remains a priority and that the LSC has been explicit in its strategic planning guidance to ensure funding for non basic or level 2 employability skills, which accounts for the majority of adult funding available, should be prioritised for courses for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, as well as programmes for those that work with this group which include courses such as lip-reading, sign language and Braille.</p>
	<p pid="c.1476W.5/3">There are also measures in place to ensure that learners with low incomes who are in receipt of means tested benefits will receive free tuition on publicly funded courses. For adult learners facing barriers to learning, Learner Support Funds (LSF) provides additional financial support to people undertaking learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1476W.5/4">Where learners are not receiving a means tested benefit the provider may waive fees at their discretion and may make use of LSF in order to provide support. In 2004/05 we know that around half of learners undertaking sign language courses paid no fees either as a result of being on means tested benefits or due to the discretion of the provider.</p>

Following a thorough joint investigation by the police, social services, the NSPCC and Education Welfare that involved St. James Independent school for senior boys, no further action is being taken by the Metropolitan police.

Through the Rewarding and Developing Staff initiative (R&amp;DS), we have supported HEIs in developing their human resource capability including recruitment and retention as a priority area. A recent evaluation carried out for the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) by KPMG identified that about &pound;66 million (of the total &pound;370 million R&amp;DS funding 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04) had been spent on recruitment and retention. The Department has also implemented, through HEFCE, a 'Golden Hello' programme of funding to encourage new entrants into teaching shortage subjects.</p>
