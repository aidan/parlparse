	<p pid="d.1093W.3/2">The Government believe that agri-environment schemes are the key tool for delivering their objectives for the natural environment. Our schemes are supported by a &#163;1.4 million/year monitoring and evaluation programme and a &#163;2.1 million/year research programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.3/3">Both these programmes contribute to the growing evidence base relating to the scheme objectives for wildlife, landscape, the historic environment, resource protection and access.

	<p pid="d.1093W.6/1">Healthy chalk streams need enough water of the right quality together with suitable habitats to ensure productive angling.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.6/2">Across England there is a lot to do as only a quarter of chalk streams are currently regarded as-healthy according to the water framework directive (WFD). Making the required improvements to address the impacts of land use, abstraction, urbanisation and diffuse pollution will require concerted action by statutory organisations and others including water companies and fishery owners.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.6/3">In the long-term, Restoring Sustainable Abstraction (RSA) and the Periodic Review of Water Companies are some of the programmes that the Environment Agency (EA) and Ofwat are implementing. Additionally, the WFD is driving extensive work programs to deliver sustainable river restoration which will directly benefit our lakes and rivers. In the Water White Paper, due in the autumn, we are looking to make some changes which will improve the efficiency of the RSA programme. We will also provide more details on our plans to reform the abstraction management system to provide clearer signals to abstractors to make the necessary investments to meet water needs and protect ecosystem functioning.</p>
	<p pid="d.1093W.6/4">2011 has been an exceptionally dry year so far; the EA is watching the situation carefully to ensure there is enough water for people and the environment.</p>

	<p pid="d.1095W.0/2">I confirm that there is a long standing history of representation from UK angling interests to increase the current minimum landing size (MLS) for sea bass, to achieve a better match to the size at which bass reach sexual maturity. A significant proportion of the commercial bass fishery, however, features vessels using trawled gear in a mixed fishery, which means the issue of raising the MLS is complex. To prevent a large increase in discards of bass in commercial fisheries using the most commonly applied mesh size range, the vessels would need to alter their fishing gear design or fishing practices to avoid catching or retaining under-sized bass.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095W.0/3">The current MLS is set out in EU legislation, and there will be a review and update of the overall package of technical measures, including MLSs where still applied following the Common Fisheries Policy reform process. This is the best means to determine agreed standards needed for any fishing gear and MLS which would apply to all member states involved in the fishery.</p>

	<p pid="d.1114W.2/1">The contribution of new drugs and technologies on the levels of tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries could be significant, but there are limitations. While most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 elimination target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of improved diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent TB infection and active disease. Recent modelling for the WHO has suggested that a combination of a neonatal pre-exposure TB vaccine, a two-month treatment regimen effective against drug-susceptible and resistant strains of TB, and a novel point-of-care diagnostic test could potentially reduce the incidence of TB by 71%. There are, however, questions remaining about the effect of these in high HIV prevalent areas.</p>

	<p pid="d.1117W.3/1">The Government strongly support the right to freedom of religion or belief. Our embassy in Tel Aviv routinely raise concerns about freedom of religion or belief with the Israelis.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117W.3/2">We have received no evidence of any problems for religious groups within green line Israel. Most of the problems that different religious groups suffer in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories stem from the ongoing occupation and the mutual mistrust that characterises Israeli-Palestinian relations. This is one of the reasons why we lay so much emphasis on resolving the conflict. The only way to resolve the conflict is via the two state solution and we urge both parties to return to negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117W.3/3">Israel's Declaration of Independence guarantees freedom of religion for all Israel's inhabitants. However, we remain deeply concerned about restrictions on freedom of movement between the west bank and east Jerusalem. It remains difficult for Palestinians to enter east Jerusalem for work, education, medical treatment or religious worship. We have lobbied the Israelis hard on the issue of movement and access.</p>

Last year the Department for International Development provided &#163;2 million to UNHCR to meet the basic relief needs of 20,000 refugees during 2010 and 2011. We are deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation and have offered further support to UNHCR. Dadaab is heavily congested and the conditions for many new arrivals is unacceptable.

	<p pid="d.1118W.9/2">In 2010, Somali refugees were generally able to access an adequate level and quality of basic humanitarian aid in Kenya and Ethiopia, although Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya had become very congested. However, the increased number of refugees fleeing from South Somalia in 2011 is straining the capacity of the camps, authorities and humanitarian agencies to respond adequately.</p>
	<p pid="d.1118W.9/3">The UK Government provided &#163;2 million in Kenya to meet the basic relief needs of 20,000 refugees in 2010-11. In Ethiopia, DFID (with other donors) is providing support to the refugee camps through a pooled humanitarian fund. In 2010-11, the fund provided around &#163;1.5 million for water and nutrition interventions. Given the deteriorating situation, my Department is working with other donors to support humanitarian agencies in scaling up their response and ensure new refugees have greater access to basic services, including water, health, nutrition, food and shelter. We also continue to press the Government of Kenya on the need to allocate more space for refugee camps, and already have an existing and growing programme of humanitarian assistance in the areas of Somalia the refugees are fleeing from.</p>

I commend the parties for coming together and setting this first milestone. However, much more needs to be done. The Framework Agreement on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile provides for the completion of the popular consultation process that formed a part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. However, for civilians to take part in consultations and talks on their own future, they must have freedom of movement and speech so they can participate fully and freely.

	<p pid="d.1131W.2/2">The British Crime survey (BCS) provides estimates on the proportion of domestic violence incidents reported to the police. The survey has two measures: one collected in the context of a face-to-face interview and a second based on answers to a self-completion questionnaire.</p>
	<p pid="d.1131W.2/3">The measure of domestic violence included in the main BCS relates to any physical assault by a partner or ex-partner, relative or household member. The most recently published figure from the 2009-10 BCS shows that 41% of such incidents were reported to the police. It is known that incidents of domestic violence are under-estimated as some victims may not be willing to disclose their victimisation in the context of a face-to-face interview.</p>
	<p pid="d.1131W.2/4">The self-completion module provides more privacy to respondents and is thought to yield greater disclosure by victims. The self-completion section provides a measure of &#8220;partner abuse&#8221; which is broader and covers physical force, non-physical emotional or financial abuse or threats to hurt the respondent or someone close to them carried out by a current or former partner. The latest estimate from the 2008-09 BCS, shows that 16% of victims of partner abuse reported the incident to the police.</p>
	<p pid="d.1131W.2/5">This reporting figure is lower that that for the main domestic violence measure and is thought to partly reflect the wider measure of abuse that it includes. It may also be that victims who are willing to disclose victimisation to an interviewer are more likely to report incidents to the police.</p>

This includes taking appropriate action to deal with fraud and malpractice which it takes extremely seriously. As a risk-based regulator, the Commission will continue to intervene decisively in individual cases where the identified risk to public confidence is substantial and where it can have most impact. I am confident that the Commission can continue to be an effective regulator of charities in England and Wales within the resources allocated it.</p>

	<p pid="d.1138W.9/1">Attainment at age 16 is the most important factor in determining later participation in education and training.

	<p pid="d.1138W.9/2">There is a strong link between disadvantage and young people's likelihood of participating post-16 and the Pupil Premium will give schools extra funding to spend on interventions that support the attainment of disadvantaged pupils. For those young people facing financial barriers to education post-16, we have introduced a &#163;180 million bursary scheme for 16 to 19-year-olds to provide better targeted financial support to those who need it.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.9/3">Local authorities have duties to provide sufficient suitable education and training places for young people aged 16 to 19, track their participation and provide targeted support to all those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) to help them to re-engage. Local authorities will know best what type of support is needed to address the particular barriers that young people face in their area, and we are funding this through the Early Intervention Grant.</p>

	<p pid="d.1150W.5/2">The response also acknowledged the strong value of a national college for fire and rescue service training, but explained that we believed that the Fire Service College could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors (whether private, public or voluntary) in its ownership, operation and governance. We therefore undertook to explore with the sector and other organisations options to secure the future of the college.</p>

	<p pid="d.1151W.6/2">While each fire and rescue authority is responsible for their own policy on procurement, they should constantly search for the best value for money in delivering their services. Outsourcing the provision of capital equipment can be one such way, provided the precise terms and conditions of the contract represent value for money in the long-term. The terms of these contracts, and the implications of any service failure, are a matter for the individual fire and rescue authorities themselves.

	<p pid="d.1154W.2/1">Firebuy Ltd, which helped deliver procurement efficiencies and collaboration for local fire and rescue authorities in England through nationally negotiated contracts, is closing in summer 2011 as part of the Government review of arm&#8217;s length bodies. It was not a function that needed to be undertaken by central Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1154W.2/2">All of Firebuy's procurement functions have been transferred to alternative organisations. The 17 framework contracts were formally novated to Wiltshire county council with The Consortium for Purchasing and Distribution Ltd managing these on Wiltshire's behalf. This ensures that there is continuity of the existing arrangements. Fire and rescue authorities have been encouraged to continue to use these contracts to maintain the benefits of collaborative procurement though procurement is a matter for them to decide on based on their operational requirements.</p>
	<p pid="d.1154W.2/3">Procurement arrangements have also been considered as part of the consultation on the future of fire and rescue control services in England. The fire sector is best placed to develop procurement models that ensure standards are adopted where necessary, so that the benefits of interoperability and collaborative procurement can be realised.</p>

	<p pid="d.1155W.9/1">The reference in <i>Hansard</i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-20">20 June 2011</phrase> should have been to local authorities&#8217; integrated risk management plans, not integrated resource management plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.1155W.9/2">The Government are committed to enabling local authorities and local communities to make appropriate decisions at the local level. Fire and rescue authorities are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. Each fire and rescue authority's plan enables that individual authority to decide how best to provide fire and rescue-related services, including prevention and protection as well as response, with resources being allocated on the basis of the evaluation of risk and where the risks are greatest.</p>
	<p pid="d.1155W.9/3">Local requirements are thus determined by local people according to local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="d.1164W.3/1">The Secretary of State has not made any recent economic assessment for High Speed one rail line in respect of Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford. However, London and Continental Railway had commissioned an independent study carried out by Colin Buchanan and Voleterra on the economic impact of HS1 in 2009. A web link of the final copy of the report can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1164W.3/3">In addition, cost-benefit ratios were also calculated during the construction stages of the project using the methodology of the time. Information on these is available in National Audit Office reports dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-28">28 March 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>.

This is because there are some vehicles registered as heavy goods vehicles that do not carry freight, including, for instance, cranes, cement mixers and some vehicles used in the building trade.

	<p pid="d.1172W.3/2">Department for Transport Ministers have received representations from the sustainable biodiesel industry and officials meet regularly with a number of organisations to discuss a range of transport matters including the operation of the RTFO.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.3/3">As part of the Government's measures to address climate change, the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) ensures a growing proportion of UK road transport fuels are from sustainable renewable sources. The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase efficiency of compliance. The value of individual renewable transport fuel certificates is determined by the market and depends upon the relative cost of supplying biofuel and fossil fuels. We continue to monitor and report on the impact of the RTFO and consider that to date the RTFO has met its objective of driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.3/4">We are currently considering responses to a consultation proposing amendments to the RTFO to implement the transport elements of the renewable energy directive. These proposals include providing twice the financial support to waste-derived biofuels as will be provided to conventional biofuels, through the award of two renewable transport certificates per litre of waste derived biofuel. Crop-derived biofuels will continue to receive one certificate per litre and no support will be awarded to biofuels that do not meet required sustainability standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.3/5">There is no plan to have the 20p duty differential for used cooking oil derived biodiesel in 2020. However, research undertaken on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change suggests that there is a potential UK-sourced used cooking oil resource of around 250,000 tonnes per year. If all of this resource were to be used as biodiesel in the transport sector, this would contribute roughly 10% of the effort required to meet the renewable energy directive transport sector sub-target.</p>

As these proposals do not affect the day to day operational interface with partners such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), it was not appropriate for RNLI launches to have been a factor in their detailed development. These proposals envisage a national SAR co-ordination network which will enable Coastguards to co-ordinate incidents around the UK from any location.</p>

	<p pid="d.1186W.5/1">&#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221; sets out our commitment to expand radiotherapy capacity by investing over &#163;150 million in additional funding over the next four years. This additional funding was included in the financial settlement for the spending review period 2011-12 to 2014-15 and will be included in primary care trust (PCT) baseline allocations, alongside the existing funding for radiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186W.5/2">Recurrent revenue allocations are currently made to PCTs on the basis of a weighted capitation formula, used to determine PCTs' target shares of available resources to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need. Funding for specific services is not identified at PCT-level, it is for PCTs to decide how to use their funding to commission services, including radiotherapy services, to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations, taking account of local and national priorities. We have said we will investigate the potential development of a range of tariffs to incentivise high quality, cost-effective services, including the newest radiotherapy techniques, once the standard radiotherapy tariff has been introduced. It is anticipated that a national currency for radiotherapy will be introduced for contracting in April 2012, with prices agreed locally. Feedback from the service on the use of these currencies will inform decisions on when it would be appropriate to introduce a mandatory national tariff, which is likely to be no earlier than 2013-14.</p>

To support this, and provide the right safeguards, we will reform the regulatory framework. We intend to consult on our proposals for a single, transparent regulatory framework, including removal of barriers to entry, to cover all institutions that want to be part of the English higher education system from August until October 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.1204W.5/1">Where the court is proposing to make, vary or discharge (i) an order under section 8 of the Children Act 1989 for contact, residence, a specific issue or a prohibited steps order (private law cases) and this is opposed by any party to the proceedings, or (ii) an order under Part IV of the Act for a care or supervision order or other connected matters (public law cases) then the court must have regard to the factors set out at section 1(3) of the Act, commonly known as the &#8216;welfare checklist&#8217;. Ascertaining the wishes and feelings of the child concerned, in the light of their age and understanding, is one of those factors.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204W.5/2">The court can seek the help of the Children Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS or CAFCASS Cymru in Wales) to fulfil its responsibility to take account of the ascertainable wishes and feelings of children who are the subject of family proceedings. CAFCASS or CAFCASS Cymru officers will meet with children and families, and report to the Court in order to fulfil this role.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204W.5/3">In cases where there are disputes between parents about future arrangements for their children, more than one meeting may need to take place. The court also has powers under the Family Procedure Rules 2010 to make a child a party to the proceedings, enabling the child to have separate legal representation, where the circumstances of the case dictate that this will be in the child's best interests.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204W.5/4">In public law cases, where a local authority has made an application to take a child into care, the court will appoint a CAFCASS or CAFCASS Cymru officer to the role of guardian for the child. Children's guardians will represent the interests of the child in court, and will also instruct a solicitor to represent the child in circumstances where the child is too young, or is unable to do so themselves.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204W.5/5">Where a court determines any question in relation to the upbringing of a child, the Children Act 1989 requires the court to make the welfare of the child its paramount consideration. The wishes and feelings of the child, so far as these are ascertainable, are an important consideration but will not necessarily be the determining factor in any decision made by the court.</p>

	<p pid="d.1205W.5/1">Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service does not have a contact centre function dedicated to dealing with family court queries. However we are currently piloting the use of contact centres to deal with the whole range of county court business and exploring how we can develop this type of facility for our business more generally.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205W.5/2">In April 2010 a telephony helpdesk pilot was set up to test the feasibility of centralised call handling. The pilot was based at Coventry county court and from April 2010 until January 2011 managed all telephone inquiries for county courts including Coventry, Nuneaton, Stratford, Rugby and Warwick. In addition, in January 2011 the helpdesk began to take telephone inquiries for Croydon county court.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205W.5/3">For the period April 2010 to March 2011, the helpdesk received a total 62,978 calls. This figure represents the number of calls received for both civil and family business. Information on the number or proportion of calls which related to family business is not held. All family business calls with the exception of adoption inquiries, which are referred back to specialist teams in courts, were dealt with at the helpdesk.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205W.5/4">In parallel with this pilot we have also established a centralised telephone call function for all county court work in two other areas. In Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Thames Valley a central contact centre dealt with approximately 129,000 calls between April 2010 and March 2011. In Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk a central contact centre answered approximately 210,000 calls during the same period. Again we do not have a breakdown of the split of calls between civil and family work.</p>

	<p pid="d.1209W.2/1">All prisoner transfer agreements (PTA) to which the United Kingdom is a signatory require the agreement of the other jurisdiction before a transfer is effected. None provide for the unfettered transfer of a sentenced prisoner to their country of origin. Most current agreements also require the consent of the prisoner but a number do not.</p>
	<p pid="d.1209W.2/2">The Government believe that wherever possible foreign national prisoners should serve their sentences in their own country and Government policy is to negotiate prisoner transfer agreements wherever they can. However, they cannot compel other states to conclude such agreements or to take back their nationals for the purpose of serving a prison sentence.</p>
	<p pid="d.1209W.2/3">The United Kingdom is a signatory to the additional protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the transfer of sentenced persons and also has bilateral agreements with Rwanda and Libya which do not require the consent of the prisoner. However, the additional protocol requires certain criteria to be met before transfer, specifically that a deportation order should be in place.</p>
	<p pid="d.1209W.2/4">In December 2011 the United Kingdom will implement the EU PTA. This will require the receiving member state to accept a prisoner who meets the criteria for transfer and does not require the prisoner to consent.

	<p pid="d.1212W.0/1">The Criminal Injuries Compensation scheme (the scheme), which is set by Parliament, compensates people based on the injuries they sustain not the crime of which they were a victim. The &#8216;tariff of injuries&#8217;, which is the part of the scheme that assigns specific injuries standard amounts of compensation, contains several injury descriptions that could apply to people who have been sexually assaulted, a subset of which are most likely to apply to victims of rape. The figures CICA are able to produce, which follow, are therefore based on claims where they paid awards for these injury descriptions.</p>
