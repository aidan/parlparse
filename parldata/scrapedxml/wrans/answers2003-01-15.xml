	<p pid=".607W.7/1">The Commission has no plans for Westminster Hall. It has, however, been aware of growing pressure for the better welcome and reception of constituents and other visitors to the Palace of Westminster and to give them a better understanding of the work of Parliament. The Commission agrees with the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons that a Visitor Centre would be desirable; such facilities are provided in many other Parliaments around the world. We therefore commissioned a feasibility study from the consultants Haley Sharpe and the conservation architects Purcell Miller Tritton. That study reviewed options for the siting of such a centre, and proposed a scheme consisting of a new security/reception building at the western end of the Jubilee Caf&eacute; and elements of a Visitor Centre in the accommodation outside the west wall of Westminster Hall, with the option of providing further facilities in Victoria Tower Gardens.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.7/2">The Commission considered the consultants' report, recognised the sensitivity of the Westminster Hall location, and asked the consultants to carry out further studies of possible sites outside the Parliamentary Estate. In due course the Commission will consider the results of these studies, together with the views of the Modernisation and Finance and Services Committees, the Domestic Committees, the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association United Kingdom Branch, the Inter-Parliamentary Union British Group and individual hon. Members. Any final decision would need to be agreed with the authorities of the House of Lords.</p>

In 2003, it is estimated that 41 Wednesday mornings will be available for tours and that 740 constituents a day could have access to the Line of Route, with a further 1,200 on Wednesday afternoons during Adjournments. This greater throughput is possible due to a more efficient operation following the creation of the Central Tours Office.</p>

	<p pid=".609W.9/1">As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, the UK is required annually to compile an inventory of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.9/2">The main greenhouse gases emitted from farming are methane from enteric fermentation in livestock and agricultural waste disposal, and nitrous oxide from fertiliser use. There are also emissions of carbon dioxide from agricultural energy use and liming of soils. Emissions are calculated from agricultural data including animal numbers and fertiliser usage produced by DEFRA, energy statistics from DTI, plus factors to relate these data to actual emissions. The data are recorded in the UK greenhouse gas inventory and show that overall emissions from agriculture fell by about 11.5 per cent. between 1990 and 2000. Agriculture also contributes to emissions from land use change, which fell by about 20 per cent. over the same period.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.9/3">Greenhouse gas emissions for the food industry are not identified separately in the inventory, although they are included with other industrial emissions. Separate studies undertaken by my Department suggest that end user carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in the food industry fell by about 25 per cent. over the period 1990 to 2000. This includes the food industry's share of emissions at power stations due to electricity generation, and it is the fall in power station emissions due to fuel switching that is main reason for the decrease in emissions from this sector.</p>

	<p pid=".610W.8/2">Rainfall over the final days of December and the beginning of January was close to the average for the whole month of December. This fell on a saturated catchment in which rivers were already running bankfull. Under these circumstances, there is little that can be done by the Agency to alleviate flooding if defences are not already in place. Early indications are that this was the third most severe floods in this area since records began in 1882, being exceeded only by the floods of 1894 and 1947. In recent years, the Agency has conducted public awareness campaigns to make those at risk aware of that risk and to provide information and advice on how people can help themselves. In this instance, the Agency takes the view that their operations will have had no adverse effects on river levels either in Medmenham or Marlow.</p>

Extra flood defences in the form of flood banks were constructed in Cookham to reduce the risk to this village. Marlow is 5 km upstream of Cookham and Medmenham further upstream and, as such, the Environment Agency takes the view that the Jubilee River has no impact, adverse or otherwise, on either community.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.5/2">The Government are committed to minimising the adverse environmental impact of pesticide use, consistent with adequate crop protection. A voluntary agreement on measures to reduce the environmental damage caused by pesticides was entered into by the industry and other stakeholders in April 2001. Provided the Voluntary Initiative is fully implemented, it should reduce the environmental impacts of pesticides and the Government remain committed to this approach. However, the Government are carrying out further work and analysis on a possible tax or other economic instrument, should the Voluntary Initiative fail to deliver its objectives within a reasonable timescale.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.5/3">The study referred to in the question has not yet been commissioned. Officials are in the process of commissioning work to develop a framework to enable subsequent assessment of the Voluntary Initiative. This will complement the indicators and targets put together by the Voluntary Initiative Steering Group and will, in particular, enable a comparison of the environmental benefits of the Voluntary Initiative and of a possible pesticides tax. The study is intended to be completed by the summer and will subsequently be published.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.0/1">The statutory bodies that are principally responsible for water quality, species, pollution, and flora &amp; fauna protection are the Environment Agency, English Nature and the Lake District National Park Authority.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/2">The Environment Agency is responsible for enforcing statutory controls on the entry of pollutants to controlled waters, and has specific duties in relation to protecting aquatic species. It is also the co-ordinator for the Bassenthwaite Lake Restoration Project that was set up last year to ensure an integrated approach to tackling the complex, longstanding pressures on the lake.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/3">All public bodies have a statutory duty to to take reasonable steps, consistent with the exercise of their functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the features for which the lake has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Since the lake forms part of the River Derwent and Bassenthwaite Lake candidate Specal Area of Conservation, further duties on all statutory authorities in exercising their functions must have due regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/4">Given its central role in the restoration programme and its duties in relation to fisheries, the Environment Agency is best placed to report on the health, breeding and distribution of fish species. The Derwent Salmon Action Plan consultation document contains information on the salmon population status in the Derwent catchment for the period 1990 to 2000. For most years the population achieved a considerable surplus over its conservation target. The most recent reliable data (for 2000) shows that the population level was almost double the conservation limit, indicating the population to be in very good health.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/5">There is less information on the status of species in the lake but available evidence suggests that the Vendace population is low. This is thought to be due to siltation of their spawning grounds and competition and predation from alien species, probably introduced by anglers. Recent bye-laws regulating the use of dead and live bait will control further introductions. The Environment Agency will be pleased to supply further information.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/6">The Agency can also supply details of permitted discharges. The condition of the lake is considered stable owing to improvements to Keswick sewage treatment works. Planned investment should deliver further improvements. The Environment Agency will consider what further improvements may be necessary for the investment period 2005&ndash;2010 and is carrying out a study to assess the potential for removal of phospherus in the lakebed sediment. Discharges of untreated sewage are very dilute and not thought to add significantly to the overall nutrient load.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/7">Diffuse sources of phosphorus and sediment pollution need to be addressed. Action under the restoration programme will need to include research to identify sources and causes of erosion and siltation; physical improvements to infrastructure including sewerage systems, farmsteads and highways; and improvements to agricultural practice through education and awareness campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.0/8">Occurrences of blue green algal blooms have been recorded on: <phrase class="date" code="1998-12-04">4 December 1998</phrase>; <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-01">1 May 2000</phrase>; <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-19">19 September 2000</phrase>; and <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-20">20 September 2002</phrase>. Controlling the total amount of phosphorus entering the lake will help to limit loads overall may reduce the frequency and extent of all types of algal bloom but will not eliminate them entirely sicne they are a natural feature of this type of lake and form as a result of the interaction of a number of variables including climatic conditions, lake chemistry, wind speed and hours of sunlight.</p>

	<p pid=".616W.2/2">However, the arrangements for prioritising Defra's funding of flood and coastal defence capital works have already been revised to take more specific account of Xpeople&quot; and environmental issues. For schemes considered for approval from April 2003, the priority scores will be based on economics, Xpeople&quot; issues and environmental protection and enhancement.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.2/3">With regard to a minimum standard of flood defence, we currently operate on the basis of permissive powers, which allows the Environment Agency and other operating authorities to take action where it is considered justifiable against a range of criteria. This allows taxpayers' money to be spent where it is most needed, an approach overwhelmingly supported by respondents to our consultation on the review.</p>

The most important is called the Xorganisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities&quot; (2002/15/EC). This is due to be implemented into UK law by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>. It will introduce an average 48 hour working week, a limit of 60 hours for a single week and a 10 hour daily limit for night workers. Both sides of industry are being consulted on how this directive should be implemented into UK law and we plan to launch a wider consultation exercise later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.6/2">The Department of Trade and Industry plan to implement an amending directive (2000/34/EC) to the original working time directive (93/104/EC) later this year. This will extend working time legislation into previously excluded sectors, including transport. Under this directive, all drivers will be entitled to four weeks paid annual leave and night workers will get regular health assessments.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.11/1">There are currently no plans to introduce compulsory eye tests. However, given the importance of eyesight in safe driving it is an issue which is kept under constant review. The number plate eyesight test for checking that drivers' vision is adequate for driving has served its purpose well since its introduction. It is equivalent to minimum standard laid down in the EC second Directive on Driving Licences (91/439/EEC).</p>
	<p pid=".621W.11/2">The police already have the power to conduct random checks of motorists' eyesight at the roadside. They notify DVLA of any drivers who do not meet the required standard. Such reports are always investigated.</p>

Actions to date include the delivery of more electronic Variable Message Signs, automatic hold up warning systems, website and public information improvements and the first stages of a new national Traffic Control Centre due to begin operating in 2004. The Traffic Control Centre will provide advice to road users about travel conditions on the trunk road network allowing them to plan their journeys more effectively to avoid congestion. In conjunction with the Police and other emergency services, the Agency is improving the way it deals with accidents and incidents on the network so that they are dealt with more effectively, reducing the time roads are disrupted to minimise congestion.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.5/1">Liability for pollution from cargo oil from tankers is governed by the 1992 Protocols to the 1969 Civil Liability Convention and the 1971 Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, to which the UK is a contracting party. The current limit under this regime is equivalent to #117 million.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.5/2">As a result of action initiated by the UK, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed in 2000 to increase the limits of liability and compensation under the 1992 CLC/Fund regime by 50.37 per cent. The revised overall limits will enter into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-01">1 November</phrase> this year, and will increase the maximum available amount of compensation to approximately #176 million.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.5/3">In addition, a Diplomatic Conference has been convened at the IMO in May this year to negotiate a proposed Supplementary Fund to the present regime. It is expected that, once it comes into force, this Supplementary Fund will further increase the amount of liability and compensation significantly so as to cover all likely costs directly arising from the most serious of tanker oil spills.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.5/4">The UK is also playing a prominent role in promoting the implementation of other maritime liability conventions which will increase liability for third party damages arising from shipping.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.12/1">It is our current assessment that the main threat to the Fleet in future would come from sea-skimming missiles. The Sea Harrier FA2 lacks utility in countering this threat. There have been no discussions with the United States of America on the Royal Navy's air defence capability for the period following the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft, although they were advised of the decision as part of the United Kingdom's annual submission to the NATO Defence Planning Questionnaire. Following the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier FA2, Royal Navy Task Groups will typically include Type 42 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers and Type 22 and 23 Frigates also equipped with air defence capability. The Type 42 Destroyers systems are being enhanced to ensure that they remain effective in the air defence role.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.12/2">The first upgraded Airborne Early Warning Sea King Flight has recently entered service providing a marked improvement in capability to detect airborne threats to the Task Group over both sea and land, and the introduction of the Type 45 Destroyers, equipped with the highly capable Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) will represent further improvement in our air defence capability. It is also highly unlikely that the Royal Navy will operate alone, but instead is more likely to be part of a coalition force with other Allied defence assets, as well as our own.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.9/1">Since my appointment as the Government's Minister for Veterans in March 2001, I have been taking steps to provide all veterans from Her Majesty's armed forces with a co-ordinated focus for dealing with their concerns. I have set out three main priorities for this work. Firstly to pull together the Government's response to issues that cut across Government Departments, such as veterans' homelessness or ill-health; secondly to ensure that lessons learnt are absorbed into MOD's policies for service personnel; and thirdly, to improve communication by publicising the assistance offered to veterans by central, devolved and local government as well as giving veterans' organisations the opportunity to represent their collective and individual concerns to Government at ministerial level.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.9/2">In terms of financial support, all injured service personnel who are deemed to have sustained a disability due to their work in the armed forces are eligible for a tax-free 'War Disablement Pension' from the Veterans Agency. They may also qualify for an attributable pension under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.9/3">The Veterans Agency has always provided potential claimants with help and advice while they are completing their pension applications through a Freephone Helpline. That service was extended in April 2002 to provide all veterans and their dependents with a first point of contact and advice and information on where to access the support that is available to veterans from both the Government and the additional support provided by the veterans' charitable organisations. This support is provided to help ease the transition back into the civilian community in terms of employment and housing resettlement.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.9/4">Many of those whose service included deployments during the Falklands and the Gulf Conflicts will have already left the armed forces and some of those have ongoing health concerns that are being treated through the support provided under the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.9/5">In relation to the Gulf Conflict of 1990&ndash;91, we accept that some veterans are ill and that some have died. In our policy document: XGulf Veterans Illnesses: A New Beginning&quot; dated <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-14">14 July 1997</phrase>, we set out how we would deal with this complex issue. We adopted three principles. First, that all Gulf veterans will have prompt access to medical advice from the MOD's Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment. Second, that there will be appropriate research into veterans' illnesses and factors which might have a bearing on these. Third, the MOD will make available to the public any information it possesses which is of potential relevance to this issue. The policy document and information about what we have done in respect of Gulf veterans' illnesses can be found on the internet at: www.mod.ulc/issues/gulfwar.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.9/6">At present I am not aware of any evidence that demonstrates that veterans from any particular campaign or conflict need additional support. But we remain open minded and one of the working groups established as part of the Government's current Veterans Initiative has placed a contract with King's College London for research to provide evidence to support policy decisions to improve the delivery of cross-departmental support to veterans and identify any areas of unmet need. The next stage of this research will include interviews with key stakeholder organisations, such as the South Atlantic Medal Association 82, The Royal British Legion and Combat Stress as well as individual veterans. The aim will be to gather information on the needs of ex-service personnel, particularly the more vulnerable who are struggling with financial or emotional problems.</p>

As a result, these figures inevitably seem low compared to the other academic years. However, the number of students receiving EMA in December 2002 is also lower than the figure at the same time in the previous academic year. This is primarily due to the key member of the EMA team at Northumberland going on long term sick leave. In fact, the number of applications received in Northumberland is slightly up on the previous year's figures.</p>

	<p pid=".641W.5/1">In rolling out Sure Start local programmes, we have invited local authority districts with large rural areas to establish a rural programme. Fifteen local authority districts have put forward an identifiably rural area as the location for their Sure Start local programme. These have all been accepted. The average level of revenue funding when programmes become fully operational&mdash;which is the third year of operation&mdash;is around #750,000 (this includes two programmes which are currently being developed as part of the 6th wave and their funding has not yet been finalised). Capital funding ranging from #750,000 to #900,000 has also been committed to each rural programme. This is based on the capital strategy submitted by each individual programme and is intended to fund major capital projects in the first three years of operation.</p>
	<p pid=".641W.5/2">In addition, we are supporting a pilot project of 50 Mini Sure Start programmes in rural areas and areas with pockets of deprivation. These programmes cover areas where the number of disadvantaged children living in a defined area is considerably less than the 800 required for a typical full programme and so would not be covered by the traditional Sure Start model. The Mini Sure Start programmes are building on existing services like Neighbourhood Nurseries or other facilities delivering children's services and using Sure Start funding to deliver outreach and additional health work. Of the 50 Mini Sure Start pilots, 29 are specifically in rural areas. Average revenue grant for these programmes across the financial years 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 is #110,000. Capital funding of up to #250,000 has also been made available.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.3/1">Regulations were introduced in January 2001 to extend the purposes for which human embryos may be used in research. The regulations enable the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to issue a licence for research for the purposes of increasing knowledge about the development of embryos and serious disease and to enable such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/2">The Medical Research Council (MRC) has taken the lead, in collaboration with the UK regulatory authorities (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Department of Health, Medicines Control Agency) and other funding agencies, in generating a co-ordinated national stem cell strategy. As part of this, MRC has appointed the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control to set up a UK Stem Cell Bank for the curation and distribution of ethically sourced, quality controlled human adult, foetal and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/3">MRC, HFEA, the Department of Health and the Medicines Control Agency are collaborating to generate a UK-wide framework that will include: provision for oversight of national activities in stem cell research, standard donor information and consent forms, and route maps for researchers wishing to develop, bank and use stem cell lines for research and therapeutic purposes. The HFEA license will require that samples of all ES cell lines be deposited in the UK stem cell bank. This will reduce the number of embryos required as individual researchers will not need to generate their own stem cell lines.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/4">In relation to the Call for Expressions of Interest in establishing consortia, applicants will be able to request pump priming support for up to three years. It is expected that more substantial support would be sought through conventional grant schemes. Examples for which funds might be sought through this call include:</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/5" class="indent">a nurse co-ordinator post to aid consenting by potential donors and facilitate interactions between the clinics and researchers</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/6" class="indent">travel expenses to assist liaison between researchers and clinics</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/7" class="indent">essential small equipment (e.g. a dedicated incubator or insulated containers to transport samples between sites)</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/8" class="indent">short-term secondments between collaborating centres for the purpose of training</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/9">The Polkinghorne guidelines refer to the use of foetal tissue. The House of Lords Select Committee report on Stem Cell Research (February 2002) recommends the separation of clinical and research roles to be standard practice for donation of eggs and embryos. MRC will adhere to this recommendation in funding stem cell research. The nurse co-ordinators mentioned in the Call will be employed by the IVF clinics and will ensure that the donor couple fully understands the aims of the research and that it might reveal information about their health. The nurse co-ordinators will never become engaged in the research, but will liaise with the researchers to inform them if embryos become available.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/10">It is illegal in the UK for payment to be made for the donation of gametes (nominal expenses are provided however). MRC will not under any circumstances contribute to the costs of IVF treatment for those couples who choose to donate embryos for research. Donation will be entirely voluntary and by the free will of the couples involved. The decision to donate or not to donate will have no effect on their IVF treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/11">Additionally, as recommended by the Select Committee, a high level Oversight Body has been established, chaired by Lord Patel, that will be responsible for the custody of stem cell lines, ensuring their purity and provenance, monitoring their use, and for establishing codes of practice for the use of ES cells, whether obtained from the bank or imported from elsewhere. The committee will review on a case by case basis applications to deposit and access ES cell lines and will monitor the use of foetal and adult stem cell lines. The committee reports to MRC Council and will brief Ministers on request.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/12">Clinics undertaking IVF treatment in the UK were asked whether they were interested in participating in the national stem cell initiative. A list of these clinics is available in the HFEA website (<a href="http://www.hfea.gov.uk">www.hfea.gov.uk</a>). Those that expressed an interest were invited to attend a meeting at MRC Head Office and were subsequently sent an invitation to submit an expression of interest in establishing a consortium to develop collaborations. The process is ongoing, with the deadline for submissions of interest being <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>. It is not known yet how many applications will be submitted, nor the level of support requested or to be awarded. When awards are made, they will be published on the MRC website in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.3/13">Stem cell research will be conducted on embryos that are surplus to IVF treatment needs and would otherwise be discarded. The MRC does not know how many surplus embryos are discarded and cannot know how many surplus embryos will be donated for stem cell research.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.8/2">RDAs are non-departmental public bodies which operate under strict HM Treasury rules for all expenditure incurred. The annual accounts of the RDAs are audited by National Audit Office. The RDAs also have their own internal auditors and Government offices monitor payments made to the RDA.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.8/3">The Department also receives monitoring reports from the RDAs on a regular basis to ensure that expenditure is properly incurred. The RDAs set out their broad spending plans in Corporate Plans which are submitted to Government for approval; these Corporate Plans are expected to deliver a number of targets which are set by the DTI in collaboration with other Government Departments to reflect the policy interest of those funding the agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.2/2">The costs of generating electricity are a commercial matter for generators.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/3">Costs can be estimated on a variety of bases, and will vary from plant to plant. For example, figures can include all cost items, including depreciation and return on capital, or can refer only to the additional costs associated with continued operation. The costs of plant using fossil fuel will vary as fuel prices change.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/4">Estimates of the cost of generating electricity from new and existing coal and gas-fired power stations were published in chapter 5 of the 1998 White Paper, XConclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation&quot; (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/publications/whitepapers/review_sources/chpt05.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/publications/whitepapers/review_sources/chpt05.pdf</a>)</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/5">This suggested that the cost of new gas-fired generation might be in the range 1.8 to 2.2p/kWh, and new coal stations between 2.6 and 3.25p/kWh.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/6">More recent estimates of the cost of generation costs from different types of plant are contained in the PIU Energy Review and a report by an inter-departmental analysts group, both of which were published in February 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/7">The PIU estimated the costs of gas-fired generation, new nuclear build and onshore and offshore wind generation as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".648W.2/2">The nationwide reach of the post office network represents a valuable channel for delivery of Government and other services. Post offices are traditionally the place where customers go to transact a range of Government business.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.2/3">As recommended by the PIU report on the future of the post office network published in June 2000, Government provided the necessary support to enable Post Office Ltd. to test the concept of post offices as Government General Practitioners. DTI contributed #25 million to the cost of running the Your Guide pilot in Leicestershire and Rutland between July 2001 and March 2002. The outcomes of the pilot were thoroughly evaluated and a report was published last July. Although this indicated that a publicly funded national Your Guide service on the lines of that piloted would not provide value for money, and we have therefore decided not to roll it out, Your Guide has highlighted the potential for Government Departments to deliver services through post offices in future. The Department has been encouraging contact between other Departments and the Post Office concerning such services and has drawn the Departments' attention to a commercial kiosk service, based on kiosks in retail outlets&mdash;including some sub-post offices&mdash;which is expected to be piloted in Cornwall later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.2/4">Ultimately it is for individual Departments and Post Office Ltd. to decide whether or not to pursue these initiatives. But we will ensure that Post Office Ltd. continues to work closely with other Government Departments to develop and promote the services of the network as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.0/2">The Government believes that investment in science research generates substantial benefits for society and the economy. The main vehicle for Government investment in basic and strategic research is the Science Budget. The metrics that are used to measure the performance of the UK Science and Engineering Base as a whole at present are:-</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/3" class="indent">(a) Quality: measured by the UK's ranking in terms of citations.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/4" class="indent">(b) Relevance: the proportion of HEI funding from non governmental sources.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/5" class="indent">(c) Cost-effectiveness: measured by the UK's ranking in terms of the number of papers published per #1 million of public expenditure on science.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/6">One mechanism through which investment in the Science Base is translated into economic benefit is through the knowledge transfer activities of the Science and Engineering Base. Metrics in this area include:</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/7" class="indent">(a) Trends in numbers of patents applied for</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/8" class="indent">(b) Trends in the number of licensing agreements</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/9" class="indent">(c) Trends in income from licensing Intellectual property rights</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/10" class="indent">(d) Metrics of spin-outs</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/11" class="indent">(e) Trends in RC income from the UK private sector</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/12" class="indent">(f) Trends in co-publication with industry</p>
	<p pid=".650W.0/13">In addition Government Departments, including DTI, fund scientific research programmes in support of their objectives. This type of research will be evaluated primarily in terms of its contribution to the achievement of the relevant departmental policy or regulatory goals, rather than its overall economic impact as such. The Government is keen however to see that any economic benefits flowing from such research are properly exploited. To that end the Government's science, engineering and technology strategy, XInvesting in Innovation&quot; published in July 2002, made recommendations for strengthening departmental mechanisms for ensuring appropriate knowledge transfer.</p>

Police forces have to examine individual crime reports in order to identify these crimes, and to identify which resulted in arrests. It is expected that rollout of new IT should enable all forces to produce this data in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".654W.2/2">Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.2/3">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime. The conclusions do not relate specifically to Twickenham or Richmond-upon-Thames, although two of the eight sites were in London (Bethnal Green and Hammersmith). Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&ndash;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).</p>
	<p pid=".654W.2/4">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reportedhaving previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.2/5">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.</p>

	<p pid=".656W.5/1">There was widespread consultation with the transport industry prior to the introduction, in April 2000, of the regime under which road hauliers and others may receive penalties for the carriage of clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom. That consultation included how road hauliers could secure their vehicles against unauthorised entry.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.5/2">Since the regime was introduced, and during the recent passage through Parliament of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, which brought in an amended regime from <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-08">8 December 2002</phrase>, there has been frequent correspondence and meetings with the industry, both at ministerial and official level.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.5/3">Responsibility for securing vehicles against unauthorised entry lies with transport operators. Those who take the measures described in the XPrevention of Clandestine Entry Code of Practice&quot; will greatly reduce both the risk of carrying clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom and of receiving a penalty should they do so. Compliance with the Code is promoted strongly in all our dealings with the industry and this message was reinforced more recently in the awareness raising campaign that took place in the weeks leading to the implementation of the amended penalty regime.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.5/4">During the course of administering the penalty provisions, officials often give advice on an individual basis to companies about the level of vehicle security expected, and about compliance with the Code of Practice. The Code is available on the Home Office Website as well as on request from the Civil Penalty Central Administration Unit by telephoning 020 8745 6006.</p>

	<p pid=".664W.9/1">In the recent Pensions Green Paper, XSimplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement&quot; (Cm 5677), we have proposed that the rules of public sector pension schemes should be changed over the next few years to make an unreduced pension payable from a normal pension age of 65 rather than 60 in respect of all new members.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.9/2">Under age legislation to be implemented by 2006, compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful unless employers can show that they are objectively justified. The Department for Trade and Industry will be consulting further, later in the year, on the proposals for age legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.9/3">In the meantime, we will build on the work already done through promotion of the Code of Practice for Age Diversity in Employment and the Age Positive campaign. The Government will continue to encourage all employers, including those in the public sector, to review their retirement policies to allow people who want to work beyond normal retirement age, and should they wish, beyond state pension age, to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.9/4">In the Department, staff below the Senior Civil Service are able to choose to remain in employment beyond the age of 60 for any period up to the age of 65. The Department's flexible approach to age retirement allows staff to continue to work in their current grade and, subject to business need, to seek promotion to a higher grade or volunteer to down grade. Subject to business need, staff may also choose to work full-time or part-time. Senior civil servants can apply to work beyond age 60 where there is a business need.</p>

Approximately 150 people became ill; there were 19 people hospitalised and four deaths. Following the outbreak, the Canadian authorities imposed an action limit in mussels of 20mg/kg domoic acid per gram of tissue, above which harvesting was suspended. This was based on observations of those who became ill, including estimates of levels of toxins actually ingested.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.3/2">The European Union adopted this action limit for mussels and other bivalve molluscs including scallops in 1997 (Directive 97/61/EC). The Food Standards Agency has recently written to the European Commission asking them to consider the case for a scientific review of the current internationally accepted action level of 20 mg/kg in scallops, and how such a review may be taken forward.</p>

	<p pid=".673W.5/2">The Food Standards Agency has published an initial regulatory impact assessment on its website as part of its stakeholder consultation on the Commission's proposed Regulation COM (2002) 377. That Regulation will provide rules for official controls on abattoirs. The Agency estimates the costs to the meat sector would be approximately neutral, although some abattoirs would benefit from reduced levels of veterinary supervision. How costs fall between industry and government will be dependent on a proposal for a further Regulation on official feed and food controls expected to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.5/3">The Agency's consultations on the Commission's official controls proposals have elicited a number of responses, many expressing concern should the proposals result in new unjustified burdens and costs on the abattoir sector. In addition the previous Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health (Yvette Cooper) received representations and had discussions with UNISON over the union's concerns that the proposal contained provisions allowing plant staff to carry out tasks currently undertaken by its members. I have received similar representations.</p>

	<p pid=".675W.5/1">The Howard League for Penal Reform took the Home Office to judicial review over a statement in Prison Service guidance that the Children Act 1989 did not apply to children under the age of eighteen in prison establishments. Mr. Justice Munby's judgment, handed down on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-29">29 November</phrase>, ruled that the Children Act 1989 applied to children in prison, subject to the requirements of imprisonment. The judgment upheld the Prison Service's policy in relation to juveniles in custody. One sentence in its policy, which was to be changed regardless of the outcome of the judgment, has been found to be wrong. This will now be changed by the Home Office in the context of the judgment.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.5/2">The Department therefore sees no immediate need to revise existing guidance to councils with social services responsibilities, or to the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC). In the latter case, this is because the NCSC is responsible for children's services, regulated under the Care Standards Act 2000, which does not include prison establishments. However, we will, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department, carefully study Mr. Justice Munby's judgment, in the context of the recommendations of the Joint Chief Inspectors' report, XSafeguarding Children&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".677W.5/1">The Food Standards Agency's target for reducing food-borne illness by 20 per cent. by 2006 is based on laboratory reports of the five major food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli 0157, Listeria and Clostridium perfringens), excluding cases reported as having been acquired abroad. These data are collected by the Public Health Laboratory Service communicable disease surveillance centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and by the Scottish Centre for infection and environmental health for Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.5/2">When the baseline was announced in August 2001 <sup>1</sup> , there were 65,209 confirmed laboratory reports in the year 2000. However, it should be noted that the majority of people with food-borne disease do not consult a doctor or have a specimen sent for laboratory testing, and therefore the number of cases of food poisoning will be significantly higher.</p>

	<p pid=".677W.5/4">The figures for 2001 (the year in which the Agency's strategy for reducing food-borne disease was being finalised) were reported to the Board in May 2002, and showed a small increase (1 per cent.) in the number of cases.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.0/2">For the general population, advice on the transmission of HIV via oral sex is available through a number of sources funded by the Department. These include sexual health leaflets, the Sexual Health and National AIDS Helpline and the website which supports the Department's new safer sex campaign. In addition, Terrence Higgins Trust are funded by the Department to produce health promotion materials for gay men. These include leaflets (specifically 'The Manual' and 'Man[sex]Man') with messages around oral sex. The advice is consistent with the statement of risk issued in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.0/3">Oral sex is common in both homosexual and heterosexual relationships, but its frequency among men who have sex with men has highlighted its potential contribution to HIV transmission. Recent information collected by the Public Health Laboratory Service found that, in 2 per cent. of new HIV cases in men reported as infected through sex between men, they believed themselves to have been infected through oral sex. On following up these reports, more probable routes of infection than oral sex were found in some men. Hence the true proportion of new HIV cases that can be attributed to oral sex will be less than 2 per cent..</p>

	<p pid=".679W.3/1">I have received no recent representations on this subject. However, the Government fully recognises the difficulties which people who are homeless face in accessing health services. The first point of contact with the national health service should usually be primary care and the Department has taken a range of actions to improve the accessibility of primary care services for homeless people and later this month will be reminding general practitioners that people do not need to have a permanent address to register with them.</p>

	<p pid=".681W.8/2">The public health implications of mobile phone base stations were assessed by the independent expert group on mobile phones (IEGMP). Their report, the Stewart Report, concluded that the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.8/3">Measurements undertaken by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Radiocommunications Agency (RA) have confirmed that public exposures are very much lower than the international guidelines. These results are available to the public from these organisations' websites, at <a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a> and <a href="http://www.radio.gov.uk">www.radio.gov.uk</a>. Network operators have undertaken to ensure that all base stations will be designed and sited so that members of the public will not be exposed in excess of the recommended basic restriction.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.8/4">The IEGMP noted that if people are unduly concerned about potential exposures then that in itself may affect their well-being. A number of recommendations of the group were, therefore, designed to provide more information to people about local base stations. One of these measures was to develop the 'Sitefinder'mobile phone base station database, which is a national database of mobile phone base stations and their emissions. The database is managed by the RA, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, on behalf of the Government. The database provides information on all operational, externally sited, cellular radio transmitters in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and is updated every three months.</p>

National Care Standards Commission area offices are best placed to assess the need for such measures in a particular care home within the broad statutory guidelines. In doing so they should take into account such things as the perceived needs of residents; the prevention of abuse; residents' right to privacy; staff training, numbers, and supervisory arrangements. These needs will vary from home to home and from area to area.</p>

The Department for Transport allocated #620 million to local authorities for small-scale schemes such as road safety and measures to encourage walking and cycling, including up to 800 more safe routes to school in the 2002&ndash;03 local transport plan settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/2">According to local transport plan annual progress reports (APRs) submitted to the Department for Transport in August 2002 1,782 safe routes to school schemes were in place in April 2002, with a further 1,543 planned for 2002&ndash;03. The APRs also showed that safe routes schemes to 8,006 schools, or about 35 per cent., of schools, are planned by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/3">Between 1999 and 2001, this Department also developed and funded the safe and sound challenge scheme, which disbursed around #210,000 to over 80 schools to implement initiatives to promote healthy active modes of travel. We commissioned follow up monitoring and evaluation of some of the schemes, which had been funded in the first two years of the challenge. The results showed that schools had successfully implemented school travel initiatives with the funding that had been awarded. However, it was not possible to establish whether any real changes in school travel patterns had occurred, as most schools did not have baseline data for comparison.</p>

This is through regulations to transpose into United Kingdom law the EU Directive on the Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco Products.

The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted in two of the new warnings, which include XSmoking Seriously Harms You and Others Around You&quot; and XProtect Children: Don't Make Them Breathe Your Smoke&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.0/2">We envisage a mixed economy in decontamination services provided to the national health service. Local needs and facilities will determine the way in which the service is provided locally but all will be provided to a nationally agreed set of standards.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.0/3">It is not possible to say at this stage how many centres there will be in total, nor how many procurements there will be, or when they will take place, but we expect the first&mdash;covering the Bradford Hospitals NHS Trust and The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust&mdash;to be advertised in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities (OJEC) before the end of 2002&ndash;03. All procurements will be carried out in accordance with the rules of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.0/4">The Department is actively seeking to develop the market in sterile services and is encouraging new entrants as well as existing suppliers to participate in procurements. To that end, officials have met existing and potential suppliers on over 100 occasions: in specially arranged conferences and workshops, private meetings with individual companies, visits to reference sites and meetings with trade associations. It would bea breach of commercial confidentiality to disclose the names of the companies involved.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.9/1">My Department complies with the Six Service Standards for General Government. To meet the key standard of answering letters quickly and clearly, the Department has set itself a target of responding, in full, within 15 working days of receipt. This is in regard to general correspondence and would include any responses to local authorities. The procedures my Department follow are in accord with the Government guidance which requires that correspondence be acknowledged on receipt or within a targeted period and if it becomes clear that a full reply cannot be provided within the deadline, then a holding reply will issue.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.9/2">Following the guidance from Cabinet Office on the handling of correspondence from Members of Parliament, the Department has set itself a target time of replying to this type of correspondence within 10 working days. As with other correspondence, the Department strives to issue a substantive reply within the target time. When this is not possible, an interim or holding reply issues as a matter of courtesy and to reassure the correspondent that their letter has been received and that action is being taken.</p>

The report, which I launched on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-16">16 December 2002</phrase> in partnership with the employing authorities and the teacher unions, shows that 57.7 per cent. of respondents were either very satisfied or satisfied with their jobs while 22.2 per cent. were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. The remainder fell in between both groups.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.6/2">There was a relatively high response rate to the survey by teachers. Their valuable feedback will be taken fully into account by the employing authorities, working closely with my Department and the teacher unions, in implementing the report's recommendations so that support services continue to improve to meet the needs of teachers. The report has been published on my Department's website and an executive summary has been sent to all teachers. There are no immediate plans for further research.</p>
