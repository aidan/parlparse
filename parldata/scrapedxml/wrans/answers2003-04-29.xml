These debts resulted from insurance and guarantee claims paid out mainly in the 1980s.

	<p pid=".304W.10/3">The Government acknowledges that debt relief is not a panacea for broader economic development problems; even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over $50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015.</p>

	<p pid=".310W.7/17">Crown Prosecution Service case records are held by category of offence, rather than by a specific offence. It is not possible from the records to show separately in how many of these cases a prosecution proceeded or the result of the case. This information could be recovered only by examining individual case files which are in storage, and the cost of such an exercise would be prohibitive.</p>

	<p pid=".313W.5/2">Government considers the maintenance of a universal postal service in this country to be of the highest importance and that is why the obligation is enshrined in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act 2000. That means a service provided at an affordable price determined by a public tariff uniform throughout the UK and includes the delivery each working day to the home or premises of every individual in the UK and a collection each working day from access points.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/3">Universal service is a matter for the postal regulator (Postcomm), which has the primary statutory duty to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff, and for Royal Mail as the licence holder with the universal service obligation. Under the terms of the Postal Services Act Postcomm must in performing its duties have regard to the interests of individuals in rural areas. Exceptions to the universal service daily delivery can only be allowed in very specific and restricted circumstances (the relevant policy document is available at <a href="http://www.psc.gov.uk/documents/licensing">http://www.psc.gov.uk/documents/licensing</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-10">10 April</phrase>, Postcomm launched a further three-month consultation to find out what users expect from the universal postal service currently provided by Royal Mail. All postal users are invited to comment on the universal service, to say what matters to them, and how they expect the service to develop. Again the information on this consultation can be obtained from Postcomm's website.</p>

The Army systems consist of <i>(a)</i> Shell 155mm HE Extended Range Bomblet Shell (ERBS) which has a proven maximum bomblet failure rate of 2 per cent. and <i>(b)</i> Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) M26 bomblets which have a failure rate, between 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. The failure rate is largely dependant on ground conditions and range.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.12/2">The RAF system consists of the BL755 cluster bomb; recent statistics show an overall failure rate of 6 per cent. in line with expectations. We have previously stated a failure rate for the BL755 of &quot;approximately 5 per cent.&quot;; the figure has now increased not because the weapon is less reliable but because the parameters used to compile the statistics have changed.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.2/1">MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 and the Protocol of 1978) provides for the phased introduction of Double-hulled tankers. Whilst the convention does not apply to vessels owned or operated by a state and used only on Government non-commercial service, as is the case for the fleet of Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Oilers, it continues to be Ministry of Defence policy that, where practicable, we comply with Shipping Acts and associated Regulations. 2010 was selected as the target date for the earliest practicable Ministry of Defence compliance based on the Department's current plans for the progressive withdrawal of non-compliant, single-hulled vessels over the rest of this decade and their replacement with compliant equivalents. The first such compliant vessels, the Auxiliary Oilers RFA Wave Knight and RFA Wave Ruler, are due to enter service this spring.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/2">So far as future procurement is concerned, the Ministry of Defence established the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) project in July 2002 to consider, among other things, the Royal Navy's future requirement for oil resupply. The capability provided by this will be fully compliant with any environmental legislation in force at the time of entry into service but it is premature to decide exactly how this requirement will be met or when industry will be invited to bid.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has overall charge in this area. He chairs the Civil Contingencies Committee which meets in times of crisis to manage the response and is attended by representatives of the relevant emergency services and agencies. He also chairs DOP(IT)(T), which oversees the work on protective and preventative security; and DOP(IT)(R) which works to build the UK's resilience and ability to manage the consequences of major emergencies. The Department of Health and the Home Office are represented on all of these committees. There are robust, established mechanisms for co-ordination which are overseen by the Home Secretary, who is supported by a senior official, the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator. Sir David Omand is the Permanent Secretary who brings together the work of the intelligence agencies and civil departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.0/2">The Home Secretary is driving forward a comprehensive programme of work to enhance and improve our capacity to respond to a range of threats. For further details on this, I refer the hon. Member to the written ministerial statement that the Home Secretary made on Civil Contingency Planning and the role of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-03-03.72"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 72&ndash;78WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.0/3">The Health Protection Agency is an important part of these arrangements. It aims to improve health emergency planning and the NHS response by providing a dedicated field service and an integrated approach to protecting the public against infectious diseases and chemical and radiological hazards.</p>

	<p pid=".321W.9/2">At present there are no official estimates of mortality in Zimbabwe during the past 12 months. The results of a national nutrition and health survey, supported by donors including DFID, are due to be released by the Ministry of Health during May. Preliminary indications are that there is little evidence of widespread severe malnutrition among children or deaths from starvation. NGOs report however that there have been cases of illness and death as a result of consuming poisonous wild foods.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.9/3">In the last four months prior to the new maize crop entering the market from May, nearly seven million people have been receiving food through the international relief effort. As the nutrition and health survey is expected to confirm, overall, the aid effort has been successful. DFID has been a significant contributor, providing &pound;51 million to help Zimbabwe since the humanitarian crisis began in mid 2001 The prospects for Zimbabwe in 2003 remain dismal. Food security continues to be affected by chaos in the agricultural sector, economic disincentives to production, unemployment at 70 per cent., and 228 per cent. inflation eroding purchasing power. DFID's priorities for the next year will continue to be the prevention of HIV and mitigation of the impact of AIDS, and directassistance for the poor and vulnerable during the continuing economic andsocial crisis in Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".326W.2/14" class="italic">Notes</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/15">1. Energy Consumption: this is weather-corrected in the usual manner, using annual degree days relative to the 20-year average for 1990&ndash;91. The figures are those reported on for the Central Government Estate campaign. Figures include the FCO's only Agency, Wilton Park Conference Centre, for 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02 only.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/16">2. Energy Expenditure: this is actual spend, and from April 2001, includes the Climate Change Levy. Costs are inclusive of VAT from 1999&ndash;00.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/17">3. Energy/m2: this variable allows for changes in both weather and estate size on energy consumption. So annual changes will generally reflect efficiency changes.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/18">4. Savings over 1997&ndash;98: These have been expressed as percentage savings relative to the first year quoted here, and are based on the figures in the preceding column.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/19">5. Energy efficiency spend: Note that this is not necessarily a good measure of an effective energy efficiency policy. For example, when a new building is commissioned or an existing one refurbished, good design can actually reduce capital costs, e.g. by avoiding air conditioning. The &pound;801,000 recorded by the FCO in 2000&ndash;01 is the capital sum invested in energy efficiency measures incorporated into the refurbishment of the Old Admiralty Building.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/20" class="italic">Energy Policy</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/21">The Energy White Paper, &quot;Our Energy Future&mdash;Creating a Low Carbon Economy&quot; made clear the importance the Government attaches to improving energy efficiency in its own estate. This is reflected in several targets. There is currently an interim target of a 1 per cent. per annum ongoing reduction in weather-corrected carbon emissions, pending the development of new indicators and targets based on benchmarking the performance of each Department's largest buildings. These new targets are planned to be in place later this year. New targets for Government Departments' use of CHP generated electricity will also be established during 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/22">In addition, the review of Government procurement has identified areas where procurement could reinforce the achievement of these targets, and arrangements are being made centrally for Departments to purchase goods with high energy efficiency standards and which provide good value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.2/23">On the purchase of renewable electricity, Ministers agreed the following target in May 2001: &quot;All departments will ensure that by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, at least 5 per cent. of their electricity comes from renewable sources that are exempt from the Climate Change Levy or from self generation, provided this does not entail excessive cost. The FCO achieved this target. The target will rise to at least 10 per cent. supply from such sources by <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, but will be reviewed after <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> to take account of market conditions following the introduction of the renewables obligation. The review of 2003 will include consideration of increasing or bringing forward the target&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".328W.2/1">Running costs for the British trade office in Laos are subsumed into the running costs of its parent office, the British Embassy in Bangkok. Compiling information on costs since 1997 would incur disproportionate cost. We keep separate figures for estimate purposes only. Running costs for 2002&ndash;03 were &pound;36,945.12, but this figure does not include the cost of the office accommodation which, although owned by us, is managed by the Australian Embassy in Vientiane.</p>

I met Serbian and Serbia and Montenegro leaders to discuss how best to sustain reform, notably to combat organised crime and ensure co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.5/2">In the days following the assassination, European Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten and EU High Representative Javier Solana visited Belgrade. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-26">26 March</phrase> the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) Management Committee approved the CARDS annual action programme for SaM, including aid of Euro 229 million for Serbia, Euro 13.5 million for Montenegro and Euro 49 million for Kosovo. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-03">3 April 2003</phrase> Serbia and Montenegro became the 45th member of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly and the Committee of Ministers (PACE) will closely monitor SaM's post accession commitments, including further co-operation with the ICTY.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.5/3">The Serbian Government has taken steps towards judicial, political and military reform by disbanding the 'Red Berets' Special Operations Unit (JSO) and the retirement of 35 court judges linked to Slobodan Milosevic. I welcome the Government's efforts in tackling organised crime and war criminals, building on developments this year, notably the disinterment of missing ex Serbian President Ivan Stambolic's remains, and the transfer of former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Serbian Radical Party Leader Vojislav Seselj to The Hague. We look forward to further developments.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.5/4">The State of Emergency imposed following Djindjic's assassination on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-12">12 March</phrase> ended on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-22">22 April</phrase>. 10,000 people from different crime gangs have been questioned and 4,500 people detained in relation to the assassination and other crimes committed before and after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.5/5">The EU is monitoring the implementation of post State of Emergency legislation, including terms of detention and independence of the judiciary. Within the EU and other bodies, we are discussing how to take forward closer integration with Europe in a way which maintains EU conditionality, while helping SaM and other countries of the region achieve the standards required.</p>

We have provided &pound;51 million in humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe since September 2001.

A successful &quot;stayaway&quot; from work on 18 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March</phrase> was followed by a wave of violence, largely against the opposition party and its supporters. There were over 500 arrests, 250 people hospitalised, and one death. Scores of people were beaten and tortured while in police custody. Both the Vice-President of the MDC and the party's parliamentary speaker were arrested. The EU has condemned the violence and sponsored a resolution on Zimbabwe at the UN Commission on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid=".334W.3/1">Special education legislation imposes duties on Education and Library Boards (ELBs) in the planning for a young person's transition to adult life. The Department of Education's Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs provides further advice on the process. ELBs are required to inform Health and Social Services (HSS) trusts up to a year in advance of a young person, with a Statement of Special Educational Needs, leaving school.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.3/2">The first and subsequent annual reviews of a Statement of Special Educational Needs after a young person's 14th birthday should involve the agencies that will play a major role during the post school years, including the relevant HSS Trust and the Department for Employment and Learning's Careers Service, so that all options for further education, training and employment are given serious consideration. Following the meeting the ELB will prepare a transition plan, in order to plan coherently for the young person's transition to adult life. The plan is circulated to the parents, the principal and all other relevant partners.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.3/3">A research project entitled &quot;Provision for Pupils with Moderate Learning Difficulties&quot;, funded by the five ELBs is being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). It is currently in its third year and it is hoped to publish its findings by early 2004. The main focus of this research is the current provision for MLD pupils, but the researchers will also endeavour to track the pupils' first destinations on leaving school.</p>

	<p pid=".334W.6/1">After schools provision in Northern Ireland for young people with Moderate Learning Difficulties (MLD) spans a number of areas and departments.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.6/2">The Department for Health and Social Services and Public Safety's Priorities for Action in 2002&ndash;03 require Health Boards and Trusts to continue to expand provision of day care and respite places for people with a learning difficulty. Moreover, all four Health and Social Services Boards have identified the development of day care services as a priority area, but funding has been a limiting factor.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.6/3">The Department for Employment and Learning's (DEL) Disablement Advisory Service, in conjunction with the Careers Service, provides such young people with help to assist them access appropriate employment and learning after school. There is a range of programmes including &quot;Access to Work&quot;, &quot;Employment Support&quot;, &quot;Job Introduction Scheme&quot; and &quot;New Deal for Disabled People&quot;. Special Needs Careers Officers provide careers information and guidance services both at school and when the young person has left school to ensure that appropriate choices have been made and that the young person has settled into his/her next destination. The officers continue to provide support to those young people who have not secured a placement in education, training or employment on leaving school.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.6/4">Should it be considered appropriate, provision is also available through Jobskills and the statutory Further Education sector. Although Jobskills is aimed mainly at 16 and 17-year-old school leavers, young people with disabilities can enter the programme up to their 22nd birthday. DEL has put in place a range of initiatives and financial support mechanisms, in further education, which promote access for young people with MLD, including specific support for individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".334W.6/5">In September 2002 the then Ministers for Education, Employment and Learning and Health, Social Services and Public Safety convened a meeting to discuss the issue of transition from full-time education to adulthood for young people with learning disabilities. A working group, chaired by the Department of Education and comprising officials from the relevant departments, was established to consider what could be done to better meet the needs of these young people. Work is ongoing.</p>

The Television Licences (Disclosure of Information) Act 2000, which provides for the disclosure of social security information to the BBC for the purpose of checking entitlement to the over-75 concession, specifies that this information may be used only in connection with free or reduced-fee licences. Similarly, the assignment of the television licensing database by the Home Office to the BBC in 1991 was subject to the records being used exclusively for administering the television licensing system.</p>

	<p pid=".345W.2/1">The National Health Service does not separately identify spend on information technology, so exact figures are not available. Net NHS expenditure in England for 2002&ndash;03&mdash;estimated out-turn&mdash;is &pound;54.4 billion. Estimated baseline spend for 2002&ndash;03 was collected which indicated some &pound;850 million of expenditure for information technology was anticipated. The indicative amount of &pound;850 million spent on information technology as a proportion of total NHS spend is 1.6 per cent.</p>

Similarly, the trust is not required to pay the salaries of the surgeon and the nurse during their period of service as these are covered by the MOD and has therefore been able to redirect these funds to pay the associate specialist and bank nurses for the cover they are providing.

	<p pid=".347W.6/2">No estimate can be provided for the number of patients that will receive treatment in European Union states in 2003 under the E112 scheme. It is usually patients themselves who initiate the application for referrals, but they also need to obtain the support of the United Kingdom specialist doctor responsible for their care and their local health commissioner.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.6/3">The option of referring patients abroad is open to all NHS commissioners and so the number of patients treated abroad will be dependent on the take-up of the scheme by NHS trusts. Overseas treatment will be offered nationally to patients within the choice strategy framework from the end of 2005 as one of several options if alternatives are not available in this country. Before then, overseas treatment will be offered on a localised basis in order to provide a more comprehensive choice for patients to meet local circumstances as well as contestability of provision.</p>

	<p pid=".353W.0/2">Levels of preparedness in the event of a civil emergency are primarily determined through testing and exercising. Government Departments, the emergency services and local authorities have all exercised their contingency plans for many years. Earlier this year a cross-governmental working party was established to provide a formal mechanism for reviewing Departmental exercise plans covering a comprehensive range of domestic challenges and counter terrorist areas of activity. The aim of this group is to create a prioritised programme of exercises that will reflect and test effectively the range of lead Government Department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, regional and local authorities and interdependent communities of interest. Local authorities are encouraged to prepare flexible plans for responding to a wide variety of peacetime hazards, and these plans are also regularly tested, reviewed and updated as circumstances change.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.0/3">Exercises at local, regional and national levels involve a wide range of participants including the emergency services, and local authorities and the NHS. Such exercises are used to monitor current levels of preparedness, to identify best practice and to identify areas for further improvement.</p>

	<p pid=".354W.3/1">Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.3/2">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Hemsworth. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&ndash;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).</p>
	<p pid=".354W.3/3">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.3/4">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.</p>

	<p pid=".358W.2/1">A review of stolen firearms statistics is currently in hand to determine the size of the problem and identify what scope there is to reduce the number of legal weapons becoming available to criminals.

This will contribute to a strategic overview of national firearm trends which will be available to all forces. Data is already being recorded on the information database in respect of cases submitted to the Forensic Science Service after <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>; the Integrated Ballistic Information System is currently being validated.</p>

	<p pid=".359W.8/2">In 2001, 289 offenders were convicted of offences under section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1978 as amended, which deals with taking, making, distribution, possession with intent to distribute, and advertising of indecent images, and 51 under S 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 which deals with possession. However, recent high profile operations such as Operation Ore indicate a far higher level of activity. The police estimate that there are thousands of individuals in this country actively involved in the distribution of such images in the UK. Distribution can involve behaviour ranging from swapping of a few images between individuals to running a major commercial internet site. Figures from the Internet Watch Foundation indicate that less than 3 per cent. of illegal sites they identify are hosted in the UK.</p>

Women made up 24 per cent. of robbery victims and six per cent. of offenders. Of those who were victims of robberies, women were more likely than men to be victims of 'snatch robberies': Seven out of 10 robberies where the victim was a women involved property being snatched or grabbed from their person.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.5/1">The provisions in Parts 2 and 3 of the draft Housing Bill will enable local housing authorities to impose conditions for the proper management of houses and flats that are subject to licensing. This will raise health and safety standards in part because a licence condition may include a requirement to carry out gas safety checks. Such a condition will reinforce the current statutory requirement that a landlord carries out an annual inspection of gas appliances and fittings in any property that he lets, under The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.5/2">Under Part 5 of the Bill, anyone marketing a home will be required to produce a Home Information Pack, including a Home Condition Report. That report will include an informed opinion on the condition of services, including gas, based on a visual inspection. This should go a long way towards ensuring that potential hazards or safety issues are drawn to the attention of both the seller and any prospective buyer.</p>

The Government regard this as a wasted resource, especially in areas of high demand for housing.

	<p pid=".368W.5/1">The draft Housing Bill sets out a discretionary selective licensing power for local authorities, and the extent of take-up would therefore depend on decisions by individual local authorities in due course. Responses to the 2001 consultation on selective licensing indicated that 50 local authorities in England were in favour. For the purposes of the Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the draft Bill, we made the assumption that selective licensing would be taken up by a majority of local authorities in areas of low housing demand, and that 75 per cent. of low demand dwellings would be likely to be required to obtain a licence.</p>
