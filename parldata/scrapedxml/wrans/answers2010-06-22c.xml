The Department's guidance advises that eligibility for a concessionary travel pass may be considered &quot;automatic&quot; (not requiring further assessment) where a person is in receipt of the higher rate mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance provided that the award of the benefit is expected to be for at least 12 months.</p>

It is chaired by Richard Macdonald, former director-general of the National Farmers Union, and is charged with identifying ways to reduce the regulatory burden. It will provide advice on how best to achieve a risk-based system of regulation in the future. The task force will make its initial recommendations by early 2011. To provide additional support for hill farmers, we will explore the scope to add to the funding provided by the Uplands Entry Level Stewardship Scheme through changes to the arrangements, under both pillar 1 and pillar 2, of the common agricultural policy, all of which are likely to require EU agreement.</p>

	<p pid="c.132W.2/1">The 2008-11 National Offender Management Service (NOMS) drug strategy has three key elements for prisons that interlink to reduce drug related offending and address individual need:</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/2" class="indent">reducing supply, through security measures and drug testing programmes;</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/3" class="indent">reducing demand, through targeted interventions for low, moderate and severe drug-misusers; and</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/4" class="indent">establishing effective through-care links to ensure continuity of treatment post-release in order to safeguard the gains made in custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/5">In early 2008 the then director general of NOMS commissioned David Blakey, former HM Inspector of Constabulary, to report on the effectiveness of the service's drug supply reduction work. His review 'Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons' was published in July 2008 and made 10 recommendations, all of which were accepted. Progress has been made in implementing them. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/6" class="indent">instructing every prison to nominate a senior manager responsible for co-ordinating delivery of the local drug strategy at the prison;</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/7" class="indent">publishing a revised good practice guide to assist prisons in tackling drug supply routes and a new guide on tackling mobile phones;</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/8" class="indent">strengthening our relationship with Home Office Scientific Development Branch; and</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/9" class="indent">working more closely with law enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/10">NOMS has in place a drug treatment framework, based on the National Treatment Agency's Models of Care, to address the needs of drug misusing prisoners. The interventions available are designed to meet the needs of low, moderate and severe drug misusers-irrespective of age, gender or ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/11">Considerable improvements have been made in clinical drug treatment in prisons, in particular through the introduction of the Integrated Drug Treatment System (IDTS)-a treatment system, based on evidence, providing improved clinical management including prescribing and psychosocial interventions via multidisciplinary teams, particularly in the first 28 days of prison and also links with care and treatment services in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.2/12">This Government believe that more can be done to cut drug related reoffending by overhauling the system of rehabilitation. We are considering how sentencing and treatment for drug use can help offenders to come off drugs once and for all. This includes the exploration of alternative secure treatment-based accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="c.145W.3/2">The next annual statistical bulletin on crime is pre-announced to be published by the Home Office on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-15">15 July 2010</phrase>, and as in previous years will include an assessment of the accuracy of sources of information on crime.</p>

This included calling for the creation of &quot;a free-standing guide that explains the strengths and limitations of the different types of crime data&quot;. The various sets of statistics are based on different data sources and coverage (in other words they do not measure the same things) and involve collection methods which have evolved over the years making comparisons difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.3/4">The public must have full, accurate and independently produced information if we are to restore confidence in the statistics and drive effective action to tackle crime. We are currently reviewing how crime statistics should be collected and published in future and will make further announcements in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.148W.8/2">Currently, same-sex couples can enter a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act 2004 which gives them the opportunity to obtain legal recognition of their relationship. Couples who register their civil partnerships gain vital rights and protections, similar to married couples. Civil partnership registrations are entirely secular in nature and, as with civil marriage, prohibited from taking place on religious premises, or containing any religious language. An amendment made to the Equality Act 2010 removed the express prohibition on civil partnerships taking place on religious premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.148W.8/3">This Government are committed to supporting civil partnerships. This week, the Prime Minister launched Working for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equality, an ambitious programme of work to tackle outdated prejudices and ensure equal chances for everyone, whatever their sexual orientation or gender identity. It contains a commitment to talk to those with a key interest in this issue about what the next stage should be for civil partnerships, including how some religious organisations can allow same-sex couples the opportunity to register their relationship in a religious setting if they wish to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.151W.3/2">Core Government funding to the police will be reduced by &#163;125 million. Each force will have its core Government funding in 2010-11 reduced by the same percentage. This reduction is less than 1 per cent of expected total police spending in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.3/3">The Government's priority is to cut the budget deficit and get the economy moving again. That means the police will have to bear a fair share of the burden, helped by &#163;100 million of savings already identified for this year on areas including procurement and IT. I am quite clear that this saving can be achieved by driving out wasteful spending, reducing bureaucracy and increasing efficiency in key functions, whilst leaving the frontline of policing strong and secure. The Home Office has protected the frontline by cutting a greater than proportionate share of its own central budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.3/4">In addition to the &#163;125 million, Government funding for counter terrorism policing will be reduced by &#163;10 million. The &#163;10 million savings package is taken from a &#163;5 million reduction in the Metropolitan Police Services' Counter Terrorism Specific Grant and a &#163;5 million reduction in the Counter Terrorism Specific Grant for local and regional counter terrorism capabilities. This was agreed following discussion with senior police officers to ensure that there would be no adverse impact on frontline delivery of CT policing. In 2010-11 there will be &#163;569 million available for counter terrorism policing.</p>

The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) is committed to supporting the special constabulary and increasing its numbers across England and Wales. The NPIA created nine regional co-ordinator posts to help police forces increase numbers and improve retention rates within their respective force areas. In particular, they are working in partnership with forces to develop effective marketing and recruitment strategies and to implement the national strategy for the special constabulary. This includes a best practice approach to the tasking and deployment of special constables.

	<p pid="c.158W.6/2">The importance of protecting frontline services has already underpinned decisions on the Local Government contribution to the &#163;6.2 billion cross-Government savings in 2010-11. Where revenue grants to local authorities have been reduced, no local authority will face a reduction of more than 2% overall. Local government will be free to make their own decisions about where savings are found. We have ensured that councils have the flexibility to take decisions locally on how to deliver the savings needed by removing ring-fences around central Government grants to local government. This will enable local authorities to redirect funds to protect the delivery of the essential frontline services that matter most to their local communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.161W.9/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government is drawing up plans for implementing a number of commitments contained in the coalition programme for Government, and in the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister's announcement on 'Building the Big Society', which will lead to the devolution of greater power to local communities. These include: radical reform of the planning system to give neighbourhoods far more ability to determine the shape of the places in which their inhabitants live; and the introduction of new powers to help communities save local facilities and services threatened with closure, and give communities the right to take over local state-run services. The forthcoming 'localism bill' will include new powers for communities, including greater financial autonomy to community groups, and the creation of new trusts that would make it simpler for communities to provide homes for local people.</p>
	<p pid="c.161W.9/2">In addition, we will be working closely with other Departments on the implementation of a wide set of proposals aimed at meeting the Government's ambitions to bring about a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people, to encourage social responsibility, and to make it easier for people to come together to improve their communities and help one another, as set out in the coalition agreement.</p>

The list of grants which will be de-ring-fenced takes account of the changes proposed by departments. The &#163;1.7 billion also mistakenly included two grants where further work identified this funding as already providing local authorities with flexibility for local decisions on the use of that funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.162W.2/2">Non-schools ring-fencing has still reduced from 10.6% to 7.7%. The coalition agreement makes clear that Ministers want to signal a fundamental shift of power and end the era of top-down government by giving new powers to local councils. The Government will phase out the ring-fencing of grants to local government. Decisions on this will be taken in the context of the next spending review.</p>
	<p pid="c.162W.2/3">The CLG capital grant for private sector renewal (&#163;300 million) was included as ring-fenced when it has now become clear that there is no control on local authority spending. A smaller Housing and Planning Delivery Grant (&#163;29 million) was also included but this grant ended in 2008-09 and is therefore irrelevant to any calculations to provide a reduction in ring-fencing.</p>

The UK provides continuing support to the Government of Bangladesh for its planning and response to disasters, including &#163;12 million to the Government's Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) (2009-14). Last month DFID facilitated a co-ordination meeting of the Bangladesh Consultative Group on Disaster Response, chaired by the Government of Bangladesh, to discuss how to respond to the needs of the flood-affected people. Local non-governmental organisations are currently responding to those needs and we continue to monitor the situation. Additional work is required to protect those at risk from further landslides. This work will be carried out under the DFID-supported CDMP mentioned above.</p>

	<p pid="c.171W.3/3">The Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (which receives its funding from the Department), has commissioned a national clinical audit known as 'Epilepsy 12' (so-called because the audit covers 12 key indicators derived from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) to facilitate local health services to evaluate clinical practice, patient experience and service descriptors in a standardised and meaningful way. One of the things it will do is to look at misdiagnosis rates and patient experience as achievable outcome measures. It will not look at costs. Data collection is due to start in the autumn of 2010 at early adopter sites, with a national roll out to follow soon after. The audit is being coordinated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.</p>

	<p pid="c.174W.5/1">There are multiple variables that have an impact on the effectiveness of nurse specialist services. Local national health service organisations are best placed to develop service models that put patients at the heart of care and have a clear and rigorous focus on improving health outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.174W.5/2">Not all nurse specialist services are designed and delivered in the same way. There are many different objectives for these services based on either enhancing current care provision or substituting the professional delivering the care. As such, determining the clinical and cost effectiveness of these services is often not straight forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.174W.5/3">The variety in the way services are delivered by nurse specialists often makes direct comparison difficult. For example, some nurse specialists may prescribe or order and interpret diagnostic tests which are usually done by a doctor, others may provide intensive counselling and support that enhances the care provided by other professionals. Services tend to evolve locally to meet the specific needs of local patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.174W.5/4">There are several studies, some including cost effectiveness, of specialist nurses who are managing some or all of the care of patients that would normally be done by hospital consultants. Generally, the outcomes can be equivalent. There is often an indication of improved patient experiences, and for nurse delivered enhanced services, improved outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.174W.5/5">For consultant nurses, there is evidence that evaluation is often undertaken before the role has had time to develop fully, often making judgements about the effectiveness of the role misleading. This is a problem for primary care in particular. There is emerging evidence of consultant nurses having a positive impact on patient outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="c.178W.6/3">The Department intends to carry out a refresh of the previous Government's carers strategy and, as part of that, will consider how carers can be supported to effectively combine caring responsibility with paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.6/4">The right to request flexible working is currently available to employed parents of children aged under 17, parents of disabled children under 18 and carers of certain adults. The Government are already committed to extending the right to request flexible working to all employees. This will ensure that individuals within the wider caring structure, e.g. grandparents and neighbours, will be able to take a more active role in caring, whilst managing their work and family lives effectively. This extension will also help to remove the stigma attached to flexible working requests at the moment. We will be consulting with business on how best to do it.</p>

	<p pid="c.206W.5/2"><i> </i>There is no specific measurement for 'functional illiteracy' in primary school children. However, in 2009 14% of 11-year-olds did not reach the expected level 4 or above in reading, and 32% in writing. The Government's aim is that no child who is capable of learning to read should leave primary education without a secure level of literacy. We will be seeking to strengthen the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics and encourage schools to adopt robust and well-evidenced approaches.</p>
