	<p pid="c.992W.0/1">I met with the British Toilet Association on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October</phrase> to discuss methods of disseminating good practice in public toilet provision. It was agreed that the BTA would work with ODPM to promote guidance, including examples of best practice, as part of the 'How To Manage Town Centres' guide produced under the Cleaner Safer Greener Communities cross-Government initiative led by ODPM. The Government will also consider with the BTA ways in which access to toilets in public places can be further encouraged, but will not be introducing legislation to impose a duty on local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.992W.0/2">The standards of cleanliness in and maintenance of public toilets are a matter of public health and are therefore subject to public health regulation. The design of public toilets required for disabled people is regulated by Part M of the Building Regulations, which specifies overall design, layout, fixtures and fittings of toilets suitable for use by disabled people. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 places a duty on service providers to make reasonable adjustments to the physical features of a building which make accessing a service impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people. There is no duty on central Government to monitor the availability or standards of public toilet provision for disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="c.994W.5/1">Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, digestive and/or nervous system of many species of birds. The general symptoms may include loss of appetite, diarrhoea, generalised weakness, swelling of the face and legs, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, blue discolouration of the skin or membranes, a drop in egg production, sneezing, coughing and laboured respiration. In disease caused by highly virulent types of virus, there may be no warning signs, with birds either being found dead or dying suddenly. The presenting clinical signs in different domestic species are influenced by husbandry conditions (e.g. whether birds are housed or not) and by the presence of intercurrent bacterial or other viral diseases.</p>

	<p pid="c.995W.6/1">The inventory of UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (including carbon dioxide) is compiled according to the guidance issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Accuracy checks on the UK inventory are conducted as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.995W.6/2">Inventory data compiled by our contractor are subject to an audited quality control and assurance programme. This ensures that the data sources are reliable and quality checked, that the choice of methodologies is transparent, that data are consistent over time, complete, comparable, and assessed for uncertainties. When required, methodological changes are made to take account of new data sources, or new guidance from the IPCC, relevant work by other international organisations, new research, or specific research programmes sponsored by Defra. Such improvements to the methodology are applied retrospectively to ensure a consistent time series of emissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.995W.6/3">Defra periodically tests the accuracy of key source sector estimates in the national inventory by means of independent peer review. Reviews completed to date include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and agriculture. Defra also funds independent verification of the reliability of the emissions estimates by combining measurements of the concentrations of selected GHGs at Mace Head in Ireland and a model of atmospheric transport developed by the Met Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.995W.6/4">Each year the GHG inventory is subject to annual reviews by trained expert reviewers working on behalf of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These reviews are a thorough cross-check of the accuracy and reliability of country estimates, and are designed to underpin the integrity of the convention process and the Kyoto protocol.</p>

	<p pid="c.997W.2/1">The Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) scheme began in 1987 when farmers were offered 10-year agreements to protect and enhance the flora and fauna on their land. The Government have always encouraged farmers to enter into another agreement at the end of their existing 10-year agreement. The Environmental Stewardship (ES) scheme, introduced this year, comprises the new Entry Level Stewardship, which is open to all farmers in England, and the more targeted Higher Level Stewardship. Higher Level Stewardship will replace the ESA and Countryside Stewardship (CSS) schemes, which were closed to new applicants in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.999W.2/1">Herbicide resistance in weeds and other wild plants can occur naturally over time as a response to exposure to certain herbicides. It is an agronomic problem well known to farmers, agronomists and the crop protection industry all over the world. Responsible use of herbicides can mitigate the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.999W.2/2">In the wider environment beyond the cropped areas of farms, herbicide tolerant weeds are not normally an issue as herbicides are not routinely used in such areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.999W.2/3">The approval and use of herbicides is closely regulated to ensure protection of the environment.</p>

	<p pid="c.999W.5/1">Researchers from the Centre for Hydrology and Ecology were commissioned by Defra to monitor for gene flow between the GM crops grown in the farm-scale evaluations and wild plants. Over 60,000 charlock seeds and 700 charlock plants were checked. The researchers reported the possible finding of a single hybrid between oilseed rape and the wild plant charlock (the scientists were unable to confirm that it was in fact a hybrid). The researchers returned to the site the following year and found no trace of any charlock plants carrying the herbicide tolerant gene. This was to be expected as I am advised that even if a hybrid charlock plant existed it would be unlikely to produce fertile seed and would not persist.</p>
	<p pid="c.999W.5/2">There are therefore no immediate implications of this research. The results of this study have been passed to the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and will be used along with other information in assessment of any future proposals to grow GM oilseed rape. We have also commissioned a review of the risks associated with the cultivation of herbicide tolerant oilseed rape, with emphasis on hybridization with wild relatives which is due for completion at the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1000W.2/1">The outbreak of Newcastle Disease in pheasants in Surrey in July 2005 was dealt with according to the published Defra Contingency Plan. A national disease control centre was established in London and a local disease control centre was set up in Reigate to manage the local response. The control policy was implemented quickly, the birds on the infected premises were culled, movement restrictions were imposed to limit the risk of disease spread and surveillance was carried out in the local area to detect any signs of disease. The outbreak was limited to one premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.1000W.2/2">Rapid exchanges of information with the French authorities identified the farms in France that had supplied birds to the infected premises. Newcastle Disease was subsequently confirmed on one premises in France and the authorities took appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="c.1000W.2/3">Dialogue with the European Commission and other EU member states was maintained and there was close liaison with third countries to keep them up to date with developments and seek to minimise the impact on trade.

	<p pid="c.1001W.0/2">In June this year The Royal Society published a report on the potential problems of ocean acidification as a result of increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This drew attention to the potential increase in acidity of the oceans which may occur over the next few centuries. This acidification has already been observed, although the full impacts on marine biodiversity are still relatively unknown.</p>
	<p pid="c.1001W.0/3">The Department, jointly with DTI, is actively funding research at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) in the North Sea to investigate the potential impact of increased seawater acidity on shallow sea ecosystems, biodiversity and the health of key organisms, including their capacity to adapt. This will enable us to better understand and predict the consequences of the increasing acidity of seawater. Full details of all related research can be found on the DEFRA website (<a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/proiect_data/">http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/proiect_data/</a>).</p>
	<p pid="c.1001W.0/4">The OSPAR Commission for the protection of the marine environment of the North East Atlantic has begun work on an assessment of the implications of increased carbon dioxide levels for our waters.

	<p pid="c.1002W.0/1">Organophosphates (OPs) are used in agriculture in both veterinary medicines and pesticides. All veterinary medicinal and plant protection products, including organophosphate products are subject to stringent regulatory control.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/2">The Government takes the safety of OPs very seriously and has funded a number of research projects into the effects in humans of exposure to OPs. Current research has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a link between chronic low-level exposure to OPs and ill health effects in humans. Some studies remain to be completed and the results of all the studies will be reviewed on their completion. We will also review our policy on OPs in light of these results.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/3">In addition to this Defra has funded Research and Development projects on the development of non-chemical alternatives for the control of sheep scab. The research into alternatives are complex long-term projects and if they do lead to the development of viable alternative products it is unlikely that such products will be available for at least five and probably 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/4">The Pesticides Safety Directorate also supports on-going R and D into less toxic and more environmentally benign alternatives for crop protection, either substituting for existing active ingredients or as part of broader Integrated Farm Management approaches. Again it will take some time before products based on this research are likely to be commercially available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/5">In 1998 a UK review programme of organophosphates used as plant protection products was announced and 40 organophosphates were identified for review. Although companies supported 21, there are now only nine approved organophosphate active substances in about 60 products. Partly as a result of this programme there has been a significant decline, to about 25 per cent. of the 1994 levels, in the use of organophosphate plant protection products.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/6">Details of veterinary medicines and plant protection research can be found on the Defra <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a> website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.0/7">Provided they are used according to their statutory conditions of use, plant protection products and veterinary medicines containing OPs should pose no unacceptable risk to operators, bystanders or consumers of the treated produce and as such there is no current scientific rationale for further restricting their use as a precautionary public health measure.</p>

	<p pid="c.1003W.2/2">Southern Water Services Limited, which provides sewerage services for East and West Sussex, Kent, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, estimates that 28.3 million m <sup>3</sup> of preliminary treated effluent is discharged from Brighton per year. Preliminary treatment means that the sewage passes through screens before discharge to the sea.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.2/3">Southern Water have applied for planning permission and discharge consents to upgrade the sewage treatment facilities serving Brighton to at least secondary treatment. When these are received we expect Southern Water to complete the approved sewage treatment scheme as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.2/4">The estimated total volume of secondary treated effluent discharged directly to the English Channel and the Solent by Southern Water is 140.2 million m <sup>3</sup> per year. Secondary treatment is the normal standard of treatment that sewage receives before discharge.</p>

	<p pid="c.1008W.8/3">Furthermore, more than one-third (35 per cent.) of all interviewed arrestees were problem drug users (i.e. they reported recent signs of dependence on one or more illicit drug types).</p>
	<p pid="c.1008W.8/4">Among those arrestees who reported recent drug dependence, 62 per cent. said that they were dependent on heroin.</p>
	<p pid="c.1008W.8/5">Four out of five interviewed arrestees reported the use of at least one illicit drug in the previous 12 months and nearly two-thirds of these drug users said they had committed an acquisitive crime, such as burglary, shoplifting or other theft, during the same period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1008W.8/6">Among those who used illicit drugs and had committed an acquisitive crime in the past year 60 per cent. overall said there was some link between their drug use and offending&mdash;this rose to 84 per cent. among crack users and 87 per cent. of heroin users.

	<p pid="c.1010W.2/2">There is no such requirement in Great Britain except for air weapons declared to be especially dangerous by rules made by the Secretary of State under section 53 of the Firearms Act 1968 i.e. air pistols with a muzzle energy in excess of six ft.lb or air rifles with a muzzle energy in excess of 12 ft.lb. The Act does not extend to Northern Ireland which has its own specific legislation</p>

	<p pid="c.1010W.5/1">The use of lethal force by police officers is subject to the same requirements as for any other use of force. In general terms, the Criminal Law Act 1967 provides that the police may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to effect an arrest or to prevent crime. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 also provides for the use of force when necessary in exercising any of the powers provided under that Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.5/2">Within the general framework of the law governing the use of force by the police, Chief Officers must have regard to the Statutory Code of Practice on the Police Use of Firearms and Less Lethal Weapons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.5/3">The Code is made under the Police Acts of 1996 and 1997. The Code of Practice is backed up by a more detailed Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms produced by the Association of Chief Police Officers which covers the more operational aspects of the use of firearms.</p>

The balance of these costs, currently estimated to be approximately &pound;110,000, was met from Defence funds. Personnel-related costs, mainly travel and subsistence, and minor costs for equipment movement not covered by commercial sponsorship, were met by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) from a number of budgets and have not been centrally identified. No estimate has been made of costs for which MOD is not responsible, such as the policing of the area surrounding the exhibition site.</p>

Since its publication, the Department has also announced plans to form a Joint Special Forces Support Group (JSFSG) and the Formation of Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR). As part of the normalisation process in Northern Ireland, I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August</phrase> this year that the Home Service Battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment will disband at the end of Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. However this does not affect the force structure or manpower numbers announced in July 2004 as the Royal Irish (Home Service) manpower is excluded from figures on the size of the Regular, trained Army. I have no plans at present for further significant adjustments to capabilities or service manpower. As part of the day-to-day running of the Department, however, there will continue to be routine adjustments at the margins of the defence programme, including those related to delivery of the MOD's efficiency targets.</p>

	<p pid="c.1029W.3/5">AWM's involvement will give comfort that Investbx will be supported for at least five years or until it reaches the point of sustainability. This guaranteed longevity is vital. Potential companies, investors and intermediaries need re-assurance that Investbx will be a permanent feature of the financial community.</p>

However, the potential for cost-effective measures by 2010 is around 10 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1035W.2/1">In the first instance the Government would expect demand for gas to reduce itself in response to price signals indicating tightness in the balance between supply and demand in the gas market. This has already been observed in previous winters, mostly from electricity generation but also, to a lesser extent, from large industrial users of gas. The scope for additional demand reduction from this sector was explored in a report, Estimation of Industrial Buyers' Potential Demand Response to Short Periods of High Gas &amp; Electricity Prices: A report to the DTI and Ofgem by Global Insight&quot;, which is available from the DTI website under</p>

	<p pid="c.1035W.2/3">The Government and Ofgem have been working with large industrial users to encourage the provision of more timely and easily accessible information to help market participants to identify commercial opportunities for such demand-side response.</p>

	<p pid="c.1041W.5/1">There are three main ways in which we have supported and continue to support developing countries in trade negotiations, including the current Round of World Trade Organisation (WTO) trade talks. First, through assistance to help countries formulate and develop their own trade policies, taking account of their domestic and regional circumstances. Second, by helping countries build their capacity to negotiate these policies with their partners, either regionally or international and thirdly, we help the actual participation of developing countries in trade talks themselves. For example, we have provided countries such as Lesotho and Zambia with the resources they need to secure analysis and expertise in order to help determine their own trade policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.5/2">We have supported regional institutions that in turn support their developing country members in trade analysis and negotiations. For example, through funding trade advisors in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) Secretariats and providing resources for the Caribbean Regional Negotiating Machinery, the body that helps Caribbean countries co-ordinate and pursue their negotiating efforts, not just in the WTO but in terms of other agreements such as the Cotonou Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.5/3">We have funded advisory support and resources to the Least Developed Country (LDC) group chaired by Zambia, to develop their position and attendance at the Hong Kong WTO ministerial and with other donors we contribute to a trust fund that will enable Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to attend the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December.</p>

	<p pid="c.1042W.6/1">The Department commissioned an analysis of data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service on predicted A-level grades to inform the consultation on Improving the Higher Education Applications Process which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-09">9 September</phrase>. The analysis has also been published and is available on the UCAS website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.6/2">The research found that: over half of all predicted grades were inaccurate; applicants from the lower socio-economic groups were more likely to receive an incorrect predicted grade than applicants from higher groups; 10.2 per cent. of applicants from the lowest <sup>1</sup> socio-economic group received under-predicted grades compared to 7.5 per cent. of the highest group (in terms of over-prediction, these proportions are 50.5 per cent. and 41.1 per cent. respectively); and applicants from independent and grammar schools are more likely to receive accurate grades than those at maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.6/3">Internal analysis of the same data was conducted by the Department and this informed the consultation document (a copy of this analysis has been placed in the House of Commons Library). It shows that a number of factors have a bearing on the accuracy of predictions, and bears out the assessment that there is an appreciable chance that predicted grades do not accurately foreshadow actual grades. This is a concern for students whatever their background and whether they received over- or under-predictions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1042W.6/4">It is clear from the research that some are disadvantaged more than others. One such group are students from lower socio-economic groups for whom, because of their generally lower levels of attainment, predicted grades are more likely to be inaccurate&mdash;and so the present system is least fair to the poorest students.</p>

	<p pid="c.1045W.2/1">Graduates have very high employment rates, reflecting the economy's strong demand for these higher level skills that are developed through participation in higher education. Graduates are significantly more likely than non-graduates to be in work, as well as enjoying greater pay and wider benefits like better health.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.2/2">Data from the Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey measures first degree graduate activity at a point six months after graduation. The most recent information, covering students who graduated in 2003/04, shows that 64 per cent. were in employment, 15 per cent. were undertaking further study, 9 per cent. were combining work with further study, and just 7 per cent. were unemployed. The remainder were not available for employment for various reasons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.2/3">The survey data also shows early indication that students who have studied shorter, more vocationally oriented courses such as Foundation Degrees are less likely to be unemployed than other graduates. This is very encouraging as most of the future growth in student numbers will come through these courses. The data on Foundation Degree graduates show: 36 per cent. were in employment, 33 per cent. were in further study, 26 per cent. were in employment and study, and 3 per cent. were unemployed, six months after leaving their course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.2/4">However, the main drawback of using the DLHE survey is that it is only a snapshot of the activity of graduates six months after graduation, which is not necessarily representative of their long-term employability. A study of the early careers of a sample of 1995 graduates shows employment rates rising rapidly in the months and years shortly following graduation, as the new graduates integrate into the labour market. By seven years after graduation, the overwhelming majority of graduates are in paid work or study, while just 1&ndash;2 per cent. of graduates remain unemployed <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.2/5">A study that tracks the labour market outcomes of 1999 graduates up to four years after graduation will be published on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.2/6">A cross-section of all (both recent and experienced) graduates in the labour market is available from the Labour Force Survey. Spring 2005 data shows that the employment rate of those with NVQ Level 4 and above as their highest qualification is significantly higher than those with lower qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.2/1">It is most regrettable if any disturbances are suffered by pupils during their public examinations. Officials have spoken to the local authority about this matter and the local authority has given its apologies for the disturbances suffered by the pupils concerned. The local authority envisaged that the measures put in place prior to the examination period would prevent any disturbance and acted to stop the noise as soon as problems were encountered. I am happy to confirm that all the details of the disturbances were reported to the examination boards so that due consideration could be given to the individual pupils involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.8/1">We have been clear about our priorities for public funding of a place in school, college or an apprenticeship for all young people, and a focus on adults without a solid foundation of employability skills. Prioritising public funding and ensuring adults can gain a Skills for Life or first full Level 2 qualification inevitably means less public funding being available for lower priority or non-qualification bearing provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.8/2">However, we see no reason to close courses which people value but a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners is central to delivering our Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.8/3">This requires a fundamental shift in expectations and practice about who pays for what. We will continue to provide fee concessions for learners on low incomes to access FE but we also expect adult learners, who can afford to do so, to make a contribution to the costs of their learning. Finding a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.8/4">In addition we have safe guarded funding for non-vocational learning, delivered mainly through local authority adult education services. In 2004/05 we provided over &pound;207 million to the LSC in support of this learning. This has risen to &pound;210 million in 2005/06.</p>

	<p pid="c.1047W.2/1">Research conducted by the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) found the funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges to be in the region of 13 per cent. LSDA's report suggested complete closure of the gap would cost around &pound;200 million. It also noted that the means of closing the gap should not be a large general increase in FE funding rates, but policy changes aimed at putting FE colleges and school sixth forms on a more equal footing. In light of this we are exploring the scope for addressing technical anomalies between school sixth form and further education systems and will be announcing decisions on the way forward shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.1050W.0/1">The Department has commissioned questions in the British Social Attitude Survey, a major annual independent survey undertaken by the National Centre for Social Research. In surveys prior to 2005 these questions included:</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/2" class="indent">If the respondent was to advise a 16-year-old about their future, whether they would say that they should stay in full-time education to get A levels, study full time to get vocational qualifications, or leave school to get a job (1990, 2002, 2004);</p>

	<p pid="c.1050W.0/4">Additional questions were also added to the survey in 2005 to ask:</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/5" class="indent">Out of every 100 people finishing school at 16, how many do the respondents think go on to do academic qualifications, and how many do more work-related qualifications;</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/6" class="indent">How far respondents agree or disagree with the following statements:</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/7" class="indent">Only people who can't do academic qualifications should do vocational ones;</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/8" class="indent">Vocational qualifications are easier than academic qualifications;</p>

	<p pid="c.1050W.0/12">The National Centre for Social Research publishes the results of these surveys each year. Copies of the published reports are available in the DfES library. The results from the most recent surveys in 2004 and 2005 have not yet been published.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/13">The Department has commissioned the Public Perception of Education in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005. This is a survey of the general public of attitudes towards the education and skills system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/14">Independently, the Learning and Skills Council published the results from a survey undertaken by BMRB. The survey asked respondents in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden whether they thought academic or vocational skills were most important for a career.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.0/15">Research provides a useful indicator of the general public's attitude on educational issues. The Department is aware that work-based learning is considered of lower status to academic learning. That is why we are introducing specialised Diplomas as part of our 14&ndash;19 White Paper reforms.</p>

	<p pid="c.1051W.6/1">The Army Prosecuting Authority (APA) routinely consults the Attorney-General before directing trial in serious cases where there is joint jurisdiction. For instance a court martial has jurisdiction in cases where a person subject to military law faces a charge before court martial of murder/manslaughter committed outside the United Kingdom. Consequently, before directing trial in cases of murder or manslaughter committed outside of the United Kingdom the APA would consult the Attorney-General as a matter of course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.6/2">In cases of offences committed against the criminal law of England and Wales, but committed outside of the United Kingdom and where the defendant has ceased to be subject to military law since committing the offence the APA is obliged by statute to obtain the consent of the Attorney-General before directing trial (section 132, sub-section 3A of the Army Act 1955).</p>

	<p pid="c.1054W.2/1">Government Office for the North East officials have had several meetings during the last three years or so with North Tyneside council officials at which the council raised the need for major structural maintenance of a number of bridges in the borough. The Department for Transport provides specific funding for highway structural maintenance to bridges on the Primary Route Network and since 2003&ndash;04 has allocated funding totalling &pound;3.224 million to the council for bridges in North Tyneside at Hadrian Road (A187) and the Coast Road (A1058) at Blue House. This funding is in addition to the &pound;9.944 million local transport block&quot; allocation to North Tyneside council since 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/2">Burns Closes Bridge is not on the Primary Route Network and is not, therefore, considered to be an immediate national priority for funding. However, it is recognised that closure of the bridge pending maintenance/reconstruction work, is causing considerable inconvenience to local residents and bus services and therefore I have asked my officials to continue to liaise with the council as it considers the various options for addressing the problem, with a view to assessing the extent to which we are able provide support.</p>

	<p pid="c.1058W.6/1">The Government believes that current fixed opening hours encourage binge drinking before last orders and create flashpoints for conflict through late night queuing for transport and fast food. In addition, the current system only allows pubs, bars and clubs to have extended house if they provide music and dancing. This means that the late night economy is dominated by activities that carry greater risk of nuisance and are aimed primarily at the younger market. We anticipate that the Licensing Act 2003, which takes effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November</phrase>, will enable a greater variety of premises to adopt flexible hours and also encourage a safer, more orderly and gradual dispersal of customers. The Act also provides the police with a raft of new powers for tackling disorderly and criminal behaviour and grants responsible authorities and interested parties, such as local residents, the right to challenge a licence application or to ask for a review of an existing licence. Recent feedback from local authorities confirms that local residents are already taking full advantage of their new rights. My Department will closely monitor and evaluate the impact of the Act on crime and disorder to ensure that the Act delivers on our promise to provide a more civilised late night society.</p>

	<p pid="c.1059W.9/1">Our aim has been to create a fair and effective licensing system that does not impose unnecessary costs and burdens. We believe that community halls will benefit from being able to provide a wide range of activities (such as live music, theatre or cinema) under a single licence, rather than having to apply for several licences and permissions as is the case under the current regime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.9/2">Unless alcohol is to be sold at events, there will be no requirement for community halls to pay for the licence for regulated entertainment, such as live music, theatre, and cinema. Once this licence has been obtained, there will be no need for further applications, unless the terms of the licence need to be changed. In addition, halls should no longer be subject to high compliance costs of disproportionate standard conditions that often apply under the current public entertainment licensing regime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.9/3">However, we are aware that some community and village halls have concerns about their ability to work within the new regime. We therefore asked action with communities in rural England (ACRE) to join our high level hroup of key stakeholders to represent these concerns. ACRE are conducting an evaluation project to review the impact of the act on village halls. The licensing fees review panel is also considering the impact of fees on a wide range of stakeholders, including community and village halls. We will consider carefully the evidence from these reviews and any recommendations to help community and village halls operate within the new regime.</p>

	<p pid="c.1066W.2/1">Since 2002 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has increased its financial and human resources in Africa. The budget of the FCO's Africa Directorate rose from &pound;35.1million in the financial year 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;48.8 million in the current financial year (FY 2005&ndash;06). The budget for FY 2006&ndash;07 has not yet been finalised. The overall numbers of staff (FCO and locally engaged) employed in our posts in Africa increased from 2,221 in 2002 to 2,509 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.2/2">There have been reductions in the overall numbers of staff in Africa Directorate in London as part of the broader reorganisation of the FCO to deliver the FCO's international strategy and to meet efficiency targets. The Directorate currently has 54 staff. There are no present plans to increase this. But in addition to staff in Africa Directorate itself, many other FCO personnel in London also work on Africa, including on counter-terrorism, sustainable development and human rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.2/3">The FCO and Africa Directorate regularly review the numbers, grading, functions and location of FCO staff in Africa in order to ensure the effective delivery of the Government's strategic priorities and value for money. Some posts in Africa contract out a number of services such as guarding, cleaning and estate maintenance. There are currently no plans to outsource any of the Directorate's core activities in the region.</p>

I subsequently requested a review of the Government's rules on the accepting and wearing of non-British awards.

	<p pid="c.1068W.3/2">With staff moving every 12&ndash;48 months and education facilities at posts' locations overseas varying, continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO addresses this problem through its Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA), which enables children to board at school in the UK while their parents remain subject to the worldwide mobility obligation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.3/3">CEA is based on ceilings, up to which boarding school fees are met. These are set annually at the median of the fees charged by the schools in the Headmasters' Conference within a 70-mile radius of London; most members of the Diplomatic Service have a home near London and choose schools in the south-east. Members of staff must cover the difference themselves if the fees of the boarding school they send their children to exceed the CEA ceilings. The cost of GCSE and A Level exams in subjects that form part of the national curriculum are refunded on top of CEA. The costs of Special Education Needs (SEN) for children who require it are also covered separately in accordance with the recommendations of the appropriate local education authority (LEA).</p>

	<p pid="c.1076W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell to Mr. Paul Burstow, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-19">19 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many deaths of people <i>(a)</i> under 18 and <i>(b)</i> over 18 years in (i) London and (ii) each London borough where the use of (A) heroin/morphine, (B) ecstasy, (C) amphetamines, (D) other misuse of substances and (E) alcohol was recorded as the cause there have been in each year since 1997. (18650)</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/4" class="indent">Relevant figures are only readily available for deaths where the underlying cause was either related to drug poisoning or directly related to alcohol (alcohol abuse, dependence and poisoning, and diseases directly related to alcohol use, such as chronic liver disease and cirrhosis). It is not possible to identify from death certificates which substance was the primary cause when more than one was involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/5" class="indent">There were three deaths from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis among those aged under 18 in Greater London in the period 1997 to 2004, and none from other causes linked to alcohol using the ONS definition. Examination of the certificates suggests that these three deaths were not in fact alcohol-related.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/6" class="indent">There were 14 deaths involving drug misuse among residents of Greater London aged under 18 in the period 1997 to 2003, with fewer than five deaths in each of the categories requested (heroin/morphine, ecstasy, and amphetamines). In order to maintain confidentiality of information supplied to ONS by coroners for statistical purposes only, precise numbers cannot be provided for this age group.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/7" class="indent">For alcohol-related deaths, figures for those aged 18 and over are provided in Table 1 below by individual year of registration of death. For drug-related poisoning deaths, figures for those aged 18 and over are provided in Table 2. For reasons of confidentiality, these drug-related poisoning data, have been provided for rolling five-year periods and figures have been suppressed where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/8" class="indent">It should be noted that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/9" class="indent">The figures for alcohol-related deaths include the long-term effects of alcohol use. Such as cirrhosis of the liver, whereas the figures for drugs all relate to poisoning from drug use.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/10" class="indent">Deaths from poisoning which involved both drugs and alcohol are coded as being due to drug poisoning, in accordance with international rules for coding cause of death.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/11" class="indent">The figures on alcohol include only those where the underlying cause was alcohol related. The figures on specific drugs include any mention of the substance where the death was related to drug poisoning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/12" class="indent">The figures on alcohol are for deaths registered in the calendar year and are based on the original underlying cause of death. The figures on drugs are for deaths occurring in the calendar year and are based on the final underlying cause of death and confidential additional information supplied by coroners to ONS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.0/13" class="indent">For these reasons the figures provided for drug-related poisoning and alcohol-related deaths are not comparable.</p>

	<p pid="c.1083W.5/1">As part of the wide range of VAT reliefs for charities, charities providing rescue or first aid services can purchase VAT free the specialised telecommunications, aural, visual, light enhancing or heat detecting equipment which they use. These charities are also able to buy medicines, medical equipment, and ambulances free of VAT. In addition, charities like the RNLI which provide rescue or assistance at sea, do not pay VAT on the purchase of lifeboats and certain related equipment, or on the costs of having these lifeboats repaired or maintained. However, agreements with our European partners mean that it is not now possible to extend the scope of the zero rates available to charities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.5/2">No Government have considered the issue of irrecoverable VAT more seriously than this one. We have conducted two major reviews to see if we could find an efficient, affordable and principled solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.5/3">Through these reviews, we came to two conclusions: first, that it would not be an affordable or efficient use of public resources to reimburse all 250,000 charitable bodies in the UK for the VAT they incur, regardless of the activities they are involved in or their financial health, and which, according to estimates from the charitable sector, would cost over &pound;500 million per year; and second, that there was no fair and principled basis on which we could decide that some charities would be reimbursed their VAT and some would not.</p>
	<p pid="c.1083W.5/4">As a result of Gift Aid and other measures, we are currently providing nearly &pound;2.5 billion worth of support to charities through the tax system each year, including over &pound;200 million in VAT reliefs. This forms part of the total Government support for the voluntary and community sector, which stands at over &pound;3.3 billion per year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.3/1">The Department's radiation protection research programme supports a number of studies investigating the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). A study by Dr. Draper and colleagues on childhood leukaemia and distance from power lines, recently published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and funded under this programme, has added to a large existing body of work in this area (BMJ Vol 330, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June 2005</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.3/2">The Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) keeps the world-wide research findings on EMF continually under review. In 2004, on the basis of a comprehensive review of the existing body of research to date, the HPA-RPD (previously the National Radiological Protection Board) recommended the adoption of new EMF exposure guidelines in this country. In addition, in view of the scientific uncertainties, the HPA recommended the Government consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency electromagnetic fields. They have also noted that the majority of elevated magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.3/3">Practical precautionary measures are now being considered in detail by a stakeholder advisory group that includes the Government Departments, agencies, electricity industry, specialists and public concern groups.

NICE guidance does not automatically apply in Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="c.1094W.8/1">The Prison Service has placed women prisoners' needs centre stage, and has made significant progress against the recommendations made by both the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) and the CJINI/HMCIP Inspection Team in its report on Ash House published in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/2">Key developments to date include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/3">1. <i>Recognition of the special needs of women in custody, with</i> gender specific programmes and policies, including policies on:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/4" class="indent">The Management of Mothers and Babies</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/5" class="indent">Suicide and Self Harm</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/6" class="indent">Child Protection / Public Protection</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/7" class="indent">Resettlement</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/8" class="indent">Anti-bullying</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/9" class="indent">Induction</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/10" class="indent">First Night</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/11" class="indent">Drugs and Alcohol</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/12" class="indent">Foreign Nationals</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/13">Policies on these topics will shortly be issued for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/14">2. <i>Ash House now has a distinct gender specific identity,</i> supported by a discrete management structure:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/15" class="indent">A NIPS female Governor dedicated to the management of female prisoners is now in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/16" class="indent">A female Governor, on secondment from HMPS, was appointed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-20">20 June</phrase> to lead the development of the regime for Ash.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/17" class="indent">The majority (75 per cent.) of staff in the unit are female.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/18" class="indent">Prisoners have access to women staff at all times.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/19">3. <i>Child-centred visits are being further developed.</i> Additional monthly child centred visits are available for life sentenced prisoners. NIPS is exploring the possibility of allowing children to stay overnight with their mother in prison occasionally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/20">4. <i>Women prisoners have access to a wider range of education, work and rehabilitative programmes</i> specifically linked to the skills requirements of women prisoners, which should enhance their prospects of acquiring employment upon release from custody. They also have access to a working out scheme. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/21" class="indent">NIPS conducted a detailed analysis on the re-integration needs of women prisoners. This was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-07">7 October</phrase> and has already resulted in:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/22" class="indent">the opening of a careers advice surgery, run by NIACRO;</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/23" class="indent">PBNI providing a dedicated re-integration worker before the end of the year to support women before and after release; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/24" class="indent">the appointment of a bereavement counsellor early in 2006 with the support of CRUSE.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/25" class="indent">Courses offered vary from numeracy and literacy to A-level Psychology, and include cookery, music, drama and aromatherapy; CLAIT is also available and NVQ's are due to be available from March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/26" class="indent">Five new teachers are being appointed and two new VT Instructors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/27">5. <i>All women receive a healthcare screening on committal</i> to prison and they are offered the opportunity to join a well women&quot; clinic. There is 24 hour nursing care available and women prisoners have access to a female doctor. A Health Needs assessment of the women in Ash House is scheduled for later this year. Psychologists are currently preparing an in-depth analysis of the offending behaviour needs of women prisoners and the prisoners will be consulted extensively in its development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/28">6. The Prison Service is committed to gender specific training of the staff working with women prisoners. Training already delivered includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/29" class="indent">Child Awareness</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/30" class="indent">Cultural Diversity</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/31" class="indent">Housing Rights</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/32" class="indent">Management of Aggression</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/33" class="indent">Mental Health Awareness</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/34" class="indent">Mother and Baby</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/35" class="indent">Prisoner Management</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/36">Further training will include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/37" class="indent">Working with females in custody</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/38" class="indent">Working with vulnerable females in custody</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/39" class="indent">Dealing with Mental Health Issues</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/40" class="indent">Presentation Skills for Induction</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/41" class="indent">Lifer training</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/42" class="indent">Suicide Awareness</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/43" class="indent">Nature of Adolescence</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/44">7. <i>On self-harm and suicide, a new committee has been established</i> on which prisoners are represented. A buddy scheme has been set up and 24 free telephone access to the Samaritans has been provided. A new self harm policy is being drafted and women who need to be observed can now remain on general association. Two Cognitive Behavioural Therapy nurses were recruited in June from a local Health Trust to work with women prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/45">8. <i>Installation of in-cell sanitation has begun</i> in Beech House and the Service plans for the women prisoners to move there early next year, while facilities are being installed in the cells at Ash House. In the meantime, women have access to lavatories on request.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/46">Notwithstanding these improvements, the Prison Service recognises that Ash House may not be the most suitable long-term option to house women prisoners and alternative accommodation is being considered as part of the Service's on-going strategic development programme. This is designed to map out the way forward for the next 10&ndash;15 years. It will also examine the feasibility of housing long term women prisoners separately from short term women prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/47">In the meantime, the Prison Service will continue to work, in partnership with others in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and with women in custody to improve its performance further. Indeed, the Human Rights Commission has been given access to Ash House&mdash;to the facilities and to the women who want to be interviewed&mdash;to monitor the current situation independently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/48">However, this issue is not something for the Prison Service alone. Many agencies and the community as a whole have a role to play in ensuring that support measures are in place to reduce the likelihood of vulnerable women ending up in custody and to cater for the reintegration and resettlement needs of those sent to prison.</p>

	<p pid="c.1096W.2/2">In addition a supply of leaflets about the benefits of immunisation have been distributed to all GP practices, libraries, pharmacies, residential and nursing homes. Translink are involved in the campaign displaying posters, promoting the flu programme, on their vehicles.</p>
