A summary of some our achievements to date can be found at http://defra/corporate/achievements. htm. I am confident that the Kingston upon Hull, North constituency will have benefited from these.</p>

To help local authorities achieve their own targets Defra's Waste Minimisation Fund was set up in 2002. As a result of successful bids for money from this fund by Kingston upon Hull City Council, the residents of the city should over the next few years reap the benefits, with a total of almost &pound;2.4 million being awarded to the city council for the period 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 for projects to expand kerbside recycling schemes across the city covering a total of 110,000 households, including those in the Kingston upon Hull, North constituency.</p>

In 1997, none of the river's length within the city council area was considered to be of fair or better chemical quality, while by 2003 70 per cent. was measured as being of fair chemical quality. Over this same period the biological quality of the river has been of fair quality or better throughout. These improvements reflect Defra's policy to improve river water quality, which is one of the headline indicator's of sustainable development and to raise compliance with the EC Water Framework Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1130W.0/4">With grant support from Defra the Environment Agency has undertaken maintenance and improvement of flood defences around most of the Number estuary, including those in front of Hull, while also managing the River Hull defences along with the city council, and riparian owners. Since the mid 1990s, and as a result of this Defra funding the Agency has invested approximately &pound;25 million on improvements to the Hull defences on the estuary, and approximately &pound;5 million on works on the River Hull.</p>

	<p pid=".1134W.3/1">There have been underlying changes to the provision for and the funding of under fives which mean it is not meaningful to give per pupil funding over time. These include the abolition of flat rate nursery vouchers and changes from a nursery formula based on the number of eligible pupils in an area, to a formula based on the number of nursery places made available in an area. Additionally, authorities have been increasing provision to meet the commitment to universal nursery education for all three and four-year-olds and in recent years LEAs have been funded for extra pupils to allow them to reach universal provision.</p>
	<p pid=".1134W.3/2">However, the following figures show the education expenditure by both central and local government for under fives in real terms. These figures do not include expenditure on child care nor on Sure Start:</p>

However, the Audit Commission report &quot;Statutory assessment and statements of SEN: in need of review?&quot;, published in spring 2002, estimated the cost to be &pound;2,500.

	<p pid=".1141W.5/1">Funding for maintained special schools is provided through local authorities. The majority of local authority funding is provided by government with the rest from council tax. It is for local authorities to determine how best to distribute government funding between and within services. Funding for schools, including special schools, is distributed by application of a funding formula, which calculates the budget share for each school. It is for each authority to devise and revise its own school funding formula taking into account local needs and circumstances. In general terms the funding per pupil for maintained special schools is higher than that for pupils in maintained mainstream reflecting the greater needs of those pupils. Access to funding for capital projects is also provided through local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1141W.5/2">The prime source of funding for non-maintained special schools operated by charities or charitable trusts on a not-for-profit basis and approved under Section 342(1) of the Education Act 1996 is through fees paid by local authorities placing children in schools. However, approximately &pound;8 million of funding is made available to the sector from the Department. This funding is paid direct to schools by the Department and includes capital and revenue funding. Capital funding covers Devolved Formula Capital, Electronic Learning Credits and an Annual Capital Round that is usually run on a competitive bidding round for projects that meet specific criteria set by the Department. Revenue funding includes access to Schools Standard Grant, Standards Fund, Teacher Threshold and Laptops for Teachers.</p>
	<p pid=".1141W.5/3">No government funding is provided directly to non-maintained special schools operating in the commercial sector. The primary source of funding for these schools is through the charging of fees for pupils placed at the school. Almost all pupils are placed by local authorities who are responsible for any fees.</p>

If the penalty is not paid or a court hearing requested within this time then a fine is registered against the individual. The evaluation of data from the pilots of penalty notices for disorder showed that payment of fines added to the penalties paid on time resulted in an overall payment rate of 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1145W.11/15">Information from the Department for Constitutional Affairs shows that the payment rate for financial penalties was 59 per cent. in 2001&ndash;02, 55 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03, 74 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04 and 79 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05 (August to October).</p>
	<p pid=".1145W.11/16">However, as a result of revisions in the method of calculating the payment rate, direct year-on-year comparisons cannot be made and although recent changes to the way data are collected from Magistrates' Court Committees allows confiscation orders to be excluded, it is still not possible for fines, costs and compensation to be identified separately, so the figures relate to financial penalties in general, as opposed to fines in isolation.</p>
	<p pid=".1145W.11/17">The Department for Constitutional Affairs' Enforcement Programme is delivering a wide programme of change aimed at improving the enforcement and administration of financial penalties. The national payment rate is currently (Q3 2004&ndash;05) at 80 per cent., up 9 per cent. on the same period last year, and performance is on trajectory to meet the 78 per cent. national target at the end of the year. The ongoing work of the Programme includes improving the intelligence available to enforcement teams through a variety of information-sharing measures, national implementation of the new legislative framework for enforcement provided by the Courts Act and taking the opportunity offered by the launch of HMCS to introduce more effective and efficient ways of working. The Programme has also devised and supported a series of nationally co-ordinated fine enforcement blitzes, with the most recent&mdash;'Operation Payback 2' in November 2004&mdash;resulting in a positive impact on the payment rate of &pound;1.7 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1151W.0/3">The Immigration Service operates cameras at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. In addition to the systems operated solely by the Immigration Service access is provided at other locations by the port operators to their local systems.</p>
	<p pid=".1151W.0/4">A combination of NDT, including Passive Millimetric Wave Imagers, Heart Beat Detectors, Gamma Ray Scanner and CO <sub>2</sub> probes are deployed at various locations including Calais, Coquelles, Dunkirk, Ostend, Zeebrugge and Vlissingen. This technology is either operated by the port authority, the carrying company or by UK immigration staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1151W.0/5">CO <sub>2</sub> probes are also deployed at various UK locations and in addition the Mobile Freight Search Team, deploying both CO <sub>2</sub> probes and body detection dogs covers a variety of United Kingdom Ports.

It is an offence under the Representation of the People Act 1983 to fail to comply with a request for information from an ERO or to provide false or inaccurate information to a registration officer.

	<p pid=".1169W.12/1">In February 1997, the then Department of the Environment issued the Social Landlords Discretionary Reduction of Service Charges (England) Directions 1997 and the Social Landlords Mandatory Reduction of Service Charges (England) Directions 1997. These allow, and in specified circumstances require, local authorities and other social landlords to reduce service charges levied on owners of leasehold flats for repairs, maintenance and improvement carried out to their homes. Guidance to local authorities and other social landlords on reducing service charges to their leaseholders was issued at the same time. Copies of the Directions and the guidance note have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1169W.12/2">The Department issued the Housing (Service Charge Loans) Regulations 1992 giving tenants of flats a right to a loan in respect of service charges for repairs, where the lease was granted under the Right to Buy scheme. The repayment periods for the amounts secured by loans are included in the Regulations. The Regulations were amended by the Housing (Service Charge Loans) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2000. These allowed local authorities to set their own interest rates for discretionary loans. Copies of both sets of Regulations have been placed in the Library of the House. The information booklets for tenants: &quot;Your right to buy your home&quot; and &quot;Thinking of buying a council flat?&quot; published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and its predecessors both refer to the right to a loan.</p>

	<p pid=".1186W.2/2">The estimated current cost of tax-exempt savings plans, with an annual premium limit of &pound;300 is around &pound;70 million per year and in recent years this cost has been increasing at an annual rate of about 10 per cent. Increasing the limit to &pound;600 per annum would potentially cost the Exchequer an extra &pound;30 million per year in the long run. Doubling the limit does not double the cost because many tax-exempt savings plan customers do not save at the current maximum.</p>

	<p pid=".1188W.9/1">The instructions given by the Crown Prosecution Service to the Bar regarding defence applications to cross-examine complainants about previous sexual history in rape trials are provided in the CPS Instructions to Prosecuting Advocates booklet. The booklet is published on the CPS website <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk">www.cps.gov.uk</a>. It states:</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.9/2" class="indent">&quot;Sections 41&ndash;43 of the Act (restriction on evidence or questions about a complainant's sexual history) were brought into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-04">4 December 2000</phrase>, The House of Lords has considered this aspect of the legislation in the case of R. <i>v.</i> A. (judgment <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-17">17 May 2001</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.9/3" class="indent">In that case, the House held that prior consensual relationship between the complainant and the defendant might in some circumstances be relevant to the issue of consent. However, all the Law Lords accepted that the complainant must not be treated unfairly. The judgment emphasises &quot;the presumption of exclusion&quot; under the Act. Consequently, advocates should encourage the court to consider section 41 in the context of the judgment overall To do otherwise may lessen the practical effect of the reforms contained in section 41.</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.9/4" class="indent">It is essential that advocates are robust in dealing with applications under section 41 and that the correct procedure is followed to ensure that inappropriate questioning does not take place.</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.9/5" class="indent">If the court grants leave to cross-examine a complainant about previous sexual history, it will be essential to review the position relating to special measures. It may be necessary to make an application to the court for one or more of the special measures provided by the Act or to apply to vary a pre-existing direction&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.9/6">In addition, the CPS instructs experienced counsel in rape cases ensuring that scrutiny of defence applications, if made at trial, to admit evidence of previous sexual history takes place and inappropriate applications are countered, robustly.</p>

	<p pid=".1191W.6/1">The application by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority (TWPTA) for an order under the Transport and Works Act to authorise a new Tyne crossing was considered at a public inquiry in March 2003. The Department received the inspector's report in September 2003. However, in February 2004 the TWPTA informed the Department that they were reviewing the powers they needed to implement their scheme and, in September 2004, they formally requested many significant changes to their draft order. In the interests of fairness, other interested parties were given an opportunity to make representations to the Department about those changes. Those exchanges concluded in December and the responses are being considered.</p>
	<p pid=".1191W.6/2">Furthermore, the TWPTA's proposed changes to the order have raised a substantial number of detailed drafting points on which my Department has sought clarification. We still await a response from the TWPTA to the drafting points we have raised. Once we receive satisfactory answers we will make every effort to proceed to a decision as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1194W.2/1">Under legislation the rules governing meter-readings are the responsibility of the independent regulator, Ofgem. Under their supply licences, gas and electricity suppliers are obliged to ensure that customers' meters are physically read and inspected once every two years, although suppliers will seek to read meters more frequently. Where meter-readers are unable to read the meter, the supplier will estimate usage, and this will be reflected in the bill. Customers may provide their own meter readings instead of accepting an estimated bill. The supplier must accept that reading.</p>
	<p pid=".1194W.2/2">Ofgem figures show that, in September 2004, 1,526,349 electricity and 1,289,419 gas customers were repaying debt to their suppliers. Ofgem does not collect data on how many customers are in debt due to inaccurate billing.</p>

	<p pid=".1200W.2/1">The total expenditure by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on external consultants in 1996&ndash;97 was &pound;11.8 million and in 2003&ndash;04 was &pound;23.2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.2/2">The vast majority of our expenditure on external consultants is associated with our major Information Communications Technology (ICT) and Estate Construction programmes. Consultants also advise on legal, financial and personnel issues and provide support in areas where we have skills shortages. Increasing expenditure over recent years is largely associated with the growth in our ICT programme which is being used to support change in the organisation. Expenditure on consultants from 2002&ndash;03 to 2003&ndash;04 has reduced by &pound;0.5 million. We would therefore anticipate expenditure in future years to level out or reduce in line with this trend. Collating forecast expenditure figures for the financial years outlined could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".1203W.3/1">We welcome the work by the US Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) which is a necessary measure to ensure transparency and accountability in the spending of Iraqi oil revenues. The SIGIR report examines whether the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) established and implemented adequate managerial, financial and contractual controls over disbursements made to Iraqi Ministries. The report states that CPA accounting procedures were insufficient.</p>
	<p pid=".1203W.3/2">CPA procedures were deficient by the standard of western governments, but the SIGIR report must be considered alongside the following points:</p>
	<p pid=".1203W.3/3" class="indent">The difficult operating conditions in Iraq, which meant that procedures were sped up to get Ministries up and running and reconstruction projects off the ground. The alternative would have been to institute a system that could have delayed expenditure for months.</p>
	<p pid=".1203W.3/4" class="indent">The progress made by the CPA in improving financial management in the Iraqi Ministries and of the budget process. The CPA introduced a transparent framework for management of the national budget and took measures to improve reporting and recordkeeping. But implementing measures took time, which was inevitable given the total lack of transparency under the former regime.</p>
	<p pid=".1203W.3/5">In addition the SIGIR report does not tally with the report by the UN-mandated International Advisory Board (IAMB) into CPA management of the Development Fund for Iraq (FPI). The IAMB was set up to oversee audits of the DFI and ensure that the objectives set forth in UNSCR 1483 were met. Although concerns were raised over the lack of metering of Iraq's oil pipelines and controls over oil sales, it concluded that</p>
	<p pid=".1203W.3/6" class="indent">&quot;all known oil proceeds . . . have been properly and transparently accounted for in the DFI&quot;.</p>
