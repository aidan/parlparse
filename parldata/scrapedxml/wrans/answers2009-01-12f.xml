	<p pid="f.14W.5/1">The National Assessment Agency (NAA) is responsible for administering National Curriculum tests. The NAA has provided the following table of marks required in Key Stage 2 English and mathematics tests to achieve Level 4 and 5. NAA uses a range of statistical and judgmental procedures to ensure that the standards of performance required for the award of each level are maintained consistently from year to year. The content of each test changes every year, therefore different numbers of marks may be required in different years to achieve a certain level. Levels are anchored to the National Curriculum so that a level 4 achieved in one year represents the same level of performance as a level 4 achieved in any other year.</p>

	<p pid="f.18W.0/1">The Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) steering group was established in March 2008 and had its final meeting in October 2008, at which it signed-off its report and recommendations to Government. Steering group members were reimbursed travelling expenses, but were not paid a fee for participating in the review.</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/2">To inform its consideration of the issues, the steering group commissioned:</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/3" class="indent">Two on-line surveys: one seeking young people's views on the SRE they had received at school; and the other seeking teachers' views on what was preventing more effective delivery of SRE. The young-people survey was supplemented with a residential event with a small group of UK Youth Parliament members to discuss issues in more detail. The administration of the surveys, the analysis of the results and facilitation of the residential event were undertaken by the Sex Education Forum, which was paid &pound;13,625 to carry out this work; and</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/4" class="indent">Two literature reviews: one which reviewed the existing evidence on parents' views on SRE; and one which reviewed the international evidence on the impact of SRE. These reviews were carried out free of charge by Professor Roger Ingham, from the Centre for Sexual Health Research, Department of Psychology, University of Southampton, who was a member of the SRE review steering group.</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/5">The total cost of the review was &pound;18,630.</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/6">Presentations were made to the steering group, summarising the key findings of the on-line surveys and literature reviews. A copy of each presentation will be placed in the House of Commons Library. In addition, a number of individuals and organisations submitted evidence to an 'SRE Review' e-mail account that was established to allow those who were unable to be accommodated on the steering group itself, to submit views. These submissions were circulated to the SRE review steering group for their consideration. Copies of these submissions will also be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/7">Oona Stannard, Chief Executive of the Catholic Education Service was a member of the SRE Review steering group and was in full agreement with the group's report and recommendations. Other than the SRE Guidance published in 2000, and the non-statutory programmes of study for Personal Well-Being issued in 2007, the Government have not issued guidance to Catholic or other schools on SRE delivery. The resources that schools use to support delivery of their SRE programmes are determined by each individual school.</p>
	<p pid="f.18W.0/8">The Government published their response to the report by the SRE review steering group on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-23">23 October</phrase>. A copy of both the group's report and the Government response are available at:</p>

Services for vulnerable children have been identified as a key priority area for the implementation of the CAMHS review's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="f.22W.2/5" class="indent">Information on the number of uncleared cases is routinely published in Tables 1 and 2.1 and the Summary and Target sections of the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics, the latest copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library or online at:</p>
	<p pid="f.22W.2/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="f.22W.2/7" class="indent">Table 1 provides the available information on old scheme cases, by quarter from May 1999, information prior to this date is not available. Table 2.1 provides the information requested for current and old scheme cases but not including cases cleared clerically, from March 2003 when the current scheme was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="f.22W.2/8" class="indent">Under its three year Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency committed to reduce the number of current scheme applications to 90,000 by the end of March 2009. As of September 2008 the Agency had reduced the number of uncleared current scheme cases by 66% from 220,100 cases in March 2006 to 75,700 including cases cleared clerically.</p>

	<p pid="f.26W.2/1">The Department takes very seriously its responsibilities to safeguard personal and other sensitive data. In the last 12 months, a number of major changes have been made in the way that data is handled and stored, especially insofar as items of removable equipment (such as laptop computers and memory sticks) are concerned. Significant improvements have been introduced, including the widespread deployment of encryption.</p>
	<p pid="f.26W.2/2">The information about lost and stolen equipment, given in response to the question referred to, was obtained from centrally maintained records of security incidents. Detail is not available from these central records to indicate the nature of disciplinary action that was taken in individual cases. Such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost, given that the bulk of these incidents occurred a number of years ago. However, the Department is currently reviewing its disciplinary policies to better reflect the importance which it attaches to the security of valuable assets and information.</p>
	<p pid="f.26W.2/3">Following the Cabinet Office review of Data Handling Procedures in Government, the Department has designated senior staff as Information Asset Owners, who are personally accountable for providing assurance in relation to the information assets within their respective business areas. Additional steps taken to reduce future losses include measures which prevent employees from copying information to removable media, except where this has been encrypted.</p>
	<p pid="f.26W.2/4">Information on the costs of seeking to recover earlier lost or stolen equipment and which of such items had software protection installed is not available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="f.27W.11/1">DWP treats temporary and permanent employees in the same way. All employees are paid on the basis of an annual salary and not an hourly rate. The appropriate starting salary is determined by grade and employees are normally recruited onto the minimum of their pay band. Progression up the pay band is based upon the annual pay review. It is possible for employees within a grade to be on different rates of pay but this is normally due to factors such as individual length of service or the effects of pay increases following previous promotion.</p>

	<p pid="f.29W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what steps Jobcentre Plus is taking to assist people recently made redundant back into work. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/4" class="indent">A person who is made redundant and makes a claim to Jobseeker's Allowance is interviewed by one of our Personal Advisers, to explain the help and support available which is then tailored to their individual needs. They are helped to draw up a job plan and Jobseeker's Agreement, which is reviewed fortnightly. Jobseekers can also access job vacancies on our website and our electronic jobpoints, as well as contact our Jobseeker Direct telephone helpline.</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/5" class="indent">We have also recently introduced a &quot;Finding your way back to work&quot; leaflet to help people understand what help is available, and a &quot;Jobkit&quot; to help those made redundant in preparing to find a new job.</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/6" class="indent">Where a business announces a number of redundancies we provide our Rapid Response Service to support the employer and employees. This can involve a range of support, such as workplace briefings by Jobcentre staff, skills assessments, and advice on how to look for a new job. The budget for this service was doubled this year, from &pound;3m to &pound;6m, and will be doubled again next year to &pound;12m. This will enable us to deal more effectively with situations involving 20 or more redundancies, or where there is a group of smaller redundancies in one locality.</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/7" class="indent">We have also announced that more people who are made redundant will get help through Programme Centres. These provide people with different kinds of help such as help in CV-writing and gaining jobsearch skills. Access to Programme Centres was previously restricted to those furthest from the labour market. Advisers will now have the discretion to allow any customers to access this help as soon as they become unemployed. This will be useful for people who have been in work for a long time and have no recent experience of job hunting.</p>
	<p pid="f.29W.2/8" class="indent">We are also extending the successful Local Employment Partnerships to provide help for newly redundant people. Through these, Jobcentre Plus is already working successfully with over 13,000 employers, and has helped over 70,000 people into work.</p>

Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br/> 2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br/> 3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 4. Data are unrounded.<br/> 5. Figures cover only those vacancies advertised through Jobcentre Plus, and so will not capture all available vacancies. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="f.31W.6/20" class="indent">In common with most large, modern organisations the great majority of our services are now delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have more than half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. We remain the largest office network in Government with 747 modern Jobcentres which are supported by 31 contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

This exercise will be completed by early 2009. As an immediate measure, I have decided to suspend proposed further Jobcentre closures while the current economic uncertainties exist, which will allow us to increase our capacity to deliver services to those in need of help.</p>

	<p pid="f.34W.0/2">Actively seeking work means that a person must carry out a reasonable number of activities, normally a minimum of three, every week in trying to secure work. At the beginning of a claim and at regular intervals thereafter, the customer will discuss with their adviser what employment they are looking for. They will then be required to actively seek work in whatever way is most appropriate for that type of employment and their individual circumstances. These activities will be agreed by both parties.</p>
	<p pid="f.34W.0/3">When considering the reasonableness of the activities, the adviser will take into account the customer's skills, qualifications and abilities, along with any personal limitations they may have. They will also consider how long the customer has been unemployed and the current availability of that work in the local labour market.</p>
	<p pid="f.34W.0/4">Examples of the types of activities a person may engage in are: speculative enquiries with employers; using all means available to locate suitable work, such as Jobseeker Direct, Jobpoints, internet, newspapers and magazines; registering with appropriate recruitment and employment agencies; and applying for all suitable jobs by the most appropriate means.

	<p pid="f.37W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many new cases were brought to the Child Support Agency (CSA) in the last 12 months; and in how many of these cases the CSA has started maintenance payments.</p>

	<p pid="f.37W.2/8" class="indent">It should be noted that in July 2008 compulsion to use the Agency was lifted for all new parents with care claiming income based benefits. Prior to this a proportion of new applications received from Jobcentre Plus were in fact change of circumstances to existing cases or are actually closed prior to a maintenance schedule being set up. These applications are included in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="f.37W.2/9" class="indent">As there can be a delay between the time an application has been assessed, and maintenance requested and the receipt of the first payment of maintenance a larger proportion of applications made in recent months will therefore not yet have started payment. The number of applications resulting in a payment for recent months will therefore increase over time, and these figures will be revised in future versions of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics.</p>

The Government have accepted her recommendations and will be developing the first ever cross government National Strategy for Mental Health and Employment, which will help us improve work outcomes for people with mental health problems across the spectrum.

	<p pid="f.43W.8/1">The proposal to change the allowed length of backdating from 12 months to three months was part of a wider package of pensions measures to increase take up and make benefit processes simpler. Older people will be able to claim pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in one phone call without having to fill in, sign or return any claim forms. This will benefit thousands of pensioners often put off by complicated claim forms and the fear of large amounts of personal information being required. Over the long-term the package results in extra expenditure for pensioners, rising to &pound;250 million per year by 2050.</p>

Details of the estimated costs and savings associated with the original proposals in the wider package of measures can be found in the SSAC report.</p>

	<p pid="f.47W.5/1">We do not collect information about voluntary work, aside from when it is done as a mandatory part of a New Deal programme, so we are not able to supply the figures requested.</p>
	<p pid="f.47W.5/2">The Government believe that voluntary activity can play an important role in helping unemployed people to keep in touch with the labour market. Voluntary work can also provide benefit recipients with skills and experience that may improve their chances of finding paid employment, and can improve social cohesion. However, there must be a proper balance between allowing benefit recipients to pursue voluntary activity, while at the same time encouraging them to retain a clear focus on moving off welfare into paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="f.47W.5/3">Recent research has looked at volunteering in the context of mandatory options in the New Deals, including &quot;The Longer Term Impact of the New Deal for Young People&quot; (DWP working paper 23, 2008) and changes to benefit rules related to volunteering, &quot;Volunteering and Availability for Work: An evaluation of the change to Jobseeker's Allowance regulations&quot; (DWP working-age research report 190, 2004).</p>

	<p pid="f.48W.2/1">The Government are doing all they can to support people who become unemployed and through Jobcentre Plus and the New Deal we are offering more support to help individuals move back into work as quickly as possible. The pre-Budget report made available to DWP an additional &pound;1.3 billion of funding which will ensure that over the next two years, through Jobcentre Plus and our private and voluntary providers, we not only maintain, but increase, the support we offer.</p>
	<p pid="f.48W.2/2">We have already doubled the resources available to the rapid response teams who offer advice and support to those affected by redundancy. These funds will be doubled again from April 2009. The support provided by these teams can include information about sources of alternative jobs within the labour market or help with applying for existing vacancies; on-site job shops and fairs; helping people draw-up CVs or brush-up their job search skills; and, where appropriate, job-focused training to help individuals develop skills needed within the local labour market or other support to overcome barriers to taking up a specific job offer, such as travel to work expenses.</p>
	<p pid="f.48W.2/3">The Government are also increasing their engagement with employers. Through Local Employment Partnerships, Jobcentre Plus is already working with employers across the country to help them meet their recruitment needs locally, and to help long-term unemployed customers find work. As announced in the pre-Budget report, LEPs will now be extended to cover the newly redundant and the Prime Minister will chair a National Employment Partnership comprising major private and public sector employers who will work with the Government to agree what more employers can do to help tackle rising unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="f.48W.2/4">The publication of the White Paper 'Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future' on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>, CM 7506, also demonstrates the Government's commitment to further reform to reduce welfare dependency and support more people into work. There are still many new job opportunities coming up all the time. Last month Jobcentre Plus took an average of 10,000 new vacancies every working day, with many more coming up through other recruitment channels. Together with the advice and support provided through Jobcentre Plus, this means that most of those who become unemployed can find another job quickly; over half of new claimants leave jobseeker's allowance within three months and around three quarters leave within six months.</p>

These fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="f.50W.5/4" class="indent">The Rapid Response Service was introduced in April 2002 and has been delivered through Jobcentre Plus in conjunction with a range of partners such as Regional Development Agencies, local authorities and the Learning and Skills Council in England, and equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales, to help employees facing redundancies. As you know the Secretary of State announced recently an extension of the service.</p>
	<p pid="f.50W.5/5" class="indent">Employers are made aware of the service in three main ways. First, Jobcentre Plus is informed by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform when employers notify redundancies of 20 or more employees. We contact each of those employers to discuss the range of support that Jobcentre Plus is able, with its partners, to offer employees, and to decide which measures will be helpful. Second, we provide information through channels that employers use regularly, including: the Jobcentre Plus website <a href="http://www.iobcentreplus.gov.uk/employers">www.iobcentreplus.gov.uk/employers</a>, the websites of organisations who help to deliver the Rapid Response Service to employers and a range of leaflets and business/trade media. Third, some employers receive an account management service from Jobcentre Plus in return for their commitment to helping our individual customers to find work. In that context, employers facing difficulties may discuss their needs directly with Jobcentre Plus and appropriate levels of support will be offered.</p>
	<p pid="f.50W.5/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus now aims to contact and offer support to every employer which we learn is making 20 people or more redundant. We also make efforts to identify situations where employers are making fewer than 20 people redundant and to offer Rapid Response Service-style support whenever we consider this likely to be the most effective way of helping the people involved.</p>

	<p pid="f.52W.3/1">Each year, before winter fuel payments are made, the DWP carries out a complex data matching process involving around 18 million records. The aim is to determine or confirm personal circumstances and calculate the payment amount due.</p>
	<p pid="f.52W.3/2">The data matching exercise identifies any issues, including those relating to household arrangements. Issues often arise when customers provide incomplete addresses, for example they may omit a flat number. If DWP identify large numbers of people residing at the same address action is taken to try to identify if it is a multiple dwelling address.</p>
	<p pid="f.52W.3/3">If a customer contacts the Department because they feel their winter fuel payment is for the wrong amount, the position is checked and the payment corrected if necessary. Out of 12 million payments in 2007-08 less than a quarter of 1 per cent. of individuals received a top up due to incorrect payments.</p>

We are working with the Government Actuaries Department and representatives of the various pension's schemes to establish the details for every member of staff affected by this transfer.</p>

	<p pid="f.71W.6/1">We are currently engaged in the most substantial peacetime naval shipbuilding programme since the first world war. This is centred on the Type 45 destroyers, the Astute class submarines and the future aircraft Carriers. Following on from these we will have the future surface combatant and successor class submarine. This programme will provide the capability the Royal Navy needs to remain one of the world's most powerful maritime forces. As the House knows we have announced that the in-service dates of the carriers will be delayed by one to two years allowing closer alignment for the entry into service of the aircraft which will fly from them. HMS Daring, the first of class of the T45 destroyers, is expected to enter service next year with its five successors at a rate of approximately one a year thereafter. The House will also know that there has been some delay to the Astute programme. We are re-baselining the programme and I will make an announcement in due course. The future surface combatant will follow-on from the carriers, but it is far too early to announce an in-service date. The future surface combatant and the successor class submarines are at the very early stages of design.</p>

	<p pid="f.72W.3/1">The effect has been very positive. We are pressing ahead with Future Lynx and giving a new priority to the Warrior upgrade and the FRES reconnaissance vehicle. These are all very important programmes for current operations and the nation's future defence capability. We have been able to do this by re-profiling the carrier build programme without any loss to defence capability. Although the in-service dates of the new carrier have been delayed, of which the House is aware, this has allowed us to more closely align their entry into service with the aircraft which will fly off them.</p>

It provides excellent mobility and firepower and is well adapted for manoeuvring in the Afghan desert. Heavy firepower in Iraq has been effectively delivered by Warrior and Challenger, both of which are well adapted to the Iraqi terrain. No Jackals have therefore been deployed on operations in Iraq.</p>

In very exceptional circumstances service personnel may be retained if their drug use is considered to be uncharacteristic and their retention would be in the interest of the service. In these cases retention is subject to the successful completion of a special programme, which is designed to re-educate and give training in cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>

The Ministry of Defence does not collect on a national basis data on the numbers of homeless veterans. We have however estimated that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population, at least in London, has fallen over the last 10 years. Independent research by the university of York published this year has shown that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population in London in 2007 was about 6 per cent. This is a much lower proportion than in the mid-1990s when separate research reported a figure of 20-25 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="f.88W.0/1">There are currently four voluntary 'Turtlewatch' groups operating on the SBAs. Three groups in the Western Sovereign Base Area (WSBA) and one group in the Eastern Sovereign Base Area (ESBA).</p>
	<p pid="f.88W.0/2">Of the three WSBA groups, Episkopi patrols and monitors beaches focused around the Episkopi station area, which includes non-military and military controlled land. This group is predominantly led by British ex-pats and consists of 80-100 members with some serving military personnel assisting in their own time. In addition some beaches in the Episkopi area are monitored by Pissouri turtlewatch, and both Pissouri and Episkopi turtlewatch work together in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="f.88W.0/3">Akrotiri turtlewatch monitors beaches around the Akrotiri peninsular, which includes military and non-military controlled land. This group has a larger proportion of military personnel contributing and the key co-ordinators are serving. Akrotiri turtlewatch is also working with Glasgow university and up to 12 students assist with monitoring every year.</p>
	<p pid="f.88W.0/4">In the ESBA there is one turtlewatch group at Dhekelia that monitors the local station beaches. This is co-ordinated by serving military/civilian personnel in their spare time.</p>
	<p pid="f.88W.0/5">Patrols are undertaken by these groups on an almost daily basis on known or potential turtle nesting grounds between May and September to identify turtle tracks and nest sites. Once a nest is located it is protected from stray dogs and foxes by placing a metal cage and tape around the general area of the nest. Around hatching time the nest is observed from a distance and after three days following the first hatch, the nest is excavated to ensure all the hatchlings can escape to the sea.</p>
	<p pid="f.88W.0/6">The active members of Turtlewatch are licensed by the SBAA's Environment Department to undertake these activities following appropriate training.</p>
	<p pid="f.88W.0/7">Since 2007 all data relating to turtle nests, hatches and deaths etc. are collated by the Sovereign Base Area Administration (SBAA Environment Department) for use in developing SBA environmental policy and assessing the impact of foreshore activities.</p>

	<p pid="f.96W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence and its Agencies have several hundred computer systems in use ranging from corporate IT systems serving thousands of users across the Department and its Agencies, to business area systems serving smaller communities. The following data covers those systems within the MOD and its Agencies where accreditation is centrally controlled by Defence Security and Standards Assurance (DSSA), which are either connected to the MOD networks, or are stand alone above Secret, or are systems that contain significant value to the MOD e.g. those systems that contain particularly sensitive or personal data. It does not include those systems where authority for accreditation has been delegated e.g. stand alone systems with no onward connectivity, and where a further breakdown of information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="f.96W.2/2">58 per cent. of systems have been through the accreditation process. Of these, 27 per cent. of systems are classed as fully accredited and are being operated in a manner within the MOD's Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO)'s risk appetite; 31 per cent. of systems are currently classed as having conditional or interim accreditation with constraints placed on the operation of the system to ensure that identified risks are adequately managed within SIRO's risk appetite.</p>
	<p pid="f.96W.2/3">The balance of systems (42 per cent.) are in the process of being accredited; this represents the significant workload undertaken to plan and develop solutions for new equipment systems or platforms; this also includes applications from legacy systems, many of which will be migrated onto the developing Defence Information Infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="f.96W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is committed to improving energy efficiency of the defence estate and the latest performance confirms that the Department is on target to meet, and possibly exceed sustainable operations on the Government estate (SOGE) energy related targets.</p>
	<p pid="f.96W.5/2">The MOD's consolidated, weather corrected performance for 2007-08 relative to 1999 to 2000 levels as reported by the Sustainable Development Commission in December 2008 was:</p>

	<p pid="f.96W.5/11">This significant reduction has been achieved through a combination of estate rationalisation, greater focus and co-ordination of effort to increase energy awareness and the development of effective local initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and improvements in data management. In addition, the MOD continues to identify opportunities to further reduce energy consumption for example, investing in our infrastructure to improve building energy management and efficiency, installing more energy efficient lighting, automated metering and making available funding for energy efficiency/carbon reduction projects.</p>

	<p pid="f.104W.6/3">We have reviewed the Fleet Tanker element of the MARS programme and have concluded that there is scope for considering alterative approaches to its procurement. We expect to determine a way forward in 2009, after which the main investment decision will be taken. The later classes of MARS ship, Fleet Solid Support and Joint Sea Based Logistic, are at an earlier stage of their procurement than the Fleet Tankers. It is, therefore, too early to determine when their main investment decisions will be taken.</p>

	<p pid="f.108W.9/1">Removal of waste arising from the UK nuclear weapons test programme on the island of Kiritimati was undertaken between 2005 and 2008. Previous survey work had identified elevated levels of radioactivity associated with the presence of radium-226, commonly used to luminise vehicle instruments at the time of the test programme, but no other elevated levels of radioactivity substances were identified during the 2005 and 2008 programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.108W.9/2">The materials (including non-radioactive) comprised approximately:</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="f.108W.9/13">A total of 111 individual locations were identified where elevated levels of radioactivity associated with radium-226 were present. Removal of the radium required both the actual instrument and a small quantity of soil to be taken from the site.</p>
	<p pid="f.108W.9/14">The highest radioactive material fell into the low level waste category.</p>
	<p pid="f.108W.9/15">All of the sites were extremely localised with radium-226 restricted to an area of no more than a few square metres.</p>

	<p pid="f.109W.8/1">The information requested is not held. I can confirm that in preparation for Operation TELIC in 2003 large numbers of Reservists were called out, some at very short notice. This was because the rapidly developing situation in Iraq at that time required us to act quickly and we were not able to give as much notice to Reservists as we would have wished. Since then, the mobilisation process now ensures that Reserve units receive advance notice that they will be required to provide individuals to support a specific operation (this can be up to six months notice). More importantly, once Reservists have been selected for mobilisation, we have tried to ensure that, whenever possible, a minimum notice of 28 days is given to the individual and his employer before the Reservist reports for duty. In many cases it is far more than 28 days. However, it must be accepted that the nature of military operations means that inevitably individuals may receive less notice of mobilisation due to rapidly changing requirements.</p>

	<p pid="f.111W.3/1">The Trident II D5 ballistic missile is the delivery system for the UK's nuclear deterrent that is carried by our Vanguard-class submarines. It is an evolutionary development of the Trident IC4 missile that the UK originally planned to procure but was superseded by a decision in 1982 to procure the Trident II D5 missile. As we made clear in the December 2006 White Paper: &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994), we are participating in a programme to extend the life of the Trident II D5 missile until around 2042.</p>
	<p pid="f.111W.3/2">With regard to the new class of submarines to replace the Vanguard-class, as we have previously stated, the first of class is forecast to enter service in around 2024. Also, as explained in the December 2006 White Paper, a final decision on the number of submarines that will be procured will be made when we know more about their detailed design. That decision will determine the timetable for entry into service of further submarines.</p>

	<p pid="f.120W.8/1">Warm Front is an ongoing process. We are aware that the Scheme Manager eaga plc, did, with the Department's knowledge, stop allocating work for a five day period between 3 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-09">9 November</phrase> while a new computer upgrade was being implemented. This is now fully operational and work is being allocated an usual.</p>
	<p pid="f.120W.8/2">The over seventies scheme in Essex is almost certainly part of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), which commenced in April and operates throughout Great Britain. CERT places an obligation on energy suppliers to meet targets through encouraging households to take up energy efficiency measures. It is at suppliers' discretion how they meet their targets, but they will typically use subsidised offers to promote key measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation, and high-efficiency lights and appliances.</p>
	<p pid="f.120W.8/3">Suppliers must focus 40 per cent. of their activity on a priority group of vulnerable and low-income households, which includes those over 70. All six major household energy suppliers currently offer priority group households free loft insulation (where less than 60mm already exists) and free cavity wall insulation, subject to a survey of the property.</p>

It was necessary to provide the contractor for this facility with a nuclear indemnity but before doing so I am told that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) approached the private nuclear insurance market in 2007 in connection with insurance for nuclear liability claims to courts outside the UK and not party to the Paris and Brussels Convention. It became clear from these discussions that commercial insurers were not prepared to quote on these potential liability claims. This established an insurance industry position in principle, in light of which the NDA and its professional advisors concluded that the position that insurers would take on the specific issue at Sellafield was clear and therefore no additional conversations were required.</p>

	<p pid="f.124W.8/1">The aim of the DTZ study is to provide an initial assessment of the potential economic impacts of proposed Severn Tidal Power schemes, including a Cardiff-Weston barrage, on the regional economies of Wales and the South West of England. In assessing economic impact the study has focused on those sectors that are expected to be most significantly impacted by tidal power development. Where possible, impacts have been quantified in terms of employment and gross value added variances.</p>
	<p pid="f.124W.8/2">I plan to consult on the interim findings of the Severn Tidal Power feasibility study early in the new year; the DTZ report will be published at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="f.134W.2/1">The operating framework for the national health service, which sets out the specific business and financial arrangements for the NHS in any given year, first made specific references to supporting carers in the 2008-09 report. The recently published operating framework for 2009-10 goes further. It requires primary care trusts (PCTs) to work with their local authority partners and publish joint plans on how their combined funding will support breaks for carers, including short breaks, in a personalised way.</p>
	<p pid="f.134W.2/2">&pound;150 million will be included in PCTs allocations over the next two years. &pound;50 million will be provided in 2009-10 and &pound;100 million in 2010-11. This money will support all carers.</p>
	<p pid="f.134W.2/3">The 2006 White Paper 'Our health, our care, our say' announced the New Deal for Carers. It included Caring with Confidence (CwC)&mdash;a training programme for carers. The first training commenced in August 2008 and distance-training modules will be available from January 2009. It is being run by a consortium led by the Expert Patients Programme and includes the three main carers' organisations (Carers UK, Crossroads and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers) and Partners in Policymaking. &pound;4.4 million per year has been allocated to fund this programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.134W.2/4">The delivery of CwC will be through existing local providers of services&mdash;whether from the third or statutory sectors. Local providers have been invited to become part of this delivery process, through a nationally advertised tendering process; from this work CwC will put in place a national network of local providers.</p>

	<p pid="f.145W.9/1">Health Resource Group version 4 (HRG4) has been designed over a number of years specifically for Payment by Results (PbR), with substantial clinical involvement. The Department is planning for HRG4 to be introduced for payment of tariff from April 2009. The changes underpinning the new tariff have already been extensively discussed and tested with a wide range of stakeholder groups.</p>
	<p pid="f.145W.9/2">The new tariff is currently being 'road tested' by the NHS, the purpose of which is to support early service and financial planning and invite comments on the clarity and comprehensiveness of guidance. The Department is also using the exercise to identify whether the new tariff has any unintended consequences. Following the road testing exercise, the final tariff is expected to be confirmed in January.</p>
	<p pid="f.145W.9/3">The Department has already determined though, that in order to help trusts adjust to the new tariff, the full range of potential changes will not be introduced in 2009-10. Tariffs for accident and emergency services will remain based on the current tariff structure, and although HRG4 has the capability to generate HRGs for procedures in outpatients clinics, there will not be a mandatory tariff for these procedures next year. The full benefits of the new design will be realised gradually, as the quality of underlying activity and cost data improves.</p>
	<p pid="f.145W.9/4">The Department has undertaken an analysis which shows that because funds are directed more accurately to specialised services under HRG4, the number of services requiring specialised service 'top-ups' is reduced from nine to two. The only two services requiring top-ups in 2009-10 are orthopaedics and specialised services for children, and in both cases the level of top-ups is lower than in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="f.147W.12/2">Holistic health initiatives include the Healthy Schools Programme, the developing Healthy Further Education Programme and the development of a new Child Health Promotion Programme for five to 19-year-olds, as well as the availability of the NHS Teen LifeCheck (a quick quiz-style online questionnaire for 12 to 15-year-olds).</p>

A copy of &quot;The Youth Alcohol Action Plan&quot; is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="f.147W.12/4">All these activities are aimed at supporting young people throughout England. Each Government office, primary care trust and local authority receives support and guidance from the Department to ensure optimum implementation across their local area. In addition, the Department funded the two-year Teenage Health Demonstration Sites pilot to examine ways of delivering better health information, advice and guidance to young people. Northumberland was one of the four demonstration sites. The evaluation report will be available in the new year, and early results look promising.</p>

	<p pid="f.148W.2/2">Private companies selling hearing aids to people with hearing impediments are regulated by the Hearing Aid Council Act 1968, as modified 1989. The Act makes it a statutory requirement that hearing aids may only be sold by a dispenser who is suitably qualified and who is registered with the Hearing Aid Council (HAC)&mdash;which was established by the Act to set standards of professional training, performance and conduct for individuals and companies involved in the assessment of hearing loss and subsequent sale of hearing aids in the private sector.</p>

It is for individual primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide the level of funding they allocate to end of life care services, including hospices, based on assessments of local needs and priorities. The level of funding a hospice receives is a matter for negotiation between the local PCT and the hospice.</p>
	<p pid="f.157W.2/2">However, the Department has made available an additional &pound;27 million over three years to be given to hospices as grants. 36 grants were awarded in 2006, 40 more in 2007 and a further 40 in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="f.157W.5/1">Suppliers have responded to the Invitation To Tender for antiviral medicines to increase the stockpile which was published in the <i> Official Journal</i> in August 2008, and these have now been evaluated. Orders have not yet been placed. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, it is not yet possible to make any announcements on the speed of the stockpile build. I will arrange for a copy of the tender documents to be placed in the Library when public procurement procedures allow.</p>
	<p pid="f.157W.5/2">There is ongoing discussion at scientific and policy level of antiviral household prophylaxis. For example, the Department has completed modelling which indicates that this is an effective strategy. We have also sought scientific advice on the issue from the Scientific Advisory Group on Pandemic Influenza (SPI), our external scientific advisory committee. This has concentrated on issues such as the size of the stockpile needed and the strategic approach to prophylaxis when the stockpile contains more than one type of antiviral. We are currently considering the delivery implications of a policy based on household prophylaxis, and the procurement approach to be followed. We are not currently considering other forms of prophylaxis.</p>
	<p pid="f.157W.5/3">Experts from the British Thoracic Society, British Infection Society and Health Protection Agency developed Clinical Management Guidelines for patients with pandemic influenza. These include proposals for antibiotics to be used for the treatment of bacterial complications. The guideline suggests antibiotics active against <i> Heamophilus influenzae</i>, <i> Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> the bacteria, which most commonly cause respiratory infections. These include penicillin based products such as co-amoxiclav or a tetracycline such as doxycycline. For those allergic to penicillin, a macrolide such as erythromycin or clarithromycin is recommended. Complications requiring antibiotic therapy would be treated with a cephalosporin such as cefuroxime, which are administered with IV fluids.</p>

	<p pid="f.161W.2/1">My previous answer highlighted the importance of gloves and aprons in supporting good hygiene practices in an influenza pandemic. The quantities and type of gloves and aprons, based on the number and type of patient interactions, are currently being investigated. The large numbers required and the need to ensure availability at point of use strongly favours the creation of a pandemic stockpile (without impacting on the Business As Usual requirement for these products). We are currently considering the most appropriate commercial options for building this stockpile.</p>

In common with other Government Departments the Department applies the Cabinet Office's Baseline Personnel Security Standard. That Standard includes a check on Criminal Record Declaration of 'unspent convictions' by the applicant. The Department's Human Resources division then decide on a case-by-case basis, making a judgment based on that conviction and the post applied for, and considering whether there would be any conflicts of interest in employing that individual.</p>

	<p pid="f.178W.6/1">One of Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) objectives is to help to reduce avoidable health inequalities through resource allocation. To achieve this objective, a separate health inequalities formula has been developed which targets funds at the places with the worst health outcomes. This is a more transparent way of contributing towards the reduction in health inequalities through resource allocation, and highlights our commitment to tackling the issue of health inequality.</p>
	<p pid="f.178W.6/2">ACRA could not determine the proportion of allocations to apply the health inequalities formula to and left it to ministerial decision. Ministers decided to apply the formula to 15 per cent. of the allocations, excluding the mental health component of the formula (which already includes an adjustment for unmet need) and HIV/AIDS. This keeps the distribution of funding between the most and least deprived areas in line with the previous formula.</p>

A six-month public engagement process was established this year in order to gather views and comments from stakeholders, service users and members of the public which will help inform next year's Green Paper.

The vision for social care is laid down in &quot;Putting People First&quot;, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. This document was signed by six Secretaries of State and a range of key stakeholders from local government and partner bodies. The Department is now working with all of these stakeholders to support the delivery of that vision. The Department is investing more than half a billion pounds in developing more personalised care services through the Social Care Reform grant.</p>

	<p pid="f.187W.5/1">The number of agency staff working in social services departments by local authority is not held centrally. The Local Government Association estimated in 2006 that the average percentage of agency staff working in posts for adults within local authority social services departments in England was 5.2 per cent. This was estimated to equate to around 8,800 agency staff covering a range of roles including field social workers but also residential care workers and administrative staff.</p>

	<p pid="f.188W.0/1">In July 2008 the Department published a response to the strategic review of Third Sector Funding and Investment consultation, undertaken between December 2007 and March 2008. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="f.188W.0/2">The vision for future funding of the third sector included: investment in strategic partners; support for innovation excellence and service development; promote and support volunteering; and contracting for expertise required at national level. There was strong support for this vision and the principles underpinning this approach.</p>
	<p pid="f.188W.0/3">From the feedback on the proposals we have developed a funding framework that underpins a wider third sector investment programme. The programme will be developed over time as more funding schemes in the Department are brought into the framework. For 2009-10 the third sector investment programme will include:</p>
	<p pid="f.188W.0/4" class="indent">Innovation Excellence and Service Development Fund - this replaces the Section 64 General Scheme of grants - project funding; and</p>
	<p pid="f.188W.0/5" class="indent">Strategic Partner Programme - this replaces the Section 64 General scheme of grants-core funding.</p>
	<p pid="f.188W.0/6">We anticipate that from 2010-11 a new volunteer investment fund, building on the existing Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme, will form part of the Third Sector Investment Programme. Moving forward, policy specific funding schemes and initiatives will be drawn under the banner of the wider programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.188W.0/7">This process will result in transformation of previous piecemeal arrangements for funding the third sector into a strategic portfolio of investments that will more explicitly support delivery of the Department's objectives and priorities supporting a fundamental step change in the Department's funding relationships with third sector organisations.</p>

The WHO recommendation appears to be largely based on the USA Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin B12 published in 2000. The Institute of Occupational Medicine recommendation was based on a review of evidence some of which was not available to COMA in 1991.</p>

	<p pid="f.207W.2/2"><i> </i>The Rural Payments Agency is obliged to recover overpayments. The reasons for these Single Payment Scheme (SPS) overpayments include entitlement correction work&mdash;some of which claimants asked us to carry out, partial payments&mdash;which were made in the 2005 and 2006 SPS scheme years and where the final claim value once validation is completed is now less than the amount paid and penalties.</p>
	<p pid="f.207W.2/3">Penalties can be applied to SPS applications for several reasons; submission of an application after the deadline, inaccuracies in an application, if a farmer does not meet cross compliance standards, or if they apply, set aside management rules. The size of the penalty will depend on the problem found. For example the size of a land penalty will depend on the amount of invalid land claimed. The size of a late submission penalty will depend on the number of days after the deadline on which an application was received.</p>

	<p pid="f.210W.2/1">Bluetongue is caused by a virus within the Orbivirus genus of the family Reorvirades. At present 24 distinct serotypes have been identified as a result of serum neutralisation tests.</p>
	<p pid="f.210W.2/2">Bluetongue was first described in South Africa but has since been recognised in most countries in the tropics and sub-tropics. Since 1999 there have been widespread outbreaks of Bluetongue in Greece, Italy, Corsica (France) and the Balearic Islands (Spain). Cases also occurred in Europe in Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Yugoslavia. These cases have been well north and west of the disease's previous normal distribution. It appears that the virus has spread from both Turkey and North Africa.</p>
	<p pid="f.210W.2/3">Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8) was first found in Western Europe when it was detected in the Netherlands in summer 2006, after which it spread to Belgium, Luxembourg, Western Germany and parts of North East France in the same year. In 2007, Northern Europe experienced a dramatic increase of new cases in all existing infected areas, and cases numbered into the many tens of thousands as disease steadily spread across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="f.210W.2/4">Uptake of vaccine has varied by region in England and Wales and over time. Sales data from the supply chain suggests that enough vaccine has been sold across the whole of England in 2008 to vaccinate around 60 per cent. of susceptible animals. However, we cannot give accurate county specific data.</p>

	<p pid="f.212W.5/2">The Environment Agency published a policy statement on composting and the potential health effects from bioaerosols produced as a result of the composting process in 2001. This set out its requirement for site specific bioaerosol risk assessments (for proposed composting facilities within 250 metres of dwellings or workplaces). The figure represents a precautionary measure and the point at which a site specific bio-aerosol risk assessment is required. The policy applies to all composting activities irrespective of waste type. Kitchen food waste cannot be composted in open windrows.</p>
	<p pid="f.212W.5/3">Since then, further work in this area has been undertaken by various parties. This has reiterated that there is insufficient information to determine the risk to human health from bioaerosols from composting. It has recommended that the trigger distance remain in place. This is a precautionary approach, based on research which has shown that bioaerosols should reduce to background levels within 250m. In 2007 the Environment Agency issued a revised policy statement which re-affirmed the need for site specific bioaerosol risk assessments to be carried out.</p>

Local authorities should be free to manage their smallholdings estates as they see fit because they are in the best position to make decisions in their areas in the interests of the communities they serve.

	<p pid="f.219W.2/1">DEFRA has not commissioned/funded any work specifically into the effect of animal disease on food security. However, we continue to fund research, to the value of &pound;1.6 million annually, on a number of major endemic diseases of livestock, including cattle, sheep, pig and poultry, which seriously affect or are a serious potential threat to livestock production and thus food security. In addition, there is a programme of research, costing in the region of &pound;8 million annually, on exotic diseases aimed at protecting UK livestock from exotic disease incursions.</p>
	<p pid="f.219W.2/2">One of the ways in which we are able to minimise the effects of animal disease on UK food security is by having a supply of livestock products from a wide range of countries, including the UK, which effectively spreads the risk. Disease outbreaks in the UK or elsewhere in the world affecting our trading partners should see a swift response in trade flows as the market seeks to offset the impacts of any supply disruption.</p>

Used tyres are also utilised as a substitute fuel in cement kilns and pyrolysis plants.</p>
	<p pid="f.224W.0/3">The DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) ran a successful tyre programme from 2005 to 2008. This led to the development of two publicly available standards for tyre shred and crumb and for tyre bales and the development of markets for their use.</p>

A range of agencies and local organisations will refer individuals ranging from community organisations through to further and higher educational organisations and youth offending teams. Local areas should construct a programme of interventions that are appropriately tailored to an individual who has been identified as vulnerable to the pull of violent extremism. When an individual is referred they will be assessed for the level of risk they pose and suitable voluntary interventions, diversionary activity and support will be offered in response.</p>

	<p pid="f.253W.5/1">The Department for International Development is providing &pound;4.5 million over the period 2006-07 to 2008-09 to the Governance and Transparency Fund to strengthen national civil society in Afghanistan. This is providing assistance&mdash;delivered through several international NGOs (including Cranfield University, Relief International and Making Integrity Work) working with a wide range of local partners including the Afghan Civil Society Forum, Integrity Watch Afghanistan, the Afghan Institute for Management Training and Enhancement of Indigenous Capacities, the Killid Group.</p>
	<p pid="f.253W.5/2">Delivery of aid through Government of Afghanistan (GoA) channels is the most effective way to build state capacity, ensure value for money, and co-ordinate funding with national priorities. At local level, the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) supports the creation of Community Development Councils (CDCs), which decide, on behalf of their village or community, what is most needed in their area. So far over 21,700 Community Development Councils have been established across Afghanistan with over 45,200 projects under way or completed. NSP is being implemented across the country by 28 local and international NGOs and by UN Habitat.</p>
	<p pid="f.253W.5/3">In addition we are providing &pound;1.5 million in core funding for the Afghanistan Evaluation and Research Unit (AREU), an independent policy research organisation which has a programme of work aimed at measuring the effectiveness of international donor assistance (including that provided by the UK).</p>

	<p pid="f.254W.2/1">Strengthened, transparent and accountable policing and justice systems are critical to protect Afghanistan's population from insecurity and criminality. The UK is working with the US and EU to reform the Afghan police and funding a bilateral mentoring programme in Helmand province. The UK provides over 50 experts for this purpose. We are working with the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) to strengthen both the formal justice sector (through the GoA's National Justice Programme) and the informal justice system. Improving people's access to justice and dispute resolution is a critical aspect of this work, through legal aid and training in legal and rights awareness. The UK's justice adviser in Helmand has for example established a Women and Children's Justice Group, helping vulnerable groups to have their rights better protected.</p>
	<p pid="f.254W.2/2">Food insecurity in Afghanistan has been particularly acute in 2008-09 due to drought and to global food price increases. Around 4.5 million people are currently vulnerable to food scarcity with women, children, and the poorest disproportionately affected. In 2008 DFID provided the World Food Programme (WFP) with &pound;11 million to respond to the food crisis. WFP deliver food on the basis of a Food Vulnerability Assessment which ranks districts in terms of food vulnerability and informs delivery priorities accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="f.254W.2/3">Additional suffering is caused by mines and explosive remnants of war: it is estimated that 728 km<sup>(2)</sup> still requires some form of clearance and over 4 million Afghans live in mine-affected areas. DFID funds the HALO trust (an expected &pound;4.6 million in 2008-09) to undertake a demining programme, in order to return hazardous areas to productive use and reduce the threat to the population.</p>
	<p pid="f.254W.2/4">DFID Afghanistan has developed a Gender Equality Action Plan to drive awareness and focus on gender issues within our development programme. The plan covers gender-disaggregated results monitoring, explicitly mapping staff and programme resources against gender objectives, and an internal skills development programme. A significant portion of our effort will be focused on building partnerships within the GoA and with other donors&mdash;particularly multilateral institutions&mdash;to increase their contribution to addressing gender inequality. DFID will lobby UNDP, the World Bank, and the Ministry of Agriculture to strengthen their approaches to gender issues.</p>

	<p pid="f.260W.2/1">As a consequence of recent turmoil in the global financial markets, less private sector investment is available than originally envisaged, meaning that the Olympic Village deal needs to be restructured and additional public sector investment will need to be made. The details of that restructured deal are being worked through between the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and Lend Lease under the terms of an exclusivity agreement and it would not be appropriate to reveal the details until that deal is concluded in the spring of next year. Under the exclusivity agreement, the ODA may not negotiate with alternative development partners.</p>

	<p pid="f.262W.2/1">The Government and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) are working hard to ensure the benefits of 2012 reach across the UK and have established a Nations and Regions Group (NRG) to oversee this work. The North East representative is Peter Rowley, Chair of the Regional Sports Board.</p>
	<p pid="f.262W.2/2">At a regional level, all London 2012 games-related activity is led by One NorthEast (the regional development agency) and Sport England North East and includes a structure involving partners from across the public, voluntary and private sectors. These arrangements provide the groundwork for delivering a strong legacy in the North East and will ensure that the region contributes to the overall UK-wide legacy ambitions of 2012. Through the effective delivery of the Legacy Action Plan, we aim to maximise the social, economic and cultural opportunities across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="f.262W.2/3">We are already seeing great progress in a lot of these areas, for example, the North East has put in place a project called Beating Type 2 Diabetes. This project is active in Middlesbrough and aims to show how increased physical activity can help prevent type 2 diabetes. It uses 2012 as a key driver for behavioural change.</p>
	<p pid="f.262W.2/4">Additionally, there are also a number of groups in the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland region who work in partnership with Sport England to promote the wider benefits of the London 2012 games. This includes Tees Valley Olympic and Paralympic Games Working Group which has identified a draft action plan of activities that it intends to carry out between now and 2012. It is organising an events-based programme which aims to use the Olympics and Paralympics to encourage involvement in sport and identify talented performers. The group is also utilising Sport England funding to match strong performers with talented coaches to enable them to fulfil their potential.</p>

	<p pid="f.263W.5/1">The Government strongly support the development and use of non-animal alternatives where possible, use of animals in scientific procedures will not be licensed if alternative non-animal techniques are available. The National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), which the Home Office part-funds, was established in May 2004 and acts as a focal point for research into the 3Rs. We have ongoing discussions with the NC3Rs.</p>
	<p pid="f.263W.5/2">The Government also continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), with a member of Home Office staff serving on the ESAC Scientific Advisory Committee, and through contributions to the European Union. It is ECVAM's task to monitor and co-ordinate research into alternatives and to develop the processes of validation&mdash;that is, the assessment of alternative methods to see whether they are reliable and whether they produce a level of information similar to the animal based tests they are to replace.</p>
	<p pid="f.263W.5/3">In addition the Home Office has established an inter-departmental group on the 3Rs to ensure other UK regulatory bodies take account of the progress with the 3Rs in their policies and practices. Home Office staff made a range of presentations on humane experimental technique at the 6th World Congress on Alternatives to Animal research in 2007. Reference is made to other relevant Home Office presentations in the 2007 Annual Report of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="f.263W.5/4">The impact of progress on the uptake of suitable reduction and replacement alternatives can be seen in a number of classes of animal use reported in the Annual Statistical report series: for example reductions in numbers of rabbits used for pyrogen testing, the numbers of guinea pigs used for skin sensitisation testing, and the number of animals used for skin irritation studies.</p>

	<p pid="f.264W.0/1">The assessment of whether the threshold of moderate pain in animal experimentation is being adhered to is mainly through the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate's inspection programme and a selection of reports and published work.</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.0/2">The severity limits of protocols are defined in Section 5.42 of the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Moderate protocols are defined as:</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Protocols regarded as moderate include toxicity tests (which do not involve lethal endpoints) and many surgical procedures (provided that suffering is controlled and minimised by effective post-operative analgesia and care).</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.0/4" class="indent">Protocols that have the potential to cause greater suffering but include controls which minimise severity, or terminate the protocol before the animal shows more than moderate adverse effects, may also be classed within the moderate severity limit&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.0/5">We have received no formal representations on this issue since January 2008. Judicial Review proceedings in July 2007 considered four issues relating to the implementation of 1986 Act one of which was on the severity limits for protocols. It was argued that in certain projects the severity limits should have been set at substantial rather than moderate. In its judgment issued on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-23">23 April 2008</phrase>, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's earlier finding that the former Chief Inspector had erred in law in assessing severity limits in the relevant project licence. On this point, the Court found that neither the former Chief Inspector nor the Secretary of State had adopted an erroneous approach to the published Guidance on the Operation of the 1986 Act regarding the assessment of severity limits.</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.0/6">Furthermore, the Court of Appeal, in upholding our appeal, agreed that the severity limit is determined by the degree of suffering experienced by the animal prior to the point at which it is humanely killed.</p>

	<p pid="f.264W.3/1">Many factors influence trends in the use of animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including the economic climate, global trends in scientific endeavour and strategic decisions by funding bodies. The increase in the use of genetically altered strains seen over recent years has also had an impact as advances in genetics open up new and promising avenues of medical research.</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.3/2">The licensing system under the 1986 Act is demand-led and we have no control over the number of project licence applications we receive. The Act limits such animal use to where there is a clear benefit to people, animals or the environment when there is no means of obtaining these benefits without animal use, or at a lesser animal welfare cost. All scientists and researchers undertaking animal research in the UK are required to take into account the '3Rs' (measures to replace, reduce, and refine animal use) when devising their programmes of research proposals.</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.3/3">In 2004 the Government established the National Centre for the 3Rs to provide a focal point and resources for such activities. The NC3Rs, which is part funded by the Home Office, drives advances in the 3Rs by taking a robust scientific approach, and bringing together expertise from a diverse range of areas, including academia, industry, Government and regulatory bodies.</p>
	<p pid="f.264W.3/4">There have been no recent formal representations about this issue.</p>

	<p pid="f.271W.8/1">The requirements of e-Borders have been presented to all carriers operating to and from the UK. No distinction is made between 'charter and leisure operators' and scheduled carriers and indeed the majority of carriers operate a mix of both scheduled and charter services.</p>
	<p pid="f.271W.8/2">In some instances, carriers have stated that they are likely to be unable to discharge their full obligations for data capture and transmission to e-Borders from the planned roll out date. Consequently e-Borders has invested in the creation of a series of transitional technical solutions (valid until the end of 2009) allowing carriers to supply data in a flexible manner that satisfy the requirements of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.271W.8/3">e-Borders is confident that by continuing to work in partnership with the industry and by offering transitional technical solutions the overall compliance rate will be very high.</p>

The recording of cannabis warnings is currently a matter for individual police forces at a local level this will remain so until the availability of PentiP.

	<p pid="f.278W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/2">The Government have placed victims and witnesses at the heart of the criminal justice system and given support services to them a high priority.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/3">Since 2004 the Government have introduced the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime which gives victims legal rights to support and information about their case. It has also supported the development of Victim Support into a strong national organisation able to help more victims more quickly. Victim Support is an independent charity and is the main provider of services to victims and witnesses across England and Wales. Over recent years funding has increased from &pound;11.7 million to &pound;30 million. Victim Support has recently introduced an improved business process, with an additional &pound;12.6 million from Government, so that victims can be contacted quickly, have their needs assessed and, if needed, be offered a wider range of practical services than was previously available.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/4">In addition the Government fund a number of other organisations offering specialist support services through the Victims Fund. &pound;8.2 million has been invested so far funding for services to victims of sexual violence, childhood sexual abuse, hate crime and homicide. The Poppy project supports adult women who have been trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation and this includes provision for temporarily accommodating victims.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/5">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR) has provided &pound;5.6 million since 2007 for Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) who provide a service to victims who are at high risk of harm. The money provides IDVAS to support victims as their cases progress through specialist domestic violence courts. The &pound;5.6 million follows &pound;2 million of Home Office funding in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/6">The recently published Youth Crime Action Plan will be improving support services to young victims of crime. The plan has been developed jointly between the OCJR, Ministry of Justice, the Department for Children Schools and Families and the Home Office. The Action Plan will deliver results on youth justice, youth crime prevention and cross cutting themes on victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/7">Support after Murder and Manslaughter (SAMM) receives an annual grant of &pound;140,000 to provide advice and support to those bereaved by homicide and presents training to police forces and other statutory agencies (e.g. the Health and Safety Executive) on bereavement awareness issues.</p>
	<p pid="f.278W.5/8">Victims and witnesses have a voice in shaping government policy and future support services through the Victims Advisory Panel and, shortly, the appointment of a commissioner for victims and witnesses will be able to promote the views of victims and witnesses at the highest levels.</p>

	<p pid="f.279W.2/1">The Government are committed to driving down youth crime and keeping the communities, including young people themselves safer.</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/2">The vast majority of young people are well behaved and it is a minority we need to focus on, who are responsible for half of all youth crime.</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/3">As well as the Tackling Knives Action Programme (TKAP), the Government have published (<phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July</phrase>) the Youth Crime Action Plan. This is a joint initiative by the Home Office, Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). The plan sets out a comprehensive cross Government plan to tackle youth crime, with a triple track approach of enforcement and punishment where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge where it is most needed, and better and earlier prevention. It will deliver an extensive and comprehensive package of measures for children, young people and families that is backed by &pound;100 million of funding to help prevent young people from getting involved in crime.</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/4">The &pound;100 million is being used for:</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/5" class="indent">extra investment in all areas of England to support families with the most entrenched and complex problems;</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/6" class="indent">an intensive programme of action for priority areas where problem of youth crime is greatest; including taking unsupervised young people off the streets at night and requiring young people to complete community service on Friday and Saturday nights; and</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/7" class="indent">guidance of recommended approaches to reducing youth crime for these areas that they can tailor to their local needs, achieving the right balance between enforcement action to tackle the problems on our streets and prevention measures to ensure future generations do not make the same mistakes.</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/8">There is already a great deal of work going on across Government to tackle youth crime and anti social behaviour. Positive Futures programme is a national sports based social inclusion programme which is funded by the Home Office in partnership with the Football Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="f.279W.2/9">The programme aims to have a positive influence on young people's lives through widening their horizons and providing access to new opportunities by using sport, art and leisure activities as a catalyst to encourage project participation and steering young people towards education, training and employment.</p>

	<p pid="f.291W.11/1">The UK Borders Act 2007 provides for biometric information collected by the Secretary of State to be retained as long as retention of that data is necessary. The specified functions, for example, include functions under the Immigration Acts or for the prevention or detection of an offence. Where an individual leaves the UK permanently, his biometric data will only be retained in circumstances where they continue to be of use for the purposes prescribed in the regulations. Retention of biometric information will therefore enable the UK Border Agency to identify those who may seek to abuse immigration control by returning to the UK in a false identity, and help to assure the identity of those who are entitled to be here.</p>
	<p pid="f.291W.11/2">The biometric information collected will be destroyed if it is no longer of use for those specified purposes. It will also be destroyed if the person proves that they are a British citizen or a Commonwealth citizen with a right of abode. The exception to this is where the information is retained in accordance with, and for the purposes of, another enactment (that is, where Parliament has already approved retention of information for a particular purpose) for example under the Identity Cards Act 2006.</p>

	<p pid="f.299W.9/1">Although no specific assessment has been carried out on its impact on police paperwork, a full independent evaluation of the pilot exercise identified a number of significant benefits of statutory charging for the criminal justice system at large, including the police service.</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/2">One of the main benefits of the scheme is the early dialogue between a police officer and a duty prosecutor. This consultation enables those cases that are evidentially weak, which can not be strengthened to meet the Code for Crown prosecutors, to be stopped there and then. Under previous arrangements these cases would have entered the court system. A costly and often ineffective exchange of correspondence between the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police would follow in an attempt to obtain evidence to support the individual case. A high percentage of these cases were then discontinued later in the process, often after several court appearances and after the police had expended additional and unnecessary effort in trying to obtain evidence.</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/3">A further benefit has been the improved relationships between police and CPS from close partnership working that has enabled them to better manage other linked initiatives including the Criminal Justice Simple, Speedy Summary (CJSSS) and the Streamlined Process that have improved case management and reduced delay in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/4">There are several other benefits to the police. Dialogue with a Duty Prosecutor enables borderline and more complex cases to be strengthened, and police officers can be directed at that point to supply only what is really required in terms of the evidence needed to support the case. The original business case for statutory charging also points</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/5">to further benefits for the police through the potential to enhance the police skills base in dealing with evidential issues as a result of early dialogue with the CPS. The business case predicted that around 238,000 cases per annum would be charged by the CPS and a further 20,000 would be stopped at the point of charge. The benefits to the police in the original business case for statutory charging were estimated to be &pound;6.5 million based on this prediction of caseload.</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/6">In practice the benefits to the police are far greater than this. With 550,000 cases now being considered by the CPS each year, the number of cases that are stopped at the point of charge which fail to meet the code test was 160,000 during 2007-08 which provides substantially more benefit to the police than was originally estimated in the business case.</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/7">The Government take all aspects of police bureaucracy very seriously and we continue to keep the implications of the charging process, in respect of the amount of paperwork involved, under close review.</p>
	<p pid="f.299W.9/8">I have now appointed Jan Berry as our national independent advocate for achieving reductions in police bureaucracy. I have asked her to identify and examine a number of key policing processes and to make recommendations on how these could be reformed to reduce the amount of paperwork generated for officers. The impact of statutory charging on police paperwork is within the scope of Jan Berry's work.</p>

It should be noted that the award criterion varies for all these medals, with some not including a good conduct element and others requiring that a considerable period of front-line duty is served, in order to qualify. Military long service medals relate to different service criterion and work patterns to civilian medals and therefore any comparisons to civilian equivalents would be inappropriate.</p>

	<p pid="f.307W.3/1">The Home Office will not directly assess forces on whether they are meeting the policing pledge. The pledge is a commitment from the police to the public and sets out clear minimum standards and public entitlement to services. All 43 chief constables have committed to deliver the pledge by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="f.307W.3/2">If the public do not feel these standards are being met they can raise it locally with the police themselves or through their police authority.</p>
	<p pid="f.307W.3/3">The Policing Green Paper explained the new relationship between the Government, police and public. The Home Office has now adopted a more strategic role allowing for grassroots accountability and an enhanced role for HMIC in providing public assurance about the quality and standard of policing in all forces. HMIC will therefore validate the delivery of the pledge by forces through their inspection process. Police authorities will also wish to be satisfied that the pledge is being delivered for local people.</p>

	<p pid="f.307W.6/1">My strategic policing priorities (SPPs) provide a national strategic context within which police authorities set their local policing plans. The SPPs for 2009-10 emphasise the strategic context for local planning and accountability, as set out in the Policing Green Paper, so that forces tackle the issues that matter most locally in that national context and get best value for money for the public from the resources devoted to policing.</p>
	<p pid="f.307W.6/2">The aim is to move to a system in which the police service is held to account much more at a local level. Police authorities are already required to issue a strategic plan which identifies the force's priorities and objectives over a three year rolling cycle and which must take into account my strategic policing priorities. Local accountability will be enhanced through the introduction of the policing pledge, to be underpinned by a set of local priorities, the publication of local information on crime and police activity and through raising the capacity and influence of police authorities to hold forces to account. A strengthened HMIC will act as guarantor of the public interest in inspecting forces and authorities.</p>

	<p pid="f.308W.2/1">Policing performance is measured through the Assessments of Policing And Community Safety (APACS) framework, which contains key performance indicators for the police working alone or in partnership. However, as set out in the Policing Green Paper: 'From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our Communities Together', the Home Office will in future no longer produce graded assessments against those indicators, which have been interpreted by some as de facto targets. Instead, HMIC will take the lead in making and publishing assessments of forces' overall performance, drawing on APACS performance indicators and other information.</p>

In addition, detection rates data are subject to wide variation where small numbers are involved.</p>
	<p pid="f.314W.0/2">Non-sanction detections that contribute to detection rates have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken.

	<p pid="f.316W.2/1">There has been a significant and sustained reduction in vehicle crime. Since 1997 all vehicle crime is down by 57 per cent. The police recorded a 5 per cent. decrease in the number of cars stolen between 2006-07 and 2007-08. This decrease is also reflected in the British Crime Survey for 2007-08 which shows a reduction of 11 per cent. for vehicle-related thefts compared with 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="f.316W.2/2">Maintaining this reduction is important, but our strategy reflects the success to date and the maturity of practice in this area. The Crime Strategy outlines our approach that Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, Community Safety Partnerships and other local partners should focus on the issues of greatest priority in each locality through local area agreements. As part of the local area agreement process 98 of the 150 local areas have chosen serious acquisitive crime, of which vehicle crime is an important component, as one of their key priorities for improvement. Central Government are also held to account through Public Service Agreement 23 which measures the progress in tackling serious acquisitive crime.</p>

	<p pid="f.316W.5/1">In 2007, the Home Office set up the National Retail Crime Steering Group, to provide a forum for retailers to raise issues of concern with Government and devise strategies for tackling retail crime. Current issues the group is addressing include ensuring Penalty Notices for Disorder are issued appropriately and consistently, developing and disseminating good practice guidance for local retailers and crime reduction partnerships to work more effectively together, and designing a new Commercial Victimisation Survey. The introduction of neighbourhood policing teams will also ensure that retailers concerns are reflected in local policing priorities. This will be backed up by guidance from the National Police Improvement Agency, and the reforms set out in the Policing Green Paper 'From the neighbourhood to the national: policing our communities together' to give local people, including businesses, a greater say in how their neighbourhoods are policed.</p>

	<p pid="f.318W.0/2">The Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency has regularly written to the Home Affairs Select Committee with all of the most robust and accurate information on the deportation of foreign criminals, including updates on the numbers of such individuals who are subject to deportation action and are detained following completion of their custodial sentence in order to facilitate their eventual deportation. In her letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-23">23 July</phrase> she advised the Committee that there were around 1,650 such individuals who were detained beyond their sentence under immigration powers. Copies of all of these letters are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="f.325W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-08">8 October 2008</phrase> the Government announced a comprehensive package of measures to support stability of the financial system, protect ordinary savers, depositors, businesses and borrowers, and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="f.325W.9/2">As part of its investment, the Government have agreed a range of commitments with banks accessing the recapitalisation scheme. The Government expect banks to restore and maintain the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to SMEs, at a level at least equivalent to that of 2007, until the end of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="f.325W.9/3">UK Financial Investments Limited (UKFI), which is wholly owned by the Government, will also oversee the conditions attached to subscribing to the Government's recapitalisation fund, including in relation to SME lending.</p>
	<p pid="f.325W.9/4">British small businesses should also be able to benefit from around &pound;4 billion of lending from the European Investment Bank (EIB) between 2008 and 2011. As announced in the pre-Budget report in November 2008, after negotiations between UK banks and the EIB, &pound;1 billion of EIB funds were approved by the end of last year to be available to British small firms. The Government continue to work with UK banks and the EIB on the use of EIB loans to deliver the most effective support to small firms with sound business propositions. It is a condition for banks participating in the Government's recapitalisation scheme to seek EIB Loans for SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="f.325W.9/5">Furthermore the Government announced a package of support to help smaller businesses at the Pre-budget report 2008. This package included the establishment of the Small Business Finance Scheme, an Export Credits Guarantee Department scheme, and the equity or quasi-equity capital fund. When combined this package will facilitate over &pound;2 billion of extra support to SME's experiencing short-term financial difficulties.</p>

	<p pid="f.336W.0/1">As with the whole tax system, the Government keep the effect of falling house prices on the ability of families to meet inheritance tax liabilities under review.</p>
	<p pid="f.336W.0/2">The Government therefore have two measures in place to address this eventuality of falling house prices affecting the ability to meet inheritance tax liabilities:</p>
	<p pid="f.336W.0/3" class="indent">While a house remains unsold, the inheritance tax due on it can be paid in instalments for up to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="f.336W.0/4" class="indent">Where a house is sold within four years of the death for less than the value on which inheritance tax was paid, the personal representatives can in most cases make a claim for inheritance tax 'loss on sale' relief. The loss on sale relief does not apply if the sale is to a beneficiary or relative of a beneficiary. This is because of the risk of avoidance.</p>

In January 2007, the DTI published the NMW penalty notice policy. In line with this, since February 2007, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has been issuing penalty notices, for those employers who fail to comply with an enforcement notice within 28 days. The Employment Act 2008 will introduce changes, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>, to the NMW enforcement regime, which will see the issue, by HMRC, of financial penalties in most cases of minimum wage non-compliance.</p>

The recent pre-Budget report announced measures which build on the support Jobcentre Plus already has in place. The package included the expansion of Jobcentre Plus' rapid response service to target both small and large-scale redundancies, the extension of Train to Gain to provide new training to people before they are made redundant, and the launch of a National Employment Partnership.</p>

	<p pid="f.348W.14/1">The Government have called on businesses to pass on the VAT rate reduction through lower prices to help stimulate consumer spending and ensure both businesses and consumers can benefit from the change. Many businesses have done so, and in the UK's highly competitive retail sector, consumers can choose whether or not to buy from businesses that do not pass the reduction on. But decisions on prices are for businesses rather than Government.</p>

	<p pid="f.354W.2/1">The UK has for some time been pressing for the adoption of the EU Code of Conduct as a Common Position; we welcome its adoption in December 2008, which changes the code's status from politically to legally binding on all member states. Export licence applications are currently subject to assessment by the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, adopted in 2000 and announced in this House on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-26">26 October 2000</phrase>. This brought together in one place principles underpinning both UK legislation and the EU Code of Conduct, to ensure a consistent approach to export licensing. This became part of statutory guidance. As export licence applications are made under the Export Control Act 2002, this remains the same with the Common Position. We will not therefore require any significant change to UK legislation to implement the Common Position, and will be in a position to implement it without delay.</p>

The report is principally concerned with the future of the EU Special Representative's office in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and is a good start to an important discussion. The UK remains deeply concerned about the political situation in BiH, and will engage closely with EU partners on the issues raised in the report. We believe the EU needs to increase further its engagement in BiH.</p>

	<p pid="f.356W.6/1">The military regime in Burma is determined to maintain its hold on power regardless of the cost and suffering of its people. The junta's 'Roadmap to disciplined democracy', including a new constitution and elections planned for 2010, is designed to entrench military rule behind a facade of civilian government. The process excludes the opposition and meaningful participation by the ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="f.356W.6/2">Fundamental rights are consistently ignored.</p>
	<p pid="f.356W.6/3">Since early November, over 200 pro-democracy activists have been given sentences of up to 65 years in prison. These severe sentences are clearly designed to silence all dissent ahead of the 2010 elections. There are now over 2,200 political prisoners in detention, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and other pro-democracy leaders. Ethnic minority groups have been methodically marginalised. Against this backdrop, we will continue to do all we can to generate international pressure for a peaceful transition to democracy and respect for human rights in Burma. In particular, we will continue to give our full support to the UN Secretary General and his efforts to break the current deadlock.</p>

	<p pid="f.366W.11/1">The European Union is providing &euro;259 million of aid to the Turkish Cypriot community, to help bring them closer to Europe and so facilitate a settlement. As of October 2008, the projects contracted reaches a cumulative total of &euro;60.8 million since inception, the total amount tendered reaches &euro;119.5 million and the total paid &euro;25.5 million. While implementation of the regulation has been slower than originally anticipated, the benefits are already being felt. The European Commission is responsible for administering the assistance. A programme team of Commission officials and contract agents was set up in 2006 to implement the programme as part of the Task Force Turkish Cypriot Community within DG Enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="f.366W.11/2">Ongoing projects include a successful programme of scholarships for Turkish Cypriot students and teachers to study and teach in EU universities, grant schemes for civil society and targeted support to farmers to upgrade their equipment.

We agree with their conclusion that the current settlement negotiations</p>

However, the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) provide all information at their disposal on the movement of people to the Republic of Cyprus. There is practical co-operation between SBA and Republic of Cyprus officials on a daily basis, and regular meetings between the SBAs, the Republic of Cyprus and the European Commission where information on movement of persons and goods is exchanged.</p>

	<p pid="f.370W.2/1">Cyprus is going through its worst water shortage for many years owing to prolonged dry seasons and lower than average rainfall year-on-year. The government of the Republic of Cyprus has looked to counteract this in several ways, including for the short term, imposing restrictions on water usage to conserve the reservoir levels and importing water from Greece. In the longer term, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus is looking at the potential of building more desalination plants to convert sea water into drinking water.</p>
	<p pid="f.370W.2/2">It is too early to comment on the potential effectiveness of these policies. The level of drought experienced is unprecedented and can only be remedied in the short term with rainfall.</p>

	<p pid="f.376W.3/1">In November 2008, the BBC Russian Service broadcast about 45 hours of live news and current affairs programming on its radio service, per week on average, as well as about 34 hours per week of features and other pre-recorded programming, of which about three hours were original production and the remaining hours repeats. Some of this programming would have incorporated themes from the news and current affairs output.</p>
	<p pid="f.376W.3/2">Comparable figures for 1988 and 1998 could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, since 2004, the BBC Russian Service has focused increasingly on strengthening its news and current affairs programming, particularly at key audience listening times, in line with BBC World Service objectives and in order to increase impact with audiences in Russia and the former Soviet Union.</p>

	<p pid="f.376W.6/1">All audience and market research used by BBC World Service is carried out independently. Such research shows that audiences turn to BBC World Service primarily for news.</p>
	<p pid="f.376W.6/2">The most recent audience survey carried out in Russia for the BBC found that of all BBC output, news attracts the largest audiences, and that the weekly BBC audiences are especially heavy news consumers. Independently-produced internet audience figures show that the number of users of the BBC Russian Service's website increased by over a million in August 2008, at the height of the conflict between Russia and Georgia, to 2.4 million.</p>

	<p pid="f.386W.5/1">The Local Transport Act 2008 (&quot;the 2008 Act&quot;) contains provisions to enhance the powers of local transport authorities in England and Wales to secure improvements to local bus services in their areas. Options for these authorities include through voluntary partnership agreements, quality partnership schemes and quality contracts (bus franchising) schemes.</p>
	<p pid="f.386W.5/2">Voluntary partnership agreements and quality partnership schemes offer the potential for local authorities to secure improvements to the standard of local bus services, alongside local authority investment in new or improved facilities for bus services and passengers. Quality contracts may provide for the payment of subsidy for the operation of local services under those contracts, and the 2008 Act includes provisions to make quality contracts schemes a more realistic option for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="f.386W.5/3">Local transport authorities already have the power to enter into subsidised service agreements with bus operators, by virtue of section 9A of the Transport Act 1968 (for Passenger Transport Authorities) and section 63 of the Transport Act 1985 (for other local transport authorities). The 2008 Act amends these powers to allow subsidy agreements to be entered into, not only where services would not be provided at all in the absence of subsidy (as at present), but also where they would not be provided to a particular standard. Provisions in the 2008 Act also increase the maximum permitted duration for subsidised service agreements from five to eight years.</p>
	<p pid="f.386W.5/4">Except where specific provision is made in section 134 of the 2008 Act, the provisions of that Act are to be brought into force by commencement order made by the Secretary of State (or in some cases by the Welsh Ministers, in so far as provisions apply in Wales). The first commencement order is expected to be made early in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="f.397W.5/1">The July 2007 Rail White Paper, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;, set out the Government's strategy to improve the quality of inter-urban rail services, and to make the best use of existing networks by lengthening existing trains, increasing service frequencies and tackling key congestion pinch points.</p>
	<p pid="f.397W.5/2">The White Paper proposals are measured against the key tests of capacity, quality of service, value for money and environment. Increasing capacity is key, particularly in those services experiencing crowding.</p>

For example, it would be unable to accommodate other rail services, While Maglev currently operates on a relatively short point-to-point basis, scaling the technology up to a national network is unproven.</p>

	<p pid="f.407W.11/1">We are investing significantly across the North East to improve transport and alleviate congestion. Total expenditure on transport in the North East has increased by 30 per cent. in the five years to 2007-08&mdash;from &pound;481 million in 2002-03 to &pound;623 million in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="f.407W.11/2">On the roads, local authorities take decisions on local measures and investment needed to alleviate congestion on their roads. In addition to this, North East schemes in the current regional funding allocation being progressed by the Highways Agency include the A69 Haydon bridge bypass, which is in construction and improvements to four A19 junctions through Tyneside. The Highways Agency is also looking at options for addressing congestion problems on the A1 Newcastle Gateshead and Western bypass, but any scheme is likely to be complex and take time to deliver, and must be developed in parallel with the Tyne and Wear authorities' proposals for addressing local traffic problems. In addition we expect, subject to satisfactory business cases, to invest over &pound;70 million over the next five years in major bus priority infrastructure schemes in Tyne and Wear, Tees Valley and Durham. These are aimed at attracting more people to public transport by improving the journey time and reliability of buses.</p>
	<p pid="f.407W.11/3">On rail, the Rail White Paper committed to introducing additional rail capacity to meet peak demand in the Northern cities, including Newcastle. The DfT Rolling Stock Plan published in January 2008 showed that around 42 additional carriages would be available for TransPennine Express and around 182 additional carriages for the Northern franchise. Both these franchises serve the North East. We will also be investing over &pound;290 million on the renewal of the Tyne and Wear Metro system between 2010 and 2019.</p>

This upgrade of the infrastructure has allowed the new timetable, which started on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December 2008</phrase>, to increase capacity on many of the West Coast Main Line services, most notably a 50 per cent. increase of services between London and Birmingham/Manchester and a 70 per cent. increase for these services on the weekends.</p>
	<p pid="f.408W.2/2">There are no legislative provisions regarding crowding on trains. The Office of the Rail Regulator states that there is no legal limit on the number of passengers that can travel in any given train coach. In this, trains differ from other modes of transport&mdash;most notably buses and aeroplanes. The heavy engineering involved means that trains are designed to operate effectively and safely even when they are fully loaded to maximum capacity. The number of passengers on board does not affect a train's operating performance or structural integrity.</p>

As part of the Cross Government 10-point plan for gender, ethnicity and disability, all departments were set targets at Senior Civil Service level. As a Department we also track data across all other grades to check progress. At SCS level we met all of our targets for 2008. For the tracking grades, we made good progress on gender and ethnicity but fell short of our targets for disability. As part of the new Cross Government Strategy, Promoting Equality, Valuing Diversity we have again set challenging targets for the next three years which we will review regularly.</p>

	<p pid="f.444W.12/1">The loans will be available to SMEs within the European Union definition; eligible companies will be able to apply for new loans for a period of up to six months from the inception of the fund. The repayment period will be three years or as agreed with the company within this time frame. In order to qualify applicants must be able to demonstrate that the absence of such funding is exposing the business to the risk of significant short-term contraction or endangering its existence. Loans from the fund will normally only be made where the existing financiers (including bankers) are, at the time of application to the fund, willing to maintain some borrowing facilities on agreed terms. Applicants, through their business plans, should be able to demonstrate a positive impact on jobs, either through job creation or job retention. The fund will be run on a fully commercial basis and will provide individual loans of up to &pound;250,000. Loans from the fund cannot be used to pay down existing borrowings and business assets could be taken as security at the fund manager's discretion although this would not generally extend to personal guarantees or charges over individuals' private residences. If security is not taken, this fact will be reflected in assessing the &quot;commercial&quot; rate of interest to be applied.</p>

A number of studies have been carried out to examine the impacts of the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme on the competitiveness of those sectors covered by the scheme. To date the two most significant pieces of UK research are those which were carried out by Climate Strategies and Oxford Economics, both of which were published in 2007 and were funded by DEFRA and/or BERR. Each report considered the effects of the EU ETS on a number of key sectors, including cement.</p>

The results suggested that, if industry were required to purchase all of their allowances, at a carbon price of &euro;25/tCO2 and assuming no equivalent action by non-EU countries, then less than 0.1 per cent. of domestic production in the non-metallic minerals sector (which contains cement) would be lost to countries outside of the EU.</p>

	<p pid="f.448W.8/1">The purpose of Constructionline is specifically to reduce duplication of effort by allowing tenderers to answer the key prequalification questions once. After that, tendering organisations only need to ask the project-specific questions of tenderers. This significantly lowers the financial and administrative burdens on SMEs, which make up the vast majority of the construction industry. Constructionline's questions are drawn from HSE's requirements for contractors in respect of health and safety. Constructionline works closely with other industry organisations and Government on health and safety matters, and will be a member of the 'Safety Schemes in Procurement Competence Forum (SSIP)' when it is formally launched in April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="f.452W.0/1">HMG assessed a number of options for bringing forward capital spending as part of a fiscal stimulus. The &pound;3 billion package announced in the 2008 pre-Budget report was based on the principles that it should be timely (focused on those projects that could be brought forward in the time available), targeted (focused on capital spending that would support the UK economy) and temporary (bringing forward spending&mdash;protecting the fiscal position in the medium term).</p>
	<p pid="f.452W.0/2">Capital spending was brought forward in a range of areas, including investing in energy efficiency measures and increasing capacity in the motorway network. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has no substantial capital spending programmes following the transfer of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency (NDA) to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). BERR is therefore not forming part of the Capital Expenditure Acceleration Programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.452W.0/3">BERR is already taking steps to assist business through the economic downturn through new schemes on small business finance, including a capital fund of &pound;50 million announced in the pre-Budget report and funded from the existing Mezzanine Fund, Enterprise Capital Funds and a &pound;10 million regional development agencies (RDA) contribution. This fund will provide capital support to overleveraged small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is in addition to the capital expenditure schemes that the Department currently funds.</p>

	<p pid="f.455W.2/2">We have wide-ranging contact at all levels with the automotive industry and its representatives (including the SMMT). My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and I met with automotive manufacturers, suppliers and retailers on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-27">27 November</phrase> and we continue to have close dialogue. Ford confirmed in November that it will manufacture its new Eco Boost engine family, which is 20 per cent. more fuel efficient and emits 15 per cent. less carbon dioxide, for global use at its Bridgend factory. Ford's investment was secured with &pound;13.4 million in support from taxpayers via the Welsh Assembly Government. This will increase jobs at the Bridgend factory, the third largest employer in Wales, to more than 2,000. It is intended the current Transit model will be produced at Southampton until 2011. We strongly welcome Ford's commitment to seeing production of the chassis cab variant of the next model Transit at their Southampton site in the future.</p>

UKTI's trade officers may spend around an hour of their time exploring a company's needs and explaining what can be done for them. They may also provide a limited amount of 'off-the-shelf' information.

Postcomm, the industry regulator, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities, carried out a consultation on the management of and access to the Postal Address File (PAF) in 2006 and published a decision document in April 2007 which laid down new safeguards for the future management of the PAF. The consultation asked all PAF users for comments on a series of proposals designed to make sure that the database is managed and made available to other organisations wishing to use it on fair and reasonable terms. Following the consultation, Postcomm held discussions with Royal Mail, which agreed to implement all the recommendations outlined in the report. These included the setting up of an independent PAF Advisory Board to give independent advice to the Address Management Unit of Royal Mail on behalf of PAF users.

Although complete figures are not yet available, Government Departments and public bodies have embraced payment within 10 days and are working to implement this across their own organisation and to encourage suppliers to pass on these terms.</p>

	<p pid="f.470W.3/1">Effective public fundraising is important for the charity sector. Professional fundraisers are required to make a statement indicating that they are paid, when fundraising from members of the public. The Charities Act 2006 has strengthened this requirement, and professional fundraisers must now also state the amount of remuneration they receive in connection with an appeal. It also provides for a new licensing regime for public charitable collections and the Office of the Third Sector has announced plans to undertake independent research into the costs and benefits of implementing this regime.</p>

	<p pid="f.487W.2/4" class="indent">The available information requested is provided in the attached table. Comparable estimates prior to 1995 are not available.</p>
	<p pid="f.487W.2/5" class="indent">The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). These estimates are based on the respondents' views about the organisation for which they work. They do not correspond to official Public Sector Employment estimates, which come directly from employers and are based on National Accounts definitions.</p>

	<p pid="f.487W.2/7" class="indent">The figures have been derived from the LFS microdata which are weighted using the official population estimates published in autumn 2007. Consequently the estimates from Q3 2006 onwards are not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release, or the migrant worker figures published every quarter, which are weighted using more up-to-date population estimates.</p>

	<p pid="f.503W.8/1">It is the responsibility of probation areas to ensure the safety of offenders who are undertaking unpaid work, the staff responsible for supervising their work and members of the public. All offenders are subject to risk assessment before being placed. The operation of unpaid work must be responsive to local concerns and probation areas are best placed to identify these concerns. For example London and West Midlands Probation Areas operate unpaid work in areas in which gangs operate. Both areas have established arrangements with the police and other agencies to determine if offenders known to be involved in gangs are likely to be at risk if required to work in certain localities. If concerns are identified, the offender would undertake work at an alternate location.</p>

	<p pid="f.509W.8/1">The Political Parties and Elections Bill currently provides for two specific, constrained, powers of entry. The provisions were discussed with the Electoral Commission during their development.</p>
	<p pid="f.509W.8/2">The first is a restatement of the existing power under section 146(3) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which allows the Commission to enter premises and take copies of information relating to income and expenditure from a registered political party, a recognised third party and a permitted participant in a referendum. This power can be exercised by the Commission for the purposes of carrying out its functions but does not authorise the use of force to enter premises. However, it is a criminal offence to intentionally obstruct the Commission from entering premises.</p>
	<p pid="f.509W.8/3">This power is replicated in clause 1(5) of schedule 19A (to be inserted into the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 by schedule 1 to the Bill). It is, however, extended in its scope to encompass candidates (other than candidates in Scottish local government elections), election agents, regulated donees (including MPs) and regulated participants.</p>
	<p pid="f.509W.8/4">In addition, the Political Parties and Elections Bill seeks to provide new powers for use by the Commission when it undertakes an investigation in circumstances where it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a breach of PPERA has taken place: specifically, the Bill provides the Commission with new powers to request information, to put questions and to apply for a warrant to enable it to enter premises when carrying out an investigation into a suspected offence or other contravention of the 2000 Act; each of these new powers is subject to a series of safeguards. These powers and the associated safeguards are set out in schedule 1 of the Bill, which proposes to insert a new schedule 19A into the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="f.509W.8/5">In relation to the new power to enter premises, under paragraph 3 of schedule 19A the Commission will need to apply for a warrant: there is no automatic right of entry. For a warrant to be issued, the Commission must demonstrate on oath to a justice of the peace that it has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed (or other contravention of PPERA has occurred). The Commission must also satisfy a justice of the peace that documents are on any premises that were withheld following an earlier request made under paragraph 2(2) of the schedule or that are otherwise relevant to the investigation. When entering the premises that a warrant authorises entry into, any Commission staff must be accompanied at all times by a constable.</p>
	<p pid="f.509W.8/6">A warrant issued under paragraph 3 is capable of applying to any person or organisation that the tests in the paragraph above are met. On that basis it is capable of applying to trade unions and their members in the same way that it may apply to any other person or organisation.</p>

In addition the justice of the peace must also be satisfied that there are on the premises for which the warrant was sought documents that that have previously been required to be produced or which are otherwise relevant to the Commission's investigation. Further detail about the proposed power of entry and search by warrant is set out in paragraph 3 of schedule 1.

	<p pid="f.514W.5/1">Levels of abscond have fallen over the last decade and are still declining. They are now 54 per cent. lower than in 1996-07. Prisoners undergo a risk assessment process before been considered for open conditions and those considered to be at risk of absconding are not allocated to the open estate. Open prisons take a variety of actions to reduce absconding including effective screening of prisoners when they arrive at the prison coupled with intelligence work within the prison to identify potential absconders and send them back to closed conditions. Work is also being undertaken with the police and CPS to ensure that wherever possible absconders are prosecuted as a deterrent to others. Despite excellent progress in this area we are far from complacent and in the coming year the National Offender Management Service will be building on these achievements to ensure that the downward trend in absconds continues and that best practice is spread across all areas of the country.</p>

	<p pid="f.516W.3/1">Clause 11 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill would reintroduce the long-standing principle that spending used by candidates for the purposes of their election campaign (often referred to as &quot;triggering&quot;) which existed prior to the passage of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (&quot;the 2000 Act&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/2">The legislation defining candidate spending has been updated since the previous system of triggering was in place and clause 11 does not propose a return to the precise wording that existed prior to 2000. Section 76 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (&quot;the 1983 Act&quot;) described candidate expenses as those &quot;on account of or in respect of the conduct or management of the election&quot;. This wording was removed from section 76 of the 1983 Act by section 132 of the 2000 Act. Section 27 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 (&quot;the 2006 Act&quot;) inserted new section 90ZA into the 1983 Act, which clarifies that &quot;election expenses&quot; in relation to a candidate at an election means any expenses incurred at any time in respect of any matter specified in Part 1 of Schedule 4A of the 1983 Act (also inserted by section 27 of the 2006 Act) which is used for the purposes of the candidate's election after the date when he becomes a candidate at the election. A person is defined as a 'candidate' according to section 118A of the 1983 Act.</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/3">Clause 11 of the Bill would .not restore the previous wording of the 1983 Act. Rather it amends section 90ZA such that the definition of election expenses is capable of including those expenses incurred and used by a person before that person formally becomes a 'candidate' by virtue of section 118 A.</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/4">, which quoted from the Neill Report. The then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, noted that there was no simple and decisive test to determine whether an expense was or was not to be regarded as en election expense within the meaning of the Act at the time.</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/5">In the case of which items should count towards election expenses, Neill specifically criticised Schedule 3 of the 1983 Act. That Schedule provided a form of return for candidates to complete their declaration as to election expenses. As Neill noted, however, the form largely reproduced the equivalent Schedule in the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act of 1883 and was therefore considerably out of date. Neill recommended that the Schedule should be revised such that it contained a full and up to date list of items of expenditure (recommendation 46). The 2000 Act accordingly repealed Schedule 3 of the 1983 Act. The 2006 Act inserted new Schedule 4A into the 1983 Act. This Schedule lists in detail the matters which are, and are not, to be regarded as election expenses, providing far greater clarity for candidates than under the previous system of triggering that existed before 2000.</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/6">In the case of determining when a constituency campaign is deemed to have begun, Neill noted the considerable doubt on this point for candidates and political parties, as the 1983 Act made no attempt to define the period of the election or the election campaign. However, Neill concluded &quot;despite the difficulties, it is possible for parties, nationally as well as locally, to distinguish in most situations between election and non-election spending&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/7">Neill therefore recommended that the precedent established by the 1983 Act should continue to be followed, and that expenditure limits should continue to be set in terms of the purpose for which expenditure is incurred rather than in terms of any specified time period (recommendation 51). It is this principle, specifically endorsed by the Neill Report, which clause 11 of the Bill seeks to restore with regard to the candidate spending limit.</p>
	<p pid="f.516W.3/8">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor (Jack Straw) said during the first evidence session of the Public Bill Committee, the trigger arrangements are not &quot;perfect, but they did act as a dampener&quot;. The Government believe that the changes made to the legislation since the passage of the 2000 Act are significant steps in addressing the points made in the Neill Report and the Fiona Jones judgement relating to determining the purpose of expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="f.518W.2/1">Clause 12 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill amends an existing power granted to the Electoral Commission to issue a code of practice giving guidance on the list of regulated matters for candidate spending (set out in part 1 of schedule 4A of the Representation of the People Act 1983, as inserted by the Electoral Administration Act 2006).

That would be the case where the Communications Allowance is used to fund expenditure on a matter listed in schedule 4A for the purposes of promoting his or her election as a candidate at a general election.

NOMS is now assisting offenders in gaining formal identification as part of normal resettlement processes and works closely with visiting Jobcentre Plus officials to ensure timely and accurate applications are made wherever possible. NOMS has also embarked on a number of other initiatives to assist in this process such as; exploring the benefits of arranging bank accounts, providing money management advice, financial capability training and assistance with setting up a Freshstart interview with Jobcentre Plus on release.</p>

	<p pid="f.522W.11/1">Information relating to the numbers of foreign national prisoners subject to deportation action who have completed their custodial sentence and been released on bail is not centrally collated at present. Similarly, reoffending data does not specifically identify the number of foreign national prisoners who reoffend. In order to provide the information requested it would be necessary to examine individual case files at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="f.522W.11/2">When a foreign criminal who is subject to deportation action is granted bail by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal and it is believed that the individual presents a risk of harm to the public, the UK Border Agency will always request that the most robust restrictions are imposed upon the individual in order to minimise the likelihood that they will reoffend. The agency will continue to pursue deportation action against such individuals and is on track to not only meet but exceed its target of deportation or removing 5,000 foreign criminals in 2008. Good progress has also been made overall in reducing reoffending; the latest figures show that between 2000 and 2006 the number of reoffences committed by offenders released from custody has fallen 15.1 per cent.</p>
