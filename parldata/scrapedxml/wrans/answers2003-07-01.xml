	<p pid=".183W.3/1">During Phase I of the Action Teams for Jobs initiative, Action teams were allowed to focus on pockets of deprivation, often at housing estate level, rather than ward level. This meant that some Local Authority wards with high overall employment rates were still able to receive Action Team help for areas within the ward with lower employment rates.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.3/2">In Phase II, a new selection method was developed to decide where Action Teams were located which focused on identifying and tackling low employment rates at ward level. The method used to identify ward employment rates used information from a number of sources such as Office of National Statistics 1998 database information on working age population; benefit administrative data; and data from the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly. Ward jobless estimates were thus indicative rather than authoritative, but the primary aim was to provide Action Team help to wards with employment rates of 58.5 per cent or below.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.3/3">However, a number of wards with higher employment rates were included in Action Teams. In some cases this was to prevent the need to withdraw Action Team services from areas with pockets of extreme deprivation but with a high level of employment at ward level. Some wards with employment rates above the threshold were also included to ensure greater viability for those Action Teams with the attendant benefit for the clients they were serving.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.3/4">The available information on the indicative employment rates of all wards in each Action Team area, and identification of wards covered by Action Team activity has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".184W.2/1">We have introduced a wide range of initiatives to help lone parents gain independence by moving into work.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.2/2">The New Deal for Lone Parents is delivering services tailored to meet the needs of individual lone parents and giving them the skills, support and confidence they need to move into work. By the end of March 2003, it had helped over 193,000 lone parents to find jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.2/3">The combination of the child care component of our new Tax Credits and the extra places created through our National Childcare Strategy are making child care affordable and accessible for parents moving into work. Since April, Childcare Partnership Managers have been introduced into every Jobcentre Plus District to work with personal advisers and Local Authorities to ensure that jobseekers with children have access to information on child care provision in their area. Lone Parents can also benefit from payments of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit at pre-work levels for four weeks after starting work to help them through what can be a difficult transitional period.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.2/4">We announced a number of measures in Budget 2003 to help lone parents overcome barriers to work. Discovery Week pilots will increase the familiarity of lone parents with the help and support available to them. From 2004 we will also introduce a new mentoring service across the country that is tailored specifically for lone parents. This will be delivered alongside child care taster pilots which allow lone parents to test whether formal child care suits their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.2/5">From April 2004, in 12 areas we will pilot a payment of &pound;4 per week for 12 months on top of tax and benefits when the lone parent starts a job of more than 16 hours a week. This will be complemented, in eight pilot areas, by a weekly work search premium payment of &pound;20 on top of benefits for lone parents who have been on income support for more than 12 months and are actively seeking work.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.2/6">We have introduced compulsory Work Focused Interviews for lone parents claiming Income Support to ensure that they are aware of the wide range of help they can access to move into work. Through our programmes we are giving lone parents more choices and more help than ever before to move off welfare and into work and this has helped reduce the number of lone parents dependent on Income Support by over 175,000 since May 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.2/1">I represented the UK at Environment council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-13">13 June 2003</phrase>. The council reached a provisional political agreement on one important legislative measure and agreed a general approach on another. The council also considered a number of other issues.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/2">The council reached agreement on a framework for a common position on the Environmental Liability directive. This measure will require polluters to bear the cost of remedying environmental damage, in line with the 'polluter pays' principle. Following intensive negotiation, the agreement reflects key UK concerns. First, there will be no obligation for compulsory financial security (to be reviewed within five years of implementation). Second, Member States will retain discretion to decide whether or not to remedy damage in the absence of the polluter. Third, Member States may choose to allow exception from liability on the basis that operations comply with a permit or were not judged harmful by the best scientific knowledge at the time. Some of the technical detail of the proposal remains subject to further discussions before an agreement is finalised. The text did however include a review of the coverage of damage falling within the scope of international conventions and of GMO damage. It should be noted that the Directive is intended to cover damage caused by the deliberate release or contained use of GMOs.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/3">Austria and Ireland opposed the agreement because it did not cover nuclear damage, and Germany was also opposed because of disagreement with major features, notably the permit and state of the art exceptions.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/4">The council also agreed a general approach on gaseous and particulate emissions from non-road mobile machinery. This included an exemption for lifeboat launchers from the scope of the Directive, an issue pressed by the UK in negotiations. I indicated that my intention at this stage was to abstain, pending European Parliamentary consideration, and that I had concerns about the second phase of the proposals. Germany was unable to support the general approach.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/5">Council debated a decision for establishing a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions. I, together with Ministers from a number of other Member States, emphasised the need to clarify Member State and Community responsibilities in implementing certain obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, particularly with respect to establishing the assigned amount, and in exercising certain rights, including participation in the flexible mechanisms. There was general agreement to aim for political agreement in October.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/6">We also discussed a presentation from the Commission about progress towards its new system for registering and approving Chemicals. Draft proposals are currently subject to an internet consultation by the Commission. Several Ministers emphasised the need to have the right balance in the proposals between environmental protection and industrial competitiveness. The Commission hoped to bring forward its full proposal by October, to enable progress to be made before the European parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/7">Together with Denmark, the UK tabled a paper drawing attention to the Commission's Communication on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade and calling for rapid progress on measures to address illegal logging and its associated trade. The council also noted written contributions on the recent Environment for Europe Conference in Kiev, Environmental Technologies, Sustainable Development in an enlarged Union, Natura 2000, vehicle emissions, sensitive sea areas, flood prevention and the herbicide Paraquat.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/8">The Presidency reported that it had written to key members of the Convention on the Future of Europe, setting out the concerns with the inadequate treatment of the environment in the draft Constitutional Treaty. I circulated a letter to colleagues at council, highlighting my continuing concerns on these points, and about the negative impact of the proposal for a Single Legislative council. The Presidency considered that the latest draft Treaty text on environment and sustainable development was a significant improvement.</p>

	<p pid=".200W.5/1">If a child of compulsory school age who is registered at a school fails to attend regularly at the school then the parent is guilty of an offence under section 444(1) of the Education Act 1996. Sanctions that might be imposed following a conviction under section 444(1) include a parenting order or a fine.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.5/2">Since March 2001 there has been a more serious offence where a parent who, knowing that his child is failing to attend regularly at school, fails without reasonable justification to cause him to attend (Education Act 1996 section 444(1A) as amended by the Criminal Justice and Court Service Act 2000). Prosecution under section 444(1A) can lead to a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.5/3">Information about the number of prosecutions under sections 444(1) and 444(1A) is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.5/4">Local education authorities have discretion whether or not to prosecute in individual cases. On conviction, magistrates must consider the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence before deciding on a sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.5/5">Further measures to reinforce parental responsibility for school attendance are being introduced in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill. New parenting contracts will enable formal agreements between parent and school or parent and LEA in which each side sets out the steps they will take to secure an improvement in the child's attendance. Penalty notices will provide an alternative to prosecution and a much quicker and cheaper way of sanctioning parents who are capable of improving their child's school attendance and simply need a reminder of their responsibilities.</p>

It is therefore not possible to say how many prosecutions the CPS have dropped on the grounds it was not in the public interest to prosecute by reason of old age. This information is held on individual case files, and could be obtained only, at disproportionate cost, by examining each relevant file in every CPS office across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.9/2">The only information currently available comes from a survey of the reasons for discontinuance undertaken in six CPS branches during the period October to December 1998. This showed that 2.7 per cent. of all discontinuances were attributable to the age or ill health of the defendant. Obviously however this information is considerably out of date and came from a limited sample.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.9/3">The Compass case management system, which is to be implemented throughout the CPS by the end of 2003 will enable a full analysis of the reasons for discontinuance including a record of cases discontinued because the defendant was elderly.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.4/1">Although no new data will now be collected for MASS, the Government recognise that the existing database will remain a valuable resource for many years which should continue to be available for users. It will, therefore, be looking for proposals from other organisations that would be interested in taking it over. The value of the database should be enhanced by the inclusion of the last three years data which has been delayed by IT problems. The Government hope to be able to publish this later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.4/2">The report of the Accidental Injury Task Force identified a need to strengthen the surveillance of accidental injury at regional and local levels in the NHS. This will be the Government's first priority. However, it is too soon to say whether NHS surveillance will collect data on product involvement in accidental injuries in the sort of detail which HASS has provided. If detailed data is required on product safety issues, this can be collected through targeted surveys.</p>

To support and help speed up the spread of best practice, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-06">6 April 2003</phrase> we introduced new flexible working legislation, to ensure that employees with children under six or disabled children under 18 will only have their requests for flexible working turned down where there are valid business reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/2">We are committed to commence a review of this legislation in three years' time, and as a baseline for this, we have already carried out two major surveys covering employers and employees, giving a clear picture of the current levels of flexible working in both public and private sectors. We are currently developing a detailed monitoring strategy for the next three years and are working closely with key employer and employee stakeholders. As part of this strategy we will be repeating the two baseline surveys in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/3">For further evidence on the numbers of people working flexibly, disaggregated into the public and private sectors, we are repeating the large scale Workplace Employment Relations Survey in 2004, and asking specific questions on flexible working to both employers and employees. The spring and autumn modules of the quarterly Labour Force Survey also provide some information on flexible working practices.</p>
	<p pid=".214W.3/4">We will be working with other Government Departments to gain information on how the new legislation is being implemented and the levels of take up across central Government. We are also establishing links with the Employers' Organisation for Local Government (EO) and the Local Government Association (LGA) in order to gather information specifically relating to flexible working practices within local government.</p>

	<p pid=".219W.0/1">As sponsoring Department, DTI has had regular liaison with representatives of the waste management industry including the Environmental Services Association (ESA) and the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM). In particular, DTI has played an active role in the development of good practice initiatives by the National Resource and Waste Forum (NRWF)&mdash;a cross-sectoral forum led by the waste management industry, which was instigated by DTI following a study of industry competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/2">The Department takes careful account of the views of the waste management industry in consideration of waste policy. This enables us to bring a waste industry perspective to discussions with other Government bodies such as Defra, the Environment Agency and HM Treasury.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/3">The Joint Environmental Markets Unit (JEMU)&mdash;which is jointly staffed by DTI and Defra&mdash;continues to promote the UK's waste management industry in international markets. An extensive programme of activities, including seminars and outward and inward trade missions, has benefited around 20 to 30 waste management companies over the past couple of years, and is beginning to achieve a far greater appreciation in the industry of global trade and investment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/4">During 2002, an industry-Government Innovation and Growth Team (IGT) for the Environmental Goods and Services Sector (IGT-EGS) was set up to identify actions to help the UK environmental sector take advantage of changes in UK and overseas markets over the next 15 years. As a result, JEMU will expand its role, taking forward those actions that are of common interest across waste, water, energy and other sub-sectors and are not already being dealt with effectively elsewhere. This will include a particular focus on the innovation-related aspects of the IGT work.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/5">To this end, DTI and Defra have established an Environmental Innovations Advisory Group which will meet for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-14">14 July 2003</phrase>. The Group will bring together companies from different levels in three supply chains&mdash;waste recycling, energy efficient technology and water management&mdash;as well as people involved in supporting the innovation and commercialisation process. This theme of innovation in resource efficiency is consistent with policy goals, while the findings would be transferable to other areas of innovation in environmental technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/6">The Department is also represented on the Defra-led Hazardous Waste Forum, and is currently considering options for a possible industry forum on waste, in line with a recommendation in the Strategy Unit report, &quot;Waste Not Want Not&quot;.</p>

PRISM was rolled out throughout DFID in 2002. Now that a critical mass of performance information has been entered into PRISM, we will report progress against the baseline figures.</p>

In 2000, DFID commissioned a review of the JFS which drew on this accumulated data to identify best practices and lessons learnt on the role of UK based civil society organisations in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. These findings contributed to the design and development of the new Civil Society Challenge Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.5/1">According to Arthritis Care, arthritis and rheumatism together account for one quarter of all visits to general practitioners. More than eight million people in the United Kingdom consult their family doctor about some form of arthritis. This includes about one million adults under the age of 45 and about 15,000 children. Figures are not available for South Sefton, Southport and Formby.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.5/2">Our policies to improve general hospital care, especially through the new single assessment process, will ensure that the health care needs of older people&mdash;who are the main sufferers from arthritis&mdash;will be properly targeted. This will ensure that the services that are provided are most appropriate to older people's needs, including people with arthritis.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.5/3">In the past year, two new classes of drugs, Cox II inhibitors and anti-TNF therapy have been made available to arthritis patients, following reviews by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). In addition, NICE is reviewing the drug, Anakinra, for its clinical and cost-effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.5/4">We have issued directions obliging strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to provide appropriate funding for treatments recommended by NICE. This is in line with our manifesto commitment to ensure that patients receive drugs and treatments recommended by NICE on the national health service if considered appropriate by their clinicians.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.5/5">Priorities for health and social care are set out in &quot;Improvement, Expansion and Reform&quot;, the Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&ndash;6. Although arthritis is not identified specifically, people with this condition stand to benefit from the improvement in access to specialist care for patients suffering from any form of orthopaedic condition. Maximum waiting times have fallen over the past few years and will continue to do so, so that, by the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first outpatient appointment with a consultant will fall to three months and the maximum wait for inpatient treatment will fall to six months. Also, the older people's national service framework set standards which will improve treatment and care for a range of older people, including those with arthritis.</p>

	<p pid=".229W.8/1">The Department does not allocate funding specifically to eye health education. We are, however, doing much to improve the detection and treatment of those with sight problems.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.8/2">Free sight tests are available under the national health service to large parts of the population, including all those aged 60 and over, children, those aged 16&ndash;18 in full-time education, people on benefits, those people at particular risk of developing eye disease, and people who are registered blind or partially sighted or who have a complex spectacle prescription. Sight tests are the ideal opportunity to review all aspects of eye health, including investigations for signs of disease. Those at risk of specific eye disease, for example, diabetic retinopathy, may be asked to attend regular screening. Overall, the number of NHS sight tests undertaken continues to increase. 9.8 million NHS sight tests were paid for by health authorities in 2001&ndash;02, an increase of three per cent. on 2000&ndash;01. 41 per cent. or four million, of these sight tests were performed on patients aged 60 or over, a group most vulnerable to eye disease. 24 per cent. or 2.4 million, were performed on children.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.8/3">In addition, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-21">21 May</phrase> the investment of an additional 52 million to deliver shorter waiting times for cataract patients, so that no patient will wait more than three months by December 2004, with most areas achieving this by the summer of 2004. We are also aiming to ensure that a minimum of 80 per cent. of people with diabetes are offered screening for the early detection and treatment, if needed, of diabetic eye disease, rising to 100 per cent. coverage by the end of 2007. This includes investment of &pound;27 million for the NHS to purchase state of the art digital cameras and related screening equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.8/4">We have promoted a system of child health and development checks. The programme of home visiting and community development makes an important contribution to many areas of health education, and fosters the early detection of problems, including those associated with eye sight in young, pre-school children. The programme also provides the opportunity to develop closer relationships between the family and the primary care team.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.8/5">Information about the extensive arrangements for providing help with NHS optical services and other health costs are publicised in leaflet HC11, &quot;Are you entitled to help with health costs?&quot; Posters are also available for display in optical practices and hospital out-patient departments.</p>

	<p pid=".230W.5/1">The Government are firmly committed to the view that, in the interests of consumer choice, the law should allow food supplements that are safe and properly labelled to be freely marketed.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/2">The most recent formal discussions on this issue took place in the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses in November 2002 and involved representatives of all European Union Member States other than Luxembourg; no firm conclusions were reached. The next stage at EU level will be discussions about maximum permitted levels of nutrients in food supplements. The Government's view is that these should be based on safety considerations rather than supposed need so as to neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.5/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for negotiations on this issue, takes every opportunity to press this case bilaterally with Member States. In addition, in May, the FSA wrote to EU Member States to advise them of the conclusions of the UK Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) on safe intakes of vitamins and minerals. The EVM's advice will form the basis of the United Kingdom's position when substantive discussions at EU level take place in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.5/1">Substantial new investment in both health and social care services was announced in the 2002 Budget. This amounts to the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the national health service. Over the years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, these plans mean that expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.4 per cent. a year over and above inflation&mdash;a total increase over the period of 43 per cent. in real terms.

Local British Lung Foundation Breathe Easy groups often reinforce pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.8/2">The Government recognises that access to routine dental treatment can be difficult in some areas of the country.

Currently, around 60 per cent. of all general practice dentists offer 90 per cent. or more NHS care. Some 25 per cent. of all general practice dentists offer NHS care exclusively. Around 90 per cent. of callers to NHS Direct seeking routine dental treatment are put in touch with a dentist within locally set and nationally benchmarked distance standards.</p>

	<p pid=".235W.5/1">The Government are committed to providing national health service dentistry for all who need and seek it. We recognise, however, that there are some areas of the country, including parts of Gloucestershire, where it is difficult to find a NHS dentist.</p>
	<p pid=".235W.5/2">In the forthcoming Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, the Government proposes to legislate for far-reaching reform of NHS dental services. It is proposed that each primary care trust (PCT) be given a duty to provide or secure the provision of primary dental services in its area to the extent that it considers reasonable to do so and be given the financial resources to do this. This will give PCTs the flexibility to address access issues in their areas. Dentists who contract with a PCT will have a secure income in return for making a longer-term commitment to the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".236W.2/1">Ministers recognise the excellent work done by all hospices in supporting people with terminal or life threatening illnesses. We also recognise the importance of improving palliative care for all patients and that is why we pledged in the NHS Cancer Plan to invest an additional &pound;50 million per annum in specialist palliative care, including hospices, by 2004. This extra &pound;50 million is to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and to enable the National Health Service to increase its contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of services.</p>

A joint NHS/voluntary sector national partnership group, charged with ensuring the &pound;50 million is spent wisely, is assessing investment plans from the local cancer networks for the use of the central budget. Once the plans are approved, allocations will be made to networks.</p>

	<p pid=".256W.6/1">The question has been transferred to me as I have responsibility for the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.6/2">The Crown Prosecution Service is party to a joint scheme, with the Department for Constitutional Affairs, to monitor the levels of cracked, ineffective and vacated trials in magistrates courts. The scheme, jointly developed between the two departments, was implemented in all 42 criminal justice system (CIS) Areas in April 2002. The scheme enables court, prosecution and defence practitioners to agree reasons why cases listed for trial are vacated or do not proceed as planned on the day. The data on the agreed reasons is analysed locally, under the stewardship of the Local Criminal Justice Board, so that strategies can be developed to reduce the instances of trials not proceeding.</p>
	<p pid=".256W.6/3">The results of monitoring for the first three-quarters 2002&ndash;03 in respect of cases listed for trial but vacated before the trial date because the prosecution were not ready for trial (further preparation needed) is:</p>

Work is presently being undertaken between the Crown Prosecution Service and Department of Constitutional Affairs to develop a common scheme for implementation later this year. Pilot schemes have been undertaken in Dorset, Surrey and London since March 2003 with promising results.</p>

	<p pid=".263W.2/1">In 2002, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister commissioned Heriot-Watt University to examine the scale, nature and impact of the misuse of the Right to Buy policy by companies. The results were published in March 2003. The full report is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at <a href="http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/information/rtb/index.htm">http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/information/rtb/index.htm</a>; a summary is at <a href="http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/hrs/hrs177/index.htm">http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/hrs/hrs177/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/2">The research found that some properties sold under the Right to Buy scheme had been acquired by companies offering tenants financial help to buy their homes on condition that they resold them to the company after the three-year discount repayment period had ended ('deferred resale' arrangements). Both tenant and company thereby evade the statutory requirement, in place since 1980, to repay discount where a property is resold within three years of being sold under the Right to Buy scheme, and the companies acquire former social homes at substantially less than their market value in order to rent them out. This means that homes formerly available at subsidised social rents then command substantially higher market rents, reducing the availability of affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/3">Such exploitation is prevalent in Inner London, where the report estimated that at least 2,000 properties had been acquired in this way by companies since 1998. It also noted that at least one such company was advertising nationally.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.5/1">The setting-up costs of elected assemblies will vary from region to region, mainly because of the different sizes of their electorates. But the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects these to be around &pound;30 million in each region, including the north-west. This estimate includes all costs necessary to establish an assembly, including the cost of local government reviews, referendums and the first elections.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.5/2">The Government's estimates of the costs of running a regional assembly were set out in our White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice&quot;. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates that the north-west assembly would cost around &pound;25 million a year to run. But about &pound;5 million of this cost will be directly offset because staff will be transferring from existing bodies, such as the region's Government Office. The remaining costs could be absorbed within the assembly's programme budget through efficiency savings of around 5 per cent.</p>
