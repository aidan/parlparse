	<p pid="a.526W.3/1">The Commission for Africa report is a well argued case for the international community and Africa working in partnership to achieve change. One key recommendation is that aid to Africa should be doubled. DFID supports this, the UK is on track to double UK aid by 2010 from levels in 2004&ndash;05. The political momentum generated by the report will encourage other countries to increase aid flows and support the International Financing Facility (IFF). DFID will work to enlist maximum international response through our presidencies of the G8 and EU during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.3/2">The Commission for Africa report presents a powerful analysis of the most effective ways to ensure that growth in the quantity of aid is matched by increased aid effectiveness. We strongly agree and will be taking further steps to improve the predictability and harmonisation of UK aid, as recommended by the report, so that it will have maximum impact. The report also recommends that aid is untied&mdash;which is already the case for UK aid. More effective aid means better value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.3/3">The report is clear on the importance of donors being held to account for the effectiveness of their aid and recommends the establishment of new mechanisms for monitoring donor performance against clear, time bound and quantifiable commitments. DFID supports this.</p>

	<p pid="a.527W.0/1">The International Finance Facility is a financing mechanism designed to provide significant extra resources for development between now and 2015. It would be used to finance country-led development processes in the poorest countries in Africa and elsewhere in the world, but will not act as a development bank or aid agency in its own right. Funds from the Facility would be disbursed through existing, effective, multilateral and bilateral mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.0/2">Finance from the International Finance Facility should ensure that aid is used to finance the investments that will help put countries on a sustainable and lasting path to poverty reduction this could include infrastructure.

	<p pid="a.527W.3/2">The country and regional strategies in the Africa and the Global Pools are based on where the UK can make a contribution to the reduction and resolution of conflict.

	<p pid="a.527W.6/1">DFID maintains close contact with the Government of Grenada, including its new Agency for Reconstruction and Development (ARD), and with other donors. We do so both bilaterally and through a forum which is convened by the United Nations Development Programme which includes the participation of the other major donors. Through these contacts we have responded to the Government of Grenada's requests for budget support and technical assistance for the reconstruction effort and have helped to press other donors to respond in a timely manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.6/2">The ARD was formally launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>&mdash;albeit somewhat later than originally envisaged. There has been progress in school reconstruction and in the housing sector. In the education sector, funds from the US Agency for International Development, World Bank, European Commission and DFID are being used for a programme of schools' rehabilitation. All children are now back at school.</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.6/3">The Government of Grenada has said that housing reconstruction and financing is a top priority and has committed to a number of initiatives for rebuilding. For priority vulnerable and needy families, as a first phase, it committed to constructing 225 low-income homes at a cost of about &pound;8,000 per home, and providing material assistance for the repair of 1,125 roofs during the same period. The Government are also offering a Soft Loan Facility which provides a maximum loan amount of approximately &pound;8,000 for 10 years with a one year grace period, at an interest rate of 3 per cent. In addition the Venezuelan Government, the US Agency for International Development, and the People's Republic of China have all committed to the construction and repair of homes in Grenada.</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.6/4">Similarly, while not directly involved in assessing the efforts of the Caymanian authorities, DFID continues to monitor progress in Cayman Islands' recovery from Hurricane Ivan. Since our emergency assistance in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, when we quickly contributed relief supplies and helped with the clear-up operation, both the islands' Governor and our Disaster Management Adviser have kept in close contact and provided us with reports. In addition, the Cayman Islands Government have shared with us a damage assessment by the United Nations' Economic commission for the Caribbean and Latin America (ECLAC).</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.6/5">We understand that the pace of recovery, including repairs to housing and essential infrastructure, continues to be strong and that the situation is improving on a daily basis. The Cayman authorities have also announced measures, in co-operation with the United Nations Development Programme, to establish a National Emergency Management system and to achieve optimum resilience in the event of any future natural disasters.</p>

	<p pid="a.529W.2/1">DFID is providing a grant of &pound;16 million (October 2001 to September 2006) to the Microbicide Development Programme (MDP) coordinated by the Medical Research Councils Clinical Trials Unit and Imperial College. DFID has also provided &pound;18 million to International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and &pound;1.3 million to International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM).</p>
	<p pid="a.529W.2/2">DFID is supporting a range of prevention interventions across the countries where we work. Our support depends on needs and demand at country level linked to the nature of the epidemic. We support a comprehensive country led approach to HIV prevention. We support governments to strengthen their health and social systems. We also provide specific support to delivering services via civil society, private sector and Government agencies. This covers a range of activities such as school education, harm reduction such as needle exchanges, and methadone replacement for intravenous drug users, voluntary counselling and testing, procurement and supply of sexual and reproductive health commodities and associated training and counselling. We encourage engagement of key stakeholders such as people living with HIV/AIDS, commercial sex workers and intravenous drug users in developing and implementing services.</p>
	<p pid="a.529W.2/3">Access to reproductive health services and information is essential to preventing HIV infection and we support better integration of services for AIDS and sexual and reproductive health, so that they are complementary and not competitive. Sexual and reproductive health services are also a cornerstone of efforts to prevent HIV infection. DFID is a major donor of reproductive health commodities (including condoms), mainly through budgetary support to country strategies that include reproductive health but also via support for specific reproductive health programmes. We support social marketing programmes that distribute contraceptives and condoms for HIV prevention.</p>

	<p pid="a.531W.5/1">We do not make it a requirement for any road user to wear reflective clothing. However, we do advise vulnerable road users&mdash;pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and horseriders&mdash;to wear fluorescent clothing during the day and reflective clothing at night to improve their visibility to other road users. This advice is contained in the Highway Code.</p>
	<p pid="a.531W.5/2">Drivers are generally less vulnerable. But the Code gives advice to them on where they should stand should their vehicle breakdown, with special advice for motorways. Our leaflet, A Guide to Safer Motorway Driving&quot;, also contains the advice on what to do when vehicles break down on motorways. While there are tragic accidents when drivers leave their vehicles, these are rare. We believe that drivers and occupants are not at great risk when they follow this advice&mdash;for example, for motorways they are advised to wait on a nearby bank or verge well away from the traffic. We therefore do not believe that we should go further and require the wearing of special clothing.</p>

In addition, small free-standing schemes are funded from the Highways Agency's small schemes budget. Following the recent Spending Review settlement, the Highways Agency is developing its detailed forward programme for small schemes, which include high value-for-money safety schemes, junction improvements, as well as environmental and accessibility improvement measures that include NMU crossings. Within this particular category of funding, the Highways Agency has indicative funding levels of &pound;10 million, &pound;6 million and &pound;7 million respectively for the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 for Accessibility projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.539W.3/1">A detailed analysis of how English dairy farmers stand to benefit or lose out relative to historic entitlements is provided in the document; CAP Single Payment Scheme, Basis for Allocation of Entitlement, Impact of the Scheme to be Adopted in England, which is available in the Library of the House and on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/capreform/background/pdf/webnoterev16.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/capreform/background/pdf/webnoterev16.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.539W.3/2">By the end of the transitional period some sectors will have gained or lost against historical subsidy receipts. Generally speaking, flat rate payments redistribute subsidy from more intensive to less intensive producers and to land not formerly in receipt of subsidy. On average larger dairy farmers will receive lower payments under this system than under one based on historic receipts whereas smaller farms will on average be better off. We believe that the eight-year transition to the flat rate payment will give all farmers time to adjust.</p>
	<p pid="a.539W.3/3">All payments to dairy farmers in the UK, as for other recipients of the Single Payment, will be decoupled from production, and therefore are no longer linked to particular farming activity. In a decoupled subsidy environment, farmers should only produce milk if they can do so profitably.</p>

	<p pid="a.540W.2/2">Those decisions were taken after very careful consideration of the arguments put forward in response to our consultation exercises on these matters. Those responses revealed a significant body of support for decoupling payments, recognising that the more fully support is decoupled, the greater the degree of freedom farmers will be given in respect of their business decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/3">A wide variety of often conflicting views were offered in respect of the Single Payment model, but our decision was ultimately guided by several key principles, namely:</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/4" class="indent">coherence with the Curry Commission report and our own Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy launched in 2002, in particular with the emphasis in both on bringing the industry closer to the market and on the increasing importance of environmentally-sensitive farming;</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/5" class="indent">consistency with our wider objectives for the Common Agricultural Policy, including greater simplicity, transparency, minimal bureaucracy and as few deductions as possible from the basic payment available; and</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/6" class="indent">the need to attract the widest possible support of the stakeholder community, for ongoing payments to farming which, we believe, requires us to move towards a system in which public money is delivering public goods.</p>

	<p pid="a.541W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1996-02-15">15 February 1996</phrase>, the Sea Empress&quot; laden with over 72,000 tonnes crude oil ran aground off Milford Haven. Extensive monitoring continued for two years covering the contamination with oil of seawater, sediment, fish, shellfish and edible plants and seaweeds with oil as detailed in the report. The main impacts all occurred at the time of the incident or shortly afterwards and there appeared to have been few major long-term effects. A full assessment was provided in the final report of the Sea Empress Environmental Evaluation Committee, published in 1998. A more detailed summary of the report is available at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_shipping/documents/page/dft_shipping_505333">http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_shipping/documents/page/dft_shipping_505333</a>.hcsp.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-31">31 October 2000</phrase>, the levoli Sun&quot; was abandoned and later sunk approximately 11 miles North West of Alderney. The vessel carried a mixed cargo of 4,000 tonnes styrene, 1,000 tonnes methyl ethyl ketone and 1,000 tonnes isopropyl alcohol. More than 1,000 tonnes styrene was lost to sea during the incident. Analysis of edible tissues from crabs recovered one week later from pots laid very close to the wreck prior to the incident demonstrated only low-level styrene contamination that posed no risk to humans. The remainder of the styrene and the ship's main bunker fuel were recovered from the wreck on the seabed. Full details are provided in R.J. Law, C. Kelly, P. Matthiessen and J. Aldridge (2003) The loss of the chemical tanker <i>levoli Sun</i> in the English Channel, October 2000. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 46: 254&ndash;257.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-29">29 June 2003</phrase>, the Jambo&quot; carrying 3,300 tonnes sphalerite ore ran aground on rocks off the Summer Isles North West of Ullapool. Sphalerite is mainly composed of zinc sulphide and contains traces of other metals such as lead, cadmium and arsenic. Monitoring included testing water, sediments and shellfish for zinc, toxicity testing and measuring the solubility of metallic elements in the sphalerite ore. It showed that measured levels of zinc in the water were mostly very low. Toxic impacts of zinc to water column animals are therefore considered very unlikely. Measured levels of zinc in sediments are very low except in the immediate vicinity of the wreck (-100 metres) so toxic and smothering impacts to benthic (seabed) animals are therefore expected to be similarly localised. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the discharged cargo from the Jambo has resulted in persistent elevated levels of zinc, cadmium or arsenic in scallop or crab tissues. It is concluded that eating shellfish from the area around the Jambo incident does not raise any food safety concerns for consumers. The final report of the Jambo Environment Group to the Secretary of State's Representative was published in July 2004 and can be obtained from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency at: <a href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/environment_group_report-5.pdf">http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/environment_group_report-5.pdf</a>.

	<p pid="a.542W.2/2">Imports of red meat from China are not permitted. Imports of poultry meat were banned in January 2002 following the detection in animal products of residues of veterinary medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/3">Bans on some animal products e.g. honey, Royal jelly and rabbit meat have since been lifted following the implementation in China of corrective measures and the guarantees provided by their competent authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/4">However, an inspection visit to China by European Commission Inspectors identified some deficiencies with respect to the production of poultry meat intended for export to the EU. Given that, and the outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in China, the ban on imports of poultry meat has been retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/5">All meat imported into the EU from third countries must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts where they are subject to veterinary inspections to ensure import conditions are met.</p>

This guidance forms part of the internal website, which also includes a calendar of religious festivals, guidance for staff on cultural differences and information for accommodation managers regarding prayer rooms.

	<p pid="a.551W.11/1">In September 2004, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Media and Heritage, met the High Commissioner of New Zealand and the UK Consultant to the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust to discuss proposals by the Trust to preserve the huts of the Antarctic explorers Scott and Shackleton. My right hon.

The purpose of his visit was to ascertain what advice and expertise English Heritage could offer to the New Zealand Government and the Trust on the conservation of the Scott and Shackleton huts located in the Ross Sea Region of the continent.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.11/3">The British Government are keen to support New Zealand's efforts to preserve these historic huts. In 2002, the Government, through the Government of the British Antarctic Territory, donated &pound;70,000 to support the proposed Ross Sea heritage restoration project developed by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust. Officials in my Department have also been exploring funding options to assist with this but no suitable sources of funding within the UK heritage sector have been found. However, the Government will continue to support fund raising efforts for the preservation of these unique huts.</p>

	<p pid="a.555W.5/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has 130 million private finance initiative (PFI) credits available to support new schemes in the latest joint bidding round, which is being run between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department of Health and the DCMS. DCMS priorities for this bidding round are projects that will promote the modernisation of the public library service and the creation of multi-sport facilities. The closing date for expressions of interest, which is the first stage in a two stage application process, was <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-12">12 March 2005</phrase>. We have received Gloucestershire county council's and Gloucester city council's expression of interest for a new cultural centre, and we will be assessing it together with the other expressions of interest we have received. We hope that the process can be completed and authorities notified of theresults in June 2005. Further information about the latest bidding round, in the form of guidance to local authorities seeking to apply, can be found at <a href="http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/pfi/bidguid.pdf">www.local.odpm.gov.uk/pfi/bidguid.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid="a.556W.2/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, in England and Wales there were 113,370 on-licensed premises; 46,582 off-licensed premises; and 19,913 registered clubs. These figures can be found in the DCMS publication Statistical Bulletin Liquor Licensing (England and Wales, July 2003&mdash;June 2004)&quot; which was deposited on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-27">27 October 2004</phrase> in the House Libraries. This document is also available on the DCMS website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.556W.2/3">The total number of public entertainment licences issued under the London Government Act 1963 and the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 is not known. Licensing authorities hold figures for theirown authority areas and these are not collected centrally. However, surveys suggest that 46,000 public entertainment licences are issued in England and Wales annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.2/4">We have not made any estimates of the distribution of these premises across the fee bands for the 2003 Act by category of existing licence. However, the Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanied the finalised fees estimated the distribution of all licensed premises across the fee bands as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="a.556W.2/7"> <th>Band</th> <th>Non-domestic rateable value (&pound;)</th> <th>Percentage of premises in band</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.556W.2/10"> <td>A</td> <td>0&ndash;4,300</td> <td>19</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.556W.2/11"> <td>B</td> <td>4,301&ndash;33,000</td> <td>60</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.556W.2/12"> <td>C</td> <td>33,001&ndash;87,000</td> <td>13</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.556W.2/13"> <td>D</td> <td>87,001&ndash;125,000</td> <td>3</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.556W.2/14"> <td>E</td> <td>125,001 and over</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.556W.2/17">The fee multiplier applies to premises primarily or exclusively engaged in the supply of alcohol for consumption on the premises that fall into fee Bands D and E. Premises in Band D would pay twice the normal application fee and annual fee; and those in Band E would pay three times the normal application fee and annual fee. It is difficult to estimate precisely how many premises will meet these definitions. However, we believe there will be at least 2,000 such premises and, at most, 4,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.565W.5/2">UK online centres were established to bridge the gap between those in society who have access to ICT and the internet and those who do not. Between 1999 and 2003 a total of &pound;396 million was invested to set up the centres. There are now 6,000 UK online centres in England, and people over 60 are one of the five main groups in the target audience for UK online centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/3">Ufi, the organisation which now has responsibility for the administration and development of UK online, also operates the network of 2,000 learndirect centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/4">Information provided by Ufi on usage of UK online centres shows that:</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/5" class="indent">UK online centres provide help and support for over 500,000 people a year</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/6" class="indent">14 per cent. of UK online users are over 65</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/7" class="indent">85 UK online centres are co-located or linked to Age Concern</p>

	<p pid="a.565W.5/9" class="indent">Over 1.5 million learners have enrolled on over 3.6 million learndirect courses since April 2000</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/10" class="indent">27 per cent. of learndirect learners who enrolled on courses between August 2004 and January 2005 are over 50, and 12 per cent. are over 60</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/11">In addition, an e-government pathfinder project, led by DfES in conjunction with Ufi aimed to test the potential of UK online centres to support e-government service delivery. One pathfinder focused on services for older people, working with Age Concern, to provide access to a range of Government services. The Department and Ufi are currently considering the findings of the evaluation of these pathfinders.</p>

	<p pid="a.566W.5/1">We are committed to improving recruitment and retention of teachers. Nationally, there are around 29,000 more qualified teachers working in schools than there were in 1997. We have put in place nationally a number of incentives to attract and retain teachers, including PGCE bursaries of up to &pound;6,000 and Golden Hellos&quot; of up to &pound;4,000 in certain subjects. The Teacher Training Agency supports the cost of Recruitment Managers in local education authorities. Every outer London borough has received funding for the last four years and will continue to be supported for the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.5/2">Vacancy rates are falling faster in London than in the rest of the country but remain twice the national rate. We therefore continue to take additional steps to recruit and retain teachers in London, including outer London. As part of the London Challenge, which the Prime Minister launched in May 2003, we introduced Chartered London Teacher status. This recognises and rewards the distinctive skills and expertise demonstrated by teachers in outer and inner London and provides incentives for good teachers to stay teaching in London. We are also aware that the cost of housing is a factor in teachers' decisions about where to live and work. With the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, we have introduced interest-free equity loans to help teachers in London schools buy homes. The Key Teacher Homebuy scheme, which is only available to school teachers in London, offers loans of up to &pound;100,000 for teachers willing to commit to a long-term career working in London schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.5/3">We have established a separate pay scale for teachers in outer London. Starting salaries for teachers in outer London will increase from &pound;20,862 in April 2004 to &pound;21,384 in April 2005 and &pound;22,002 in September 2005. Schools retain the discretion to make such payments or other financial assistance, support or benefits to a teacher as they consider necessary as an incentive for the recruitment of new teachers or the retention of existing teachers.</p>

There is a strong public interest in allowing Government to have a clear space, immune from exposure to public view, in which it can debate matters internally with candour and free from the pressures of public political debate, including in deciding whether it should seek advice from its principal legal adviser, the Attorney-General.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.2/1">The London Tree and Woodland Framework Consultation Document was launched in July 2004, produced by the London Woodland Advisory Group which includes Government Office for London, Greater London Authority (GLA) and the Forestry Commission (FC). Consultation involved a wide range of London stakeholders, and as key members of the Advisory Group the Mayor and officials from the GLA were closely involved in drawing up proposals in the framework, while boroughs through the London Tree Officers Association were key consultees.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/2">The Government plan to launch the Tree and Woodland Framework for London shortly. The document will provide a firm commitment by a wide partnership of London bodies including the GLA and the FC to maintain and enhance London's trees and woodlands as a vital part of the environment and will establish priority locations for new tree planting, taking into account such factors as levels of social deprivation, transport corridors and gateways, derelict land, biodiversity objectives, areas of regeneration and community forests.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/3">The 'million trees campaign' which is managed by Trees for London, supported by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the FC, was initiated in September 2003. This project involves a London-wide partnership to plant one million new trees in London by 2010. To date this has already achieved a total of 330,000 trees. The work of the FC and Thames Chase Community Forest has also resulted in substantial areas of new planting with full public access in the North East of London. This project has been supported by the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund and work to extend the forest will continue. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are also actively involved in the Greening the Gateway partnership which is the shared environmental vision for the Thames Gateway London. I am in regular contact with the Mayor and London boroughs on environmental issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.583W.12/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Chief Executive, Martin Narey, is committed to place diversity at the heart of NOMS. A permanent diversity impact assessment process will be in place and a NOMS race and diversity strategic framework is being developed that will be aimed at not only ensuring compliance with legislative requirements, but at also promoting best practice in diversity across NOMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.12/2">Planning has begun on the creation of a learning and development strategy for NOMS. Working closely with Skills for Justice (the Sector Skills Council for the justice sector) and regional probation training consortia, this strategy will identify new learning programmes and qualifications needed to support the development of NOMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.12/3">As the offender management model is now being developed, a particular priority is to define the occupational standards and competencies needed to undertake this critical new role, and hence to develop supporting learning programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.12/4">The Prison Service and National Probation Service are also developing proposals for an integrated approach to leadership and management development for managers across NOMS. An early output has been the creation of an induction and development programme for the 10 Regional Offender Managers.</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.3/38">The results for the half-year to September 2004 show an improvement of eight percentage points on those for 2003&ndash;04. This is very encouraging and continues the upward trend of recent years: in 2001&ndash;02 enforcement stood at 53 per cent. rising to 64 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 and again to 77 per cent. last year. The NPS is now closer than ever to achieving its enforcement target of 90 per cent. and I am optimistic that the 85 per cent. achieved in the first six months can be increased by the end of 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="a.587W.0/1">The Home Office invested &pound;5.5 million in launching the Chipping of Goods Initiative in March 2000. The UK was the first country in the world to embrace the use of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) or 'electronic tagging' to deal with property crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.587W.0/2">The programme was led by the Police Scientific Development Branch and the Business Crime Team and was established as a result of the need to reduce the incidence and cost of property crime and to reduce the burden on police resources in tracing the ownership of stolen goods. It was also established to show the clear business benefits that can be gained from adopting such technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.587W.0/3">Case studies for each of eight demonstrator projects were carried out, each one showing how the business benefited from the use of RFID. Manufacturers, retailers, consumers, the police and other enforcement agencies will all benefit from the wider adoption of this technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.587W.0/4">The eight demonstrator projects are world class implementations and have already received five awards for technical excellence and outstanding achievement, including 'Retail Technology Team of the Year' and the 'European Supply Chain Solution of the Year'.</p>

However there has been no investigation of Radio Frequency Identification technologies which imply the ability to communicate with devices at much greater distances, nor it is envisaged that this would ever form part of the requirements for the Identity Cards scheme.</p>

Our embassy in Bogota has spoken to the judicial authorities and to Colombian Government representatives at the highest level to express our concerns regarding this killing. Luis Eduardo Guerra was a highly respected member of the Colombian NGO community and well known to our embassy. I met him during my visit to Colombia in 2004. I welcome the Colombian Government's assurances that there will be an impartial, swift and effective investigation into this, as well as into the other murders in the San Jose de Apartado Peace Community. Officials from the human rights unit in the Attorney-General's office, as well as forensic specialists and other officials, are in the area where the killings happened and are carrying out their investigation. This process includes interviews with members of the Peace Community, as well as all local army units, to try and establish the facts. We have also stressed to the Colombian authorities the need for proper protection to be given to witnesses of the crimes and of human rights defenders following thecase. The Colombian authorities have assured us that such protection will be available to anyone who needs it. We continue to closely monitor the situation. Those responsible, whoever they may be, must be brought to justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.601W.0/1">We have taken many steps to tackle pensioner poverty, including the introduction of pension credit and winter fuel payment, and since 2000 there has been a 7 per cent. real rise in the level of the basic state pension. As a result of these measures during 2005&ndash;06 we will be spending extra &pound;11 billion more on pensioners, including &pound;5 billion more on the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.0/2">Poverty is about more than low income; it also impacts on the way people live&mdash;their health, housing and the quality of their environment. The sixth annual 'Opportunity for all' report (Cm 6239), published in September 2004, sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.0/3">Analysis suggests our overall strategy to tackle pensioner poverty is having an impact on pensioner incomes. The Household Below Average Income figures present the number and proportion of pensioners living in households with incomes below fixed and relative thresholds. The latest publication shows that between 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03, 1.8 million fewer older people lived in absolute low income on un-rounded figures. Inpercentage terms, this equated to a fall of around two thirds. Further information is presented in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.604W.2/1">The contracting-out rebate rates that applied to appropriate personal pensions introduced under the Social Security Act 1986, were set out in a report laid before both Houses of Parliament in March 1987 by the then Secretary of State for Social Security. As required under the legislation, a report by the Government Actuary was laid at the same time and set out the rebate rates that, under the legislation then in force, he considered to be appropriate. Before these reports were laid, a draft of the Government Actuary's report was issued for consultation. This consultation included questions on the appropriateness of the level and structure of the rebates. The actuarial profession were among those consulted and their views were taken into account as part of the consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.606W.3/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Tamworth will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk, will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, whilst older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 21 per cent. of adults and 6 per cent. of children in the West Midlands region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>

	<p pid="a.606W.3/20">Through Jobcentre Plus we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Tamworth the proportion in employment has increased by 1 point since 1997 to 72.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/21">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.25 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with 1,890 in Tamworth alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,300 families in Tamworth.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/24">Our reforms include the State Second Pension which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004 around 3,855 pensioners in Tamworth were receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;38.29 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70+ payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80+ annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.3/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent. respectively. Some 14,400 pensioners in Tamworth have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.608W.5/1">Poverty is about more than low income; it also impacts on the way people live&mdash;their health, housing and the quality of their environment. The sixth annual 'Opportunity for all' report (Cm 6239), published in September 2004, sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.5/2">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in 'Households Below Average Income 1994&ndash;95 to 2002&ndash;03'. It should be noted that the reporting of year on year changes of low-income rates for small ethnic groups are not reliable. Both publications are in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.5/3">According to the latest data, in 2002&ndash;03, 3.7 million women in Great Britain were living in households with income below 60 per cent. of median income on the Before Housing Costs measure, and 4.7 million women were living in low income using a similar threshold on the After Housing Costs measure.

In devising a dress code the guidance requires managers to consult and ensure that they do not discriminate on any grounds and, where an employee's religion requires them to observe a particular dress code, this should be respected. However, recognition and respect for faith must be balanced against considerations for health, safety and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.2/2">The Department's Corporate Diversity Unit is currently devising a toolkit on religion and belief which is intended to include guidance on the wearing of religious objects including the Kirpan.</p>

It is for PCTs, in conjunction with strategic health authorities, to ensure that local services meet the needs of their local communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.625W.2/1">The Department's guidance on the tracking of surgical instruments is contained in Health Service Circular (HSC) 2000/032 (Decontamination of Surgical Instruments). This asked chief executives of national health service trusts to have taken steps, by April 2002, towards having systems in place to enable the tracing of surgical instrument sets to patients on whom they have been used. The presence (or absence) of such a system was taken into account in assessing each NHS trust's compliance with the Department's guidance made as part of the Review of the decontamination of surgical instruments in the NHS in England&quot;, published in December 2001. NHS trusts are not required to report to the Department which tracing system they use.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.2/2">Compliance with the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive (93/42 EEC)&mdash;compulsory for commercial reprocessing centres providing a service to the NHS&mdash;implies the ability to track surgical instruments through the system. It does not&mdash;and nor does Departmental guidance&mdash;require any particular form of marking, such as bar codes, to be used. The detailed contents of contracts between NHS organisations and private sector providers of decontamination services are a matter for the parties concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.2/3">The Department's guidance on handling instruments used on suspected CJD patients or in certain brain biopsies recommends that such instruments should be quarantined pending confirmation of a diagnosis. All hospitals that have implemented the guidance in HSC 2000/032 will have the capacity to do this. Other than the review published in 2001, no complete survey of their compliance has been undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.2/4">The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (NHS PASA) has commissioned a survey that includes tracking and tracing systems in use in NHS trusts. NHS PASA is also discussing with the NHS the technologies presently available for marking instruments, such as laser etching; and those being developed, such as the implantation of radio frequency identification chips in individual instruments.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.2/1">A new set of arrangements have been put in place to enhance accountability to patients and the public. Patients' forums have been set up to monitor local health services and to feed back the views of local people to the trusts. Patient advice and liaison services provide information, advice and support to help patients, families and their carers. Independent complaints advocacy services offer support to patients and their carers wishing to pursue a complaint about their national health service treatment or care. Health overview and scrutiny committees in local authorities are scrutinising health services and a new duty has been placed on the NHS to involve and consult in service planning and operation, and in the development of proposals for changes. The advent of NHS foundation trusts has further led to greater accountability to patients and the public by enabling far greater local ownership and involvement of patients, the public and staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.5/1">With reference to improving the patient experience, national patient survey results to date show that the vast majority of patients&mdash;across all surveys&mdash;are positive about the overall care that they receive and the national health service staff who provide that care. For example, they have confidence and trust in staff, feel involved in their treatment/care, feel that they are listened to, get answers to any questions they have in a way they can understand and are treated with respect and dignity.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.3/1">No specific budget was allocated to the Wells report work. Its compilation involved the input of many individuals in a number of different organisations. The cost to public funds of the report could therefore be estimated only at disproportionate cost. The report will not be published, as to do so would prejudice similar future examinations of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which other public authorities discharge their functions.</p>
