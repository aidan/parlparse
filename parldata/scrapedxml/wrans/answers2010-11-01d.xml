	<p pid="d.491W.0/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) came into existence in 1986. Limited information on the volume of prosecutions for specific offences is captured on the Compass Management Information System. Compass was fully implemented in April 2005 and there are no central records prior to that date. The records show that in the five years ending March 2010 there were 13,282 offences charged under the sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which relate to sexual assaults or activity with a child or young person under the age of 16. This figure relates to the age of the victim and not that of the, defendant. Charges for other sexual offences, for example rape, may also involve victims aged 15 years or under but it is not possible to ascertain the age of the victim.</p>
	<p pid="d.491W.0/2">It is also not possible to ascertain the number of offences that were reported, whether the charges were modified or the outcome of the proceedings, because the records show the nature of the offence at the outset of the proceedings. Furthermore, it is not possible to ascertain the age or gender of any victim or whether the victim in any case was also prosecuted from the database.</p>
	<p pid="d.491W.0/3">This information is held on individual case files and could be obtained only by identifying and examining every relevant file in each CPS office, which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.497W.11/2">The inspectorate plays a key role in the implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. Visits by inspectors to designated establishments, many of which are unannounced, are important to check for compliance with the Act. An additional important role is to advise those working under the Act and encourage best practice with respect to the 3Rs-replacement, refinement and reduction. The inspectorate implements a risk-based approach to inspection and I expect this to continue.</p>
	<p pid="d.497W.11/3">The new European Union directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, to be implemented in United Kingdom legislation in January 2013, also requires a risk-based approach to inspections. A detailed assessment of the impact of its provisions, including those relating to inspections, is under way and will in due course be included in a public consultation on options for transposition.</p>

This occurs when the CRB has to contact the registered body for additional information about the applicant, when the application form has not been completed correctly or where the police require additional clarification about the applicant's identity. The CRB cannot continue to process the application until the registered body provides this information; or the applicant resolves any question of identity to the satisfaction of the police force.</p>

	<p pid="d.499W.5/18">The CRB have been working with police forces through joint operational performance reviews, to address the problems associated with delays and the impact that exceptional demand for CRB checks can have on police forces. The CRB has set up improvement plans with those forces that have been having problems meeting the demand for certificates. This is aimed at maintaining a steady output of applications on the system while also reducing the number of outstanding cases that have been with police forces for more than 25 days.</p>

	<p pid="d.514W.8/1">The probation budget for 2010-11 is &#163;864 million compared to &#163;894 million 2009-10. Before the new Probation Trust arrangements came into general operation in April 2010, all trusts and potential trusts were required to demonstrate how they would drive down costs and improve performance. There is no evidence that the savings that have been achieved have had any adverse impact on performance, and as such these savings are not expected to adversely impact on the prison population. Internal resource allocations for the spending review 2010 period have not yet been decided, but we have already been clear that a large part of our savings will be achieved through improvements in efficiency and cutting administration.</p>

	<p pid="d.514W.11/1">My Department is developing firm plans to deliver its priorities within the funding baselines announced in the Spending Review. We will be consulting widely on proposals for change but as yet no internal budgets have been set. Preliminary estimates suggest that the Department will lose around 14,000-15,000 posts, including a significant reduction in our headquarters and administrative areas. Preliminary modelling assumptions split the posts between 10,000 in the National Offender Management Service, 3,000 in courts and tribunals services and 1,000-2,000 elsewhere in the Department over the four-year period. Where possible, staff reduction will be through natural turnover and voluntary redundancy, avoiding compulsory redundancies if possible.</p>

	<p pid="d.515W.2/1">Reliable year-by-year information on the expenditure on community payback by probation trusts for the past five years is not available. A cost collection exercise in 2008-09 estimated that roughly &#163;95 million was spent on unpaid work but the estimate is not considered robust. The National Offender Management Service is currently introducing a new costing system for probation trusts which will collect reliable information on both budgeted and actual expenditure on unpaid work. Budgets for unpaid work are set locally by providers and commissioners and will be determined in the light of the Spending Review settlement. Allocations within the Ministry of Justice to business groups, including the National Offender Management Service, are yet to be decided but will reflect the impact of the forthcoming Green Paper on Sentencing Reform and need to deliver services as efficiently as possible including through the use of the new competition framework for unpaid work.</p>

	<p pid="d.529W.8/2">The spending review recognises the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging fiscal climate, the coalition Government has allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="d.529W.8/3">We have achieved this by:</p>
	<p pid="d.529W.8/4" class="indent">the NHS transferring some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will be up to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15; and</p>
	<p pid="d.529W.8/5" class="indent">additional grant funding, rising to &#163;1 billion by 2014-15, will be made available for social care. This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the revenue support grant.</p>

	<p pid="d.532W.2/2">If it were to become necessary to terminate the project, the only contracts to which significant cancellation charges could apply would be those awarded to EADS for the integrated system and Babcock for facilities management of the control centre buildings. These cancellation charges could vary significantly depending on the circumstances in which the contracts were cancelled. Specific arrangements set out in these contracts cannot be disclosed due to commercial confidentiality. Savings could also accrue from the cancellation of these contracts as well as from the cessation of national team staffing costs and local implementation costs paid to fire and rescue authorities which are currently funded for this work under New Burdens principles.</p>

We have been clear that EADS (now branded as Cassidian) must deliver to time, cost and quality.

	<p pid="d.544W.6/1">The Government decided not to proceed with the recycling of CRC revenues proposed by the previous Administration in order to support the public finances and contribute to the spending plans set out in the spending review, which align the allocation of public resources with the Government's overall objectives as set out in the coalition agreement. The decision has the additional benefit of creating a clearer price signal in the scheme which participants have asked for.</p>
	<p pid="d.544W.6/2">The clearer and stronger price signal provided by this change should reduce uncertainty and administrative costs while maintaining energy efficiency measures among participants and the commensurate savings in energy bills.</p>

	<p pid="d.545W.3/1">Government have committed to keeping the operation of this scheme under active review with a particular eye to simplifying it and ensuring it properly incentivises those who do most to improve energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="d.545W.3/2">In order to clarify the price signal to participants and to support the public finances, including spending on the environment, as part of the comprehensive spending review the Government announced that revenue from allowance sales will not be recycled back to participants. As part of the commitment to simplify the scheme and reduce the burden on businesses, we also announced that the first allowance sales for 2011-12 emissions will now take place in 2012 rather than 2011. A public dialogue and consultation with participants on how to further simplify the scheme will begin shortly. The UK Government and devolved Administrations will consider the results of that consultation process and, subject to the views expressed, make legislative proposals to amend the CRC ahead of the second phase.</p>

We will not know the CRC emissions coverage accurately until participants have submitted their emissions data in July 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.549W.8/1">The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) was significantly revised as part of the EU Climate and Energy Package agreed by EU member states in 2008. The changes will take place from Phase III, which will run from 2013 to 2020, with a more ambitious, EU-wide cap on emissions. This will bring with it more emission reductions, more predictable market conditions and improved certainty for industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.549W.8/2">The Government support an EU move to a 30% emissions reduction target, and a significant part of this reduction should come from sectors covered by the EU ETS. An EU move to 30% would therefore mean a lower cap level, in turn delivering a higher carbon price which will stimulate investment in low carbon jobs and technologies, and help to put the EU and UK on track to meet 2050 emissions reduction targets.</p>

	<p pid="d.551W.0/2">There are no targets for individual technologies, and the actual mix of technologies that makes up the UK's achievement of the 2020 target will depend on how different technologies respond to the financial incentives put in place, and how constraints such as planning, grid, and supply chain ease over time. It should also be noted that the overall target is defined as a proportion of energy demand, which is uncertain, and thus the exact level of renewable energy required in 2020 is uncertain too.</p>

	<p pid="d.551W.3/1">Warm Front continues to provide a range of heating and insulation measures for vulnerable households. The new Energy Company Obligation, starting in late 2012, will run in parallel with the Green Deal programme. It is intended to focus particularly on households who cannot achieve financial savings without additional support, including the poorest and most vulnerable and those in hard to treat homes. We expect energy companies to play a greater role than they do through the current obligations in ensuring the poorest and most vulnerable can afford to heat their homes adequately. This includes offering a wider range of measures which improve energy performance, such as heating systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.551W.3/2">Between 2007 and 2008 up to an estimated 80,000 households were prevented from falling into fuel poverty and this can be attributed to energy efficiency improvements. We will continue to monitor the impact of such measures on the fuel poor.</p>

The scheme is designed in such a way that while the applicant must meet specific qualifying criteria to qualify for a grant, the grant itself is then associated to the property in which they reside.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.2/1">National Grid has never needed to curtail wind output because supply on a national scale exceeded demand. National Grid has made payments to wind farm operators to curtail output on two occasions. The first was a test to ensure the technical capability was present and the second was due to constraints on the transmission network. The total cost incurred was approximately &#163;53,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.9/2">The number and identity of organisations that receive funding, along with the level of that funding, is a matter for Arts Council England. As part of the spending review we have protected front-line funding for the arts, limiting the reduction to the overall budget for arts organisations to 14.9% over four years.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.9/3">In 2009-10 the typical regularly funded arts organisation received 33% of its income from the Arts Council. Therefore the actual reduction in income seen by the typical arts organisation from the reductions in the Arts Council's budget will be less than 5% over four years. There will, of course, be variation between organisations.</p>

	<p pid="d.556W.14/2">The National Lottery Commission has advised that in order to be eligible to play the national lottery, players must be resident at a United Kingdom or Isle of Man address, irrespective of their tax status. Residency in this instance is determined by checks carried out by Camelot, the national lottery operator and, in practice, this means members of the armed forces can open an online interactive account and purchase games on the national lottery website, as long as they are in a country where it is legal to do so, and/or set up a direct debit account.</p>
	<p pid="d.556W.14/3">However, the National Lottery Commission understands that in the majority of overseas jurisdictions, local laws forbid the purchase of other foreign lotteries, including the UK national lottery. If tickets are purchased from a country where it illegal to do so, the tickets are invalid and Camelot is not able to pay any associated prizes.</p>
	<p pid="d.556W.14/4">The NLC have therefore required Camelot to amend the rules for national lottery games so that players will only be able to set up or amend their direct debit, or purchase games online when they are physically located in the UK and the Isle of Man. These new rules will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-18">18 December 2010</phrase>. I welcome the NLC's intention to prevent people buying invalid tickets and inadvertently putting themselves at risk of prosecution in foreign jurisdictions.</p>
	<p pid="d.556W.14/5">I shall be writing to the NLC to thank them for their action so far, but I shall also ask them to consider what can be done in countries where the purchase of UK lottery tickets is lawful to allow armed forces personnel (and others) to participate.</p>

	<p pid="d.571W.0/1">The overseas pricing movements (OPM) mechanism was abolished by the previous Government as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review. OPM was originally put in place in order to ensure that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) overseas budget was maintained in real terms after foreign exchange rate and differential inflationary pressures overseas. The decision to remove OPM became effective in April 2008. As a result the FCO implemented a foreign currency forward purchase programme to help manage its foreign exchange needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.0/2">Since April 2008, our posts overseas have faced significant exchange rate and inflationary pressures. In 2008-09 the exchange and inflation rate pressure on our posts' budgets was &#163;59.2 million. In 2009-10 the exchange and inflation rate pressures on our posts' budgets was &#163;80 million and is estimated to be over &#163;100 million in 2010-11. As budgets in the FCO are devolved to our network of over 250 posts, details of the specific impact that the loss of OPM has had on any project or specific area of spend could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.0/3">Additional exchange rate pressures have had an impact on our international organisations subscriptions, peacekeeping assessed contributions and other budget areas spent in foreign currency from the UK. The total net impact on the Department's budget of adverse currency movements is estimated to be &#163;77 million in 2008-09, &#163;109 million in 2009-10 and &#163;141 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.0/4">In order to manage the pressures on our overseas network from exchange rate movements since the ending of the OPM mechanism and retain a global footprint, the FCO has had to re-examine and reprioritise funds allocated to programmes so they focus on those areas where the FCO itself can make the biggest difference and which offer the best possible value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.0/5">As part of the 2010 spending round, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that a new Foreign Currency Mechanism would be introduced to enable the FCO to better manage exchange rate pressures and allow for better planning. This will allow the FCO to stabilise the value of our budget overseas so that our activity will no longer be dictated by the foreign exchange markets, as it has been since OPM was withdrawn.</p>

The review did not include consultations with community leaders but, rather, took an objective view of the situation on the ground. The review noted significant improvements to the medical facilities provided for pilgrims by the Saudi authorities since the British Hajj Delegation first began 11 years ago. It also noted the declining demand for medical assistance for minor ailments from British Hajjis.</p>

	<p pid="d.578W.2/1">Bikeability cycle training is based on the National Standard for cycling training. The National Standard was developed by cycling organisations, safety bodies (including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and Road Safety UK), and the Administrations of the United Kingdom. It represents years of combined experience in providing high-quality, safe cycle training. Formal cycle training with an on-road element, such as Bikeability, has been shown to improve the safety awareness of children.</p>
	<p pid="d.578W.2/2">Recent research conducted by MORI asked parents and children about their experiences of Bikeability. Children who have taken part in the scheme feel safer and more confident when riding on the road (86%) and their parents feel more confident in allowing them to do so (87%). Children who have participated also feel more confident about riding their bike more often (87%). Bikeability training is rated very highly by both parents (97% say that they are very/quite satisfied with the training) and children (95% describe it as fairly/very good). I intend to publish this research in full in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="d.578W.2/3">The Department is currently evaluating cycling measures undertaken in the designated cycling demonstration towns, including cycle training and other activities aimed at schools. This work will be published once complete.</p>
	<p pid="d.578W.2/4">The value the Government place on Bikeability is demonstrated by our decision to continue support for the scheme after 2010-11.</p>

Whilst we are able to provide the overall cost of training courses for the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA), it is not possible to obtain information on the number of training courses without again incurring disproportionate costs. This is because the VCA relies on data supplied by its finance procurement system. Whilst this can identify expenditure on learning and development activities as a whole, it is not possible to differentiate between expenditure on courses and expenditure on other forms of learning and development activity. It is also not possible to accurately determine the number of courses delivered against a paid invoice. Their training budget is also used to meet the cost of ad-hoc training course expenses, professional registration, and exam fees, among other items.</p>

	<p pid="d.582W.5/2">The system's in orbit validation (IOV) phase was initially funded through contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA). The UK has provided &#8364;240.3 million to Galileo through its contributions to ESA. Funding to ESA is provided on a <i> juste retour</i> basis, meaning that contracts equivalent to a member state's contribution less administration costs should be awarded to companies from within the member state.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.5/3">The subsequent work required to complete the Galileo system is funded from the core EU budget to which all member states contribute. The UK contributes to the EU budget as a whole, not to individual programmes within it. The level of UK contribution depends on a number of factors, and varies from year to year. As a rough indication, the UK's pre-abatement contribution to the 2010 budget is currently estimated at 14%. The UK's contribution to the EU budget from 2014 onwards will be decided during the forthcoming negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.5/4">The EU budget allocation to complete the system was set at &#8364;3.405 billion in 2007. Four of the six work package contracts necessary to complete the system have been let and orders placed for items such as satellites, and the remaining contracts should be signed in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.5/5">The European Commission has not yet set out its proposal for the exploitation phase covering the operation, maintenance, marketing, improvement and renewal of the system from 2014 onwards. The Commission is required to undertake a feasibility study of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of contracts with private sector entities as part of this process since that may save public funds. The Commission's proposal may be made with the programme's mid-term review which the Commission is legally required to undertake in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.594W.8/2">The Department for Transport has no plans to implement a Tees Valley light rail metro system. We are aware of a long-standing proposal from local authorities in the area for such a system, but no official funding bid has ever been received by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.594W.8/3">Some early elements of the Tees Valley Metro project were prioritised by the north-east in the previous Government's Regional Funding Allocations system. These schemes are not being considered for major scheme funding in the spending review period and we hope to advise promoters how best to proceed once we have made progress in developing a new funding framework for major schemes for the future. In the meantime, promoters may also seek alternative funding sources.</p>
	<p pid="d.594W.8/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October</phrase> the Department announced that the agreed funding for the Tees Valley Bus Network would be accelerated so that the scheme can be delivered to a quicker timescale.</p>

UKTI Defence and Security Organisation (UKTI DSO), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills but working in close harmony with the MOD, is responsible for promoting British defence industry overseas. As the hon. Member knows only too well, defence exports make an important contribution to sustaining our defence industry. They uphold tens of thousands of highly skilled jobs and maintain prosperity for the individuals in the industry and for taxpayers as well. In addition to this, defence exports tie into a broader diplomacy initiative by enhancing relationships with key strategic partners.</p>
	<p pid="d.596W.8/2">This Government intend to increase defence exports through an active and innovative programme for defence diplomacy. We are working closely with industry to gain a clear understanding of the marketplace and to grasp the genuine potential to achieve exports. We are now considering export issues early in our acquisition process and aim to identify how early adjustments can be made to our own procurement programme to improve export prospects. We will utilise modular design opportunities to provide enhanced flexibility to both the company and customer by considering differing capability requirements.</p>
	<p pid="d.596W.8/3">We continue to support industry through responsible exports consistent with maintaining the effectiveness of the UK's strategic export controls. The first duty of the Government is to safeguard our national security and support for our troops. Effective strategic export controls are essential in fulfilling that commitment, and as such, we will retain an appropriate export licensing process.</p>

Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice the MOD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trades unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity, and health and safety. The MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>

	<p pid="d.604W.12/1">The Environment Agency is committed to deliver real term efficiency savings of at least 15% in procurement over the spending review period. In real terms, 15% efficiency savings in flood and coastal risk management procurement is equivalent to delivering an average of 2% more in terms of outcomes, each and every year, between now and 2015.</p>
	<p pid="d.604W.12/2">The Environment Agency is developing a new procurement strategy which will set out how these savings will be achieved. Its main contractual frameworks are due for renewal, and these present an opportunity to increasingly move towards a delivery model that commissions segments of capital and asset maintenance work to clearly defined service levels and outcomes.</p>

HEFCE-funded student places are allocated in full-time equivalent terms with the mix of students between full-time and part-time courses being an institutional decision. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will receive its annual grant letter for 2011-12 by January 2011. It will set out the number of funded places for that year. Plans for the longer term will be set out in the Higher Education White Paper this winter.

	<p pid="d.630W.5/1">The Cancer Reform Strategy included the commitment that the NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) would be extended to women aged 47 to 73. In June this year, we confirmed in the &quot;Revision to the NHS Operating Framework 2010-11&quot; that all local breast screening programmes should begin the extension in 2010-11. Based on the latest information, 14 of 82 local screening programmes have extended.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.5/2">Women over the age of 70 can request free three-yearly screening and should receive the leaflet &quot;Over 70? You are still entitled to breast screening&quot; to advise them of this fact when they leave the NHS BSP. NHS Cancer Screening Programmes has commissioned research to examine if more can be done to raise awareness of this right.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.5/3">The extension of breast cancer screening includes inviting women age 47-49, which will guarantee every woman her first breast screening invitation by the time she is 50. NHS BSP has undertaken research into screening women under 50. This research, the 'Age Trial' began in 1991, screening women from the age of 40 and 41. The results, published in December 2006, did not suggest that screening from this age would have a significant impact on the number of deaths from breast cancer. The women who participated in this trial continue to be followed up.</p>

	<p pid="d.633W.2/1">The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS' refers to creation of a NHS Commissioning Board and a new Public Health Service, to integrate and streamline existing health improvement. The NHS Commissioning Board will take on responsibility for commissioning national health service primary dental services, whilst the primary care trusts' (PCTs) responsibilities for local health improvement will transfer to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.633W.2/2">Local authorities will employ the Director of Public Health jointly appointed with the Public Health Service. To discharge their functions and responsibilities, both the Public Health Service in local authorities and dental service commissioners will need appropriate advice and input from dental public health consultants, dental practice advisers and their teams, working with local clinicians.</p>
	<p pid="d.633W.2/3">There have been no direct discussions between Ministers and the United Kingdom consultants in dental public health group but departmental officials have met with the group on a regular basis. The group has also formally responded to the White Paper consultation and their views will be taken in to consideration.</p>
	<p pid="d.633W.2/4">The 'Improving oral health and dental outcomes: Developing the dental public health workforce in England' report recommends a half time appointment for a consultant in dental public health and two sessions per week for a dental practice adviser as best practice within each organisation PCTs. In light of the White Paper proposals, we may need to reconsider estimates once the new commissioning arrangements become clear.</p>

About 140 new psychological therapy services are now up and running around the country and by March 2011 60% of primary care trusts will have an improving access to psychological therapies service, meaning many more people suffering from depression will be seen in these services.</p>

Together with an ambitious programme on efficiency, releasing up to &#163;20 billion of annual efficiency savings over the next four years, this funding will enable the national health service to meet rising demands while improving outcomes. Primary care trusts will be able to prioritise spending to support particular groups according to local need, including carers and disabled people.</p>

The NHS will also have greater local democratic legitimacy through a new role for local authorities in promoting integration between local NHS services, social care and health improvement.</p>

			<tr pid="d.641W.0/152"> <td colspan="2"><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br/> A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> 2. Method of Admission<br/> We have defined non-elective admissions by the following admission method codes:<br/> 21: Emergency-via A and E services, including casualty department of provider<br/> 22: Emergency-via General Practitioner (GP)<br/> 23: Emergency-via Bed Bureau, including Central Bureau<br/> 24: Emergency-via consultant out-patient clinic<br/> 28: Emergency-other means, including patients who arrive via A and E department of another HC provider<br/> 31: Maternity-where baby was delivered after mother's admission<br/> 32: Maternity-where baby was delivered before mother's admission<br/> 81: Transfer of any admitted patient from another hospital provider<br/> 82: Other-babies born in HC provider<br/> 83: Other-babies born outside HC provider, except when born at home as intended<br/> 98: Not applicable (e.g. other maternity event)<br/> 99: Not known<br/> 3. Main procedure<br/> The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (e.g. time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures.<br/> 4. Consultant Main Specialty<br/> The specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Take care when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as &quot;acute&quot;). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information.<br/> Main speciality of obstetrics<br/> 501-Obstetrics for patients using a hospital bed or delivery facilities<br/> 5. Hospital Provider<br/> A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, this data is quoted separately. In these cases, '-X' is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of dataflows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using these data as the counts Small numbers<br/> To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced.<br/> Data quality<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.649W.9/2">The Organ Donation Taskforce believed that by implementing the recommendations in their report &quot;Organs for Transplant&quot; published in January 2008, organ donor rates can increase by 50% by 2013 which would enable around 1,200 extra transplants every year.</p>
	<p pid="d.649W.9/3">Steady improvement is being made. During 2009-10, organ donor rates increased to nearly 20% over the baseline year of 2007-08. Our aim is to see organ donor rates continue to rise this year allowing many more people to benefit from a life saving or life enhancing transplant.</p>

The report will be published in the winter.</p>
	<p pid="d.652W.5/3">The NCEI report identified the need for further research around age inequalities in three areas: firstly, to look at why the reduction in mortality in older people is slower than for younger people and slower compared to other countries; secondly, to examine to what extent poor patient health and patient choice contribute to poorer outcomes; and finally, to look at how effective pre-treatment health assessments would be in reducing adverse outcomes in health inequalities.</p>

	<p pid="d.652W.5/5">The Department is working with Macmillan Cancer Support on a jointly funded project that aims to improve appropriate intervention rates for people over 70 who have a cancer diagnosis. The pilot programme aims to identify, test and evaluate ways to assess an older person for cancer treatment; to provide practical support and information to aid patient/practitioner decision making; and to train professionals involved in the pathway to promote age equality and address age discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="d.652W.5/6">It is anticipated that the pilot projects will run for a 12 month period with the pilots taking place between May 2011 and April 2012. We will then evaluate whether the approaches tested can have a positive impact on intervention and mortality rates for older people.</p>

	<p pid="d.656W.6/1">Intensive physiological monitoring in the early phase of a stroke is important in identifying and supporting early treatment that can halt stroke progression and minimise the degree of brain damage. All acute stroke units should provide high-dependency care including physiological monitoring. The National Stroke Strategy and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence quality standard set out the elements of high quality care. It is for the national health service to ensure that these standards are met, including provision of access to good stroke care out of hours and at week ends. Support is available to implement improvements to acute care from the Stroke Improvement Programme and the stroke networks.</p>

Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer included in admitted patient HES data.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

The relevant Government Departments will now be taking forward the implementation and roll-out of these proposals. For example HMRC have already this October stopped issuing replacement national insurance cards and have said that from 2011 they will be issuing all national insurance numbers to people by letter rather than providing a plastic card, saving the Government up to &#163;1 million a year in upfront costs.</p>
