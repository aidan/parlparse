	<p pid="a.715W.9/2">EU air quality limits are already met across 99 per cent. of the UK (land area). For the very small parts of the country where limit values are not yet met, including London, roadside locations present the greatest challenge. The UK, like most other member states is using the provisions in EU legislation to secure from the European Commission additional time to meet the limit values for both particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. If successful these would extend the compliance deadlines to 2011 for particulate matter and to 2015 for nitrogen dioxide.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.9/3">The Government submitted in April their application for particulate matter:</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.9/5">and is working with the Mayor of London and relevant local authorities with a view to consulting on the application for nitrogen dioxide early in 2010. Applications need to set out the measures that will be taken to meet the limit values by the extended deadlines. The additional time will allow current and planned measures to take effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.9/6">EU target values for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons do not come into force until 2012. In 2008 all monitoring sites at roadside locations exhibited concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon below the target value. Measures to reduce emissions from traffic source will continue to reduce concentrations at urban sites.</p>

Most recently, the TB Eradication Group was set up in November 2008 to make recommendations to the Secretary of State for developing a plan for reducing bovine TB in all parts of England, including Devon, with the ultimate objective of moving towards eventual eradication.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/2">We are also actively pursuing the future use of vaccination of cattle and wildlife, through vaccine research, and the Badger Vaccine Deployment Project (BVDP), alongside our current control measures. Two of the areas for the BVDP are in Devon and the aim is that the vaccination of badgers will commence in summer 2010 and take place for at least five years in each area.</p>

The project will be fully rolled out, in all the areas, by the third year (i.e. all areas will have been vaccinated by 2012). Once this initial phase has been completed vaccination across 100 per cent. of the areas will continue each year and each area will be vaccinated for at least five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.719W.8/1">The Badger Vaccine Deployment Project aims to increase farmer confidence in TB vaccines and develop practical know-how for vaccinating badgers, including how best to deploy vaccines in an area and developing an understanding of training needs and costs. To this end, we will be monitoring levels of take up among farmers and contractors, and training will be assessed and monitored throughout the project. We will also build up an understanding of the costs of injectable badger vaccination. This information will inform plans for future use of both injectable and oral badger vaccines for bovine TB. Possible further measures of success are currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/2">The Badger Vaccine Deployment Project is not a scientific trial, but a practical project to develop know how for vaccinating badgers. The project will target cattle farming areas of up to 100km<sup>(2)</sup> (25,000 acres) in each of the six high incidence TB areas for five years vaccination. While the project will be unable to demonstrate a treatment effect of the vaccine in cattle herds, an exploratory analysis of routinely collected cattle disease data will be carried out at the end of the project and independent expert statistical advice has been taken to ensure the project design gives a good chance of detecting any changes in cattle TB trends that may be associated with vaccination. We expect landowner participation in the project to be at least 70 per cent. within the 300km<sup>(2)</sup> catchment areas, which will enable us to reach our 100km<sup>(2)</sup> target in each area. Social science research looking at changes in farmers' attitudes to vaccination and factors that influence farmer behaviour can provide meaningful results on a smaller scale. The project design has also been discussed and agreed with the TB Science Advisory Body, along with two of its subgroups dealing specifically with TB vaccines and economics and social science, key farming and veterinary stakeholders and the TB Eradication Group for England.</p>

It is not necessary to trap and vaccinate every individual in a population or to prevent the entry of unvaccinated ones to control a disease. This is because as the proportion of immunised individuals increases, the risk to all individuals, whether vaccinated or not, decreases. The stable social structure of undisturbed badger populations, where there is little mixing of individuals between social groups, lends itself to the generation of this 'herd immunity' through vaccination.</p>

Regulations should be risk based, proportionate and well designed, so as to achieve their objectives while also keeping costs to a minimum.

At the end of March 2009, net lending to agriculture, forestry and hunting in the UK stood at just below &pound;11 billion. This was more than &pound;900 million higher than at the same point in 2008 and some &pound;280 million above the level recorded at the end of 2008. There is strong evidence that the banking sector is continuing to lend to farm businesses with sound business cases but DEFRA will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.14/1">DEFRA does not hold the specific estimates requested. The most recent data available which can be used to estimate the carbon emissions of outdoor patio heaters are from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.14/2">In spring 2007, the Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) produced a briefing note (BNDH18) intended to estimate the CO2 emissions as a result of the use of patio heaters. This note estimated that 'outdoor heaters' (both domestic and non-domestic) accounted for around 94.9 GWh of energy being consumed annually, equivalent to 22.2 ktCO2 (thousand tonnes of CO2).</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.14/3">In October 2007, the MTP updated the assumptions in the original study to estimate CO2 emissions from patio heaters as a result of the smoking ban. The report estimated that the annual emissions from patio heaters as a result of the smoking ban would be between 96 and 282 kt CO2, depending on the type of heaters and how they were used.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.14/4">The MTP estimates are not derived from surveys or detailed research, and should not be interpreted as accurate data on energy consumption and carbon emissions. I am unable to give a prediction of future emissions as we have no way to estimate future sales of patio heaters.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.11/1">The Environment Agency's National Incident Recording System (NIRS) records all pollution incidents reported to the Agency since 2001. The Environment Agency does not classify such incidents as point or diffuse pollution. An approximation of the number of &quot;diffuse incidents&quot; can be derived from NIRS by counting incidents that arose from an unregulated site where the cause was not identified. Data are available and provided on this basis for full calendar years from 2001 until 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.11/2">For prosecution and fines there is often a time lag between the incident being reported and the completion of any enforcement action. Yearly figures in this table therefore may relate to incidents which occurred in the previous year or earlier. This is why some prosecutions have been prosecuted and reported in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.739W.2/2" class="indent">(1) The common is small and heavily used by the public, and so does not support a rich mammal fauna, though both bats and badgers do occur;</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.8/1">The notified special interest features of Thundersley Common Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) are its dry heath, wet heath and acid grassland plant communities. It is one of the best remaining fragments of heathland in Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.8/2">Natural England's records show that five oak trees, and one birch, have been removed from Thundersley Great Common SSSI since 2004. These trees were felled during the 2008-9 winter by Castle Point borough council with the assent and support of Natural England. The work was done as part of a higher level stewardship agreement to restore the special interest features of the SSSI&mdash;namely its rare heathland habitats&mdash;to favourable condition. Some tree removal is essential as part of this restoration work because many oaks became established on the heathland in the second half of the last century when the site was less actively managed. There are now over 100 trees on the northern half of the SSSI which are rapidly shading out the remaining patches of heathland vegetation. If these are all left to mature a large part of the SSSI will soon be dense woodland and the heathland will be lost.</p>

These entitlements are unaffected by the Department's new probationary policy, which applies only to the central Department and not its agencies. In practical terms, new employees are unlikely to be taking maternity leave during their probationary period. If, however, the situation did arise, the employee would be entitled to take maternity leave in accordance with the maternity leave provisions in the staff handbook. In such a case, the employee's probationary period would be frozen and recommenced upon the employee's return from maternity leave.</p>

While the Government recognise the impact of higher fuel prices on those living in island communities in Scotland and in other rural areas across the UK, such prices are set by fuel producers and suppliers as a result of their commercial judgments, driven by market forces. OFT reports have repeatedly shown that markets are functioning properly in rural areas such as North West Scotland and the Scottish islands, but any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour on the part of fuel sellers can of course be brought to their attention.</p>

We understand that CGA Strategy, the pub and drinks market analyst, which tracks the pub closure rate on behalf of the British Beer and Pub Association, currently estimates that between 51 and 53 pubs a week are closing.

	<p pid="a.798W.8/1">In partnership with other Government Departments, the tourism industry and the wider public sector, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has a clear and coherent policy framework for industry growth. This includes branding and marketing improvement led by VisitBritain; the National Tourism Skills Strategy; and work across Britain on driving up product quality through the accommodation grading schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.8/2">Central Government are committed to providing &pound;130 million between 2008 and 2012 for marketing Britain overseas and England to the British. In addition, between &pound;3.3 million and &pound;3.5 million is provided annually to the Regional Development Agencies for tourism support. In addition to this, Government have committed &pound;350 million to helping small businesses get the training they need to get through the economic downturn. This investment is across the economy but we encourage small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism industry to take full advantage of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.8/3">Specifically, in recent months VisitBritain has emphasised its &quot;Value Britain&quot; message, which aims to impress on potential overseas visitors the wide range of affordable accommodation, transport and attractions available in Britain. VisitEngland has also launched its &quot;Enjoy Every Minute, Enjoy England&quot; campaign, designed to inspire and stimulate consumers to take day visits, short breaks and holidays in England this year based on the range of experiences, fantastic quality and value on offer.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.13/1">The Department has contracted with the organisation Together for Disabled Children (TDC) to support local authorities and Primary Care Trusts in improving short break services.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.13/2">Early in 2008 The Department asked those local authorities that fell outside of short break pathfinder areas to undertake preparatory work on short break service reform, ahead of receipt of major new funding from April 2009. Nine criteria were set against which robust preparation could be measured.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.13/3">TDC inform us that by March 2009, 15 authorities had met six, seven or eight of the criteria, these were: Brent, Hackney, Havering, Hounslow, Kingston upon Thames, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Darlington, Northumberland, Redcar and Cleveland, St. Helens, Warrington, Southampton, Kirklees, Wiltshire</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.13/4">Three non-pathfinder local authorities had met less than six criteria, these were: City of London, Oldham, Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.13/5">The remaining 111 non-pathfinders authorities met all the criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.13/6">TDC also report that as of the end of June 2009, 122 of the 129 non-pathfinder areas had met all nine criteria, a further six had met eight criteria, while one authority had yet to meet four criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.13/7">The short break national programme has now moved beyond the preparation stage and all areas have received short break funding. Readiness criteria are not being applied to the 2010-11 financial year, however TDC continue to concentrate their resource on those authorities where progress is slowest, and are providing remedial support where readiness criteria remain unmet.</p>

	<p pid="a.802W.2/1">For most young people, eligibility for education maintenance allowance (EMA) is subject to an assessment of their household income based on the financial year prior to the academic year in which they start their course. A successful assessment provides a young person with a guaranteed entitlement of up to three years of EMA on the same rate regardless of whether their income increases. If there is a drop in income from one year to the next then a young person may apply to be reassessed for the subsequent academic year. They could be assessed as eligible for EMA where they were not previously, or an increased rate of it. They would receive the EMA guarantee based on the rate awarded following the most recent assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/2">There are a limited number of exceptional circumstances in which a young person may apply to be reassessed for EMA during the academic year. Those circumstances are:</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/3" class="indent">(i) someone whose income was taken into account in determining financial eligibility has died;</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) a person whose income was taken into account in determining financial eligibility has experienced a reduction in income due to their own disability, or the disability of any other person for whom he or she has responsibility as primary carer (disability means as defined in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995);</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Since the assessment of income was made, the young person has become estranged from their parents, guardians or someone else whose income was taken into account in determining financial eligibility;</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) The young person has become a parent with responsibility for their own child.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/7">The financial needs of young people can be affected by a range of circumstances, including reductions in household income due to redundancy, or reduced working hours. Other mechanisms exist to help with the costs of supporting young people aged 16 to 19 in learning. Child Benefit provides support for parents regardless of income, and Tax Credits are designed to tailor support to current circumstances and to be responsive to changing needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.802W.2/8">In addition to the support provided to families, discretionary learner support funds are made available via the Learning and Skills Council to colleges and Local Authorities. This funding is provided to enable schools and colleges, using their discretion, to help individual learners facing hardship and financial barriers to learning that are not addressed through other mechanisms. This funding can be used to respond to any hardship needs of learners that may arise through sudden changes in circumstance.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.2/1">The Government are committed to every school providing access to a core offer of extended services and has provided significant funding to support the delivery of extended services, including committing over &pound;1 billion in the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Funding is allocated to local authorities. DCSF guidance states that local authorities should work closely with their schools and other children's service partners through the children's trust to develop and agree strategic plans for using the extended services funding. Local authorities are strongly encouraged to devolve as much of their extended schools funding to schools as possible. In determining allocations, local authorities are encouraged to consider the needs and context of schools and their population, including levels of deprivation, of which free school meals is one of the indicators. DCSF guidance also states that extended activities and services will be of particular benefit to disabled children and young people and those with special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.2/2">As part of this funding, there is over &pound;200 million of extended services subsidy. This is focused on supporting the access to extra-curricular activities by disadvantaged children, including children eligible for free school meals (FSM). The DCSF has issued the message to local authorities that all subsidy funding is to be passed to schools to help increase the level of participation for those children. The DCSF has, working with the Council for Disabled Children, issued guidance: &quot;Extending Inclusion&mdash;Access for disabled children and young people to extended schools and children's centres: a development manual&quot;, emphasising the importance of making extended services accessible to all children.

	<p pid="a.805W.6/1">Mr. Smith was convicted of attempting to abduct a child and was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. Section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 empowers the Attorney-General to refer certain sentences to the Court of Appeal for review. The offence of child abduction is not an offence to which section 36 applies and the Attorney-General could not therefore consider referring the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.805W.10/1">Following Second Reading of the Equality Bill, interested organisations raised concerns that, as drafted, the Bill reduced the existing protection against discrimination for pregnant women and new mothers. This drew our attention to an unintended consequence of the drafting which would have potentially allowed discrimination against pregnant women or new mothers if this could be shown to be reasonable. Therefore on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-09">9 June</phrase>, we tabled amendments to the Bill which represent a return to the level of protection given against pregnancy and maternity discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (as amended). These amendments were briefly debated on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-16">16 June</phrase> and agreed, and now stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.805W.10/2">The Bill makes absolutely clear that breastfeeding mothers are protected from sex discrimination in relation to provision of services to the public, whatever their baby's age. So a woman who is breastfeeding her baby in a restaurant or on a bus cannot lawfully be asked to leave, or get off, for that reason. At present we have no plans to bring forward proposals to provide a legal right for women to breastfeed in public places.</p>

	<p pid="a.814W.0/2">The investment in social rented homes forms part of the National Affordable Housing Programme and is reported as part of that programme. Information on spending for new affordable housing is published in HCA's Annual Report and Accounts. The money for decent homes has been allocated directly to local authorities as part of the overall Decent Homes programme and is not reported on separately. &pound;162 million of the &pound;175 million for major repairs has been allocated to 39 local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.0/3">A large number of our programmes are aimed at reducing the number of people in temporary accommodation. Over the past year those households placed in temporary accommodation has reduced by 17 per cent. to 64,000 from a peak of 101,000 in December 2004 (as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.0/4">The regeneration funding was intended for 2009-10. As sponsor Department for the regional development agencies, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills leads on the monitoring of the &pound;100 million reprioritised for critical regeneration projects with relevant projects due to begin work in the autumn. The HCA are due to begin investment of the &pound;80 million allocated to them shortly, with work beginning on relevant priority projects during the autumn/winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.0/5">Because these schemes represent elements of wider programmes with established reporting mechanisms, monthly breakdowns of spend are not available.</p>

The improved delivery of services through local strategic partnerships and local area agreements has been further developed by provisions within the Local Government and Public involvement in Health Act 2007, and its success is being measured both through the new comprehensive area assessment and through evidence including the Citizenship Survey and Place Survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.828W.5/19">Landlord statistical returns show that the 18 per cent. of the social housing stock is non-decent compared to 38 per cent. in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.5/20">The cost per house of meeting the decent homes standard varies across the country and the Department does not collect that information. Some landlords are refurbishing the houses in their area above the decent homes standard. Any higher local standard, and how that is to be achieved, will be determined by local circumstances and the level of resources that can be delivered into the programme locally. The Government expect over &pound;40 billion to have been spent on refurbishing council houses by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.10/5" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission retains the power to pursue a non-resident parent who moves overseas, but only where the non-resident is regarded as being habitually resident in the UK. The criteria for establishing jurisdiction when a non-resident parent leaves the United Kingdom is described at Section 44 of the Child Support Act. There is no distinction made between an EU state and a non-EU state.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.10/6" class="indent">There are certain cases where the nature of employment will bring the non-resident parent under the jurisdiction of the Commission, for example those employed in the Civil Service or a member of the naval, military or air forces. The Commission may also have jurisdiction where a non-resident parent is employed by a company that is prescribed in Child Support (Maintenance Arrangement and Jurisdiction Regulations) 1992, Regulation 7A(2).</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.10/7" class="indent">The Ministry of Justice, however operates a system for administering international child and spousal maintenance cases where the non-resident parent can not be treated as habitually resident in the UK; this is known as the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO).</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.10/8" class="indent">Where a parent with care applies to their local magistrates' court or family proceedings court, details of the maintenance liability can be referred to the foreign jurisdiction - where the non-resident parent now resides - whom will be able to apply their domestic collection and enforcement mechanisms in order to recover the amount due. They will then refer this money back to the UK REMO administrators.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.10/9" class="indent">The UK has reciprocal maintenance agreements with over 100 states and territories.</p>

	<p pid="a.830W.2/7" class="indent">It should be noted that the current statutory maintenance scheme defines a shared care arrangement as one where a qualifying child spends at least 52 nights per year with the non-resident parent. However the original statutory maintenance scheme defined a shared care arrangement as one where the qualifying child spends two days or more per week with the non resident parent. The figure quoted above is based on these definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.2/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.834W.6/1">The Budget announced a Young Person's Guarantee; a guaranteed offer of a job, work experience placement or training for all jobseeker's allowance customers approaching 12 months of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.6/2">The Community Task Force is the work experience element of the Young Person's Guarantee. It will offer work-focused placements of benefit to the community, designed to move customers closer to the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.6/3">When the Young Person's Guarantee is introduced in January 2010, the Community Task Force will be offered on a voluntary basis to all customers not taking up another element of the guarantee. It is expected to become mandatory for all customers who do not take up another element from spring 2010. Placements will last up to six months while the scheme is voluntary, and three months when it becomes mandatory, with the option in the latter case for young people to stay on for a further three months on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.6/4">The Department for Work and Pensions will be contracting with external providers to provide these placements. The Community Task Force will use a standard funding model, comprising a service fee and outcome payment. The outcome payment will be paid to the provider when a customer finds sustained, paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.6/5">Customers taking part in the Community Task Force will be paid a training allowance, rather than jobseeker's allowance. However, they will still be expected to be actively looking for work and to leave the programme if they find paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.6/6">Funding for the Community Task Force is included in the Young Person's Guarantee funding and is not available as a separate figure. The budget for the Young Person's Guarantee is approximately &pound;250 million for 2009-10 and &pound;838 million for 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="a.838W.5/1">The Future Jobs Fund is a fund of around &pound;1 billion to support the creation of jobs for long-term unemployed young people and others who face significant disadvantage in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.5/2">Bids for funding can come from anyone, but we have a strong preference for partnership bids. We expect the majority of bids to the Future Jobs Fund to be led by local authorities, sub-regional, city region and local partnerships, or by national or local public sector and third sector bodies. We published the invitation to bid on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-13">13 May</phrase>, and had received over 200 bids by <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June</phrase>, which we are currently assessing. Up-to-date guidance on how to bid is available from the Future Jobs Fund website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.838W.5/4">We expect that in most cases eligible candidates will be referred to employers by Jobcentre Plus. In some cases individuals may self-present to the employer, or may be identified by them directly. In these situations, Jobcentre Plus will need to confirm an individual's eligibility. Future Jobs Fund employers will be encouraged to sign a local employment partnership with Jobcentre Plus.</p>

	<p pid="a.841W.2/1">We have not placed any paid-for advertisements in the last 12 months. We have, however, produced 500 posters to publicise the new entitlement to industrial injuries disablement benefit for miners with osteoarthritis of the knee.

	<p pid="a.842W.0/4" class="indent">Regular face-to-face contact with people is the most effective method of helping them find work quickly, and ensuring they remain entitled to payment of benefit by demonstrating they are actively seeking work. People claiming Jobseeker's Allowance are therefore usually required to attend their nearest Jobcentre for regular jobsearch reviews and more in-depth interviews with a personal adviser if they do not find work quickly. Where someone is undertaking part-time work we will make every effort to make alternative arrangements to accommodate their part time working patterns. We will, however, ensure that the guidance is clarified in this respect.</p>

	<p pid="a.842W.6/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking: whether her Department consulted disability organisations prior to the most recent programme of refurbishment to Jobcentre Plus offices and whether the tendering contract for the most recent refurbishment to the Jobcentre Plus offices stipulated the provision of accessible seating in Jobcentre Plus offices. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/5" class="indent">During the programme to roll out Jobcentre Plus offices, in the period 2002 to 2006, Jobcentre Plus worked in partnership with the Department's Diversity and Equality specialist, to ensure the changes met the needs of all our customers. The Jobcentre Plus Project developed a Jobcentre Plus Environmental Guide (JPEG) in association with the project architects which referenced all relevant external legislation including the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). DDA requires all providers of public services to ensure that services to customers can be accessed by all, whether that is in regard to the physical office environments or by other means. The JPEG was reviewed throughout the rollout programme to ensure compliance with the Act. This was reflected both in the standards and specifications deployed in the physical refurbishment of our offices and in the design of specific components.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/6" class="indent">The tendering exercise for the national roll out of Jobcentre Plus offices between 2002 and 2006 identified a range of customer seating which complied with statutory requirements. The scope of the tenders included a range of design options that took account of our business-related Health and Safety considerations and also met key customer needs such as comfort, visibility and ease of use. Consultation with the Department's Diversity and Equality specialists provided Jobcentre Plus with assurances that the broadest range of customer requirements would be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/7" class="indent">As part of the planning for delivery of services through the new Jobcentre Plus network, each District drew up a local service delivery plan which was the subject of consultation with a range of local stakeholders, including customer representatives. Customer Service Directors have recently been asked to review their existing service delivery arrangements in meeting the challenge of the current economic climate, taking account of the planned welfare reform changes for the next two to three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/8" class="indent">This exercise has identified that a number of Jobcentre Plus offices currently face capacity pressures. These pressures will be met through a range of solutions. This includes making our services more accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners' premises. We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally, including some offices opening to the public on Saturday. In the light of the increase in customer demand we have embarked on a programme to convert or extend our existing buildings where necessary, deploying existing components including similar seating to that already installed as part of the 2002-2006 roll out of Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/9" class="indent">However, we will only acquire new space where all other measures are insufficient.</p>

Interpretation of these data need to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br/> 2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br/> 3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (that is, excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural time lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 4. Data are unrounded.<br/> 5. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) have been available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System.</td> </tr>

However, a &pound;10 disregard is applied to payments of War Disablement Pension, War Widow's Pension and their replacement under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme when calculating a person's entitlement to these benefits. This disregard, which gives war pensioners an advantage over other groups, is made in recognition of the special nature of these payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.856W.5/5">In addition to the statutory disregards mentioned, local authorities, who administer housing benefit and council tax benefit, have discretion to disregard all or part of a War Pension over and above the statutory &pound;10 disregard. The cost of any further disregard is met by the local authority, not by central Government. It is, therefore, for each local authority to decide whether a higher disregard should apply.</p>

	<p pid="a.866W.2/2">Helicopters and crews from all three services continue to serve with distinction in Afghanistan. We have already deployed to Afghanistan the maximum number of helicopters that are both properly equipped for the challenges of the operational theatre, and that we can sustain on an enduring basis. While it would be possible to surge additional helicopters into theatre on a temporary basis, this would be unsustainable over time and would severely impact upon the achievement of harmony guidelines for helicopter air and ground crews and training of new and existing crews. We are working hard to increase the number of deployed helicopters but we need to do so sustainably. That is why we have been investing in additional aircraft and crews, logistics and infrastructure, as well undertaking significant modifications to our existing helicopter fleet to enhance their capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.866W.2/3">Helicopter capability is measured by flying hours rather than airframe numbers. The helicopter fleet is managed to ensure that our operational and other commitments are met, including an 84 per cent. increase in flying hours in Afghanistan between November 2006 and April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.868W.6/22">Typically we achieve a decision as to which path the patient will follow, either to surgery or straight to physiotherapy/rehabilitation within 10-20 days of injury. Those needing only physiotherapy/rehabilitation treatment (the majority) are referred directly for treatment in one of the RRUs. Typically, these patients will start physiotherapy within four to six weeks of the decision on their treatment path.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.6/23">Patients requiring physiotherapy following fast track surgery will receive this either at a local MOD Primary Care Rehabilitation Facility (PCRF) or by referral back to an RRU. This will usually commence within two weeks of surgery, depending upon the patient's individual and geographic circumstances. No strict measure of waiting times are taken, as each patient's care pathway is individually managed and co-ordinated by the referring RRU, and timescales will depend on continuing assessment and surgical outcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.870W.2/1">The roll-out of the Defence Medical Information Capability Programme (DMICP) is being undertaken in three parts, to fixed permanent defence medical facilities; to deployed defence medical facilities; and to enable information exchange with the NHS. The first part of the roll-out is now drawing to a close. The list of medical centres where DMICP is already in use and a list of the expected dates of implementation of DMICP in medical centres, where it is not yet in use will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/2">The second part of the roll-out is to cover deployed operational and maritime units. It is expected to start in September 2009 with field trials and pilot sites, with the main roll-out due to begin in January 2010. The deployed roll-out is expected to complete by December 2010, subject to any necessary rescheduling for operational reasons, ship upkeep and maintenance periods, and to reflect lessons learned from earlier phases.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/3">Services to deliver the third part of the roll-out&mdash;the interface between DMICP and the NHS National Programme for IT (NPfIT)&mdash;will be introduced in a phased manner beginning later this year and are expected to be completed by the end of 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/4">Although NPfIT does not extend to the NHS in the devolved Administrations, we are in contact with their health officials so that as far as possible the same benefits, in terms of speedy and accurate exchange of data, will be available to defence patients and medical staff in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland over the same period.</p>

Responsibility for their individual management is shared between the single service commands, and it is not possible to separate out costs from overall unit medical budgets. Each service funds its respective DCMHs differently, with funding provision coming from a number of areas. Due to the number of budgets to which costs would be attributable, any detailed study of DCMH finances would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.876W.2/19">With the introduction of Typhoon we are bringing into service a state of the art multi-role weapons system, suitable and adaptable to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It is in certain key aspects already a significantly more capable platform than the aircraft it replaced and it continues to develop and improve. Typhoon requires only a one-person crew rather than a two-person crew like the Tornado F3, which is being phased out. Additionally, as the 2004 Defence White Paper &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot; made clear, &quot;the effectiveness of modern precision weapons and sensors, which can be used in all weathers, day and night, mean that highly accurate air delivered offensive effects can be achieved with fewer fast jets than before... Similarly the air threat to deployed forces has greatly reduced and the capability of our air superiority aircraft and other air defence assets is continuing to improve. So we need fewer aircraft and fewer ground-based air defence systems to meet the threat.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.2/20">The number of fast-jet aircrew completing training is sufficient to meet training requirements, and aircrew training for Typhoon is planned to increase over the next few years as the aircraft comes into wider service. Under current plans, by 2014-15 there will be an annual requirement for 16 newly qualified Typhoon pilots each year, to support a requirement for 92 front-line Typhoon pilots within a total force of 122 pilots.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.3/1">The current economic and financial situation has given rise to a huge increase in the volume of correspondence received over the last 12 months in particular. There has been an increase of over 100 per cent. in Members' correspondence over the previous 12-month period, creating a considerable backlog, which HM Treasury is in the process of clearing. The hon. Member's correspondence was unfortunately part of that backlog and we apologise for the delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.900W.2/1">Prior to 2005 when the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise merged to form HM Revenue AND Customs (HMRC) S.20 Notices under the Taxes Management Act were regularly sought by the Inland Revenue Inspectors of Taxes on a case by case basis and could be issued from any tax office and a copy retained in individual taxpayers folders. There was no form of central record of the issue of S.20 Notices and the type of information requested. It is therefore not possible to provide this information for this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.2/2">In February 2006 the HMRC Single Point of Contact (SpoC) for the acquisition and disclosure of communications data was designated as the National Telecoms Unit who are responsible for all departmental matters relating to communications data, including RIPA requests, witness statements and Production Orders. From 2006 onwards the HMRC SpoC has not issued any S.20 TMA Notices.</p>

	<p pid="a.904W.8/1">Local forces have responsibility for policing at the border. However, between 1998-99 and 2008-09 the Home Office contribution to these costs rose from &pound;121.4 million to &pound;222.4 million, an increase of 83.2 per cent. over this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.8/2">The costs of police at ports are met as part of the forces overall policing duties and the division of these funds is a matter for each force, in consultation with the police authority. In some cases, such as where an airport is &quot;designated&quot; under the Aviation Security Act 1982, contributions are provided by airport operators. Provisions included within the Police and Crime Bill currently being debated in the other place, include the requirement for all airports to provide such contributions. No central record is kept of these costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.8/3">In addition, between April 1998 and April 2009 the Home Office made a contribution to the costs of special branch officers at ports as a part of the dedicated security post grants. From April 2009 funding of these posts will be made as part of the wider funding of police counter terrorism activity. The overall level of the dedicated security post grants for the years it was allocated is detailed in the following table. For security reasons, we do not disclose the breakdown of this grant between different security functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.911W.3/1">Direct access to information on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is restricted to a limited number of designated personnel under the control of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), either directly, or under a contract awarded to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) for operation and maintenance of the NDNAD and development of its IT systems. Throughout the lifetime of the contract, the FSS are required to demonstrate compliance with specified security requirements. Police and law enforcement personnel do not have access to the information on the NDNAD, but receive reports from the NDNAD Delivery Unit of matches between DNA taken from crime scenes and that taken from individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/2">In relation to those NPIA and FSS staff, there has been one instance of unauthorised use of the database during the last five years. This involved a contractor working for the FSS who was found to have used an administrator account on the IT system rather than his own. Following an investigation by the NPIA, no evidence of any improper access to database records was found. However, as use of the administrator account was in contravention of security procedures, the individual was removed from further work on the database. No incidents of unauthorised or improper use of match reports by police and law enforcement personnel have been reported to the NDNAD in the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/3">Since the NDNAD was set up in 1995, two instances of loss of data have been reported. These took place in February 2009 when the FSS faxed DNA reports intended for two police forces to incorrect fax numbers. In both instances, the faxes were either retrieved by the police or destroyed within 36 hours of the event. A thorough investigation was undertaken by the NPIA and reported to the Home Office. No evidence was found of any malicious intent by any individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/4">As a result of the investigation into this incident, an existing project to replace use of fax was accelerated. As from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-17">17 April 2009</phrase>, fax has no longer been used to transmit any DNA reports to forces. They are now sent in line with Cabinet Office guidance over a secure network either by email or as a web service on a secure network.</p>

	<p pid="a.912W.2/2">Requests for the release of data or samples relating to the DNA profiles held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) must be approved by the NDNAD Strategy Board. Requests are also considered by the NDNAD Ethics Group, which makes recommendations to the Board on whether the request should be approved. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) lays down that DNA samples and the profiles derived from them can only be used for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence, the conduct of a prosecution or, since April 2005, for the purposes of identifying a deceased person. In accordance with these requirements, the Board does not approve any research unless it has clear operational benefit to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.2/3">Details of requests from commercial organisations for data or samples relating to profiles held on the NDNAD which have been approved by the NDNAD Strategy Board in each of the last three years and in 2009 to date can be found in the following table. No requests from research organisations have been approved during this time. The information provided from the NDNAD was anonymised (i.e. no details enabling individuals to be identified were supplied to the commercial organisations).</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.0/1">It is very difficult to provide precise figures for the proportion of UK legislation that stems from the European Union and the consequent cost. All proposals for EU legislation are, however, deposited with Parliament with an assessment of any legislative changes that would be required to implement them in the UK and an explanation of the HMG policy in the area concerned, including in the case of proposals on migration and asylum, by choosing not to opt in to them where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.920W.0/2">The origins of a regulation could be a devolved Administration or a local authority, as well as the Government or the EU. All regulations, irrespective of their origins, should comply with the principles of better regulation. Regulations should be risk based, proportionate and well designed, so as to achieve their objectives whilst also keeping costs to a minimum. The Government continue to work with European partners to ensure that EU regulations meet these standards.</p>

Their conclusion is that they can service demand, within contractually binding response times, from a reduced number of laboratories. Closure of the Chorley site is currently only a proposal, to be tested and challenged through the consultation process.</p>

Deloitte has also been the FSS pension advisers for some time. FSS have used a number of specialist providers in a smaller way to support the design of the business transformation programme. The transformation team itself has also been staffed by a number of agency and interim specialists to work alongside and train in-house resources (for example Lean Sigma training). Some components of the transformation (e.g. IT enabling projects) will involve the engagement of a number of our existing external service support providers (e.g. Cap Gemini), but these companies are not involved in the provision of broader consultancy services.</p>

This will allow police officers to concentrate their efforts on fighting crime and being more visible.</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/2">The decision to discontinue the measure is based on the maturing relationship which exists between the police service and the Home Office around performance management. Over time a performance management culture has been embedded, and following the success that forces have had in reducing crime and the move to one centrally set target around public confidence, we believe that this approach is the right one.</p>

We continue to urge the Saudis to respect freedom of religion and to honour article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is done at ministerial, ambassadorial and official level.</p>
	<p pid="a.954W.5/4">In February 2009 the UN UPR reviewed human rights in Saudi Arabia. The UK made a number of recommendations. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2008 Annual Human Rights report was launched by the Foreign Secretary. In the report we highlighted that &quot;the public practice of any religion other than Islam remains banned. Renouncing religious belief in Islam is an offence punishable by death&quot;. Our embassy last raised Freedom of Expression with the Saudi Government in Riyadh on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-13">13 July 2009</phrase>. We will continue to lobby on this and other important issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.954W.5/5">The security situation in Iraq shows continued signs of improvement, but violence does continue to affect many people, including Christians. The UK continues to encourage the Government of Iraq to protect all communities and to take tough action against those responsible for any acts of violence and intimidation regardless of political, ethnic or religious affiliation.</p>
	<p pid="a.954W.5/6">Promoting human rights is integral to building a stable democracy in Afghanistan. But after 30 years of conflict Afghanistan is starting from a low base. Poverty and weak state institutions are big contributors to human rights violations. Conservative cultural values often exacerbate the severe hardships many still face. We condemn all instances where individuals, including Christians, are persecuted because of their faith or belief and take every opportunity to urge Afghanistan to implement laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect. This includes full implementation of those norms laid out in the 1981 UN Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. Our embassy in Kabul continues to follow the human rights situation on the ground closely and raise matters of concern with the Afghan Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.954W.5/7">We recognise that the human rights situation in Somalia has been appalling for a very long time. The ongoing civil conflict has impacted adversely on all sections of society, but particularly on vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities including the small community of Christians. We continue to urge the Transitional Federal Government to combat human rights abuses as an important component of the Djibouti Process to restore peace and stability to the country. We support the mandate of the UN Independent Expert on Human Rights in Somalia and the work of human rights organisations to gather accurate information and evidence about the situation on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.956W.0/1">The Government remain deeply concerned by the increasing use of capital punishment in Iran, which has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the world. We regularly make representations to the Government of Iran, in our bilateral contacts and through the EU, to express general concern about the use of the death penalty in Iran and to raise individual execution cases.

	<p pid="a.956W.3/1">Iran's human rights record has continued to deteriorate throughout 2009. Even before the recent unrest we were particularly concerned by worrying signs of growing pressure on anyone with foreign contacts, including numerous arrests on counts of espionage and threatening national security. We are also witnessing an increasing use of the death penalty, and the continued practice of juvenile executions.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.3/2">The violence and brutality we witnessed in response to peaceful protests following the elections only served to compound the genuine concerns long held by the international community with regards to Iran's human rights record. In the aftermath of the elections we are concerned that large numbers of political opponents, students, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders have been arrested and remain in detention. We are concerned about the conditions under which they are being detained, and that they are being denied access to due legal process.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.3/3">We have repeatedly raised our concerns with the Iranian authorities regarding human rights violations and will continue to do so. The Iranian Government must heed strong calls from the international community and its own people to live up to its freely undertaken human rights commitments by respecting basic human rights and democratic freedoms.</p>

	<p pid="a.958W.5/1">In 2003 reports suggested that AQ Khan, who headed the Kahuta Nuclear Research Institute, supplied technology that could be used to make nuclear weapons to some of the countries mentioned. There is no evidence that Khan provided technology to Saudi Arabia. The UK played a leading role in Libya's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction in December 2003 and we support all the UN Security Council Resolutions in place with regards to Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>

	<p pid="a.959W.2/1">We are concerned about reports that members of the Christian community in Bahmani Wala, Pakistan have been attacked. The UK supports freedom of religion and condemns persecution because of faith or beliefs. Incidents such as the attack in Bahmani Wala are an example of the sectarian violence and violent extremism that feed the discrimination faced by religious minorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.2/2">With our EU partners, we regularly raise our concerns with the Government of Pakistan over the situation of religious minorities in Pakistan and we will continue to do so. The most recent EU demarche in December 2008 called upon the Government of Pakistan to promote tolerance, and take measures to protect freedom of religion or belief. This demarche also called for the reform of discriminatory legislation and urged the Minister for Minority Affairs to raise awareness about abuses against minorities and to increase their political representation at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.2/3">Bilaterally, both in London and through our High Commission, officials regularly raise the treatment of minorities with their Pakistani interlocutors and will continue to do so. My hon. Friend the former Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Gillian Merron, met Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's Minister for Minority Affairs, during her visit to Pakistan in February 2009. She raised concerns about the difficulties faced by religious minorities in Pakistan, and the misuse of blasphemy legislation.</p>
