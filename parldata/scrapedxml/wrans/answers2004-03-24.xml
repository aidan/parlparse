In addition, badgers have been recorded defecating and urinating in troughs.

The results of this research will be reported to Defra in December 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".825W.9/1">The primary food of the badger in Britain is the earthworm. These do not represent a limiting resource across much of Britain, especially the south-west, due to their super-abundance. However, they may not be available to badgers under some conditions such as during periods of dry weather. Therefore, badgers are unlikely to be confronted with food shortages as a result of increasing population size alone. When earthworms are not available badgers are forced to select other food sources and will forage greater distances to obtain these. Being generalist opportunists, badgers will consume a wide variety of foods. These include many invertebrates, plant roots, fruits, cereals, animal carcases and stored livestock feed. Food shortages may encourage badgers to forage at greater distances from their setts, although there is no quantitative data on this.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.11/1">Cattle reacting to the intradermal comparative test are considered to be affected by bovine tuberculosis, regardless of culture results. The main reason for carrying out bacteriological tests in those animals is to identify, for epidemiological purposes, the strain of M. bovis responsible for the infection rather than to validate the skin test results.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.11/2">There are several reasons why reactors may be negative on culture:</p>
	<p pid=".828W.11/3" class="indent">A very small proportion (0.5 per cent. or less according to the veterinary literature) of reactors without visible TB lesions can be caused by bacteria closely related to the M. bovis bacillus.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.11/4" class="indent">Cellular immune responses (which give rise to the skin test response) will be evident at earlier stages following infection than the pathological changes caused by the disease (e.g. visible lesions), and probably before bacterial loads are sufficiently large to be found by standard culture methods.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.11/5" class="indent">M. bovis is a fastidious organism to grow in the laboratory, so culture methods are less sensitive than the skin test.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.0/1">The autumn North sea fisheries survey undertaken by CEFAS changed to the GOV (Grande Ouverture Verticale) trawl from 1992. The survey gear predominantly targets roundfish but also samples a wide range of other commercial fish. Consequently the gear is not designed to target only cod. Nevertheless, the GOV trawl is more efficient at catching cod than the Granton trawl it replaced. Both gears show a very truncated age distribution, with few mature cod. Before the change to the GOV gear the cod stock had seriously declined, and in the early 1990s the advice from ICES was that strong measures were needed to protect the cod, including direct reductions in fishing effort. Results from the two gears, albeit at different times, are comparable.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.3/1">This is not a well researched area but one North Sea study concluded that an oil platform had attracted cod and saithe, leaving a zone around the platform where fish density was lower. Even so, the total quantity was negligible compared to regional or even local fish stocks. On this limited basis it does not appear that the aggregation of cod and saithe by platforms is likely to have a significant effect on the availability of fish.</p>

It extends the scope of the regime from vessels over 18 metres overall length to vessels over 15 metres overall length but no longer applies to vessels fishing for deep-water species which are now subject to separate management arrangements. The hailing in and out arrangements contained in the previous regime have been removed except in a newly created biologically sensitive area off the south-west coast of Ireland. The Council will agree new effort ceilings for Member States later this year. The new arrangements do not affect the ability of UK registered vessels over 15 metres to fish in western waters. Fisheries Departments will monitor overall fishing effort against the ceilings set by Council. Where an effort ceiling is in danger of being breached licences will be varied to prohibit fishing in the relevant area. No such licence variations have proved necessary since the previous regime was introduced in 1995.</p>

Secondly, the environment, through the planktonic food chain, affects the survival from eggs to &quot;recruits&quot;. Sea temperature is often used as an index of such environmental changes. Defra are funding research into the links between the environment and recruitment, as illustrated in the recently publicised article in Nature. However, it is the first we have to manage. ICES advice is that if the environment is also causing reduced recruitments then managers have to be even more cautious.</p>

	<p pid=".835W.9/1">For grant-aided capital investment the Environment Agency uses Defra's priority scoring system, which applies to all flood and coastal defence operating authorities. The system was introduced on a pilot basis in 1997 and, following a review and wide ranging consultation, a revised system was announced in 2002 to come into effect in April 2003. The revised system ranks projects on three components in a ratio of 20:12:12 respectively: benefit:cost ratio, the number of people to be protected (as measured by number of residences over cost) and environmental assets protected. In order to be approved for grant aid from Defra proposals must meet a minimum threshold score, which is reviewed annually.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.9/2">For investment in other flood management expenditure the Agency issued guidance to Regional Flood Defence Committees (RFDCs) on priorities in 1998. From 1 April 2004 Grant in Aid from Defra will replace levies on local authorities for financing the bulk of RFDC expenditure and this gives the Agency a greater direct role in deciding on priorities and distribution between regions. For 2004&ndash;05, allocations reflected the assumptions made in regional business plans for the previous levy-setting round. The Agency is now working with Defra on a more robust prioritisation system for the allocation of Grant in Aid based on new performance measures in relation to flood risk reduction, for application from 2006&ndash;07. In the meantime the Agency will be expected to meet the targets published in their 2004 Corporate Plan.</p>

	<p pid=".842W.8/1">Sales of mortgage-based equity release schemes, also known as lifetime mortgages, will be regulated by the Financial Services Authority as from 31 October 2004. The Government are considering responses to the consultation on whether home reversion equity release schemes should also be regulated by the FSA. An announcement will be made in due course. The Government therefore have no plans to commission research to assess consumers' understanding of the different regulatory systems once the new FSA regulation comes into force.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.11/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Edward Leigh, dated 24 March 2004</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many same-sex couple households there are in England and Wales according to the 2001 Census; and how many same-sex couple households there are in Great Britain according to the Labour Force Survey. (163070).</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/4" class="indent">The 2001 Census defines a same-sex couple as two people of the same sex, both resident in the same household, who report themselves as partners on the Census form. Figures published in table UV93 in the 2001 Census National Report for England and Wales Part 2 on the number of people with same-sex partners indicate that there were 39,261 co-residential same-sex couples in England and Wales identified by the 2001 Census. However, same-sex couples can only be identified if they choose to declare themselves as partners on the Census form. Thus the count of co-residential same-sex couples would be an underestimate of the true number. It is not known to what extent there was an undercount because, for example, same-sex couples may have ticked some other box in the relationship field such as 'Unrelated'. Furthermore, a household may contain more than one couple and there is no exact count of the number of same-sex households from the 2001 Census.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/5" class="indent">The Labour Force Survey (LFS) gives information about same-sex couple households for each three-month period. It collects information on residents in private households. Questions are designed to establish whether each resident is cohabiting or not, and, if so, with which other household member. However, same-sex partnership can only be distinguished if the respondent volunteers the fact; it is not asked. In the LFS, a same-sex couple is defined as two respondents who are living together as a couple in the household and who are the same sex.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/6" class="indent">In the three-month period ending November 2003, 50,887 same-sex couple households in Great Britain were identified on this basis. The LFS is a sample survey covering over 57,000 households in the United Kingdom in each three-month period. As with any statistical sample survey, estimates from the Labour Force Survey are subject to sampling error.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/7" class="indent">It is not possible to derive an estimate of the number of co-residential same-sex couples in Scotland by taking the difference of the two estimates provided in this answer, since data were provided at different times and in different contexts, and each figure is subject to estimation error.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.11/8" class="indent">There will be a more comprehensive analysis of how to interpret information on same sex couples later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.5/1">Since the Chancellor's announcement in the Pre-Budget Report that the Government were considering introducing tax stamps for spirits, Treasury Ministers and Officials have received a wide range of representations on this and on the spirits industry's alternative package of measures. Those representations acknowledge that spirits fraud is a serious problem and needs to be addressed but differ in their views on how to tackle this effectively. The main concerns highlighted related to the impact and compliance costs of tax stamps. In making his decision that tax stamps are necessary to tackle spirits fraud, the Chancellor took account of concerns raised and announced on Budget Day that he will help the trade financially with the cash-flow costs and capital investment associated with the introduction of tax stamps. He also announced that there would be a further freeze on spirits duty&mdash;for the seventh Budget in a row and, indeed, that spirits duty will be frozen for the remainder of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.5/2">Officials are working with the industry to consider how the offsetting measures can be effectively targeted and applied and to develop the detailed arrangements for tax stamps in a way that minimises additional burdens on business and causes minimal disruption to the trade's operations.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.8/1">This Government have given exhaustive consideration over recent years, in close consultation with the alcohol industry, to finding ways to tackle the serious problem of spirits duty fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.8/2">HM Customs and Excise held a formal consultation on tax stamps in late 2001 and early 2002. They conducted a further formal consultation in the summer of 2003 on regulatory options for reducing opportunities for fraud in the alcohol holding and movement system.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.8/3">Partly as a result of those earlier discussions, a number of measures have already been put in place or are planned to tackle spirits fraud. These include the creation of a Joint Spirits Fraud Task Force in 2002 and the development of draft Memoranda of Understanding between Customs and key spirits trade associations. Customs have also strengthened their operational response to fraud, including the creation of a National Discreditation Team to detect illicit loads which were destined to be diverted after arrival in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.8/4">Despite these ongoing efforts, Customs' estimates, published alongside the Pre-Budget Report in December 2003, showed that around &pound;600 million of revenue was lost through spirits fraud in 2001&ndash;2002. The Government therefore announced that tax stamps for spirits would be introduced from 2006 unless the industry put forward alternative measures that would be as effective as tax stamps in combating fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.8/5">There has been a further intensive period of discussions with the industry since December on all aspects of tax stamps and alternative options. The industry put forward an alternative package of 17 proposals. However, as announced in the Budget, the Government's assessment is that the anti-fraud impact of the alternative package falls significantly short of that estimated for tax stamps. The package contains inherent weaknesses: it leaves the door open for displacement to other types of fraud, most notably inward diversion; it stands to be undermined by a complicit party; and unlike tax stamps it does not tackle the problem of identification&mdash;the ability for consumers, retailers and Customs officers to distinguish readily between licit and illicit products.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.8/6">A full assessment of the industry's package of alternative proposals to tax stamps will form part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment, to be published alongside this year's Finance Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".855W.11/1">Lieutenant Colonel Hawley's paper on A Study of Attempted Suicide in the Army: 10 Years of Experience 1987 to 1996 came to the following conclusions:</p>
	<p pid=".855W.11/2" class="indent">a prospective cohort study should be undertaken over a period of five years to confirm the findings of this scoping study and to extend the analysis;</p>
	<p pid=".855W.11/3" class="indent">a review of the current selection criteria for entry into the Army should be undertaken in order to help select individuals appropriately;</p>
	<p pid=".855W.11/4" class="indent">a formalisation of the criteria for dealing and disposing of individuals who have attempted suicide should be completed;</p>
	<p pid=".855W.11/5" class="indent">training in the identification of individuals at risk should be introduced to all leadership courses.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.11/6">This paper was not commissioned by the Army but produced as a result of private academic research in 1998. The report was not seen by the Chain of Command at the time and no action was taken. It coincided with a more major body of official research, the Walton Report. Arrangements are being made to place a copy of Lieutenant Colonel Hawley's paper in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has several hundred computer systems in use ranging from corporate IT systems serving thousands of users to business area systems serving smaller communities. This means that a detailed and specific answer to this question could be provided only at disproportionate cost. There are, however, some practices which are standard across the department and these are detailed as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.5/2">Information systems within the Department are controlled by Security and Operating Procedures (SyOps). Each System is only accredited for use once the procedures have been approved by the Departmental Security Officer. All users are required to observe the SyOps; enforcement is the responsibility of individual System Security Officer(SSO's)/Information Technology Security Officers (ITSO's).</p>
	<p pid=".856W.5/3">Joint Service Publication (JSP) 440, covering these issues was revised last year. SyOps are revised as necessary as and when new threats to security arise. A recent example is the appearance of photo-messaging which has required that mobile phones be prohibited in some areas where formally they were permitted.</p>

	<p pid=".858W.5/1">Initial tests of the Activities for Managing Life (AMLs) assessment model as a potential alternative method of assessing entitlement to Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance were not sufficiently encouraging to justify further development and testing of the model. We believe that our delivery objectives of substantially improved customer service and more speedy, accurate and consistent decision making can best be achieved through the Disability and Carers Service's change programme, which is designed to modernise the delivery of the benefits on the basis of the current assessment arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".859W.2/1">Measures instituted by this Government since 1997 to improve pensioners' incomes have been targeted largely on those in the lower part of the income distribution who tend to be older, female, and from ethnic minorities.</p>
	<p pid=".859W.2/2">The main measures since 1997 include: above inflation increases in the Basic State Pension between April 2000 and April 2003; the introduction of the Minimum Income Guarantee and then Pension Credit which, from April 2004, will ensure that no single pensioner need live on less than &pound;105.45 a week and no couple on less than &pound;160.95 a week, as well as providing extra support for those with modest savings; Winter Fuel payments of &pound;200 a year for the remainder of this Parliament; an extra &pound;100 a year within the Winter Fuel Payments for those aged 80 or over; free TV licences for individuals aged 75 or over; and an extra 100 for households with at least one pensioner aged 70 or over.</p>
	<p pid=".859W.2/3">The Government will be spending around &pound;10 billion a year extra on pensioners in 2004&ndash;05 as a result of these measures.

	<p pid=".860W.3/1">There is no statutory retirement age in the UK, in the sense of an age at which legislation requires a person to retire.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.3/2">The state pension age is currently 65 for men and 60 for women but will increase gradually from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020 to allow employees and employers as well as companies running pension schemes time to plan for and implement the changes.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.3/3">We have signalled our intention to maintain the state pension age at 65 (there is a consensus that people should have the right to work longer but that this should be voluntary and not forced). However, both Private and State Pension systems allow individuals to work past this age and accrue higher pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.3/4">Proposals in the Pensions Bill will allow individuals to receive better rewards for deferring their state pension in the form of a lump sum payment or increased pension when an individual eventually retires.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.3/5">The minimum age at which tax privileged retirement benefits can be drawn from a private pension scheme will be raised to 55 years by 2010. It is possible to retire earlier in exchange for an actuarial reduction of private pension. The actual amounts are dependant on the type of pension scheme and when the employee retires. It is a requirement of tax legislation that schemes should have a normal pension age reflecting the age at which individuals would usually withdraw their pension.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.3/6">We are proposing to raise the age at which public sector employees can draw an unreduced pension from 60 to 65. This age would apply regardless of the employee's length of service but certain occupations where the physical capacity of the job justify the award of a normal pension at a lower age will continue.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.2/1">Evidence from research plays a key role in developing, monitoring and evaluating the business of the Department. The Department has developed a cycle of investigation and research, leading to informed planning to implement change (sometimes through pilots which refine innovative approaches), and then monitoring to assess the impact. This cycle is reflected in a parallel process of consulting upon and commissioning our social research programme through open tendering. The analytical community has been reorganised and aligned with policy and delivery units, integrating analysis and policymaking to provide the highest level of evidence-based policy making. The Department has maintained the level of research spending, and rigorous evaluation and monitoring of new developments. All research is published on the internet so that it is freely available to anyone who would wish to use it.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.3/1">Conditions on the delivery of mail are a licensing matter for the regulator, Postcomm. The Postal Services Act 2000, and the Licence granted by Postcomm under it, requires Royal Mail to make one daily delivery to every household in the United Kingdom. It does not specify the time at which this has to be made. Postcomm, therefore, does not have authority to dictate the time of the daily delivery. Postwatch (The Consumer Council) has worked closely with Royal Mail (and the CWU) throughout the process to ensure that the change to a single daily delivery balances commercial necessity against customer need. Postwatch undertook extensive research jointly with Royal Mail to ensure that any adverse effect on consumers was minimised. Postwatch advocated local flexibility rather than a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; solution and continues to work with Royal Mail at a local level to help ensure a smooth transition.</p>

The creation of Defra in 2001 provided an opportunity to move the responsibility for welfare of all animals kept by man to a single Minister (with the exception of animals kept for experimental purposes which stays with the Home Office). Following consultation, the Government are undertaking a review of 21 animal welfare Acts relating to captive and domestic animals with the aim of consolidating them into one Animal Welfare Act. We hope to publish a draft Bill later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".869W.6/2">Figures for crimes recorded by the police are not broken down by constituency areas. However, they are available at Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) level. There are currently fourteen CDRPs in Lancashire, including Chorley. CDRPs broadly equate to Local Authority areas, and financial year figures are available for 1999&ndash;2000, 2000&ndash;01, 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".869W.6/3">Figures for recorded crime offences are available at CDRP level for six key offences groups only: violence against the person, sexual offences, robbery, burglary in a dwelling, theft of a motor vehicle, and theft from a vehicle.</p>
	<p pid=".869W.6/4">The number of offences recorded may have been affected by the adoption of the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS). The NCRS was officially implemented across England and Wales in April 2002. Lancashire police adopted the Standard prior to this, in August 2000. The NCRS has particularly impacted in violent crime offences. Therefore, following the introduction of the Standard, numbers of recorded crimes are not directly comparable with previous years.</p>

I commend the hard work of its Chairman, Members and staff in establishing the Commission as an authoritative and respected body. The Commission has established a high reputation for its decision making, for impartiality, openness and thoroughness and has won the confidence of the public, the legal profession and related pressure groups.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.5/3">The Commission will be able to analyse the legal and investigative issues that still commonly arise in miscarriages of justice. The Commission will be able to provide advice to other stakeholders and agencies within the criminal justice system on actions that could help to minimise their incidence. The Commission's main priority, however, is to deal with its case accumulation, minimising the waiting time for applicants particularly those in custody. With additional funding, the Commission has made a considerable reduction in the number of cases awaiting a review from the 1999 peak. I have every confidence that the Commission will continue to make good progress towards this goal despite the recent unexpected rise in the number of applications.</p>

	<p pid=".872W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 18 March 2004</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/2">The information that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has asked for on the number of outstanding checks broken down in the manner requested is not available from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) systems.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/3">A weekly report is produced by the CRB to establish the number of outstanding applications held within the computer system. This report displays applications that have been outstanding from one week to six weeks. These figures are broken down further to show the number of applications that have been with the CRB from 0-four weeks, four-six weeks and over six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/4">As at 29 February 2004, the CRB has a total of 105,218 applications awaiting completion.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/5">Of these applications:</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/6" class="indent">97,756 are less than four-weeks-old</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/7" class="indent">5,901 are four to six-weeks-old</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/8" class="indent">1,561 are over six-weeks-old</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/9">The number of applications awaiting completion over six weeks, approximately 1.5 per cent. of the overall total, falls well within the 5 per cent. tolerance, as stipulated in our Public Service Standard.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/10">The CRB continues to monitor its performance and implement measures aimed at minimising backlogs and streamlining the Disclosure process. These measures have included:</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/11" class="indent">consulting Registered Bodies on how to encompass greater responsibility within their role, enabling speedier authentication of Disclosure applicants;</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/12" class="indent">minimising data quality errors by providing advice and assistance to applicants and Counter signatories on completing the application form;</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/13" class="indent">replacing our previous manually produced Fastrack system with an automated process;</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/14" class="indent">providing additional resources to specific areas of concern.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/15">For example, five members of CRB staff have been seconded to alleviate backlogs at Local Police Forces.</p>

	<p pid=".872W.3/1">The initial contract with Capita, which envisaged the majority of applications being made via the telephone, included an on-line identity check using Experian's on-line system. This was deemed to be the most efficient method as an applicant could be asked for sufficient information to &quot;pass&quot; the check while making the application via the call centre.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.3/2">The subsequent introduction of the paper application channel, which now accounts for 87 per cent. of all applications made this route unviable as specific questions aimed at obtaining a pass score cannot be asked on a paper application form.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.3/3">In line with the recommendation of the Independent Review Team appointed by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in September 2002 powers have been taken in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to make Registered Bodies solely responsible for identity and address verification. The CRB issues guidance to Registered Bodies showing the type of documentation a Registered Body should use to verify name and address. The CRB Code of Practice requires Registered Bodies to check documents contained in this list</p>
	<p pid=".872W.3/4">The CRB does use &quot;postcode look up&quot; to verify that an address exists but does not carry out any further address checks. The revised contract with Capita reflects this.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.2/1">There is currently one designated custody suite operating in Cornwall. This is at Camborne police station, which has 25 cells. However, St Austell police station, which has eight cells and is not designated as a custody suite, is currently being used as a temporary option while the 11 cells at Newquay police station are undergoing extensive refurbishment. When Newquay reopens in May this year, St Austell police station will no longer be used as a custody suite. Planners are currently considering the designs for a new custody suite at Launceton and subject to planning consent, this will be open in 2005 and will provide an additional 21 cells. There are other cells available in police stations across Cornwall that are not part of custody suite facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".876W.8/1">Prior to 1997 the Race Relations Act (RRA) 1976 already prohibited discrimination on racial grounds. The RRA did not specifically refer to harassment, but it was clear from case law that racial harassment was a type of detriment capable of amounting to the kind of less favourable treatment prohibited by the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".876W.8/2">As part of its fulfilment of its obligations under the EC Race Directive the UK amended the Race Relations Act 1976 (by virtue of the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003) so as to make it unlawful to harass a person, on grounds of race or ethnic or national origins, in the areas of activity covered by the 1976 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".876W.8/3">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created new and separate offences where the offences of causing fear and violence or of causing harassment, alarm or distress under the Public Order Act 1986, or the offences of harassment or putting in fear of violence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 were racially aggravated.</p>
	<p pid=".876W.8/4">Figures for the number of prosecutions in Crosby for this type of offence are not centrally available. Merseyside Police figures for racially aggravated harassment offences (published by the Home Office under the requirements of S95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991) show a total of 434 recorded offences of this type over the period 1999/2000 to 2001/02.</p>

	<p pid=".877W.11/4">These measures are part of a wider initiative to increase Specials Number and effectiveness, which has also seen all 43 police Forces awarded a share of &pound;2.75 million &quot;Capacity building&quot; funding to help develop and improve Specials' recruitment, management and retention. We hope that by 2006/07 another 3,000 Specials will have been recruited through wider public awareness and better management and communication by Forces.</p>

A budget of &pound;2 million was made available for this scheme in financial year 2003&ndash;04 to assist with urgent repairs to high-level roofs and masonry to keep the cathedral building structurally stable and weather-tight. Grant offers have already been made under this scheme against a budget of &pound;2 million for 2004&ndash;05. Following a review of all its grant schemes, and now that the majority of big repair projects to cathedrals in England have been completed, English Heritage has earmarked a budget of &pound;3 million for this scheme in 2005&ndash;2008.</p>

This scheme has benefited a large number of parish churches in England.</p>
	<p pid=".878W.9/4">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport administers the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, an interim scheme introduced in the 2001 Budget, which has returned in grant aid the difference between five per cent and the actual amount of Value Added Tax (VAT) paid on eligible repairs and maintenance. In his Budget announcement on 17 March 2004, the Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed that claims for all eligible works carried out on and after 1 April 2004 will receive grant payments under the scheme to cover the full amount of VAT paid. Unless a permanent VAT reduced rate is achieved in the meantime as part of negotiations on a review of the EU rules governing VAT reduced rates, this scheme will continue until 31 March 2006. Listed places of worship belonging to all formally constituted religious organisations are eligible to apply to the scheme. Around 4,500 listed places of worship throughout the United Kingdom have so far benefited from the scheme, which has paid out over &pound;18 million.</p>

	<p pid=".883W.0/1">Over the past 10 years, DFID has funded about &pound;3.6 million of applied research on renewable energy, covering all the main renewable energy technologies, about half of this in the last four years.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.0/2">We recognise the importance of access to affordable and reliable energy services to economic growth and development, drawing on the full range of appropriate technology options, including renewable energy. This was a key outcome of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), and was included among the range of actions needed to reduce poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.0/3">As a follow-up to the WSSD, DFID is working with several international networks to promote improved access to energy services, including the Global Village Energy Partnership and the EU Energy Initiative. These programmes involve dialogue with developing countries about their energy needs in support of their poverty reduction objectives. Most countries possess a range of indigenous natural resources that may help meet requirements such cooking, heating, lighting and water pumping. Where they are practical and financially feasible, renewable energy resources may have an important role to play.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.0/4">In addition, DFID is taking a lead role in discussions with the World Bank about increasing the share of renewable energy in meeting the energy needs of developing countries, wherever this is feasible and financially viable.</p>

They have also pledged to create a commission to examine the requirement for new regulations and the enforcement of existing labour legislation, but they face many constraints in putting these commitments fully in to effect.

	<p pid=".885W.2/1">Great progress was made in reducing malarial mortality in the 1970s and 1980s, yet many parts of Africa are now seeing an increase in the number of deaths from malaria. A key cause is the increase in the resistance to anti-malarial drugs and the lack of affordable alternatives. In addition the capacity of health systems in sub Saharan Africa is often inadequate to respond effectively to malaria. Nonetheless, malaria remains a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.2/2">Since 1998 the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided in excess of &pound;110 million to support malaria control activities globally and at country level. At the global level this include support to Roll Back Malaria; support to the Medical Research Council; support to the Malaria Consortium Resource Centre; and initiatives to help find new low-cost malaria treatments. DFID has committed US$ 280 million over seven years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). The GFATM will fund distribution of insecticide impregnated bednets and appropriate ant-malarial medication.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.2/3">DFID also supports malaria control activities at country-level through our bilateral county programmes, either through direct support to the health sector or through general budget support. DFID is committed to supporting national Governments and their partners to help ensure that effective drugs and commodities, including effective anti-malarial drugs, are accessible to the poor. Since 1997, DFID has committed &pound;1.5 billion to strengthen health systems to deliver vital drugs and health care treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.5/1">The provision of search and rescue dogs is managed and supported by the non-governmental organisations themselves that comprise the National Search and Rescue dog group. DFID meets the costs of their deployment and return when the dogs are used overseas as part of a United Kingdom response to natural disasters such as earthquakes. It is not possible to disaggregate the deployment costs of the dogs as they are one part of a larger search and rescue effort and immediate response that usually also includes the delivery of other relief items by the same chartered aircraft.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.8/1">DFID's overall aim is to reduce global poverty and promote sustainable development, in particular through achieving the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Our goal in the water sector is to enable poor people to lead healthier and more productive lives by helping to increase and sustain their access to safe drinking water supply and appropriate sanitation.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/2">The UK has worked hard to improve aid effectiveness by untying aid, focusing support on strategies drawn up by developing countries themselves, harmonising our assistance with other donors, and the use of new means of aid, such as direct budget support. More effective use of aid therefore, means moving away from donors allocating funding to selected sectors or to donor-led projects, and moving towards providing support that is consistent with national poverty reduction strategies. For this reason, DFID budgets according to regions and countries, and allows country programmes to determine priorities according to national plans.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/3">DFID's strategy for water and sanitation is therefore aimed at seeking to ensure that water and sanitation issues are given the right level of priority within developing countries' plans although evidence suggests that this is not always the case. It is for this reason that DFID has recently published a Water Action Plan, which sets out how we intend to take this work forward. The Plan sets out what needs to be done at the national, regional and international level. The key elements are: making sure water and sanitation issues figure prominently in policy discussions with our main partner countries in their reform agendas; providing evidence of the links between improved water management, water supply and sanitation and achieving all the MDGs, and ensuring that we are making use of this evidence in our policy dialogue; improving the way the international system works, by focusing support on key international partnerships and networks, particularly those that can improve co- ordination in the water sector.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.8/4">The next step will be to put the plan into operation.</p>

	<p pid=".888W.5/1">The results from the 2003 National Curriculum tests showed that 75 per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached Level 4 in English and 73 per cent. in mathematics. These results represent a significant improvement in standards&mdash;of 12 percentage points in English and 11 percentage points in mathematics&mdash;since 1997, reflecting the impact of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies on primary schools. We remain absolutely committed, through our new Primary Strategy, to supporting schools to achieve the ambitious targets we have set for standards of literacy and numeracy.</p>

The variation between the partnership data from April 2003 indicates both the varying success partnerships have had in applying the follow up rules and the cyclical nature of the NEET group.</p>

	<p pid=".893W.2/1">In 2002/03, there were 3,374 full-time undergraduates and 362 part-time undergraduates in the UK from the 10 countries acceding to the EU on 1 May 2004. This represents 0.2 per cent. of the UK and EU domiciled undergraduate student population in UK institutions. The funding made available to HEFCE and English universities for 2004&ndash;05 provides for a modest increase in student numbers from EU countries following accession. It is not possible to predict the numbers with certainty at this stage since a decision to study in the UK depends on a number of factors, including the availability of HE in the student's home country and their ability to support their own living costs.</p>

	<p pid=".896W.2/1">Pupil mobility in some London schools is significant. Data published in the Ofsted report 'Managing Pupil Mobility' in 2002 showed that mobility in both inner and outer London was higher than elsewhere. Schools in inner London authorities had an average of 14.2 per cent. of pupils joining or leaving mid year. In Outer London the average was 6.8 per cent.. This compared to 5.9 per cent. for metropolitan authorities, 6.3 per cent. for unitary authorities and 5.7 per cent. for shire authorities. Ofsted evidence suggests that where mobility levels exceed 12 per cent. there is an impact on standards achieved for all pupils. We are seeking to address the issue of pupil mobility in London through the trialling of induction mentors in 22 London secondary schools, and by the dissemination of good practice through the Key Stage 3 Strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".897W.5/1">My right hon. Friend has accepted the School Teachers' Review Body's recommendation that pay scales increase by 2.5 per cent. in April 2004 and by 3.25 per cent. in April 2005 to August 2006. This is in line with the Government's projections on the rate of inflation to 2006 and it is not, therefore, expected that teachers' pay will involve a real terms increase.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.5/2">The Government play no part in setting the levels of pay in the higher education and further education sectors as universities and further education colleges are independent and autonomous bodies. Pay levels are subject to negotiations between employers and the representative trade union bodies. Pay levels will therefore vary from institution to institution.</p>

Support for ANA development has included &pound;830,000 for refurbishment of ANA barracks to provide decent living and working conditions. We are in the process of providing a further &pound;10 million to develop ANA recruitment centres. The UK provided basic assistance to the ANP to help ensure the retention of national police deployed in Mazar-e Sharif (where our Provincial Reconstruction Team is located). In addition, the UK has provided nearly &pound;1 million of support to German-led refurbishment of the Afghan Border Police Headquarters in Kabul.</p>

PRTs aim to support the authority of the Afghan Government, improve the security situation, facilitate development and reconstruction, and support Security Sector Reform. In the long-term Afghanistan must have an effective national army and police force. Work to recruit and train them has been under way for some time, with our active support and involvement. A wider programme of Security Sector Reform is also underway, including the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.5/1">From 1 April 2004, the Council Tax (Prescribed Classes of Dwellings)(England) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3011) allow local billing authorities to reduce the discount on most second homes to 10 per cent. and on long-term empty homes to zero. There is a national exemption from council tax for unfurnished dwellings which are vacant for six months or less. The maximum council tax which could be charged on a second home is therefore 90 per cent. and the maximum council tax which could be charged on a long-term empty home is 100 per cent. Council tax from second homes and empty homes can be used in the same way as council tax from other property. The proceeds are shared, between billing and precepting authorities. The effect of changing the discounts on second and long-term empty homes is to raise the tax base of an area and so local authorities in that area can raise more council tax. The Government will not adjust grant because of the extra income generated by reducing the second homes discount. This means local authorities in the area have the choice to spend this on local priorities or to have a lower council tax or precept than would otherwise have been the case. In the case of long-term empty property, the Government intend to adjust grant so that extra revenue will not be retained locally.</p>

	<p pid=".911W.8/1">Following the late sharp increase in the size of the Supporting People budget last year the Government launched an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme. The review concluded that &pound;1.8 billion was too much to pay for legacy funding, however it recommended that the pace of change needed to take account of the need to protect services for vulnerable people. This is why authorities have only been required to make a 2.5 per cent. efficiency saving in 2004&ndash;05 with an element of these funds being re-allocated elsewhere on the programme. The final Supporting People grant allocations for 2004&ndash;05 have now been made and will not be reverted. Those allocations reflect a very significant increase in funding compared to two years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.8/2">Decisions about longer-term future allocations are still under consideration, but we are looking at the wide variation in provision and circumstances between authorities. The intention has always been to move towards a needs based allocation formula, the Independent Review has made recommendations on the formula and we are looking at these recommendations in detail.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.2/1">The safety of medicines is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the Government's independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/2">Early information on the risk of stroke in dementia patients treated with risperidone was assessed by the MHRA in 2002, resulting in changes to the product information to include appropriate warnings. However, it was not until later in 2003, when further data became available, that revealed the magnitude of the risk and potential public health implications. The CSM was consulted in December 2003, as soon as all the data and subsequent analyses had been compiled and assessed by the MHRA. The CSM considered an assessment of all available data from clinical trials with risperidone and advised that additional analyses of the risperidone clinical trials in dementia and analysis of the risk of alternative treatments were required, as well as expert advice in the treatment of patients with dementia.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/3">An expert working group, including geriatricians, psychogeriatricians and psychiatrists, met on 19 January 2004 to consider a formal meta-analysis of clinical trial data for risperidone and clinical trial data on olanzapine, which had recently become available. The CSM considered the recommendations of the expert working group at the end of January and advised that the risks of stroke with risperidone and olanzapine should be communicated accompanied by comprehensive treatment guidelines to inform the necessary changes in prescribing practice. In the case of a third atypical antipsychotic quetiapine, there were insufficient data to draw conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/4">Risperidone has a United Kingdom marketing authorisation, whereas olanzapine has a European authorisation valid throughout the European Community. The communication in the UK on 9 March 2004 on risperidone and olanzapine was planned to coincide with a Europe-wide communication on olanzapine following consideration by the European scientific committee, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) at its February meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/5">The CSM, through the MHRA, has close links with regulatory authorities world-wide. The MHRA is represented on the CPMP and its Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP), which meet monthly and provide a regular forum for discussion of drug safety issues within the European Union. An electronic communication system allows rapid exchange of drug safety information between member states. The PhVWP has regular videoconferences to share drug safety information with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America. The MHRA is a member of the Vigimed mailing list, which is an e-mail distribution list set up to facilitate rapid exchange of information between National Centres participating in the World Health Organisation International Drug Monitoring Programme. The MHRA also has informal links with other regulatory authorities world-wide.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/6">There is an obligation on companies making an application for a marketing authorisation to provide the MHRA with all information relevant to the assessment of risks and benefits on the product at the time of the application; this includes data from clinical trials conducted outside the UK. For marketed drugs, the marketing authorisation holder's &quot;qualified person&quot;, who is responsible for their pharmacovigilance system, has an obligation to inform the MHRA of any information relevant to the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the product.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/7">Aside from the data and interpretation received from the company, and their corresponding applications to vary the Marketing Authorisation, no representations were received on the risk of stroke with antipsychotics before the announcement of 9 March.</p>

It aims to develop solutions to improve hand hygiene compliance by national health service staff, by testing ideas at six pilot sites. It is estimated that about &pound;600,000 would be required to launch a campaign and supply a toolkit to every acute sector ward in the NHS, which works out at a cost of less than &pound;2,000 per trust. The annual cost to the NHS of healthcare acquired infections has been estimated to be about &pound;1 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".922W.11/1">The NHS Plan required hospitals, by 2004, to have a hospital nutrition policy to improve the outcome of care for patients and reduce dependency on intravenous feeding regimes. Hospitals should also ensure that their menus are subject to nutritional analysis to ensure they meet the needs of patients.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.11/2">To assist hospitals in providing high quality food and food services, NHS Estates developed the Better Hospital Food programme. The national health service is making good progress in delivering these new services which reflect patients' preferences and provide a wider range of food options, including recipes and product purchasing specifications. In addition, the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency has in place stringent controls to ensure the quality of all food for which contracts are negotiated on behalf of the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.2/1">The European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) is a qualification recognised around the world for basic computing skills. General information technology skills should be seen as an everyday requirement for any service based organisation. The opportunity to gain the ECDL qualification is offered to all staff working in the National Health Service. For NHS staff, it provides a basic level of knowledge, which enables people to demonstrate their competence in computer skills. The ECDL is completed in modules and designed to be completed over time and to fit in and around any other work requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/2">There is no formal requirement for NHS staff to hold the ECDL for the purpose of working in the NHS. As a matter of good practice, and as part of its commitment to life-long learning, the NHS encourages all staff to develop appropriate skills, including competency in the use of IT.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/3">The national health informatics development team within the NHS Information Authority has put in place central facilities to support local NHS organisations in training needs around the ECDL. Since the programme was launched in March 2003, 9,000 people have qualified and a further 54,000 have registered. It is expected that up 40 per cent. of NHS staff will register over the five year timescale of the central programme. The central programme provides central support for registration and validation of ECDL training that would otherwise fall to individual NHS organisations and is expected to cost &pound;15 million. It remains the responsibility of local NHS organisations to provide local facilities. Specific costs for ECDL training by individual members of staff are not identified.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/4">Training, development and deployment of staff is a matter for local management. The NHS is an organisation committed to equal opportunities and valuing diversity therefore appropriate opportunities and support should be made available for all staff regardless of whether they hold an ECDL qualification or not.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/5">The Government hope that training and skills development are regarded as an integral part of employment, and that time spent by staff on training for any recognised vocational skill is not identified as lost.</p>

It recommended that structured patient education is made available to all people with diabetes at the time of initial diagnosis and then as required on an ongoing basis, based on a formal, regular assessment of need. The National Health Service locally is usually required to make funds available to support NICE appraisal guidance within three months of publication. In the case of this guidance, the Secretary of State issued a direction to waive this requirement, as NICE advised that successful implementation of structured educational programmes would depend on the availability of an appropriately trained workforce. Primary care trusts, in working towards the Planning and Priorities Framework target of having practice based registers and systematic treatment for people with diabetes by 2006, should consider the introduction of structured education as an important element of a systematic treatment regime.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.5/3">Parallel importers are not permitted to change the primary packaging of the product&mdash;that is the immediate packaging in contact with the product (for instance the blister packaging). The importer is however required to overlabel the immediate packaging in accordance with the European Union labelling regulations. This operation can be carried out by the importer if the company holds an assembly licence, issued by MHRA after inspecting the site.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.5/4">Any repackaging and relabelling proposed by a parallel importer is considered by MHRA before a licence is issued. The labelling of all products must meet the Medicines Labelling Regulations as laid down in Title V of Directive 2001/83/EC and each product pack must contain a patient information leaflet in English. Guidelines on the labelling and packaging of medicinal products are also relevant to parallel imports.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.5/5">In the past 12 months MHRA has received 107 letters or reports relating to medicinal products that have been repackaged and placed on the market in the United Kingdom as licensed parallel imports. These include 18 reports received by the MHRA Defective Medicines Report Centre concerning quality defects in the labelling or leaflets of re-packaged parallel imports, (which represents 6 per cent. of quality defects reported on all products).</p>
	<p pid=".930W.5/6">A further 66 of the letters received, either directly or via ministerial offices, concern aspects of the labelling, packaging or leaflet of the imported products, of which 14 were from patients, patient carers and health professionals. The remaining 52 were from the UK Marketing Authorisation holders and 47 related to updating of patient information leaflets.</p>
