	<p pid="b.333W.0/1">The main sources of Government funding in 2007-08 for the nine English Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are listed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/2" class="italic"> Single Programme Budget</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/3">Since April 2002, the RDAs have been financed through a Single Programme budget (the &quot;Single Pot&quot;). Money from the six contributing Departments (BERR, CLG, DIUS, DEFRA, DCMS and UKTI) is pooled into one single budget. The funding, once allocated, is available to the RDAs in order to achieve the regional priorities identified in their regional economic strategies and the challenging targets set by them in their Corporate Plans. In 2007-08, the Single Pot allocated funding of &pound;2.3 billion to the nine English RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/4" class="italic"> European Regional Development Fund</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/5">The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was set up in 1975 to stimulate economic development in less prosperous regions of the European Union (EU). As EU membership has grown, ERDF has developed into a major instrument for helping to redress regional imbalances. Between 2007 and 2013, England will benefit from an investment of a further &euro;3.2 billion (approximately &pound;2.5 billion) of ERDF. The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) manages ERDF in England and provides programme funding directly to the RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/6" class="italic"> Rural Development Programme for England</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/7">The Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) is a 7-year (2007-2013) EU programme that aims to safeguard and enhance the rural environment, improve the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors and foster competitive and sustainable rural businesses and thriving rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/8">The overall budget for the Programme is approximately &pound;3.9 billion. Some &pound;600 million of this will be made available for socio-economic schemes aimed at making agriculture and forestry more competitive and sustainable, enhancing opportunity and the quality of life in rural areas, and diversifying the rural economy. This part of the RDPE is being delivered primarily by the RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/9" class="italic"> Business Resource Efficiency <i> and</i> Waste Programme (BREW)</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/10">In line with the landfill tax back to business commitment, the Spending Review 2004 (SR2004) announced that the additional revenues will be used to fund programmes to support business in improving its resource efficiency, including waste minimisation and diversion from landfill. The RDAs have been given the responsibility of co-ordinating the programme at regional level. In 2007-08, DEFRA has provided funding of &pound;10.9m through the Single Pot to the RDAs in respect of their programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/11" class="italic"> Northern Way Growth Fund</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/12">The Northern Way is collaboration, formed in 2004, between the three Northern RDAs of England (North West RDA, Yorkshire Forward and One NorthEast). Its aim was to work together to improve the sustainable economic development of the North towards the level of more prosperous regions in the UK. In 2007-08, CLG provided funding of &pound;25.8 million to the RDAs, this being the remaining contribution from Government toward the &pound;100 million Northern Way Growth Fund. BERR is now the lead Government Department for the Northern Way Growth Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/13" class="italic"> Social Enterprise Business Support</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/14">In the Social Enterprise Action Plan the Office of the Third Sector announced it would provide &pound;5.9 million to RDAs to improve Business Link's capacity to broker business support for social enterprises.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.5/1">Reserves in formed units, such as Territorial Army (TA) Battalions and Regiments, and Royal Auxilliary Air Force Squadrons, are in most cases maintained to provide a framework which parallels their Regular equivalent, as over the years this has been shown as the most effective and robust method of providing a framework, upon which reservist capability can be recruited, grown, nurtured and trained.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/2">In the case of the TA, it is the basis from which capability can be deployed on operations. Where possible, the Army tries to deploy TA personnel in 'cohorts', groups drawn from units listed on the commitments forecast. However the current operational requirement dictates that TA capability is deployed variously as individual reinforcements, formed sub-units and only in some exceptional cases&mdash;particularly field hospitals&mdash;as formed units. For a large scale operation a greater proportion of the TA would be deployed as formed sub-units and units, albeit that the latter would still be the exception.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/3">For the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, Squadrons are established for peacetime training purposes only.

Funding from PTB allocations is supplemented by mainstream funding from the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.355W.6/2">The Ministry of Justice contribution (&pound;22 million in the current financial year) pays for the treatment and testing required to deliver the drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR) which is the main delivery route for drug interventions within community sentences and is one of 12 requirements available as part of a community order. The overall sentence is supervised and delivered by the national probation service. The treatment is commissioned locally in partnership with the drug action teams (DATs) and is delivered by a range of voluntary and public sector treatment providers. The national probation service also delivers accredited cognitive behavioural programmes for substance misusers.</p>
	<p pid="b.355W.6/3">Drug action teams receive additional funding&mdash;some &pound;110 million in 2008-09&mdash;from the Home Office to support delivery of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP). DIP works with drug misusing offenders to move them out of crime and into treatment. While the programme is not a formal alternative to custody its emphasis is on working with offenders, particularly in the community, from their earliest point of contact with the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="b.359W.0/1">Improving the skills and employment outcomes for offenders is one of our key objectives for reducing re-offending, and our priorities for action are set out in the 'Reducing Re-Offending through Skills and Employment: Next Steps' plan. The Ministry of Justice works closely with the Departments for Innovation, Universities and Skills, and Work and Pensions to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/2">We recently published a Prison Policy Update briefing paper which set out our intention to increase the range of employment programmes available to offenders inside prison. This will be done in partnership with the private, public and voluntary sectors, who generally fund the work or training programme delivered. Individual prisons may need to cover the cost of setting up the programme but this information is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/3">Similarly, offenders in the community are given opportunities to carry out unpaid work with private, public and voluntary sector employers. Probation areas may need to cover the costs of establishing the relationships with employers but this information is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/4">In addition to these links with employers, offenders have access to DWP programmes aimed at getting disadvantaged groups into employment such as New Deal and Progress2Work. Information about these programmes is offered via Jobcentre Plus advisers, including in prisons through their employment and benefit advisors.</p>

	<p pid="b.361W.2/15">Provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with drug misuse problems under the National Probation Service's supervision is primarily delivered through the Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR), which has replaced the Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO). The Ministry of Justice expects to contribute &pound;22 million in 2008-09 to the Pooled Treatment Budget (PTB) (in addition to a &pound;20 million permanent transfer to the Department of Health) to pay for the treatment and testing for these orders. Probation areas are also broadly expected to spend &pound;39 million to provide the supervision and enforcement of these orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/16">For those offenders who are not sentenced to a specific drug misuse requirement as part of their community order, but who want or need to access treatment, referral to community drug services/clinical treatment is carried out on a voluntary basis. Offenders will have to access local treatment services on the same basis as the rest of the population and we do not centrally record the cost of each offender on the probation caseload who accesses treatment in this way.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/17">Provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with alcohol misuse problems under the National Probation Service's supervision is commissioned at the local probation area level and is not recorded centrally. In particular, probation areas ability to deliver alcohol treatment as part of a community sentence is largely dependent upon the nature and extent of provision commissioned by local primary care trusts (PCTs) as part of NHS provision. In addition, the Ministry of Justice will be making seed funding available to probation areas to identify, support and disseminate best practice in working with alcohol misusers, although the exact sum has yet to be finalised.</p>

Re-offending behaviour can be influenced by not just the programmes run in prisons, but also the work of probation services and other partners once the offender has been released, as well as a wider range of socio-economic factors.</p>

	<p pid="b.365W.0/1">There were five cases brought against the Northern Ireland Office Core Department by its staff settled during the time specified. Four cases were on grounds of sex; two in 2004-05, one in 2006-07 and one in 2007-08. There was one case on grounds of race in 2003-04. All cases were settled out of court. There were no cases during this period based on sexual orientation.</p>
	<p pid="b.365W.0/2">The NIO has procedures in place for dealing with complaints of discrimination and the majority of complaints brought by staff will be dealt with under these procedures without recourse to Tribunals.</p>
	<p pid="b.365W.0/3">In accordance with Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, all personnel policies affecting staff are screened to ensure that they do not have an adverse affect on any of the nine groups specified under the legislation, which include gender, race and sexual orientation. In addition, NIO staff receive training on avoiding discriminatory behaviour in the workplace, including on the basis of gender, race and sexual orientation. Until recently, this took the form of mandatory equal opportunities awareness training for new staff as part of their induction. This has been replaced by a new diversity course which is currently being rolled out to the whole Department.</p>

The advantage of this venue is that it is close to the Olympic Park and Village which will improve the athlete and spectator experience by limiting travel and making it easier to attend other games events on the same day in the Olympic Park.</p>

The first group of adult apprenticeships is expected to start in September 2008. These people, who are already at level 2, will take a further two years in college and in employment training to qualify, and will complete in autumn 2010. The first group of 16 to 24-year-old apprenticeships is also due to start in September 2008 on a full four year apprenticeships ending in autumn 2012.</p>

The exact number of trainees and apprenticeships will be agreed by the National Skills Academy for Construction Partnership Board as part of the on-going process of establishing the training plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.2/2">The ODA strategy is focused on getting people into work and then onto the first level of training.

We were deeply disappointed that Iran's Interior Ministry and Guardian Council disqualified over a third of all prospective candidates who registered to stand, including a large proportion of reformist candidates. This denied the Iranian electorate their right to choose from candidates representing the full range of political views in their country and make a genuine democratic choice about how they are governed. We do not wish to take sides in Iran's internal debates, but together with the EU we will continue to stand up for the internationally recognised principles to which many Iranians aspire including freedom of speech and transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government.</p>

	<p pid="b.410W.7/1">In 2005 and 2006, we published guidance for local health organisations and their partners, to support delivery and improvement of local programmes for alcohol misuse interventions, 'Alcohol Misuse Interventions: Guidance on developing a local programme of improvement and Models of care for alcohol misusers'.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/2">To test out the best ways to identify and provide advice to people who are drinking more than is good for them, the Department has commissioned a programme of trailblazers to pilot identification and brief advice that is under way in general practitioner (GP) practices, accident and emergency departments and in Probation departments, in 57 locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/3">We have put in place a new national health service indicator to measure the change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol related harm from April 2008&mdash;the first ever national commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol health harms.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/4">This indicator is expected to encourage primary care trusts (PCTs) to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much, linked to advice and support from GPs or other health care staff&mdash;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of &quot;everyday&quot; drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems, including dependency.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/5">Since 2007-08 we have provided PCTs with an extra &pound;15 million of additional funding to improve alcohol interventions. The National Audit Office will carry out an audit of NHS spend on alcohol interventions and specialist treatment, with a report expected this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/6">Over the next three years, the Government will be actively supporting the full implementation of the published guidance, 'Substance Misuse in the Undergraduate Medical Curriculum'.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/7">This major development will, over the next 10 years, ensure around 60,000 new doctors leaving medical training in England will be able to deliver competent practice in both drug and alcohol misuse, including&mdash;as a crucial priority for implementation&mdash;the recognition and the management of risky and harmful alcohol consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/8">We have allocated &pound;650,000 in 2008-09 for the developmental work medical schools will need to carry out, to embed such an integrated substance misuse curriculum into core teaching and training programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.422W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/2">The Government take underage drinking very seriously. The National Alcohol Strategy 'Safe.Sensible.Social' published in June 2007, focuses action on three groups most at risk which are 18 to 24-year-old binge drinkers, young people under 18 who drink alcohol, and harmful drinkers whose drinking is damaging their health, often without them realising it.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/3">In the Home Secretary's speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February 2008</phrase>, she said that a number of new measures and possible steps would be taken to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour which is fuelled by alcohol. This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places. The Home Secretary also said that she is considering a number of options including making the possession of alcohol by a young person an offence, or possibly involving the parents if alcohol is confiscated from a child. We are currently considering the effectiveness of the current powers and what can be done to help the police use them more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/4">The Department for Children, Schools and Families will also be publishing an action plan later in the year on young people and alcohol which will contain further proposals for reducing drinking by young people. Additionally, two confiscation campaigns have taken place recently; one in October 2007 and one in February 2008. The results of the October campaign showed that nearly 3,700 litres of alcohol were confiscated from young people during the four week period.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/5">The Government also support schemes that make it easier for retailers to verify, and young people to prove their age. That is why we are working with the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should be accepted.</p>

	<p pid="b.423W.2/2">The Government continue to prioritise reductions in levels of alcohol-related disorder and antisocial behaviour. Through schemes such as Pubwatch and Best Bar None, we are continuing to support responsible management of licensed premises that results in reductions in alcohol-related crime and disorder. We have also held a series of enforcement campaigns that have targeted irresponsible premises and individuals that contribute to, or partake in alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour. This has involved meeting with retailers in local areas to raise awareness in respect of their responsibilities.</p>

In addition, we will make asset seizure more visible to local communities so those communities see the benefits of working with police and their partners to identify dealers.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.2/3">The Government have already invested heavily, including through the Drug Intervention Programme (DIP), in reducing drug related crime. DIP aims to get adult drug-misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment and other support. Delivery at local level is through local partnerships, using integrated teams (including drug workers in all custody suites) for which funding is provided in all areas of England and Wales, including smaller towns and communities. Since DIP began, acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug-related crime makes a substantial contribution&mdash;has fallen by around a fifth.</p>

	<p pid="b.436W.2/1">In October 2007, as part of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, we implemented a ban on the manufacture, import and sale of realistic imitation firearms, which evidence showed were being used in criminal activity to threaten and intimidate. The 2006 Act also increased to 12 months the maximum sentence for possessing an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/2">The police, together with SOCA and HM Revenue and Customs, are looking at the supply and availability of firearms as a priority. This includes items which contravene the recent legislation on realistic imitations.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.2/3">We have also recently increased the provision of search arches and wands in priority areas and, as part of the Tackling Violence Action Plan, have committed to providing additional search technology to the police and partner agencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.436W.8/2">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) does not hold address details, and it is not, therefore, possible to provide figures for the number of people who are resident in the Yorkshire area. The following table gives figures for people sampled by the Yorkshire police forces, however, these people may not be resident in the area in which they were sampled. There are two figures for each force: the number of profiles, and the estimated number of individuals. The number of profiles held on the database is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.8/3">At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent., that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent. fewer than the number of profiles.</p>

	<p pid="b.449W.3/1">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is committed to reducing the need to travel to meetings where this is practicable and appropriate. Our departmental blueprint sets out our vision to be innovative and have exemplary business operations. In developing our new headquarters building, Kingsgate House, we have installed state-of-the-art video conferencing and telepresence facilities, as well as phone conferencing. E-conferencing is also being used to give people the ability to attend meetings from their desks by accessing a shared workspace which enables interaction with colleagues. Our wide range of video conferencing facilities provide for ad-hoc one-to-one conversations as well as formal planned meetings and committees. These are seen as really positive steps within the Department and I do not believe that to develop an artificial target to increase video conferencing usage would deliver any additional benefits.</p>
