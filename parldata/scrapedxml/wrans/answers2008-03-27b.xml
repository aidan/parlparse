	<p pid="b.333W.0/1">The main sources of Government funding in 2007-08 for the nine English Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are listed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/2" class="italic"> Single Programme Budget</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/3">Since April 2002, the RDAs have been financed through a Single Programme budget (the &quot;Single Pot&quot;). Money from the six contributing Departments (BERR, CLG, DIUS, DEFRA, DCMS and UKTI) is pooled into one single budget. The funding, once allocated, is available to the RDAs in order to achieve the regional priorities identified in their regional economic strategies and the challenging targets set by them in their Corporate Plans. In 2007-08, the Single Pot allocated funding of &pound;2.3 billion to the nine English RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/4" class="italic"> European Regional Development Fund</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/5">The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was set up in 1975 to stimulate economic development in less prosperous regions of the European Union (EU). As EU membership has grown, ERDF has developed into a major instrument for helping to redress regional imbalances. Between 2007 and 2013, England will benefit from an investment of a further &euro;3.2 billion (approximately &pound;2.5 billion) of ERDF. The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) manages ERDF in England and provides programme funding directly to the RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/6" class="italic"> Rural Development Programme for England</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/7">The Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) is a 7-year (2007-2013) EU programme that aims to safeguard and enhance the rural environment, improve the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors and foster competitive and sustainable rural businesses and thriving rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/8">The overall budget for the Programme is approximately &pound;3.9 billion. Some &pound;600 million of this will be made available for socio-economic schemes aimed at making agriculture and forestry more competitive and sustainable, enhancing opportunity and the quality of life in rural areas, and diversifying the rural economy. This part of the RDPE is being delivered primarily by the RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/9" class="italic"> Business Resource Efficiency <i> and</i> Waste Programme (BREW)</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/10">In line with the landfill tax back to business commitment, the Spending Review 2004 (SR2004) announced that the additional revenues will be used to fund programmes to support business in improving its resource efficiency, including waste minimisation and diversion from landfill. The RDAs have been given the responsibility of co-ordinating the programme at regional level. In 2007-08, DEFRA has provided funding of &pound;10.9m through the Single Pot to the RDAs in respect of their programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/11" class="italic"> Northern Way Growth Fund</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/12">The Northern Way is collaboration, formed in 2004, between the three Northern RDAs of England (North West RDA, Yorkshire Forward and One NorthEast). Its aim was to work together to improve the sustainable economic development of the North towards the level of more prosperous regions in the UK. In 2007-08, CLG provided funding of &pound;25.8 million to the RDAs, this being the remaining contribution from Government toward the &pound;100 million Northern Way Growth Fund. BERR is now the lead Government Department for the Northern Way Growth Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/13" class="italic"> Social Enterprise Business Support</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.0/14">In the Social Enterprise Action Plan the Office of the Third Sector announced it would provide &pound;5.9 million to RDAs to improve Business Link's capacity to broker business support for social enterprises.</p>

	<p pid="b.334W.2/2">The Department has received no transfer of funds from the England and Wales fossil fuel levy for these purposes. However, the Sustainable Energy Act 2003 provides a power for the Secretary of State to direct Ofgem to pay into the Consolidated Fund up to &pound;60 million from funds paid to Ofgem and arising from the auctioning of renewable obligation certificates and electricity generated under non-fossil fuel obligation contracts. There is also a corresponding duty on the Secretary of State to spend a matching sum to promote the use of energy from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.334W.2/3">&pound;60 million was transferred to the Consolidated Fund in 2004-05 and formed part of the &pound;500 million which Government have announced they would spend from 2002 on R and D and capital grants for emerging renewable and low carbon technologies.</p>

This work followed extensive public debate about the state of childhood today and provided insights into the attitudes of parents and children themselves, including their views on appropriate roles for Government, councils, schools and families in creating the right conditions for happy childhoods. The research cost &pound;80,840 (including VAT). The outcomes have informed the Children's Plan, published in December 2007, and particularly the proposals for a new focus on improved opportunities for outdoor play. We will continue to draw on the research as we develop policies for implementing the Children's Plan to create better futures for children and families.</p>

Since then, VisitBritain has moved increasingly from print-based promotion of the tourist industry to electronic marketing. This meant that new ways of measuring the return on investment were necessary, as the old methodology had begun to produce unrealistic results by 2005-06.

	<p pid="b.347W.0/1">The Mobility Weapon Mount Installation Kit (M-WMIK) was identified as a solution in spring 2007, to meet a request from commanders in Afghanistan for an enhanced WMIK vehicle to complement the Land Rover based WMIK fleet. The M-WMIK will provide mobility for battle group support weapons and offers high levels of agility coupled with considerable firepower. The initial contract was signed in July 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.0/2">I am not aware of increased costs; this is the first time we have procured the M-WMIK vehicle. Some specialist users possess vehicles based on the same Supacat chassis, but the costs of these were broadly similar.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.5/1">Reserves in formed units, such as Territorial Army (TA) Battalions and Regiments, and Royal Auxilliary Air Force Squadrons, are in most cases maintained to provide a framework which parallels their Regular equivalent, as over the years this has been shown as the most effective and robust method of providing a framework, upon which reservist capability can be recruited, grown, nurtured and trained.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/2">In the case of the TA, it is the basis from which capability can be deployed on operations. Where possible, the Army tries to deploy TA personnel in 'cohorts', groups drawn from units listed on the commitments forecast. However the current operational requirement dictates that TA capability is deployed variously as individual reinforcements, formed sub-units and only in some exceptional cases&mdash;particularly field hospitals&mdash;as formed units. For a large scale operation a greater proportion of the TA would be deployed as formed sub-units and units, albeit that the latter would still be the exception.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/3">For the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, Squadrons are established for peacetime training purposes only. For the Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Marine Reserve, there are no units formed for operational deployment; they are administrative groupings only. Individuals, within them would deploy as reinforcements to other units.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-19">19 March 2008</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced a review into our Reserve Forces. This will examine how the Reserve can be optimised to meet current and projected defence requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.357W.2/17">In addition, the Prison Service owns residential properties. Numbers of vacancies vary but it is estimated to be between 25 and 30 at any one time and they are disposed of as soon as is practicable. Details of vacancies are not held centrally. Each individual prison establishment would need to be contacted to establish the exact number of vacancies which would be at a disproportionate cost to the Ministry.</p>

	<p pid="b.359W.0/1">Improving the skills and employment outcomes for offenders is one of our key objectives for reducing re-offending, and our priorities for action are set out in the 'Reducing Re-Offending through Skills and Employment: Next Steps' plan. The Ministry of Justice works closely with the Departments for Innovation, Universities and Skills, and Work and Pensions to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.359W.0/2">We recently published a Prison Policy Update briefing paper which set out our intention to increase the range of employment programmes available to offenders inside prison. This will be done in partnership with the private, public and voluntary sectors, who generally fund the work or training programme delivered. Individual prisons may need to cover the cost of setting up the programme but this information is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.361W.2/15">Provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with drug misuse problems under the National Probation Service's supervision is primarily delivered through the Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR), which has replaced the Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO). The Ministry of Justice expects to contribute &pound;22 million in 2008-09 to the Pooled Treatment Budget (PTB) (in addition to a &pound;20 million permanent transfer to the Department of Health) to pay for the treatment and testing for these orders. Probation areas are also broadly expected to spend &pound;39 million to provide the supervision and enforcement of these orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/16">For those offenders who are not sentenced to a specific drug misuse requirement as part of their community order, but who want or need to access treatment, referral to community drug services/clinical treatment is carried out on a voluntary basis. Offenders will have to access local treatment services on the same basis as the rest of the population and we do not centrally record the cost of each offender on the probation caseload who accesses treatment in this way.</p>
	<p pid="b.361W.2/17">Provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with alcohol misuse problems under the National Probation Service's supervision is commissioned at the local probation area level and is not recorded centrally. In particular, probation areas ability to deliver alcohol treatment as part of a community sentence is largely dependent upon the nature and extent of provision commissioned by local primary care trusts (PCTs) as part of NHS provision. In addition, the Ministry of Justice will be making seed funding available to probation areas to identify, support and disseminate best practice in working with alcohol misusers, although the exact sum has yet to be finalised.</p>

Re-offending behaviour can be influenced by not just the programmes run in prisons, but also the work of probation services and other partners once the offender has been released, as well as a wider range of socio-economic factors.</p>

In addition, NIO staff receive training on avoiding discriminatory behaviour in the workplace, including on the basis of gender, race and sexual orientation. Until recently, this took the form of mandatory equal opportunities awareness training for new staff as part of their induction. This has been replaced by a new diversity course which is currently being rolled out to the whole Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.372W.2/1">Around 2,000 trainees are expected to be on the Olympic site over the period of construction and between 85 per cent. and 90 per cent. of these (1,700 to 1,800) are likely to be NVQ level 2. The exact number of trainees and apprenticeships will be agreed by the National Skills Academy for Construction Partnership Board as part of the on-going process of establishing the training plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.2/2">The ODA strategy is focused on getting people into work and then onto the first level of training. The initial forecasts of the skill requirements for the Olympic site indicate that the requirement will be mainly civil engineering and construction skills rather than the traditional building craft skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.2/3">Accordingly it is currently expected that the vast majority of the trainee places will be NVQ level 2 and a minority at level 3. In addition there will be a significant proportion of level 3 trainees/apprenticeships on the Olympic Village.</p>

	<p pid="b.378W.2/2">The UK is continuing to press for the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). As the Heathrow consultation document states, under current proposals aviation emissions would effectively be capped at the average level over the period 2004 to 2006. This means that when the trading scheme is established, any additional aviation emissions above that level would lead to no increase in total emissions, since airlines would have to pay for the equivalent emissions reductions in other sectors.</p>

We continue to urge all countries similarly to live up to their commitments, including the promises made at the 2005 Gleneagles summit, and to achieve the millennium development goals. The successful recent replenishments of the World Bank's International Development Association and of the African Development Fund in 2007, to which the UK pledged &pound;2.134 billion and &pound;417 million respectively over the next three years, will ensure that low-income developing countries will continue to benefit from the concessional finance and expertise of these institutions.</p>

The reference period for Family Resources Survey figures is single financial years. Family Expenditure Survey figures correspond to single calendar years for 1979, 1981 and 1987, two combined calendar years from 1988-89 to 1992-93, and two financial years combined for 1993-95 to 1995-97.<br/> 3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, equivalised for household size and composition, as a proxy for standard of living. This uses the OECD equivalence scale for all years in the series.<br/> 4. The median income of the survey year in question has been used, namely the contemporary median, instead of using a fixed median for a particular year.<br/> 5. For after housing costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are deducted from income.<br/> 6. Amounts in the tables have been presented in millions, rounded to the nearest 100,000 children.</td> </tr>

As part of an initiative to reduce business travel, there is an existing programme, established in November 2007, to improve video-conferencing facilities as well as the number of systems deployed. This programme is supported by numerous communication events to heighten awareness of managers and staff. The Department is tracking usage of both video and audio conferencing facilities but has not set arbitrary targets. An additional conferencing tool will also be provided later in 2008 and this is expected to help provide further options to conduct more business from home offices and as a consequence reduce the amount of business travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the reasons for the proposed closure of the Jobcentre Plus office in Shepherds Bush. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus needs to constantly look at how it delivers its business to ensure that it is making best use of resources to deliver Jobcentre Plus services.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/5" class="indent">We are near to completing the rollout of the Jobcentre Plus Network and are therefore reviewing how we deliver services to customers. The investment in new technology and increased availability of Contact Centre facilities mean that increasing numbers of customers, including employers, access services via telephone and e-channels, such as the internet. This has changed the work of Jobcentres and we need to adapt to meet these changes. At the same time, we need to make best use of the resources available to us, and to provide value for money to the taxpayers, especially given the high cost of the London estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/6" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus London network was planned some time ago on the original business model and customer base. With the current business model we need significantly less office space than we currently occupy and we can deliver a more effective and efficient service by consolidating our operations in a smaller number of large sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/7" class="indent">A consultation exercise on the proposed closure of Shepherds Bush Jobcentre is in progress. The views of local stakeholders will be taken into account and no decisions will be made until the Minister has seen the outcome of the consultation. Customers in the area will still be able to access a face to face Jobcentre Plus service at Acton and Hammersmith Jobcentres.</p>

	<p pid="b.404W.5/1">The EU Common Position on Burma dates back to 1996 and imposes restrictive measures on members of the military regime, the military and security forces, the military regime's economic interests and other individuals, groups, undertakings or entities associated with the military regime who formulate, implement or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and their families and associates.</p>
	<p pid="b.404W.5/2">In November 2007, the EU strengthened the Common Position to add further state economic enterprises to the investment ban extant on Burmese state owned enterprises. Further restrictive measures include a ban on trade and investment in the timber, gemstones and other extractive industries, which provide a source of revenue for the military regime, including companies trading in these commodities.</p>
	<p pid="b.404W.5/3">In drawing up these measures, the aim of the EU is to target those closely associated with the regime and to minimise the impact on ordinary Burmese citizens.</p>

	<p pid="b.406W.2/1">Both in the UK and overseas, staff are paid subsistence to compensate for the additional costs of being away from home on official duty. Subsistence covers the cost of a room in a typical hotel and the costs of meals and other incidentals. Each post has a different daily subsistence rate depending on different economic conditions. Depending on local circumstances, Posts will normally book and pay for any hotel rooms direct, charging this back to the departmental cost centre for the member of staff involved. Our policy is to use standard hotels in the city concerned, typically non-luxury business hotels reasonably close to the Post.</p>

We were deeply disappointed that Iran's Interior Ministry and Guardian Council disqualified over a third of all prospective candidates who registered to stand, including a large proportion of reformist candidates. This denied the Iranian electorate their right to choose from candidates representing the full range of political views in their country and make a genuine democratic choice about how they are governed. We do not wish to take sides in Iran's internal debates, but together with the EU we will continue to stand up for the internationally recognised principles to which many Iranians aspire including freedom of speech and transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government.</p>

	<p pid="b.410W.7/2">To test out the best ways to identify and provide advice to people who are drinking more than is good for them, the Department has commissioned a programme of trailblazers to pilot identification and brief advice that is under way in general practitioner (GP) practices, accident and emergency departments and in Probation departments, in 57 locations.</p>

	<p pid="b.410W.7/4">This indicator is expected to encourage primary care trusts (PCTs) to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much, linked to advice and support from GPs or other health care staff&mdash;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of &quot;everyday&quot; drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems, including dependency.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/5">Since 2007-08 we have provided PCTs with an extra &pound;15 million of additional funding to improve alcohol interventions. The National Audit Office will carry out an audit of NHS spend on alcohol interventions and specialist treatment, with a report expected this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/6">Over the next three years, the Government will be actively supporting the full implementation of the published guidance, 'Substance Misuse in the Undergraduate Medical Curriculum'.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/7">This major development will, over the next 10 years, ensure around 60,000 new doctors leaving medical training in England will be able to deliver competent practice in both drug and alcohol misuse, including&mdash;as a crucial priority for implementation&mdash;the recognition and the management of risky and harmful alcohol consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.7/8">We have allocated &pound;650,000 in 2008-09 for the developmental work medical schools will need to carry out, to embed such an integrated substance misuse curriculum into core teaching and training programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.411W.5/1">There is no conclusive evidence that antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are addictive, in that they do not appear to lead to tolerance or dependence-forming, hence the Department has not implemented any policies to deal with this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.5/2">However, we know that some patients will experience withdrawal reactions on stopping or reducing their use of SSRIs, and in some cases the withdrawal reactions may be severe and disabling.</p>
	<p pid="b.411W.5/3">In 2005, the expert working group of the then Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) reported on the safety of SSRIs, which the Department currently regards as definitive. The CSM recommended that no one taking SSRIs should stop this treatment without prior discussion with their prescribing doctor, that SSRI usage should not stop suddenly, and that dosage should be reduced gradually at the end of a course of treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.414W.3/1">In June 2007, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommended mandatory fortification with folic acid of bread or flour alongside controls on voluntary fortification and guidance on supplement use to United Kingdom Health Ministers. In October 2007, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) wrote to the FSA to request a further expert view of the evidence on folic acid and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.414W.3/3">In the meantime, FSA officials will continue their discussions with industry about controls on voluntary fortification in food and caps on the levels of folic acid in supplements as there are 106,000 people in the UK exceeding the upper limit for folic acid from dietary and supplement sources. It is therefore important to control voluntary fortification and intake through supplements to ensure there is no further increase in these numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.3/4">The FSA has received representations from the trade associations of food supplements manufacturers and retailers regarding proposed controls on folic acid containing food supplements, capping folic acid at 200 micrograms. Information has been provided to the FSA on the types of products on the market containing folic acid and the recommended daily dosage. The FSA will undertake further modelling and the results will be discussed with the supplements industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.422W.6/2">The Government take underage drinking very seriously. The National Alcohol Strategy 'Safe.Sensible.Social' published in June 2007, focuses action on three groups most at risk which are 18 to 24-year-old binge drinkers, young people under 18 who drink alcohol, and harmful drinkers whose drinking is damaging their health, often without them realising it.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/3">In the Home Secretary's speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February 2008</phrase>, she said that a number of new measures and possible steps would be taken to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour which is fuelled by alcohol. This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places. The Home Secretary also said that she is considering a number of options including making the possession of alcohol by a young person an offence, or possibly involving the parents if alcohol is confiscated from a child. We are currently considering the effectiveness of the current powers and what can be done to help the police use them more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/4">The Department for Children, Schools and Families will also be publishing an action plan later in the year on young people and alcohol which will contain further proposals for reducing drinking by young people. Additionally, two confiscation campaigns have taken place recently; one in October 2007 and one in February 2008. The results of the October campaign showed that nearly 3,700 litres of alcohol were confiscated from young people during the four week period.</p>
	<p pid="b.422W.6/5">The Government also support schemes that make it easier for retailers to verify, and young people to prove their age. That is why we are working with the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should be accepted.</p>

Through schemes such as Pubwatch and Best Bar None, we are continuing to support responsible management of licensed premises that results in reductions in alcohol-related crime and disorder. We have also held a series of enforcement campaigns that have targeted irresponsible premises and individuals that contribute to, or partake in alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour. This has involved meeting with retailers in local areas to raise awareness in respect of their responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.2/2">The recently published strategy, 'Drugs: protecting families and communities' sets out clearly our future intention to take a robust stance against dealers and to reduce drug-related offending, including developing ways to regularly engage and respond to the needs of communities. In addition, we will make asset seizure more visible to local communities so those communities see the benefits of working with police and their partners to identify dealers.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.2/3">The Government have already invested heavily, including through the Drug Intervention Programme (DIP), in reducing drug related crime. DIP aims to get adult drug-misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment and other support. Delivery at local level is through local partnerships, using integrated teams (including drug workers in all custody suites) for which funding is provided in all areas of England and Wales, including smaller towns and communities. Since DIP began, acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug-related crime makes a substantial contribution&mdash;has fallen by around a fifth.</p>

	<p pid="b.436W.8/2">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) does not hold address details, and it is not, therefore, possible to provide figures for the number of people who are resident in the Yorkshire area. The following table gives figures for people sampled by the Yorkshire police forces, however, these people may not be resident in the area in which they were sampled. There are two figures for each force: the number of profiles, and the estimated number of individuals. The number of profiles held on the database is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="b.436W.8/3">At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent., that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent. fewer than the number of profiles.</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.0/2">The definition of serious criminality used within the Border and Immigration Agency is set out in published guidance. Cases which fall within that definition are prioritised in the legacy exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.0/3">All decisions on legacy cases are made on a case by case basis by caseworkers within the Case Resolution Directorate. The Border and Immigration Agency's website provides details of policy and guidance that staff follow when considering all cases.</p>

A detailed breakdown of the reasons for these removals could only be obtained by examination of individual case records at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.0/5">The Border and Immigration Agency is committed to the removal of foreign criminals who commit a serious crime in this country. We have repeatedly said we will target the most dangerous first. Increasingly we are deporting those who have received shorter sentences.</p>

	<p pid="b.441W.3/1">The Identity and Passport Service, and prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, the UK Passport Service, has introduced a range of measures that help to counter identity fraud. These include carrying out identity checks, investigating suspected identity fraud cases, implementing systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent applications for UK passports, systems to confirm the validity of UK passports presented to other organisations and the introduction of interviews for first time passport applicants over 16-years-old. As part of research into the cost of identity fraud to the UK economy published in February 2006, The UK Passport Service calculated the cost of measures to counter identity fraud when processing applications for UK passports issued in the UK at &pound;62.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/2">In addition, the Identity Fraud Steering Committee (IFSC), chaired by the Identity and Passport Service, has since 2003 been leading a cross public-private sector work programme to tackle identity fraud. There have been a number of successes and costs are given where available. Tougher criminal penalties have been introduced for driving licence and passport offences, alongside offences in the Identity Cards Act 2006 to target those who possess and use false identity documents and genuine documents belonging to someone else.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/3">The IFSC has also led on introducing more powers to share data to combat fraud, and most recently the Disclosure of Death Registration Information Scheme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-16">16 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/4">We have worked extensively to raise public awareness of identity fraud. A leaflet and the website:</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.identitytheft.org.uk">www.identitytheft.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/6">provide a quick and easy guide on things to look out for that indicate that a person may be at risk of becoming a victim of identity theft or fraud, or that they are already a victim. Over 13 million leaflets are in circulation and the website receives an average of 16,000 visits per month. Leaflets are printed by a range of partners on the IFSC, as well as banks and other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/7">Costs associated with the website are shared across IFSC members. The total cost to Identity and Passport Service in 2007-08 of the leaflet, poster and website is &pound;12,000. In 2006-07 Identity and Passport Service spent &pound;5,500 on printing leaflets. In 2005-06 the Home Office spent &pound;25,000 on identity fraud awareness material.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.3/8">We have also sought to ensure better co-ordination in prosecuting fraudsters. This has involved the establishment of a network of Single Points of Contact in all police forces and a range of Government Departments and agencies dealing with identity fraud investigations and prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.442W.2/1">Dispersal orders are one of a number of measures to tackle antisocial behaviour. They have succeeded in tackling underage drinking, joyriding, noise nuisance, the antisocial use of fireworks and the harassment and intimidation of residents. They are not intended to be used in isolation, but should form part of a tiered and integrated response to tackling crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour in local areas. This includes work by Youth Offending Teams to prevent young people getting involved in offending and antisocial behaviour. There are no plans to extend dispersal powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.2/2">While no assessment has been made of the efficacy of dispersal orders on their own, a study and report by the National Audit Office ('Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour', HC 99 Session 2006-07, <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase>) confirmed that a tiered approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is highly effective. This is also borne out by the fact that perceptions of antisocial behaviour have fallen by 4 percentage points from the baseline of 21 per cent. in 2002-03 to 17 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.445W.3/2">The insecurity in Darfur has forced many agencies to scale back operations at a time on increasing need. Although existing food stocks are sufficient for the next two months, the insecurity is hampering the ability of WFP and other agencies to stock pile food, medicines, shelter materials and fuel before the onset of the rainy season in May/June when needs will rise dramatically and logistics become extremely difficult.</p>

This sets out proposals to replace the Learning and Skills Council with two new systems. Responsibility for 16-19 funding will transfer to local authorities, supported by a new Young People's Learning Agency. For adults we propose to strengthen the demand led approach, including through the creation of a new Skills Funding Agency and a strengthened advice and support service.</p>

E-conferencing is also being used to give people the ability to attend meetings from their desks by accessing a shared workspace which enables interaction with colleagues. Our wide range of video conferencing facilities provide for ad-hoc one-to-one conversations as well as formal planned meetings and committees.

	<p pid="b.450W.3/1">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) was created by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.450W.3/12">The Government takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously. Data exchanges between the Student Loans Company and HMRC have all been reviewed following the Chancellor's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-20">20 November</phrase> to ensure they meet the appropriate security standards. No breaches of data protection protocols have occurred in respect of student loan administration. Furthermore, the provisions catering for the sharing of information in the Sale of Student Loans Bill will strengthen the framework for legal protection of data in respect of all loans, whether sold or unsold. The Bill will extend an existing criminal sanction prohibiting the wrongful disclosure of HMRC information outside the terms of the legislative gateway.</p>
