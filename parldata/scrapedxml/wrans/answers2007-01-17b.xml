	<p pid="b.1116W.5/1">The track record of the private sector in delivering water in developing countries has been mixed which is why DFID is interested in what works. And what works varies from place to place so the public versus private debate is not a straightforward one. The UN Human Development Report recognises that &quot;the most obvious lesson from any review of public and private provision is that there are no hard and fast cross-country blueprints for success&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/2">Successful public water utilities include ONEA in Burkina Faso, SANASA in Brazil and the National Water and Sewerage Corporation in Uganda (NWSC). The NWSC provides consultancy and advisory services to other utilities in East Africa. The formation of this business unit has been partly due to the strength of the private sector environment in Uganda. On the other hand the UN Human Development Report also notes that &quot;many publicly owned utilities are failing the poor, combining inefficiency and lack of accountability in management with inequity in financing and pricing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/3">In Cochabamba, Bolivia, the failure of private sector water provision led to rioting in the streets and the cancellation of the contract with the private provider. In Senegal on the other hand, private sector involvement helped create 81,000 new water connections and increased the country's water supply by 10 per cent. between 1996 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/4">The failure and success of both public and private utilities depends on more than ownership structure. Factors such as the level of inherited debt, the quality of regulation and the engagement of civil society are highly significant. The conclusion that DFID draws is to support what works best in each context in for the world's poorest people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/5">DFID's policy is that&mdash;where we can&mdash;we respond to requests from developing country governments for assistance to help improve the efficiency of their water utilities. Usually this involves DFID providing support to public bodies. In some cases, where the developing country government has a policy for participation of the private sector in service delivery, DFID may be asked to advise on how this might best be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/6">Nevertheless, the public sector continues to play the leading role in providing water and sanitation throughout the world. This is why most of DFID's aid (about 95 per cent. of our bilateral country programme expenditure on water and sanitation) supports the delivery of water and sanitation through governments, not-for-profit or humanitarian agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/7">Assessments of public and private provision have been completed by a range of international and research organisations including the World Bank. These studies (including a DFID-funded assessment by WaterAid of the impact of private sector involvement on the poor) reinforce DFID's view that the polarised debate about public and private utility ownership fails to grasp the complexity of the current situation. DFID believes that different approaches work best in different contexts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1117W.5/1">Under Saddam Hussein's regime, trades unions were part of the Ba'ath Party machinery and had very little independence. After the fall of his regime, trades unions effectively collapsed. Trades unions in Iraq are therefore relatively recently established. DFID provides support to trades unions through our Civil Society Fund (CSF) programme. There are two main aspects to this assistance:</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.5/2" class="indent">training trades union leaders; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.5/3" class="indent">providing a resource centre for trades unions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.5/4">DFID-funded training for trades union leaders is conducted through the UK public services trade union, UNISON. The aim is to contribute to the social and economic stability of Iraq by building the capacity of trades unions through the training of a new generation of union leaders. Training has focused on the role of trades unions in the workplace and society; negotiating collective agreements; union organisation; and women's involvement in the unions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.5/5">DFID support for a resource centre for trades unions in Baghdad has been undertaken with the International Centre for Trades Union Rights (ICTUR). The purpose of this project is to establish an independent NGO office to provide information, technical support services, expertise and legal advice to Iraqi trades unions and act as a centre for open discussions between trades unionists and the legal, academic and NGO communities. The centre studies and promotes basic principles of trades union and labour rights throughout Iraq and aims to influence government policies on labour rights and standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1119W.0/1">Officials from the Department for International Development have met with the Portland Trust on a number of occasions over the past three years and I met representatives of the Trust earlier this month. These have included bilateral meetings, meetings with other government departments, and meetings as part of wider discussions with other agencies to discuss ways of supporting economic development in the occupied Palestinian territory.

	<p pid="b.1119W.3/1">DFID will double its commitment to water and sanitation in Africa&mdash;where the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation are most off-track&mdash;to &pound;95 million a year by 2007-08. We will then more than double funding again to &pound;200 million a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1119W.3/2">In November, DFID published its global call to action on water and sanitation. This is our encouragement to developing country governments and to other donors to do more. It highlights the need for all of us to invest more in water and sanitation, to ensure that this money is spent effectively and fairly, and to put the right structures in place to make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1119W.3/3">For this to happen governments and the international community must organise themselves better and be held to account more effectively. To make this work we have proposed that there should be one annual report to monitor progress towards achieving the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goal targets and one high-level global annual meeting to agree action. At the country level there should be for water and sanitation one national plan, one co-ordinating group and one lead United Nations body.</p>
	<p pid="b.1119W.3/4">November also marked the recognition by the UK Government that safe and affordable water is a right for all. The right to water sets a global standard. It places a legal obligation on governments to ensure that everyone has equal access to water and it gives greater legitimacy to people's demands for water. It means that water services are not a matter of policy preference or charity but a legal requirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1120W.0/1">The UK provides core financial support to the International Development Association, the arm of the World Bank which provides grants and concessional loans to the world's poorest countries. Donors pledge support to IDA for a three-year period. In February 2005, the UK pledged &pound;1.43 billion to the fourteenth replenishment of IDA. This was comprised of (i) a core contribution of &pound;1.33 billion, to be paid in three equal instalments of &pound;443 million in 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09; and (ii) an additional contribution of &pound;100 million contingent on progress on harmonisation and conditionally, to be paid in two equal instalments of &pound;50 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08. Payment is by promissory note. Expenditure is charged to DFID's budget when the note is deposited with the IDA but notes will be encashed over a nine-year period. The UK will therefore spend &pound;493 million on IDA 14 in the current financial year. This represents approximately 10 per cent. of DFID's total budget in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.0/2">As part of our IDA 14 replenishment package, the UK also set aside a further &pound;250 million to support the World Bank in responding to specific needs arising from the enhanced focus in 2005 on Africa and the achievement of the MDGs. We committed &pound;200 million to the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF)&mdash;part of the Bank's Africa Action Plan resulting from Gleneagles&mdash;and &pound;50 million to the Education Fast Track Initiative (FTI), whose Catalytic Fund and Education Programme Development Fund are administered by the Bank. Payments commenced in 2006-07, when we expect to spend &pound;30 million on the ACGF and &pound;70 million on the FTI (&pound;20 million from the initial FTI commitment plus &pound;50 million from an additional commitment of &pound;100 million made in the autumn of 2005).</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.0/3">The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 per cent. relief on the debts owed by qualifying Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) to the IDA. The UK and other donors are making additional contributions to IDA to offset IDA reduced debt service receipts. To date the UK has paid &pound;26.85 million in additional contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.0/4">The UK is also a major contributor to other trust funds administered by the World Bank Group (mainly IDA, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Finance Corporation). Trust funds cover a wide range of activities. They can be used for the World Bank to provide technical assistance, advice and research, as well as supporting post conflict countries or co-financing projects. Some Trust funds support the Bank's own development operations and work programmes. Others support broad global initiatives&mdash;such as the Global Fund to Combat AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Global Environment Facility; and the HIPC Initiative&mdash;for which the Bank manages resources on behalf of the international community. Contributions to individual Trust Funds are normally determined and financed by the DFID Division with responsibility for the relevant country/regional/sector programme or policy issue. Details of expenditure through World Bank Trust Funds are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1120W.0/5">The UK has agreed to contribute up to &pound;50 million to the IMF's Exogenous Shocks Facility which helps poor countries to cope better with external shocks, such as an increase in oil prices. The first contribution of &pound;10 million was paid in 2005-06. Under the MDRI, the cost of cancelling the IMF debts of eligible countries will largely be met from the IMF's own resources. However, donors agreed to make a contribution towards these costs. The UK paid &pound;13.728 million in 2005-06. The UK also provided &pound;780,737 to IMF in 2005-06 to deliver technical assistance to a number of countries in Africa. Total UK expenditure of &pound;24.5 million on IMF in 2005-06 represented 0.37 per cent. of UK aid expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1121W.3/1">In order to ensure compatibility with WTO obligations and to respect the 'Understandings' reached with the US and Ecuador in 2001, the EU moved to a tariff-only regime for imports of bananas with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>. I am aware that certain Latin American suppliers maintain that the EU tariff of &euro;176/tonne is too high, even though the quota ceiling on their potential exports was removed as part of the new import regime. I am also aware that some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) suppliers consider that the tariff is too low to maintain their access to the Community market. Following introduction of the new import arrangements, the Trade Minister of Norway was appointed as facilitator and mediator of an independent panel monitoring imports of all bananas into the EU. The Commission has stated that the findings of this independent panel will allow changes to be made if appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1126W.6/1">Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005, on the protection of animals during transport and related operations, applies to the transport of live vertebrate animals that takes place in connection with an economic activity. The term 'economic activity' is not defined in the regulation but my Department has provided a view on its meaning in guidance, which is available on the Defra website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1126W.6/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/farmed/transport/eu-transportreg.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/farmed/transport/eu-transportreg.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1126W.6/3">In this guidance, we have taken the view that the regulation applies to animals transported as part of a business or commercial activity that aims to achieve financial gain, whether direct or indirect, for any person or company involved in the transport. Commercial pet breeders are given as an example of such transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1126W.6/4">However, there are those who keep animals as a hobby, take them to shows, and occasionally breed from them with any surplus animals often being sold. We would not consider this to be economic where the income source does not exceed the expenses of the hobby and the primary purpose is for pleasure or competition and not as part of a business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1127W.2/1">Defra is committed to developing the understanding young people have of both where and how their food is produced. Defra provides approximately 1 million per year in payments to farmers who provide educational visits to their farms by schools, colleges and special interest groups, free of charge, as part of their Countryside Stewardship or Environmental Stewardship (Higher Level) agri-environment scheme agreements. These schemes are the single largest provider of farm visits in the country with approximately 1,000 farms in England taking part.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.2/2">Countryside Educational Visits Accreditation Scheme (CEVAS) training is advocated to all farmers providing Stewardship educational access visits. This provides training and an annual farm health and safety inspection for providers of farm education visits. This enables teachers to choose farms safe in the knowledge that the farmers have the right skills to give the children an interesting educational experience in a secure environment. Defra will provide &pound;146,000 amounting to 50 per cent. of the funding for CEVAS during 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.2/3">Defra is providing &pound;60,000 in 2006-07 to Farming and Countryside Education (FACE), which helps young people learn more about food, farming and a sustainable countryside. Defra also gives a &pound;50,000 grant to the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs each year to support a range of educational activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.2/4">In addition, my officials and ministerial colleagues have worked closely with our counterparts at the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health, and other stakeholders, to support the industry-led Year of Food and Farming. This initiative aims to reconnect children and young people with food, farming and the countryside. It will run through the academic year September 2007 to July 2008. A series of national, regional and local events, and learning resources will be supplemented by a wide range of other activities for children to participate in, including visits to food and farm businesses. Defra will provide &pound;30,000 of funding for this financial year to support the start-up phase of the project and further funding to support communications activities. Defra has also seconded a member of staff to the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) to work on the initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.2/5">Sir Don Curry, chair of the Sustainable Farming and Food Delivery Group is leading work on the initiative, and has written to the devolved Administrations encouraging them to participate in the year.</p>

DEFRA has provided &pound;30 million over three years for funding infrastructure improvements. The Agency spent 9m in 2005-06 and is on course to spend &pound;10.6 million in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.1134W.0/1">The UK financial services sector, including insurance, is contributing an increasing share of UK economic output, accounting for 8.6 per cent. of UK Gross Domestic Product in 2005 and supporting over 1 million British jobs. The UK's trade surplus in financial services was &pound;19.1 billion in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.0/2">London is the world's leading international financial centre, with unparalleled scale, scope and internationalism. 70 per cent. of global secondary bond market trading takes place in London, along with over 40 per cent. of over-the-counter derivatives trading, over 30 per cent. of world foreign exchange business, over 40 per cent. of global trade in foreign-listed equities, and 20 per cent. of cross-border bank lending. Over 250 foreign banks are based in the UK&mdash;more than in any other financial centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.0/3">The success of the UK's financial sector depends on a number of factors, including our tradition of openness, innovation, high-level skills, world-class regulation and a competitive business environment. London has proved an attractive location for both EU and non-EU financial services providers, with non-EU providers benefiting not just from London's large pools of liquidity and broad international investor base but also from London's position as a gateway to European financial markets. The Government are working with the financial sector, including through the Chancellor's high-level group on financial services, to ensure its continued success.</p>

	<p pid="b.1136W.5/1">Most food is VAT zero-rated. The VAT liability of low calorie foods generally follows the VAT liability of their mainstream food equivalents, and they may be zero or standard-rated depending on the nature of the product and the way that it is supplied. This has been the case since VAT was introduced in 1973 and there are no proposals to change this.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.9/1">The chairs in the catering areas of Portcullis House were recently replaced due to their repeated structural failure. They had been replaced once under guarantee, but by 2006 were uneconomic to repair as they were no longer under guarantee, and the original manufacturer had gone out of business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.9/2">The cost of replacement chairs, including an additional quantity to meet the Administration Committee's recommendation for more seating to be provided in the Portcullis House catering areas, was &pound;57,800 plus VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.9/3">The old chairs that remain safe and fit for purpose will be sent to the Government approved auction house for disposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.9/4">A three to five-year life expectancy for contract-quality chairs in a high-usage catering environment is considered normal in the hospitality industry.</p>

The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations seek to protect those using the job-finding services provided by employment agencies.

	<p pid="b.1145W.9/4">The inspectorate investigates every relevant complaint it receives, which would include those concerning temporary agency workers' terms and conditions of employment, and, which indicate a possible breach of the legislation. It also undertakes targeted spot checks in those sectors where, on a risk-based analysis, they consider that breaches of legislation are more likely to occur. It does this by visiting agencies' premises, where appropriate, and examining the records.</p>

The contractual liability rests with the local authority who carry out a value for money (vfm) assessment of the overall costs to the public sector before signing a contract. This vfm assessment takes account of both the financial costs and the expected value of risk transferred to the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155W.8/2">For financial penalties, a European Union Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February 2005</phrase>. It provides for member states to recognise and enforce fines imposed on their nationals and residents by other member states. It will close the loophole that allows an offender to effectively evade punishment by leaving the member state that imposed the financial penalty. The Government are taking the necessary action to implement this measure in the United Kingdom as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.8/3">In addition, in the Road Safety Act 2006, we introduced provisions to enable the introduction of a Graduated Fixed Penalty and Deposit scheme to help enforce penalties against offenders for traffic and roadworthiness offences such as overloaded lorries, where the offender cannot prove they have a satisfactory United Kingdom address at which a summons could be served. A deposit could be taken by either the police or VOSA enforcement officers in lieu of a fixed penalty notice or in more serious cases in lieu of a Court hearing. The offenders will therefore not be able to avoid paying the appropriate penalty by simply leaving the country as the sum will already have been taken. The Act also allows, in any case where a prohibition has been issued and where either the driver or vehicle is deemed unfit to continue with the journey, that both the police and VOSA enforcement officers will in future be able to immobilise a vehicle if they believe there is a risk that a driver will continue with his journey whilst under prohibition. The details of the schemes will be subject to a consultation in 2007 with a view to implementation later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.8/4">I and the Irish Transport Minister jointly undertook in February 2006 to work together to initiate cooperation between the United Kingdom and Ireland on one another's driving disqualifications. Once initiated, this would mean that a resident of Ireland, disqualified from driving in the United Kingdom, would not escape the consequences of that disqualification when he returned home. It would also mean that similar measures applied to a resident of Great Britain or Northern Ireland disqualified in Ireland for a motoring offence committed there. We plan to take this step within the framework established by the 1998 European Union Convention on driving disqualifications. We had originally intended that this practice should be initiated in the early part of 2007. There has been some unavoidable delay to this work, but I remain committed to bringing such mutual recognition into effect as soon as practicable. Officials from all three jurisdictions are working closely together to this end and we expect to consult on details in the course of 2007.</p>

Low calorie hot chocolate, tea and coffee are also allowed. There is a requirement for drinking water to be provided free of charge to registered pupils on school premises.

	<p pid="b.1173W.8/1">We have been following the development of the draft Prohibition of Mercenary Bill very closely and are urgently investigating the potential consequences for South African personnel currently serving in the UK armed forces, should the legislation be enacted, so that we can support those who may be affected. We value, greatly, the service given by South African personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173W.8/2">Representations have been made by the Secretary of State for Defence to the South African Defence Minister on the potential implications the proposed legislation would have on recruitment and retention of personnel into the UK armed Forces. A visit is being planned to South Africa to enable MOD officials to hold face-to-face discussions with the South African Department of Defence to try and resolve some of the uncertainties.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175W.6/1">The programmes supporting sporting and cultural provision offered by my Department and its non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are available in all towns of England, including coastal towns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/2">Here are some examples of the many actions we have undertaken or plan to improve the (i) economic competitiveness and (ii) quality of life for residents of coastal towns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/3" class="indent">The investment we make through Visit Britain to support its promotional expenditure promotes and contributes to the visitor economy of Britain as a whole, including coastal towns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/4" class="indent">We have invested in a number of large scale projects such as leisure centres, multi-sport facilities etc in coastal towns around England through Sport England's community investment fund and Active England funding since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/5" class="indent">We recognise that the reuse and restoration of historic buildings and areas is a way of achieving a sense of place and local identity. Restoring the historic environment creates jobs and helps underpin local economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/6" class="indent">The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has funded 655 projects totalling &pound;250.7 million in English coastal resorts. Many HLF funding schemes have complemented or levered in extra funding from regional development agencies, the single regeneration budget and the European regional development fund. HLF funding has also benefited other seaside towns including former mining and fishing towns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/7" class="indent">There have been 520 lottery awards in the Hartlepool constituency, with a total value of over &pound;28.2 million since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>, the most notable award being one of just over &pound;4 million from HLF towards the restoration of HMS Trincomalee. These have generated partnership funding of approximately a further &pound;24 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/8" class="indent">The Regional Screen Agencies are actively involved in programmes in coastal towns and areas, including encouraging filming, supporting film festivals and supporting a range of community education projects. These help encourage more production to film there, and raise the profile of these areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.6/9" class="indent">The Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy will be the venue for the Olympic and Paralympic sailing events in 2012. Hosting the games will provide enhanced facilities on the site that will provide an outstanding sailing legacy for all levels, from beginner to world class including disabled. The development will also act as a catalyst for the continued regeneration of the area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1177W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177W.2/2">Digital switchover is expected to have an impact on both transmitter power usage and consumer power usage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177W.2/3">Digital transmission is more efficient than analogue in terms of power usage. Replacing the analogue terrestrial transmission network with a nationwide digital terrestrial television network will lead to a significant net reduction in energy usage by the transmission networks, estimated to be 186 GWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177W.2/4">Consumer power usage is expected to rise as a result of switchover, primarily because of the rapid increase in the take-up of set-top boxes, particularly for second sets, which would not be otherwise converted until replaced. The predicted level of the increase is dependent on a number of assumptions about the usage and the design of equipment in the market at the time of switchover. DCMS, DTI and DEFRA economists have estimated that the increase in consumer energy use attributable to switchover in 2012 is likely to be between 966 GWh and 2,816 GWh per annum. The increase is equivalent to a 0.37 per cent. increase in domestic electricity consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177W.2/5">The central estimate for the total impact of switchover is a net increase of 1,705 GWh per year, but this would be reduced if industry makes more energy-efficient products. Work on this is being taken forward as part of the DTI usability action plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177W.2/6">Further details are contained in the 'Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment: the timing of digital switchover', published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.1179W.2/14" class="indent">Following its recent structural and staff changes, Sport England should re-establish its understanding of national governing bodies and their sports; seeking to understand them, know them, support them, challenge their thinking and, where possible, provide them with the resources to deliver their plans&mdash;to hold them to account but not to judge them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/15" class="indent">Sport England should support, as appropriate, all the sports under the scope of the review so that the breadth of choice remains for those participants and prospective participants who may not be attracted to the major sports&mdash;and may even dislike them!</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/16" class="italic"> Rec 2:</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/17" class="indent">Sport England should work with the NGBs to identify where new investment will have most impact, building on the findings outlined in the report. This will mean funding different areas and different levels for different sports, as their needs dictate e.g. for one sport, investment in community clubs may be most appropriate; for others, it could be the development or strengthening of county or even regional centres of excellence; and for some of the smaller sports, this may mean providing them with help to develop their plans in greater detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/18" class="italic"> Rec 3:</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/19" class="indent">Sport England should devise an application process to enable funding to be released as quickly as possible, as many NGBs already have robust plans in place and have identified key areas for investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/20" class="italic"> Rec 4:</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/21" class="indent">Sport England should acknowledge that differing sports are at different stages of evolution in their talent development programmes and will require different types and levels of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/22" class="italic"> Rec 5:</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/23" class="indent">Sport England should ensure that all sports are supported in the most appropriate way for them. Sport England, while working through its regions, should not lose sight of the bigger national picture for each of its sports. Sport England regions will determine which sports they can provide substantive support to but Sport England must ensure there is a mechanism in place to support other, smaller sports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/24" class="indent">Sport England must ensure that sports can deliver national programmes, albeit with regional variations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/25" class="italic"> Rec 6:</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/26" class="indent">Sport England should seek to play a role that individual NGBs would find difficult or impossible to do for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/27" class="indent">Sport England should seek to &quot;add value&quot; to the work of the NGBs by providing services that they would find difficult to resource/provide themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.1181W.3/1">It is not possible to answer the question in precisely the terms asked. My Department's Lottery Grants Database, which uses information supplied by the Lottery distributors and can be searched at <a href="http://www.lottery.culture.gov.uk">www.lottery.culture.gov.uk</a>, records 40 awards in which the phrase 'post office' occurs in the project description. Approximately one-third of these are to do with village halls or other community facilities buildings which provide, among other functions, post office services. The other awards listed were made for a variety of purposes. For example, there are two awards to groups of post office pensioners, one to an adult education project also supported by Consignia plc, and several to projects which happen to be located near a post office.</p>

	<p pid="b.1181W.6/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that the whole of the UK, including the West Midlands, can contribute to and benefit from the 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games. We are working closely with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and the Nations and Regions Group (NRG), chaired by Charles Allen, which brings together representatives from every nation and region. Each nation and region is developing its own plan to maximise the impact of the games in its area, as well as the wider opportunities to deliver a sustainable legacy from the games.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.6/2">The West Midlands Leadership Group for the 2012 games (the regional steering group) will be working with LOCOG to maximise the opportunities of the London 2012 Volunteering Strategy for the region. Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency for the West Midlands, will also be hosting business opportunities workshops over the forthcoming months in partnership with West Midlands Business Council, including providing more detailed guidance on procurement opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.6/3">LOCOG is also developing its plans for how the Cultural Olympiad will be delivered in the regions, and has conducted a tour of the regions to establish how best to make the festival a truly UK-wide event. LOCOG's plans currently include a nationwide torch relay, and we are currently setting up the Legacy Trust, to support cultural and sporting programmes designed to support the games, across the UK. Coventry will also host the UK Schools games in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.6/4">LOCOG will be working, through the Nations And Regions Groups and through a comprehensive ticketing strategy, to ensure that as many people as possible throughout the UK can participate in the games by attending events. Further detailed information regarding plans for future involvement and activities can be provided for the West Midlands by the relevant NRG co-ordinator, Jenny Drew (Culture West Midlands, The Regional Partnership Centre, Albert House, Quay Place, Edward Street, Birmingham, B1 2RA).</p>

Nothing in the new proposals will take away from our efforts in tackling organised crime in Northern Ireland through the recovery of assets. Our aim is that they will improve and enhance our efforts to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185W.0/3">In recognition of the high profile, public confidence and success achieved by ARA in Northern Ireland in tackling organised crime and dealing with organised criminals, SOCA will have a designated officer responsible for asset recovery work in Northern Ireland, and there will be no diminution in the resources available for assets recovery work there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185W.0/4">Subject to the passing of the necessary legislation the merger is likely to come into force from April 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190W.2/2">Penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) were introduced under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Under the PND scheme, police may issue a fixed penalty of either &pound;50 or &pound;80 for a range of minor disorder offences. The recipient of a PND has 21 days from the date of issue in which either to pay the fine or to request a court hearing. Failure to do either will normally result in the PND being registered as a fine against the recipient at one and a half times the penalty amount or, in exceptional circumstances, in proceedings against them for the penalty offence. No other sanction is currently available to deal with non-compliance of a PND.</p>

	<p pid="b.1194W.11/1">The contract under which the Harmondsworth Removal Centre is occupied and managed by the contractor includes a dispute resolution procedure which is founded upon the Arbitration Act 1996. English law requires such disputes to remain confidential to the parties. Therefore, it is not open to the Secretary of State to disclose detail of the disputes without the consent of the other contracting party.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.11/2">The Secretary of State was able to disclose the amount of the settlement to Parliament. It should be noted that pursuant to the Lord Chancellor's pledge that Government Departments would utilise alternative dispute resolution wherever possible the parties entered into a mediation agreement with a senior member of the bar which agreement contained a confidentiality clause in line with the confidentiality attendant upon the arbitration of disputes. It follows that the Secretary of State cannot disclose details of the contractual points in issue or the date when they were first raised.</p>

	<p pid="b.1195W.5/1">The information requested is not available centrally. Identity fraud is not a crime that is currently defined as such in law. At present most cases dealt with by the police, where a person's identity has been used unlawfully to obtain property, are dealt with as deception offences under the Theft Act 1968 and recorded in the Home Office classification for 'Other frauds'. However, deception offences cannot be separately identified from other offences recorded within the 'Other fraud' classification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195W.5/2">In July 2006, the Home Office brought into force sections 25 and 26 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which created new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents. Such offences are recorded under the 'Other forgery' classification but again cannot be separately identified from other offences within that classification.</p>

This has been partly through the development of an electronic system for booking visits, which is available to prisons, and the publication of guidelines on practical ways of improving the arrangements. NOMS is also looking into the booking of visits by e-mail and in the longer term, a national fully integrated IT system to meet a number of business needs such as the management of visits booking.</p>

In response to this publication we have received general expressions of interest and requests for further information from a number of organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.6/2">These expressions of interest have been received both informally via established contact forums and more formally via the recently established NOMS National Provider Network registration website. To date 374 voluntary and community sector and 68 private sector organisations have registered an expression of interest via the website. However the website does not ask registrants whether they have a specific interest in undertaking work which is currently carried out by the probation service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.6/3">Additionally, individual probation services will have been in contact with external organisations as part of their preparation of service delivery plans for 2007-08. Over the coming months, these plans will be the subject of discussion and negotiation with the NOMS commissioner for their region. Although the average value of contracts held is small, a recent survey indicated that the probation service as a whole currently holds more than 600 contracts/grants with external organisations, approximately 75 per cent. of which are from the voluntary and community sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1208W.3/2">The taskforce is an important forum for consulting business on how best to boost UK business engagement in Asian markets. Since its inception in October 2005, the taskforce has discussed and made recommendations on the challenges faced by UK companies operating in Asian markets and how to raise awareness among UK companies of the potential opportunities in these emerging markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1208W.3/3">The taskforce has commissioned three research reports to explore differing aspects of UK-Asian Trade. This research, along with the experience of taskforce members, has informed the development of UKTI's new five year strategy: directing the focus onto large and medium sized companies in addition to its existing work with small businesses to ensure UKTI helps a wider range of companies, and instigating a shift in resources towards emerging markets. It has also led to the development of a programme which will target and support 950 mid-corporate companies which are not sufficiently engaged with Asia and which are not currently served by UKTI.</p>

We will continue to support the Iraqi Government, security forces, judiciary and civil society organisations to develop a more secure country with a representative Government able to work for all Iraqis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213W.6/1">The UK is deeply concerned about the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation and the increasing violence in Sri Lanka, and particularly about the impact of continuing violence and military actions by the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on the civilian population. This has already claimed the lives of at least 40 civilians this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213W.6/2">We strongly endorse the UN's recent call for all civilians in Sri Lanka to be protected. We understand that there are at least 15,000 civilians in the Vakarai area who are in a desperate situation. As a minimum, there should be a cessation of hostilities around Vakarai to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to send in humanitarian supplies to the people there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213W.6/3">Both the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE must cease military action and implement the agreements they had reached to reduce the violence. Recent incidents demonstrate that neither side is protecting the civilian population. We urge them to return to the negotiating table in order to prevent further deterioration of the security situation and the needless loss of more lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.1215W.8/1">Decisions about funding Sanctuary Schemes are local decisions and local authorities have a number of funding options available to them. For example, schemes could be funded through a local authority's Private Sector Renewal Strategy. In the case of social housing the funding could come from the landlord. The police or the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership may have grants, or one-off funding to target crime reduction which could be directed to funding Sanctuary Schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.0/1">The Regional Co-ordination Unit does not have any proposals relating to sub-national statistics for its knowledge network briefing engine. The purpose of the knowledge network briefing engine, which was launched in 2002, is to produce compact briefing documents called &quot;Fact Files&quot; on regions and major cities in England for Ministers to use on regional visits. Although originally built by Cabinet Office, the briefing engine system is now maintained externally. The RCU contributes &pound;30,000 a year towards the maintenance of the system.</p>

Authoritative reviews of the toxicological data for numerous chemicals are published by international organisations such as the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, a joint World Health Organisation (WHO)/International Labour Organisation/United Nations Environment Programme venture) and WHO (air and water quality guidelines). Various groups in the United Kingdom including expert advisory committees (the committee on carcinogenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, the committee on mutagenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, the committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, and the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants) and agencies (such as the Health Protection Agency) also make such assessments, as, indeed do agencies in other countries, such as the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in the United States of America.</p>

The campaign raises awareness through support for health promotion events, the provision of printed resources, media briefings and the SunSmart website. By so doing, and by targeting specific at-risk groups, the campaign aims to reduce the prevalence of skin cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.0/2">Cancer Research UK and the Department have worked with other departments and organisations in raising awareness of issues related to skin cancer and in developing the SunSmart campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.0/3">The campaign has helped schools to develop their own sun protection policies through school guidelines and curriculum resources for use in the classroom. The healthy schools programme, a joint Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills initiative, is currently building a new website. This will signpost advice and good practice on a range of health matters which can be made available to schools including the dangers caused to children at school by excessive exposure to sunlight. Cancer Research UK also consulted extensively with the Health and Safety Executive in developing the prevention campaign for men and outdoor workers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232W.3/1">There are at present no specific mechanisms or regulations that relate to the use of unsupervised/coin-operated sunbeds by under-16s. However the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has issued guidance which advises against use by those under 16. Cancer Research UK has also worked with representatives of the industry to help improve information for both staff and customers. That includes the displaying, of information specifically discouraging the use of sunbeds by young people under 16. In the light of concerns about unsupervised tanning salons and coin-operated sunbeds, the Department is planning further discussions with the HSE and other stakeholders to see whether the existing guidance aimed at sunbed operators and customers needs to be strengthened.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.6/2">We have made steady progress in reducing teenage pregnancies since the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched in 1999. Between 1998 (the baseline year for the strategy) and 2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 11.1 per cent. and the under-16 rate has fallen by 15.2 per cent. Both rates are now at their lowest level since the mid-1980s. However, we need to accelerate progress to achieve the challenging PSA target to halve the under-18 conception rate by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1232W.6/3">Progress in local areas is variable, with some areas seeing significant reductions in their rates, while in other areas rates are static or increasing. That is why we have issued detailed delivery guidance to local authorities and PCTs setting out what has worked in areas with sharply declining rates. All areas have been asked to review their local strategies in the light of these findings and reflect them in their forward plans. We have also provided new analysis on the underlying factors that increase the risk of teenage pregnancy, to help local areas target their strategies in high-rate neighbourhoods and on young people at greatest risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.1233W.2/1">The Food Standards Agency welcomes and encourages the voluntary initiatives some businesses have undertaken to reduce the trans fats levels in their food products. However, any product reformulation to reduce the levels of trans fats (generally through the removal of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil) should not result in increases in the saturated fat levels in foods. Dietary intakes of trans fats are well within maximum recommended intakes, whereas saturated fat intakes currently exceed public health recommendations. Consequently saturated fat intakes represent the greater heart health risk and remain the priority.</p>
