	<p pid="a.3W.9/1">In terms of participation in sporting events, all service personnel are treated the same be they able-bodied or disabled, and policies are in place to aid them in volunteering for sporting events, including applications for special paid and/or unpaid leave and taking part in representative sport. Financial assistance in the form of grants from non-public funds can also be awarded. A number of athletes are engaged in full-time training.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.9/2">Sport plays an important part in the development of the attributes required in service personnel and has a significant effect upon morale. It provides an inducement to physical fitness and contributes to military effectiveness by encouraging personal qualities such as courage, resilience and esprit de corps.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.9/3">Fulfilment of sporting expectations is also an important retention and recruitment factor. All members of the armed forces are therefore encouraged to participate in sport in the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.9/4">Assistance to former members of the armed forces to enable them to qualify for the London 2012 Paralympics is provided by their national governing body. This assistance can be supplemented by the Combined Services Adaptive Sports Association (Battle Back&#8212;Sport) when required, primarily in the form of grants from non-public funds.</p>

The MOD takes advice from its own legal advisers on issues relating to the recruitment of under-18s as the requirement arises. That legal advice is confidential and will not be disclosed. We are satisfied that our policies on under-18s in service are robust and comply with national and international law. In addition to the comprehensive welfare system that is in place for all service personnel, we remain fully committed to meeting our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and have taken steps to introduce special safeguards on young people under the age of 18. An example is our recent announcement that for those under the age of 18, the ability to be discharged will in future be a right up to the age of 18, subject to an appropriate period of consideration or cooling off.</p>

	<p pid="a.14W.6/1">I expect the cost of the UK&#8217;s involvement in NATO operations over Libya to be modest in comparison to other operations such as Afghanistan. While it is still too early to give a robust estimate of the final costs, I can provide initial indications of average accommodation, allowances, munitions and fuel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.6/2">We maintain a small presence in Naples and Poggio but the majority of the UK personnel in Italy are based at Gioia Del Colle air base and Trapani naval base. The average weekly total cost of accommodation at Gioia Del Colle, Trapani and Poggio is around &#163;240,000, &#163;33,000 and &#163;12,000 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.6/3">There are two types of personal allowance paid to service personnel in Italy. Longer separation allowance (LSA) is paid on an accrual basis for military personnel separated from their families and will continue to be paid for the duration of the operation. The total cost of LSA in Italy is around &#163;120,000 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.6/4">Local overseas allowance (LOA) is paid for personnel on operations before a complete welfare package has been set up as is currently the case in Poggio and Naples. The total cost of LOA in Italy is around &#163;11,000 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.6/5">The gross book value (inclusive of VAT) of precision guided weapons fired in support of Operation Ellamy between <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-19">19 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-08">8 May</phrase> this year was around &#163;6 million per week. Where there is sufficient contingency within current stock holdings to meet anticipated requirements for current and contingent operations, the Ministry of Defence does not intend to replenish all stocks of weapons deployed. We therefore cannot say at this stage how much of this sum will contribute to the charge against the Government Special Reserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.6/6">Aviation fuel costs average around &#163;300,000 per week, although they vary significantly week by week.</p>

	<p pid="a.15W.8/1">'Mission accomplished' is not a term employed in mission reports as whether the desired effect of a given sortie has been achieved may not often be immediately apparent&#8212;for instance, if the aircraft had attacked a target, further analysis may be necessary to determine the extent of the resulting damage. Aircraft may also fulfil other tasks, for instance reconnaissance or deterrence, and indeed conduct multiple tasks on the same mission, further complicating the assessment of the results of an individual sortie. Therefore there is no common definition of a mission accomplished rate and this information is not held.</p>

	<p pid="a.21W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) are the UK's only truly national police force, covering the four constituent parts of the country. The force's main responsibilities are to protect the personnel, resources and property of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) through the use of a variety of policing methods. These include community policing, armed guarding, specialist firearms units, nuclear escorts on land and sea, operational support units, the UK's largest marine policing capability, public order policing, criminal investigation including fraud and intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.5/2">The use of the above functions varies from site to site in accordance with local requirements and the associated risk/threat. Sites covered include selected naval bases, garrisons, Atomic Weapons Establishments, US Visiting Forces sites, and non-MOD locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.5/3">MDP officers may also volunteer for overseas duties in support of UK missions. They provide specialist training, support, monitoring and mentoring to local law enforcement and government agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.3/1">The reforms in the Localism Bill will assist councils in providing a robust safety net for the homeless. Local housing authorities will still be required to secure suitable accommodation for households who are eligible for assistance, homeless through no fault of their own and in 'priority need' (eg families that include a dependant child or pregnant woman and people who are vulnerable for some reason).</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.3/2">The proposed homelessness provisions in the Localism Bill provide local authorities with additional flexibility so that they can also bring the duty to an end with an offer of accommodation in the private rented sector without requiring the applicant's agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.3/3">We are putting additional protection in place for those provided with private rented accommodation ensuring the tenancy must be for a fixed term of at least 12 months and the homelessness duty will recur if the applicant becomes homeless again within two years through no fault of their own, regardless of whether they still have priority need.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.3/4">We have maintained the level of investment in homelessness grant for local authorities and the voluntary sector, with provision of &#163;400 million in total over the next four years. We have established a new cross-Government working group on homelessness, bringing together Ministers from eight Government Departments, working with Local Government Association as well as voluntary sector partners to address the complex and multiple causes of homelessness and rough sleeping.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.6/1">The most successful action to tackle homelessness is strongly rooted in local communities. The voluntary and community sector is instrumental at local level in tackling rough sleeping, often in direct response to local concerns about the visibility of the problem. The best local authority homelessness prevention services are shaped around local need. This is an example of big society in action.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.6/2">The Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness brings together eight Departments to address the complex causes and improve support for homeless people. The Ministerial Working Group is working with local government and voluntary sector partners to remove bureaucratic barriers, giving communities greater freedom to do what works best in their areas.</p>

Schools are expected to comply with Data Protection legislation and ensure the security of personal information. In 2008/09 Becta produced guidance on data security for schools. In 2007 they also developed guidance in liaison with the Information Commissioner's Office, for those schools choosing to use biometric authentication systems. This guidance remains valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.49W.2/2">The coalition agreement of May 2010 promised to outlaw the finger-printing of children at school without parental permission. The Government have introduced new legislation in the Protection of Freedoms Bill, currently going through Parliament, to regulate the use of biometric recognition systems in schools and colleges. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that no children's biometric data are taken, in schools or colleges, without parental permission. The provisions would also give children the right to refuse to use biometric systems and ensure that alternatives are provided for children or their parents who opt out of using biometric technology. Subject to the passage through Parliament, the Department for Education will issue advice to schools making their duties under these provisions clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.2/2">The Government are committed to refocusing school inspection for maintained schools, academies and free schools, around the core areas of pupil achievement, teaching, leadership and behaviour, and safety. We have no plans to ask Ofsted to assess the implementation of nutritional standards for school food as part of this new inspection focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.2/3">Governing bodies of maintained schools and local authorities are responsible for ensuring that school food meets the required standards. Parents are increasingly knowledgeable about the importance of healthy eating and are well placed to hold schools to account for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.2/4">Free schools and academies, established since September 2010, are not required to comply with the school food standards, and are free to promote healthy eating and good nutrition as they see fit.</p>

They will be required to provide lunches where there is demand and free school meals to all pupils who are eligible and wish to take up their entitlement. We have no reason to believe that Free Schools will not provide healthy, balanced meals that meet the current nutritional standards. As part of the broader freedoms available to Free Schools, we trust the professionals to act in the best interests of their pupils.</p>

We want to discourage schools from focusing on pupils on the C/D borderline to improve the school's standing in league tables. Performance tables will therefore include measures of pupil progress and average point scores which capture the full range of outcomes for all pupils. While we will continue to publish A-C indicators, we will also publish a wider range of information, in a supporting dataset, such as the percentage of pupils achieving A*-G in the English baccalaureate subjects and the percentage of pupils achieving 5+A*-G at GCSE or equivalent. Full details of the content of the 2011 performance tables will be published, later this term, in our annual statement of intent.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.2/2">Reforming performance tables to increase flexibility and interrogative functions, is part of our ambition to improve accountability and increase transparency. The objective is to create a fully flexible dataset that will: allow parents, inspectors, governors, and the public to challenge schools on their performance; support school improvement; and open up underlying data to allow users to create and compare the information of most importance to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.8/2">There is already a legal duty on schools to promote the well-being of their pupils. Within that, it is for school governing bodies and local authorities, rather than central Government, to determine their own policies on supporting pupils with medical needs. Good schools and local authorities will work with parents and local health services so that the medical needs of children, such as those with myalgic encephalomyelitis, are met while they are at school.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/3">As we said in the Schools White Paper, &#8216;The importance of Teaching&#8217;, good schools have a vital role as promoters of health and well-being in the local community, and have always had good pastoral systems. They understand well the connections between pupils' physical and mental health and their educational achievement. We believe that the majority of the important work that schools do is not as a result of government prescription, and so the Department has no plans to change the existing arrangements or to bring forward new legislative proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/4">This Department, together with the Department of Health, produced guidance for schools in 2005, entitled &#8216;Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years&#8217;. This recommends, among other things, that there should be a clear policy in each school, an individual health care plan for any child with medical needs, and training for staff. The guidance can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.60W.9/3">The Government are reviewing what further action can be taken to communicate the impacts of air pollution more effectively, and, through a partnership approach, establish stronger messages about tackling the health impacts of air pollution and what action people can take to reduce air pollution. Examples of such initiatives include &#8216;active travel&#8217;, which promotes walking and cycling, leading to reduced health risks and improved air quality; and &#8216;smarter choices&#8217; measures aimed at behaviour change. The Government will continue to investigate measures to improve air quality and will shortly be consulting on their plans to achieve limit values for nitrogen dioxide.</p>

	<p pid="a.61W.2/1">A licensed injectable badger TB vaccine is already available for use on prescription. Experimental studies have demonstrated that vaccination is safe and effective in reducing the progression and spread of TB in badgers. DEFRA is funding a Badger Vaccine Deployment Project to assess the practicality of vaccination in the field and to train lay vaccinators. However, while we would expect vaccination to result in reduced transmission of bovine TB to cattle, we currently have no hard evidence on this. Therefore, the precise contribution vaccination could make to reducing disease in cattle is unknown.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/2">It is important to note that vaccines can never represent a single answer to the problem of bovine TB. Vaccination is a risk reduction measure, most likely to be successful in controlling bovine TB when used alongside other disease control measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/3">Despite the relative lack of scientific evidence, the public consultation document made clear that we do see a role for vaccination. We are carefully considering the large number of responses we received to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.0/1">Under the Care Quality Commission&#8217;s (CQC) current methodology, every provider should be reviewed at least every two years. However, in line with the principles of proportionate, risk-based regulation, the CQC carries out site visits based on its judgment of risk and where a site visit is the most effective way of gathering information about compliance. This enables the CQC to target its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low. Site visits will therefore take place wherever necessary to gather information about compliance.</p>

Provider compliance assessments are not mandatory. When carrying out a review, the CQC may ask to see any provider compliance assessment that has been undertaken and this information may add to the evidence base upon which the inspectors judgment is founded.

Information on the number of surgical resections and proportion of deaths is provided at trust and cancer network level for the period from 1998 to 2006 and is available on the NCIN website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.2/3">An eAtlas of preliminary information for trusts with significantly better or worse post- operative mortality rates than expected during 2002 to 2006 was also published. This showed that the performance of trusts with worse than expected 30-day post-operative mortality rates in 2003 to 2006 had improved in 2007-08. The NCIN has advised that information for 2007-08 will be updated in due course when analysis is complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/4">A data briefing summarising some of the key findings in relation to year of diagnosis and stage of diagnosis is also available on the NCIN website.</p>

	<p pid="a.77W.0/1">&#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, sets out a range of actions to improve survival outcomes for all cancers in England, including haematological cancers. These actions include diagnosing symptomatic cancer earlier, helping people to live healthier lives to reduce the incidence of preventable cancers, screening more people, introducing new screening programmes and ensuring that all patients have access to the best possible treatment, care and support. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.0/2">We know that cancer patients greatly value the care and support of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). The results of the 2010 Cancer Patient Experience Survey show that 81% of haematological cancer patients reported having a CNS. To support the national health service to develop the CNS work force, the strategy sets out our intention to build the evidence base for the benefits and costs savings that CNSs can offer. This follows an independent report we published in December 2010 that showed that, in many scenarios, the costs of additional support roles are likely to be outweighed by the savings that can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.0/3">For many people with cancer, being supported to stay in or return to work can provide a huge boost to self-esteem, financial security and emotional wellbeing. Through the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative, we are working in partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support to ensure that cancer survivors receive the support they need to live as healthy and as active a lifestyle as possible. This work includes looking at models of support to enable those cancer survivors who want to, to get back to work. Seven vocation rehabilitation pilots were established in 2010 to take this work forward, and these are set to run until July this year.

	<p pid="a.77W.3/1">Although the Department has not formally evaluated any research specifically in these areas it does aim to keep abreast of major developments in research relevant to its responsibilities. However, we do know that good social relationships and connectedness are associated with a range of positive outcomes, including better physical and mental health. Reducing isolation and building supportive social networks and relationships promotes good mental health and recovery as well as preventing mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.3/2">Physical illness greatly increases the risk of mental illness and mental illness can itself be a causal factor in the onset of physical disease. Depression is associated with a two-fold increased risk of coronary heart disease and unhealthy behaviour such as poor diet, less exercise, self-harm and significantly greater prevalence of smoking and drug and alcohol misuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.78W.2/1">There are a number of indicators in both the Quality and Outcomes Framework for General Practitioners and the NHS Operating framework for hospitals to support better care for older people around dementia care, hospital acquired infections, readmission rates and non-payment for emergency readmissions. In future, all licensed doctors will need to revalidate regularly, if they wish to keep their license to practise up to date and fit to practise. However, the content and standard of health care training is the responsibility of the independent regulatory bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.78W.2/2">The Government are also funding several national audits on continence, falls and bone health, hip fracture, dementia care in general hospital through the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership by involving all hospitals to promote transparent information about care gaps. There are National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines in place for a range of conditions and pathways affecting older people including continence, nutrition, delirium, dementia, falls and bone health.</p>
	<p pid="a.78W.2/3">In addition, local commissioning is also informed by joint strategic needs assessments for the local population and the Care Quality Commission also has a regulation and inspection function for primary care services. However many of these solutions depend on high quality local clinical leadership and advocacy from professional bodies such as royal colleges and specialist societies.</p>

	<p pid="a.82W.3/1">Under the Care Quality Commission&#8217;s (CQC) current methodology, every provider should be reviewed at least every two years. However, in line with the principles of proportionate, risk-based regulation, the CQC carries out site visits based on its judgment of risk where a site visit is the most effective way of gathering information about compliance. This enables the CQC to target its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low. Site visits will therefore take place wherever necessary to gather information about compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.3/2">The CQC cannot predict the number of site visits which will take place, or proportion of providers visited, since decisions about whether a site visit is required are based on judgment of risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.0/1">Funding for health, alongside all other public services, was reviewed and set for the next four years as part of the comprehensive spending review, published in October 2010. The majority of health funding is currently allocated to primary care trusts (PCTs) and this was most recently reviewed and set for the current financial year (2011-12) in December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/2">For next year (2012-13), the usual process for reviewing the allocations of national health service funding continues. The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) continually oversees the development of the weighted capitation formula which is used to allocate PCT funding. It makes recommendations to the Secretary of State for Health on potential changes to the formula between PCT allocation rounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.5/5">Some councils are making changes like sharing back office services, and caring for people in their own homes instead of expensive residential care. By making these types of changes, councils can protect other front-line services.</p>

In order to do this, AEA used different price points&#8212;&#163;4/GJ, &#163;6/GJ and &#163;10/GJ&#8212;and different assumptions about how far non-financial constraints to the development of the market are overcome. Figure 3.2 in the report shows the potential contribution that various feedstocks could make to biomass supply in the UK up to 2030, on the basis of different combinations of the assumptions. The &#163;6/GJ price point does not refer to a specific feedstock but is one of the sensitivities set out in the report.</p>

If the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) is classified as tax and spend then the Government would expect to make some increase to the levies cap to accommodate this. Controlling the impact of ECO on consumer bills and ensuring its aims are met cost-effectively will be central to its design irrespective of whether it is classified as tax and spend and subject to the control framework, or as regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.5/1">Following the Macondo Incident, the UK's Offshore Oil and Gas Industry established a joint industry and Government Group&#8212;the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group (OSPRAG)&#8212;to review the UK's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills. This group, in which DECC participates, identified the need for a dedicated UK capping device that could be used on a variety of wells, not just those in deepwater, and industry is currently constructing a device for deployment in UK waters. This should be ready for use by late summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/2">In addition, Chevron, who are currently drilling on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). Have developed a capping stack for the Stena Carron deepwater drilling operations, that is located in Stonehaven (near Aberdeen) and can be deployed within nine days of an incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/3">There are also other devices which are commercially available, that could be deployed to an incident worldwide, and one of the well control companies has decided to locate a device in Aberdeen to supplement the equipment that is currently located in Houston.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/4">In the UK, unlike the USA, there is no limit on companies' liability for clean-up and compensation. Operators on the UKCS maintain insurance or make other provisions to cover drilling and other operational risks together with the legal liabilities associated with clean-up or other remediation measures. For all new drilling operations, my Department requires confirmation that appropriate insurance cover is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/5">In addition, operators are parties to the Offshore Pollution Liability Association Ltd (OPOL). This requires operators to demonstrate separate provision to meet third party clean up costs and associated damages of up to $250 million in the event of a pollution incident. OPOL members collectively also provide a back-up mechanism in the form of a guarantee in the event of operator default, to meet claims for clean up and associated damages up to the same financial limits. The Department also carries out checks to confirm membership of OPOL.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/6">OSPRAG has also set-up a sub-group to review liability, indemnity and insurance provisions that would be invoked in the event of a spill. This group are currently undertaking a study to look at estimates of the cost of oil spill clean-up in the UK and whether the OPOL limit is sufficient to cover these costs. DECC is participating in this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.2/2">DECC records expenditure on subscriptions and membership fees but does not specifically collect data on the number of subscriptions and memberships held. It would incur disproportionate costs to investigate all payments to determine how many individual fees and subscriptions were paid for. Membership fees and subscriptions are taken out for a number of reasons. DECC pays membership fees to secure UK representation on eight international energy and climate change bodies. Where staff hold or are training for professional qualifications they are required to subscribe to professional institutes, for example accountants, lawyers, economists. DECC also takes out subscriptions to access a wide range of printed and electronic data required to deliver the Department's objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.113W.2/2">The Environment Agency, working with Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, monitors air and rain at seven locations around the UK. The analysis and reporting is mainly on a quarterly basis, with some variations and the analytical requirements are given in the table. Under this Euratom programme, analyses for uranium are not carried out at any location. Samples from Aberporth in Wales are analysed for certain isotopes of plutonium in both air and rainwater and the Environment Agency reports these annually. All the results are reported in the annual publication &#8216;Radioactivity in Food and the Environment&#8217;. The latest report (2009) is available on the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) website.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/3">The Environment Agency adjusted its programme slightly during March and April to check on radionuclides arriving from the Fukushima accident in Japan. The particular adjustments were to analyse filters that were changed weekly before normal processing, to ensure that short half life radionuclides were analysed appropriately. Results from this Fukushima-related monitoring have been placed on the Health Protection Agency's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.117W.9/4">For the right to request time to train, we are not able to estimate the how many businesses will benefit on average as a result of this decision as costs are calculated on a per request basis not a per business basis. We estimated in the impact assessment (IA) we published in January 2010 that the cost of dealing with a successful request would be around &#163;319. This covers an estimated procedural cost of &#163;90 for dealing with the request and &#163;229 for accommodating the request.</p>

The published IA does not break this down by business size for the same reason as the right to request time to train. The IA estimated that the cost of dealing with requests would be approximately &#163;62 per initial request and &#163;123 per appeal.

This can be further broken down to an equivalent annual figure with a cost to SMEs per annum of &#163;1.6 million, and the cost to large employers of &#163;0.02 million per annum. There would also be costs as a result of dual discrimination cases against private sector employers of &#163;1.0 million per annum.

This is the case across the income distribution, in both cash terms (Chart A.2) and , as a proportion of net income (Chart A.3).

	<p pid="a.140W.2/1">The London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) has placed 6.6 million tickets for the London 2012 Olympic games on sale to the UK public, including special prices for young people in a &#8216;Pay Your Age&#8217; scheme for over 200 sessions. Further tickets will go on sale for the Paralympic games in September, with prices for young people starting at &#163;5. As the Paralympic games take place in term-time, LOCOG will particularly encourage school groups to attend by providing group packages.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/2">In addition to the main ticketing process, LOCOG has also announced a scheme called Ticketshare. Through a levy on those purchasing hospitality packages for the London 2012 games, Ticketshare will donate up to 100,000 tickets for children and young people in schools and colleges across the UK. To be eligible, schools and colleges need to apply to join the Get Set Network, part of LOCOG's education progamme. 50,000 of these tickets will go to schools and colleges in London, and 50,000 will go to schools and colleges across the rest of the UK. In addition, the Mayor of London has provided 75,000 additional tickets for London schools and colleges.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/3">The tickets will be distributed through the Get Set network, and therefore the numbers to each nation/region will depend on the number of schools and colleges that apply by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-16">Friday, 16 December 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.141W.2/1">The whole of the UK stands to benefit from the London 2012 Games, including those through direct contracts and their supply chains; from tourism, the investment in sport and through the opportunities for schools and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/2">The Nations and Regions Group, established by the Government Olympic Executive (GOE) and the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG), works directly with each UK nation and region to help them realise and maximise the benefits from the economic, sporting and cultural opportunities offered by the games.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/3">The games will also provide a focus for the tourism industry. The Government&#8217;s Tourism Policy, published in March, aims to help the tourism industry achieve its potential for growth through a range of measures. This initiative aims to generate 4 million extra overseas visitors over the next four years bringing in an extra &#163;2 billion worth of visitor spend and helping to create 50,000 new jobs across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/4">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and LOCOG procurements continue to provide business opportunities for companies across the UK, in particular the SMEs which benefit from supply chain opportunities. LOCOG is now accelerating its procurement programme. It is procuring &#163;700 million worth of contracts for goods and services across eight sectors&#8212;including performance and events, security, sports and technology. It will require a workforce of around 200,000 people, including 6,000 staff, up to 70,000 volunteers and up to 100,000 contractors. The procurement process for contractors was launched at the end of 2009 and most of the contracts will be awarded by the end of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/5">The games will also provide a sporting and cultural legacy across the UK. We are introducing the school games, a new school sport competition which will provide more opportunities for pupils to compete in sport through a vibrant programme of regular intra and inter-school competitions. Through the Inspire Programme cultural and sporting projects can link their events and projects in an official capacity to London 2012. Get Set, the London 2012 education programme, aims to enhance young people&#8217;s learning through sport, culture and education and the Legacy Trust UK will help communities from across the UK build a lasting legacy from the games.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.2/6">In addition, the &#8216;Places People Play&#8217; programme has been created to bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring people to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy.</p>

The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. For example, the steel reinforcements for the Olympic Stadium&#8217;s podium structure came from Express Reinforcement in Neath, while Bluebay Building Products, based in Cardiff provided reinforced concrete for the bridges and highways on the Olympic Park.</p>
	<p pid="a.142W.3/33">The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.2/1">Claims to the employment tribunals may be classified into two broad categories: singles and multiples. Multiple cases are where two or more people bring cases, involving one or more jurisdiction(s) usually against a single employer but not necessarily so (for instance in transfer of undertaking cases) and always arising out of the same or very similar circumstances. As a multiple, the cases are processed, and judicially managed, together.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/2">Statistics published annually and quarterly by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service provide a breakdown of claims received. In recent years this breakdown has included that between single and multiple claims. The following table sets out the claims received by employment tribunals in each of the last five financial years for which data are available, including the proportion of multiples and single claims lodged. However, employment tribunals do not categorise claims as &#8216;private sector&#8217; or &#8216;public sector&#8217;. Therefore, no statistics are collated centrally on this divide, whether in respect of multiple claims or more widely, and it is not possible to report on this aspect. While a manual search of individual case records might give some indication, such work could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost.</p>

An authorised absence from prison can be for a number of reasons, such as release to outside hospital or for release on temporary licence to assist with prisoner resettlement. Release on temporary licence requires a prisoner to be absent from prison for at least one night.

	<p pid="a.160W.5/1">Security breaches are defined as any incident involving visitors or outsiders where the security or control of the establishment has been breached, or there has been an attempt to do so. To provide details of the nature of each security breach would involve locating, examining and summarising each of the 249 incident reports which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.160W.5/2">Typically, though, incidents may involve unauthorised access to the prison by members of the public, such as authorised visitors attempting to gain access to non-authorised areas of the prison or intruders found in, or attempting to enter, the prison grounds. Some incidents may be connected with attempts to bring unauthorised articles into the prison, or damage to the physical security of the prison perimeter or other acts of vandalism.</p>

Eligible prisoners are able to rent televisions from the Prison Service for a weekly rental charge of &#163;1 per set, per week or part week.

	<p pid="a.170W.3/1">The only minimum sentences provided for in the sentencing framework are seven years for a third Class A drug trafficking offence under section 111 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, three years for a third time domestic burglary under section 111 of the 2000 Act, and five years for unauthorised possession of certain firearms (three years if the offender is aged under 18) and the Criminal Justice Act 2003, unless the courts find exceptional circumstances or that it would be unjust to impose the sentence in an individual case. In addition, there is the mandatory life sentence for murder under the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.2/1">Table 1 shows the number of 18 to 20-year-olds in custody each month since January 2008. The trend has been of a steady decline since August 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.2/2">Young adults sentenced to detention in a young offender institution are detained in young offender institutions (YOIs) as required by section 98 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. These are normally self contained but in some instances are situated within an adult prison with which they share the majority of their facilities. Whatever the location, young adults detained in YOIs have separate sleeping accommodation and are always managed in accordance with the YOI rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.2/3">We are committed to retaining specific provision within the secure estate for young adult offenders. Our &#8220;Breaking the Cycle&#8221; Green Paper sets out a broad reform agenda to drive improved results for all offenders in the secure estate, including young adults.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.2/5">In reference to the answer I provided to question 39586 on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-14">14 February 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-02-14.590"><i>Official Report</i>, column 590W</phrase>, it has come to light that the population and operational capacity figures were incorrect in that they did not include data for YOI Hindley for June 2008 and that the data used related to the last Friday of the June, rather than, as stated, the last day of the month. This has been amended and the correct information is set out in Table 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.2/6">Between 2005 and the present, all young adult offenders sentenced to detention in a young offender institution have been detained in designated young offender institutions (YOIs), as required by section 98 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.0/1">The European Commission wrote to the UK Government in January, expressing the view that the UK's international air services agreements with the Russian Federation were inconsistent with its obligations under the treaties governing the European Union. The Commission invited the Government to submit its views in accordance with Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.0/2">The Government responded to the Commission in March pointing out certain misunderstandings in the Commission's assertions. In particular it was pointed out that there is no restriction on which airlines may be designated by the UK to operate under the agreement, whether on grounds of nationality or otherwise. The Government also questioned other assertions in the Commission's letter and concluded that the UK has satisfied its obligations under European law.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.0/3">While acknowledging the desirability of modernising the current air services arrangements with Russia, the Government did not consider that the revocation of the bilateral Air Services Agreement would be a proportionate response.</p>

The new projects are testing a diverse range of technologies and operating models and will help to inform the wider roll out of infrastructure across the country. We have been working closely with the new projects to ensure they learn from the experiences of first round projects. They will move from detailed planning to implementation throughout the coming year, with the East of England project the first to have installed charge points so far.</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.9/1">As part of the Government's measures to address climate change, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) ensures a growing proportion of UK road transport fuels are from sustainable renewable sources. The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase the efficiency of compliance. The value of individual certificates is determined by the market. To date the RTFO has met its objective of driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK. Therefore the introduction of a minimum floor price is not considered necessary at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.189W.9/2">We are currently consulting on proposals to amend the RTFO to implement the Renewable Energy Directive. These proposals include providing additional support for biofuels derived from waste that meet certain mandatory standards for sustainability by awarding two Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates to each litre of such fuel supplied. Crop-based biofuels will continue to get one certificate per litre, as long as they meet the mandatory sustainability standard. In this way the proposed change would give twice the financial support to biofuels derived from waste as conventional biofuels, and no support to biofuels that do not meet required sustainability standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.194W.2/21">The Department for Transport has re-started discussions with five train operating companies (First Great Western, London Midland, South West Trains, Northern and Trans Pennine Express) about plans to provide additional carriages. The companies are currently developing updated proposals for consideration by the Department, and until these have been evaluated and commercial negotiations have concluded, it is not possible to be certain as to which rolling stock will eventually be used in each franchise.</p>

Any upgrade to Euston within the confines of the existing station would be particularly disruptive, and far more so than the phased station redevelopment proposed for HS2. However, as there are no plans for further major infrastructure upgrades on the WCML, neither we nor Network Rail have made an assessment of the disruption associated with such work.</p>

These do not run contrary to security, but are integral to longer term stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.204W.2/1">The Government are deeply concerned that the reported breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with the Shan State Army North has led to renewed conflict in Shan state. We have received reports which allege that the Burmese army has attacked local communities, whom they suspect of assisting the armed groups, and perpetuated human rights abuses. We understand that the fighting is taking place in the north-central area of Shan state, which is difficult to access and as such the information is hard to verify. In a Security Council debate on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-10">10 May</phrase>, we called upon all armed actors including the Burmese army and ethnic militia to protect the civilian population. The Government secured a strongly worded human rights resolution at the March UN Human Rights Council which called on the Burmese Government to end continuing grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including the targeting of civilians in conflict areas. The UK also highlighted our serious concern during a meeting with other EU member states on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May</phrase> and underlined the importance for the EU to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.206W.5/1">The Digital Diplomacy department in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) encourages the use of social media to deliver the FCO's foreign policy priorities. All senior diplomats are given digital training before heading out to post, including on social media. The digital unit is in constant touch with diplomats at post, working with them to increase their use of social media for use in communications, engagement and in monitoring, in order to gain a wider picture of events. Our social media presence is strong, and growing, allowing us to respond to foreign policy challenges in a new way. FCO missions and staff currently engage through Facebook and Twitter with over 300,000 followers across the two, and with a growing number of local-language social media in key countries (e.g. Sina.com in China). A significant, and growing, number FCO staff also write blogs, often in local languages, many of which are picked up by online publications in their host countries. We also make significant use of social media to get messages to British nationals in consular crisis situations and are working with social media partners to increase the reach of our presence on such platforms.</p>

In these negotiations the Government will press the EU institutions to ensure that funding for external action adds value and has a positive impact.

	<p pid="a.209W.0/1">There are oil production facilities both in those parts of Libya still controlled by the Gaddafi regime and those controlled by the opposition. However, due to the disruption to the Libyan oil sector caused by the conflict and shining areas of Regime and opposition control, it is not possible to give an accurate estimate as to the balance of control of these facilities. Against this background, Government analysis indicates that at present the Regime has effective control over about 75 to 80% of Libya's oil production capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.2/1">In November 2010 the coalition Government published &#8220;Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&#8221; which set out the planned changes to the entitlements to full funding Further Education and Skills for adults in England. Learners aged 19 up to 24 will be entitled to full fee remission for their first qualification at level 3. Outside of this entitlement, there is an expectation that the learner will share the costs with the Government; with co-funding in the 2011/12 and 2012/13 academic years, and the introduction of Government-backed loans from 2013/14.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/2">The Statistical First Release<sup>(1)</sup> provides the latest data on the proportion of starts and completions for learners at Level 3. Based on historical data we estimate that 3,000 learner places at level 3 could become co-funded rather than fully-funded in 2011/12. However, as the further education funding system is demand led it is not possible to predict the number or proportion of adults that will be required to pay a fee for a first level 3 qualification beyond 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.5/1">The Merlin Agreement set out the commitment of five major UK banks to increase the capacity of lending available to UK businesses this year. The commitment to make available &#163;190 billion of new lending to businesses is up from &#163;179 billion last year. &#163;76 billion of this will be allocated to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a 15% increase on 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.5/3">The commitment to lend to SMEs is linked to the remuneration of the banks' chief executives and senior managers responsible for business lending, but the Government are clear that, if the banks fail to meet their commitments, the Government reserves the right to return to the matter and take further measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.219W.8/4">Government strongly advises people to be very wary of unsolicited offers which sound too good to be true, as they often are. And in those cases where people receive material through the postal system which they believe may promote a fraud, they should draw their concerns to the attention of the appropriate authorities to allow them to take any necessary action.

	<p pid="a.221W.2/1">Over the course of the spending review, the Department continues to focus on driving long-term, sustainable growth while finding efficiencies and reducing levels of spending to meet the target savings. Around 10% of resource savings will be made by cancelling lower priority activities, for instance through ending Train to Gain and replacing it with small and medium enterprise (SME)-focused training programme, and through abolishing the regional development agencies in 2012. Reforms to further and higher education funding will deliver 60% of the total savings target, and the remainder of savings will largely be delivered through driving efficiencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.222W.7/1">As part of the spending review tough decisions about departmental budgets have been taken and, like all other areas, further education has made its contribution. This has included reviewing the extent to which automatic fee remission for adult skills is provided, and in this context we have prioritised English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) funding to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the employment and support allowance (work-related activity) group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for other people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace. Increased freedoms and flexibilities for providers will allow them to respond to the needs to their communities and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>

	<p pid="a.226W.5/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, will respond shortly. He has raised the matter of fair access to credit for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) such as Ms Rope's business via correspondence; however, it would be inappropriate for Government to urge banks to offer finance to specific businesses contrary to their own risk assessment procedures. However, we continue to robustly support the case for the UK's SMEs in our discussions with the banks.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.2/1">The Department seeks to enable UK businesses, particularly manufacturers, to benefit from opportunities resulting from the growing global civil nuclear market. This has been mainly in the form of providing market information, helping to develop capability and competitiveness, and support for research and innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/2">The provision of such support has been made primarily via the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC), for which this Department provided a &#163;30 million capital and start-up grant, and via the low carbon and advanced manufacturing elements of the Manufacturing Advisory Service, which has included assistance on civil nuclear new build and decommissioning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/3">In addition, a grant for business investment has been provided to Rolls-Royce towards the development of a new civil nuclear facility in an assisted area. This was part of a &#163;45 million package deal that will also see the company build new aerospace facilities in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.2/4">Direct and indirect support is also provided to various companies through the activities of the BIS funded research councils and Technology Strategy Board (TSB). This includes: funding for research and training provided to universities, which often collaborate with business; through research council funded activities; recent funding of &#163;2 million for business-led feasibility projects via the TSB, and further funding for NAMRC which will be supported as one of the seven partners that will come together to form the first Technology and Innovation Centre, focused on high value manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="a.230W.2/1">Most British companies with significant interests in Japan have returned to normal business. One or two, with assets in the affected Tohoku region, suffered direct damage and are working on repair and recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.2/2">A poll of foreign companies conducted by the Foreign Chambers in Japan found uncertainty about the economic situation, and sales forecasts in the short-term. But 65% of the companies polled were looking for further growth, with only 1% considering withdrawing.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.2/3">The Japanese suppliers of some British companies have been badly affected by loss of production facilities, damage to supply chain partners or the disruption to energy supply. But many are now returning to normal operations, although we expect the longer term impact will be felt for some time, in supply chains globally.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.2/4">Our UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) teams, based in Tokyo and Osaka, have been in close touch with British business in Japan throughout the crisis. As concerns over the Fukushima nuclear crisis grew, British firms participated in telephone calls with Government chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, who explained the situation and took questions. Transcripts were made available via our embassy website and through social media. We also assisted some British companies with the process of importing iodine tablets for their staff, and also provided iodine as a precaution to British nationals and their dependents.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.2/5">We continue to provide British companies with accurate and up-to-date information on doing business in Japan, which remains the world's third largest economy and a significant market for UK exporters. We are advising on current business opportunities in a range of sectors, including some arising from the reconstruction and recovery programme. Our UKTI team is ready to assist any UK business considering their next steps in the country, as well as any UK company in Japan in need of assistance or advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.2/6">Finally, I am very grateful to those British businesses who generously supported Her Majesty's Government own consular relief effort, for example by making cars or hotel rooms available for our use. Others took their own initiatives to provide goods and assistance to the stricken area for Japanese nationals. The UKTI team worked closely with the British Chamber to match requests for emergency supplies to what companies could offer.</p>

	<p pid="a.231W.2/2">We will make prisons places where people learn skills to build lives beyond crime, placing a much greater focus on developing the vocational skills demanded by employers in the areas to which prisoners are to be released. We will put in place new learning delivery contracts that focus on clusters of prisons between which prisoners tend to move, putting a new emphasis on decentralised control and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/3">That means prisoners preparing for release from HMP Latchmere House will, as our reform programme takes effect, benefit increasingly from a co-ordinated programme of vocational activity. That activity will be delivered in a coherent way across the establishments from which HMP Latchmere House receives prisoners, focusing on the vocational skills demanded by London's employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.2/4">To bolster this, we will reflect the Government's focus on payment by results by introducing outcome incentive payments: learning providers' payments will be based, in part, on their success in helping get people into jobs.</p>
