	<p pid=".581W.3/1">The policy of the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) is to raise charges against industry for activities undertaken on its behalf where Government independence from industry is not essential and when costs can be directly identified, calculated and recovered from individual companies. On this basis charges are raised for a proportion of the costs of demonstrations of defence equipment; market research and publications; DESO symposia and seminars; and inward visits.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.3/2">In addition, the full costs of operating project offices in support of Government-to-Government sales are offset by receipts from customer Governments. In 2000&ndash;01 DESO's costs were as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".581W.3/5"> <th><i></i></th> <th><i>&pound; million</i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".581W.3/8"> <td>Expenditure</td> <td>56.01</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".581W.3/9"> <td>Receipts</td> <td>41.68</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".581W.3/10"> <td>Net Operating Costs</td> <td>12.36</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".581W.3/13">These net operating costs are more than offset by benefits to the Defence budget, estimated at over &pound;400 million a year, arising from DESO's activities. These benefits include reductions in overhead costs for UK Procurement as a result of longer production runs, receipts from Commercial Exploitation Levy and disposal of surplus MOD equipment. Against this background, there are no plans to amend the charging policy for services provided by DESO.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/2">Since 1997 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has conducted in excess of 500 disposals. These range in size from airfields and barracks to small areas of land and individual houses.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/3">Following the publication of &quot;In Trust and On Trust: A Strategy for the Defence Estate&quot; in June 2000, the MOD has embarked on a major &quot;core sites&quot; review covering all our 4,000 or more sites. This will determine how the estate can best be used to satisfy our long-term military needs and also guide future investment. Associated with this work, we are also considering the supply and demand for training as part of a Strategic Planning Study for the Army Training Estate (SPATE), which is largely concerned with the rural training estate. This should not be confused with the Defence Training Review, which is an advanced element of the &quot;core sites&quot; review and relates largely to the built estate.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/4">While the MOD has no current plans to acquire significant additional areas of land, we do from time to time purchase land adjacent to existing training areas where this allows more efficient or effective use of the land we already own.</p>

	<p pid=".583W.0/1">Sonar 2087 is designed to detect submarines at distances greater than those from which potentially hostile submarines could engage our forces. Sonar 2193 is a mine-hunting sonar and will operate at short ranges. The exact frequencies the sonars will use are classified. I am withholding this information in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which relates to defence, security and international relations. I can tell you, however, that in order to achieve detection at long distances, Sonar 2087 will operate at frequencies lower than systems currently employed by the Royal Navy, whereas Sonar 2193 will operate at high frequencies to achieve fine discrimination between objects.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.0/2">As underwater noise can adversely affect the marine environment, the MOD is committed to using both Sonar 2087 and Sonar 2193 in an environmentally responsible manner.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.0/3">The draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for Sonar 2087 was conducted for the Department by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC). The EIA was informed by a number of other studies of the possible effects of sonar noise on humans, mammals and fish. The total cost was in excess of &pound;2 million. The EIA will continue to be developed during the demonstration and manufacture phases of the project, taking account of trials information. It will continue to be informed by evidence from leading experts both in the UK and US; this includes exchange of information on studies conducted by the US Navy. We also monitor relevant scientific and environmental research around the globe. The final EIA will be completed by the planned 2006 entry into service and will be subject to independent review. An EIA for Sonar 2193 has been commissioned, to be undertaken by QinetiQ at the SOC, at a cost of &pound;143,000.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.0/4">Sonar 2087 is designed to be used world-wide. To date, the EIA indicates that, for initial trials, the vicinity of the North-West Approaches would be a suitable area. All our trials will be preceded by EIAs specific to the area concerned and they will be conducted using mitigation measures to take account of marine animal life and human divers/swimmers. These measures will be integral to our operating procedures and will include monitoring of the area which will begin before active transmissions are started and continue while the activity is under way and also for a period after transmissions have finished. Exclusion zones will be operated around known sensitive sites such as breeding grounds and sanctuaries; and we will begin transmissions at low output levels to give marine life the opportunity to move away. Similarly, a minimum range will be established from known diving sites.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.0/5">These measures will provide a sustainable balance between the requirement for essential trials and training and the equally important need to avoid causing significant adverse impact on the marine environment.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.5/1">It is our policy that the Defence Estate should be no larger than necessary to meet the operational and training needs of the armed forces. To this end, the overall size of the estate is kept under continual review, and rationalisation of our landholdings and the early sale of surplus property remains a key priority. Normally, surplus sites are identified through estate rationalisation studies, as a result of changing operational requirements or from changes in policy. Before a site is offered for sale steps are taken to ensure there is no alternative defence use.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/2">In the future, the rationalisation of the estate will be shaped by the emerging 'core sites' approach which is currently being developed as part of our Estate Strategy (&quot;In Trust and On Trust: A strategy for the Defence Estate&quot;) which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-07">7 June 2000</phrase>. It is the intention that 'core sites' will become the focus for future development and investment.</p>

Only 1,350 were on hold by the Committee (see table for breakdown). The majority of Committee holds are imposed because applications are submitted with insufficient information for the Committee to be able to assess whether the goods could be used in Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programmes. Where there are serious concerns in this regard, assurances of end-use or in-country monitoring are often sufficient to lift the hold.</p>

Guidance on the standard to which treatment should be provided is contained within the Department of Health publication &quot;Drug Misuse and Dependence&mdash;Guidelines on Clinical Management&quot;, which is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/2">Ambitious targets have been set under our 10-year anti-drugs strategy to prevent drug misuse, and to help those with drug problems overcome them. A key target is to increase the participation of drug misusers in drug treatment programmes that have a positive effect on health and crime by 66 per cent. by 2005 and 100 per cent. by 2008.</p>

	<p pid=".603W.2/2">None. We issued Health Service Circular 1999/176 in August 1999. It asks National Health Service bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is not available at the time the technology first becomes available. It also advises that these arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence.</p>

We are working to ensure that it is flexible and responsive to employers' changing skills needs. The sector plays a particularly important role in delivering the skills we need for craft, technician and equivalent level jobs&mdash;skills that are vital to raise our skills base and to boost productivity. Over recent years we have widened participation and increased achievements while maintaining retention rates. We have also seen significant improvements in performance and a reduction in variations in quality across the sector. Nevertheless, we have ambitions to achieve more. We have significantly increased the Standards Fund, to support raising standards in colleges, and we are spending &pound;100 million over the next three years to develop Centres of Vocational Excellence in the sector.</p>

	<p pid=".609W.2/2">The assessment of staff morale is a matter for colleges, as independent employers, to address in consultation with the relevant unions, just as the terms and conditions for staff are a matter for colleges to determine in discussion with relevant unions. We acknowledge that colleges need help to ensure that they have the right arrangements to recruit, reward and retain excellent teachers. Starting this year, significant extra resources amounting to an additional &pound;300 million over the next three years have been made available to the further education sector to reward high calibre staff through our Teaching Pay Initiative, &pound;44 million of which will be shared by sixth-form colleges. The total figure is over and above the annual pay round. In addition, we plan to implement arrangements for FE teachers of shortage subjects to benefit from 'golden hellos' comparable to those already in schools and from arrangements we are piloting to help new entrants to the profession to pay off their student loans.</p>

	<p pid=".609W.5/115">These new programmes are an addition to the 260 programmes which are already delivering services to young children and their families in disadvantaged areas or developing their plans for delivery from the autumn. This announcement brings the total number of sure start programmes so far announced to 437. They will become operational from summer 2002 when we will be well on schedule to meet the Public Service Agreement target of 500 programmes operating by 2004, reaching one third of all poor children aged under four and their families in England. This will be a significant contribution to the Government's aim of eradicating child poverty by 2020.</p>

	<p pid=".611W.6/1">The Government fully recognise the harm which economic crime inflicts on its victims, not only in terms of the financial loss but in terms of the frustration and inconvenience caused. Living off the proceeds of crime cannot be tolerated in a fair and just society, and the Government are determined that crime should not pay.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.6/2">The Proceeds of Crime Bill, which was announced in the Queen's Speech, will attack the profit motive which drives organised criminals. The Bill will contain measures to deprive people of money and property which they have obtained through criminal activity. These measures include reforming confiscation procedures and modernising the criminal law on money laundering and the creation of a new agency, the National Confiscation Agency (NCA), which will co-ordinate the activity of the police, Customs, the Inland Revenue and prosecutors to remove assets obtained illegally and to encourage international co-operation in this. Removing illegal gains from criminals not only acts as a deterrent but reduces their ability to fund further crime.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.6/3">A large proportion of economic crime involves credit card fraud. The Home Office is currently working closely with the financial institutions and the retail sector to reduce credit card fraud by the introduction of chip cards and personal identification numbers as security safeguards.

Friend the Minister of State responsible for policing of crime and community safety will be chairing a meeting with senior members of these industries to discuss credit card fraud issues later this month.</p>

This report recognised that the available data were patchy and infrequently gathered, but offered a low estimate of &pound;6.6 billion and a high estimate of &pound;13.6 billion for the total economic cost of other fraud (excluding credit card fraud) for the year ending 1999. These estimates include amounts defrauded, investigation and deterrence costs.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.2/17"><i>(c)</i> There is no accepted definition of &quot;economic crime&quot;. However, Home Office Research Study no. 217 &quot;The economic and social cost of crime&quot; (copies of which have been placed in the Library) estimated that in total, fraud, commercial and public sector victimisation and property crimes against households and individuals cost around &pound;32 billion in 1999&ndash;2000. Estimates have not been made for previous years.</p>

We consider that the main reason behind this price increase is arbitrage across the UK-Belgian interconnector with high oil related gas prices in Europe.

	<p pid=".627W.2/2">The current epidemic has been caused by a specific strain of the foot and mouth virus (PanAsian Strain O) which has occurred in a number of countries around the world. The precise means of the introduction of the virus into Great Britain is unknown and the subject of continuing investigations, but is most likely to have been introduced in imported meat or meat products. The virus was primarily transmitted throughout a large proportion of the susceptible farm livestock population of Great Britain via sales of subclinically infected sheep through markets, via dealers and local sales between farms before <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-23">23 February</phrase> when all animal movements were banned. The specific means of transmission between herds and flocks has been the subject of detailed epidemiological investigations of each infected premises. The results of these investigations are summarised in the following table.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.5/1">A standstill would have slowed down the rapid livestock movements that helped spread foot and mouth disease. The Government are reviewing their proposals in the light of responses to the consultation exercise; they have decided to make this issue part of a total approach to future disease control, which will also include biosecurity, animal identification and licensing. This will allow fuller veterinary and economic assessments to be carried out. In the meantime, current movement licensing controls will continue.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.2/1">Community law requires any member state that has an outbreak of foot and mouth disease not to export fresh meat from within an infected area to any other member state. Responsibility for ensuring compliance lies with the competent authority of the affected member state. For third countries, EC rules require exports of all foot and mouth disease susceptible products to be accompanied by veterinary health certification that guarantees that the meat does not come from a region infected with foot and mouth disease. All imports from third countries of foot and mouth disease susceptible products must enter through UK Border Inspection Posts where they undergo checks to verify they comply with Community import conditions. It is the responsibility of the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission by means of inspection visits to ensure that member states are complying with Community law and that third countries have in place appropriate disease control measures to ensure they meet Community import conditions.</p>

The risk of leakage at these facilities arises not only from the storage tanks but also pipework and pump delivery systems, including delivery of fuel to the site. HSE does not have information on the number of underground storage tanks at risk of leakage in the UK. However, local authority petroleum enforcement officers issue licences under the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928 to retail petrol outlets to ensure the safe storage of petrol. Conditions attached to these licences specify arrangements to prevent and detect leaks.</p>

	<p pid=".629W.12/2">HSE does not collect statistics on how many leakages from underground storage tanks have been reported. The Environment Agency's prosecution database runs only from January 1999 and does not provide narrative in respect of prosecutions. The failure to report leakage or the fact of such leakage from a storage tank would not therefore be specifically identified and case-by-case information would be disproportionately expensive to obtain. If leakage from a petrol tank occurred a prosecution would be likely to be based on the leakage itself and the resulting pollution or a breach of a licence condition.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.2/2">HSE and the Environment Agency have no plans to commission a full condition audit of all underground storage tanks in the UK. There are a number of Environment Agency initiatives aimed at preventing pollution from such tanks and associated facilities. In general, these approaches focus on factors such as the condition of the facility, their age and environmental sensitivity, and the potential consequences of leakage in Environment Agency groundwater protection zones. In addition, local authority petroleum enforcement officers issue licences under the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928 to retail petrol outlets to ensure the safe storage of petrol. Conditions attached to these licences specify arrangements to prevent and detect leaks.</p>

	<p pid=".632W.0/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Mrs. Curtis-Thomas, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-12">12 July 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".632W.0/3" class="indent">The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent question about plans to maintain the A565 trunk road between Bootle and the Seaforth Flyover.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.0/4" class="indent">I am aware of your previous concerns about the appearance of the A565&mdash;which is currently a trunk road maintained by this Agency. As you may know, we have announced proposals to &quot;detrunk&quot; this section of the A565 and it is planned that ownership and management responsibility for the road will transfer to the Local Authority, Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council, by June 2003. Until then we will continue to maintain the road through our Managing Agent, Lancashire County Council's Highways Consultancy.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.0/5" class="indent">In my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-06">6 February</phrase> (copy enclosed) I said that we intended to work with Sefton's Cleaning Services Manager to improve the standard of street sweeping and litter removal. Unfortunately, progress on improving the appearance of the Bootle to Seaforth Flyover section of the road has not been as swift as I would have liked, for which I apologise. We have inspected this stretch of road on several occasions since I wrote to you. The only significant issue concerns the ongoing problems with the standard of sweeping and cleaning of the road provided by Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council. As a result, we have, as an extra measure, instructed our Term Maintenance Contractor, Edmund Nuttall Ltd., to remove all weeds by hand and to clear the detritus within the next fortnight. In addition to this, we are in discussion with the Council's Cleaning Services Manager with regards to road sweeping and cleaning. Regular cleaning is important to inhibit weed growth, preventing the build up of material that allows them to grow, and increasing the effectiveness of spraying them. We expect to see improvements to the road's appearance as a result of these measures in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".632W.0/6" class="indent">If you would like any further information about this matter, you may wish to contact the Agency's Project Sponsor for this section of route, Alex Miller, as Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, M1 4BE (telephone 0161 930 5627).</p>

	<p pid=".634W.8/1">The Multi-Modal Studies are looking at some of the most severe transport problems around the country. They are considering the contribution all modes of transport can make to solving these problems. They are also looking at the contribution existing, previously considered and new transport infrastructure can make. The key objective is to give decision makers the information needed to identify tailored, integrated and sustainable transport solutions. The studies will drive major investment decisions over the period covered by our 10-Year Plan for Transport.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.8/2">The studies are founded on our New Approach To Appraisal, launched in 1998 in our Integrated Transport White Paper. They weigh strategies and their component projects according to their economic, environmental, safety, accessibility and integration impacts. This ensures that costs and benefits are fully explored and understood before decisions are taken. This new approach to decision making is an important step forward. We will consider the contribution all types of transport can make to solving problems, not just roads.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.8/3">Each study is addressing very different problems so the strategies and the decisions that emerge will be unique. The impact on the environment must be a key consideration and in each case we will have to weigh up the benefits of a particular road or rail link and balance it against the environmental impact. The conclusion will vary in each case. No individual decision will set a precedent for others to follow.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.8/4">Decisions will be taken through the new arrangements for the development of Regional Transport Strategies within Regional Planning Guidance. Ministers need not accept all recommendations from Regional Planning Bodies. There may be instances where strategies or individual projects raise issues of national importance. Where this is the case my priority will be to ensure that final decisions reflect, and are properly co-ordinated with, our wider national policy objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.0/1">The Secretary of State has today replied to the Chairman of the South East England Regional Assembly, and I am placing a copy of his letter in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/2">Multi-modal studies represent a wholly new approach to the consideration of transport provision. The Access to Hastings Study is the first of these multi-modal studies to have been completed, and I am grateful to all who have contributed to it.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/3">The study contains a large number of recommendations designed to relieve congestion and safety problems in Kent and East Sussex and to contribute to the regeneration of the economy in the area around Hastings and Bexhill. I have considered the study's recommendations in light of the guidance for handling multi-modal studies outlined in the Secretary of State's parliamentary answer of today. I am able to accept most of these recommendations, although in some areas further work is required to develop proposals before any finding commitments can be given.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/4">The study has shown a wide measure of agreement that, in place of the proposed six lane off-line scheme on the A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury, the Highways Agency should consider the feasibility of a four lane on-line scheme. I have asked the Agency to progress that work. There is also broad consensus that the proposed A259 Pevensey to Bexhill scheme may now be dropped, given the safety improvements which have now been put in place. I have asked the Highways Agency to continue to monitor safety on this stretch of road.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/5">I have also asked the Agency to prepare a draft programme of work to identify possible further measures on the A21 South of Pembury. I have stressed, however, that this work will need to bear in mind the environmental sensitivity of the area.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/6">The study has demonstrated the potential merits of public transport investment in bus and rail. GoVia has agreed to the electrification of the Ashford to Hastings rail route and to looking at the scope for further improvements. As a result of this study, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) have also agreed to look at improvements to the service between Wadhurst and Tonbridge and investigate what further measures are required on the route to provide faster, better quality of service. I have asked the SRA to work with the local councils to consider proposals for a new station at Glyne Gap and proposals for Ore-Bexhill metro rail service.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/7">I am also inviting East Sussex county council to come forward with well thought out proposals for improving bus services in Hastings to tackle regeneration. They are now reviewing their Local Transport Plan and I look forward to considering their proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/8">Although I recognise the strong views held by the Regional Assembly and others in favour of the proposed A259 Western and Eastern bypasses, I have decided not to proceed with these schemes. The study did not build a convincing regeneration case for the by-passes&mdash;it concluded that although the by-passes could possibly help to generate employment in the area this would not necessarily help those in most need. There would be reduced congestion in some areas of the town but the position would get worse in other areas. Against these rather weak arguments we had to place the evidently severe implications for the environment&mdash;two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and an internationally recognised wetland surround Hastings.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.0/9">I believe, therefore, we must look for alternative means to prevent the further decline of the area and to optimise its economic potential. Regeneration is an important priority for the Government&mdash;some wards in Hastings suffer from some of the most severe deprivation in England&mdash;but we do not believe the by-passes are the solution. A regeneration strategy for Hastings needs to be developed which shows clearly how transport and other measures may be implemented to ensure a sustainable economic future of the area. I have asked my officials to work closely with the South East England Development Agency and local partners on that.</p>

The William Roberts Society is negotiating to purchase William Roberts' house from Treasury Solicitors, the administrators of the estate, with a view to establishing a museum to display his art. The Tate Gallery also has indicated its interest in acquiring some of the works of art. The Treasury Solicitors Department have given both these parties first refusal on purchasing the house and works of art respectively with a deadline set for proposals to be submitted. My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for the Arts has urged the William Roberts Society to obtain professional advice to help them with their proposal to turn the house into a museum.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.6/1">The Royal Sign manual procedure is used where a testator makes a bequest in his or her will to charity but the charity is unnamed or unclear. In the circumstances, the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Queen, exercises the Royal Prerogative to direct that the bequest be made to a specific charity, which most nearly represents the testator's intention. A common bequest is for the purposes of &quot;cancer research&quot; but there are several charities which carry out this object. In the absence of any indications of the particular charity, the Treasury Solicitor's Department who administer the scheme has established a rota so that each one of our chosen cancer research charities receive approximately the same amount in any given year. This rota has now been running for almost 20 years, and the Attorney- General and I are seeking the views of the public on its composition. I have today placed a paper describing the issues in detail in the Library. It will be sent to all the registered cancer research and relief charities for their observations and comments.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.0/1">The Government offices for the English regions were established in 1994 and their work was originally overseen by the Government Office Management Board (GOMB). Following the Performance and Innovation Unit report, &quot;Reaching Out&quot;, published in February 2000, the role of the Government Office Management Board passed to the Regional Co-ordination Unit (RCU).</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/2">The administrative running costs for each Government office and for RCU/GOMB for the period 1995&ndash;96 until 2000&ndash;01 are detailed in the table. The table also shows the administrative running cost allocations, including a very small allocation for capital expenditure, for the current financial year. Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, the RCU has managed a single running cost budget for itself and the nine Government offices. This funding is transferred from sponsor Government Departments to cover the running costs of the Government offices for the work that the latter undertake on behalf of sponsor Departments. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year the sponsor Departments were DETR (as was), DfEE (as was), DTI and MAFF (as was). From <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, Home Office and DCMS are expected to become sponsor Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/3">The total indicative administrative running cost budget for the RCU and the Government offices for financial year 2002&ndash;03 is &pound;98.63 million and &pound;95.66 million for the 2003&ndash;04 financial year. There will be a resource planning exercise that will precede each of these financial years, and this will allocate these figures between individual Government offices and the RCU.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.0/4">Programme budgets administered by the Government offices are the responsibility of the Secretaries of State for the relevant sponsor Departments.</p>

	<p pid=".643W.3/1">My predecessor announced in March that &quot;N2&quot;, the date for commencing the main provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, would be no later than the end of November 2001. I can now confirm that, in lay terms, the new regime will come into effect at midnight on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. For legal reasons, the date named in the Commencement Order will be <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>. Naming this day will have the effect of commencing the main provisions of the Act from the beginning of that day, which complies with the timescale set by my predecessor.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/2">So far, the Government have secured Parliament's approval for seven statutory instruments subject to affirmative resolution, and made a further 27 statutory instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/3">We will shortly be making other statutory instruments with a view to enabling the FSA Board to make further provisions of its rulebook at its Board Meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July</phrase>. The key provisions of the rulebook, of course, were made by the FSA at its Board Meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/4">It particular, we expect shortly to make the statutory instrument that provides mechanisms by which firms having authority under old law to do financial services business will be &quot;grandfathered&quot; across into permissions to do equivalent business once FSMA commences. The FSA will then be responsible for letting individual firms know their grandfathered permissions.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/5">From <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-03">Monday 3 September</phrase>, we will commence FSA powers to consider applications from financial services firms to modify their grandfathered permissions or the grant of new permissions. <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-03">Monday 3 September</phrase> will also be the date from which the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal will consider appeals on decisions taken by the FSA in respect of those applications.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/6">By the summer recess, therefore, the task of implementing the Act will pass substantially to the financial services firms. They will need:</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/7" class="indent">to become familiar with the secondary legislation passed by Government;</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/8" class="indent">to absorb the provisions of the rule book made by the FSA;</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/9" class="indent">to analyse their grandfathered N2 permissions, and consider whether to seek modifications to those permissions;</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/10" class="indent">to adapt their procedures; and</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/11" class="indent">to train their staff.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.3/12">The date set for N2 ensures that the new regime for financial regulation starts after the close of business on the day, week and month, and should further assist financial services firms in making their adjustment.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Ms Julia Drown, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-12">12 July 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what powers there are to sell Census results to private companies (3315).</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/4" class="indent">Under the provisions of Section 4(1) of the Census Act 1920, the Registrar General is required, as soon as may be after the census, to prepare reports on the Census returns and to present such reports to Parliament. Copies of all such reports from previous censuses have been published and made publicly available either through the Stationery Office or from the Census Office by delegated authority.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/5" class="indent">Access to census results will mainly be through free access to information on the National Statistics website, with additional information being provided on a cost recovery basis.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/6" class="indent">Additionally, under the provisions of Section 4(2) of the Act, the Registrar General may, at the request and cost of any local authority or person, prepare abstracts containing any such statistical information not contained in the reports to Parliament, which, in his opinion, it is reasonable for that authority or person to require. It is under this provision that most small area statistics or specially commissioned output from the census are made available to private companies and other customers either directly from the Census Office or from other agencies licensed to sell census information to third parties.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.2/7" class="indent">For both free and cost recovery services, the same measures are applied to all such statistical results to ensure that there is no disclosure of information relating to identified individuals or households. No information is available on an exclusive basis, and repeated requests for information that has yet to be published are likely to lead to that information being placed on the National Statistics website.</p>

Working Families Tax Credit, like its predecessor Family Credit, may be used as an indicator of entitlement to certain benefits or concessions by central Government, the devolved executives, local government and voluntary organisations. In this way, families entitled to other help can be identified without them having to make a full application. The major central Government passports for many Working Families Tax Credit recipients are helped with NHS costs such as prescription charges, dental treatment, sight tests and hearing aids and Social Fund payments to help with maternity costs or funeral expenses.</p>
