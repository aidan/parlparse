	<p pid="a.255W.0/1">Defra's aim is sustainable development, ensuring that environmental, social and economic considerations are balanced and integrated. As a result most of the Department's activities benefit the locations which fall within the growth areas, either directly or indirectly. As well as Defra's own actions we can achieve a great deal by working with a variety of partners and through exerting influence on Government Departments and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.0/2">The key Defra policy areas which have a direct impact on growth areas include waste and recycling initiatives, flood defence works, our wide-ranging rural development programmes and regulation of the water supply industry. Funding associated with these activities has not been exclusively earmarked for growth areas, and will be part of mainstream business delivery, not specifically as a result of growth area status.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.0/3">Delivery is carried out on Defra's behalf by a number of delivery agents, including the Environment Agency, the Countryside Agency, Government Offices, local authorities, and the Rural Development Service, all of whom have a strong regional focus. We also provide support to regional development agencies, rural community councils, parish and town councils and the voluntary and community sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.0/4">Turning to specific policy areas, the priority for flood defence is to optimise the protection of people and the reduction in flood risk as measured by net damages from flooding in relation to the funding available. Total Government spend has risen from &pound;312 million in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;478 million in the current year and &pound;570 million for 2005&ndash;06 and the following two years. Where growth areas might have a risk of flooding, in many cases they will already have benefited from investment to protect them to a high standard, e.g. in the Thames Gateway. These defences will be subject to a renewal programme. Where further investment is needed, the development partnerships will consider provision in consultation with the Environment Agency, taking account of Planning Policy Guidance Note 25.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.0/5">The main source of funding for local authority waste management is the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services block of the central Government revenue support grant, which is allocated through the Local Government Finance Settlement using a population-based formula. Defra's waste performance and efficiency grant, which totals &pound;255 million over the three years from 2005&ndash;06, is also allocated to all authorities using a population-based formula. Defra is currently considering mechanisms other than direct funding to assist authorities in growth areas in addressing the additional challenge they face in meeting their landfill directive obligations as a result of population growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.0/6">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to secure the proper use of water resources in England and Wales. The Environment Agency's Water Resources Strategy looks some 25 years ahead and considers the needs of public water supply, agriculture, commerce and industry, as well as the environment, examining the uncertainties about future water demand and availability including the potential effects of climate change and different societal values. It takes account of the Sustainable Communities Plan where the numbers and locations of housing have been defined and recognises the impact that the growth areas will have on the water supply infrastructure. It concludes with a series of actions that will provide the right amount of water for people, agriculture, commerce and industry and an improved water-related environment.</p>

Ministers have received advice from English Nature in the form of letters from the chair and deputy chair of English Nature. As English Nature gave oral evidence to the inquiry into the Rural Strategy 2004 by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee of the House, their position on the creation of the Integrated Agency is already in the public domain.

	<p pid="a.259W.2/1">Last year, UNICEF, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) worked together on an initiative to focus on accelerating responses to the situation of orphans and vulnerable children. They undertook a Rapid Assessment, Analysis and Action Planning (RAAAP) exercise in 17 countries in sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence rates and orphan populations. These countries were: Botswana, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Republic of South Africa, Rwanda, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.2/2">The RAAAP exercise consisted of three basic elements: situation analysis, response analysis, and preparation of two-year costed action plans for scaling up responses. Sixteen countries (all except Botswana) presented country profiles and plans to a UNICEF meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, last September. Uganda and Zimbabwe already had long-term plans of action. Botswana's focus was and remains the evaluation of their Short Term Plan of Action in order to develop a longer term plan in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.2/3">Independently of the above, Ghana has also produced &quot;National policy guidelines on orphans and other children made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS&quot;.

	<p pid="a.259W.5/1">DFID does not plan to commission research on the impact of the separation barrier. Other donors are already active. A preliminary analysis of the barrier's revised route published by the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in March 2005 identified that some 142,640 acres (10 per cent.) of West Bank land will lie between the completed barrier and the Green Line. This is some of the most fertile land in the West Bank and currently home to 49,400 Palestinians. Thousands more Palestinians living to the east of the barrier will be separated from their land on the west. The OCHA plans to publish a more extensive technical analysis towards the end of this month. Other bodies researching this issue include the DFID-funded Palestinian Negotiations Support Unit (NSU). The NSU's work indicates that the barrier will deny Palestinian access to 25 per cent. of the 20 million cu m of groundwater currently abstracted annually from the Western Aquifer Basin, and that in the Eastern Aquifer Basin estimated losses will be in the order of 3 to 5 million cu m per year.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/1">The Government of Vietnam have made rapid progress in reducing poverty in recent years and in maintaining a high rate of economic growth. The number of people living in poverty halved from 58 per cent. in 1993 to 29 per cent. in 2002 and economic growth has averaged approximately 7 per cent. per annum over the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/2">This progress is a result of the Government of Vietnam's programme of economic reform and sustained commitment to development and poverty reduction. Recognising that Vietnam is an environment in which aid works, DFID has rapidly increased its programme in Vietnam from &pound;6 million in 2000&ndash;01 to an expected spend of &pound;55 million in 2005&ndash;06. The DFID programme supports the Government of Vietnam's own poverty reduction and growth strategy. We work very closely with the Government and other donors to support the reform process and ensure that we achieve the maximum impact from the use of our resources. We co-finance the poverty reduction support credit with eight other donors. Key outcomes of our assistance include helping to define methods to target and reach the poor more effectively, and the development of policies in Vietnam that lead to broad-based growth and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/3">Despite these notable successes, approximately 23 million people still live below the poverty line and an estimated 8.8 million live in hunger. DFID supports rural development programmes in the poorest regions of Vietnam such as the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands. We also support Government targeted poverty reduction programmes that include investments in roads, irrigation, village classrooms, commune health centres and clean water schemes in the poorest communes. In transport, DFID has co-financed a programme that will have built over 2,000 roads linking communes to markets in rural Vietnam by the end of 2005. Evaluations of these road programmes show positive results such as stimulating economic growth and increasing school attendance. In education, we are collaborating with Government and other donors to support the achievement of education for all objectives: 100 per cent. attendance at primary school, and 100 per cent. adult literacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/4">DFID also supports poverty reduction in Vietnam through its contributions to the European Commission development budget (currently approximately 18 per cent. of the total budget). The EC spent &euro;28.1 million in Vietnam in 2003 (UK contribution: &euro;5.06 million), and is committed to spend &euro;112 million between 2004 and 2006 (UK contribution: &euro;21.6 million).</p>

We have reduced the total explosive power of our nuclear forces by over 70 per cent. since the end of the Cold War and in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review we announced that only one Trident submarine would be on deterrent patrol at any one time. That submarine would normally be on several days' notice to fire with its missiles de-targeted. We have conducted studies on the verification of nuclear disarmament since the Review Conference in 2000 and will report the concluding part of our findings to the NPT Review Conference this May. The UK has ratified and continues to support the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty without further delay and without preconditions.</p>

This will be a significant benefit to many small businesses for whom business rates can represent a disproportionate burden. Under the new relief scheme, those businesses occupying single main premises with a rateable value below &pound;10,000 are likely to qualify for some reduction in their rates bill, rising to a 50 per cent. rebate for those with rateable values below &pound;5,000. All those small businesses which believe they may qualify should be encouraged to apply for this relief and we have made provision for this by informing all rate payers of the relief in their rates bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.2/1">Planning Policy Statement 7 (PPS7) &quot;Sustainable Development in Rural Areas&quot;, says (paragraph 10) that isolated new houses in the countryside will require special justification for planning permission to be granted. It goes on to say (paragraph 11) that:</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Very occasionally the exceptional quality and innovative nature of the design of a proposed, isolated new house may provide this special justification for granting planning permission. Such a design should be truly outstanding and ground-breaking, for example, in its use of materials, methods of construction or its contribution to protecting and enhancing the environment, so helping to raise standards of design more generally in rural areas. The value of such a building will be found in its reflection of the highest standards in contemporary architecture, the significant enhancement of its immediate setting and its sensitivity to the defining characteristics of the local area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.2/3">The Government's intention is not to discourage particular styles and/or types of contemporary architecture which also meet the wider objectives of policy set out in PPS7. The fact that a particular design reflects the evolution of architecture from its historical roots is not of itself a reason to reject a proposal for an isolated new house in the countryside. Indeed, as Planning Policy Statement 1 (PPS1) &quot;Delivering Sustainable Development&quot; makes clear (paragraph 38), Government policy is that local planning authorities (when deciding planning applications) should not attempt to impose architectural styles or particular tastes, or stifle innovation.</p>

At that time, only three of 20 charities contacted in central London confirmed that they accepted food donations from catering establishments. None of these three organisations were prepared to accept unpackaged food prepared from fresh ingredients in our own kitchens and the Refreshment Department has minimal levels of wastage of packaged foods. All charities contacted in 2002 concluded that the nature, frequency and unpredictable quantity of food waste from the House of Commons Refreshment Department was unsuitable for their needs, but that they would contact us if their policy changed. No further discussions have been held since then.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.5/1">An employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population in work is a long-term aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/2">This long-term aspiration is very challenging. It will require continued macroeconomic stability and further radical welfare reform to build on the success of achieving the highest employment rate of all the G8 major industrialised countries and one of the highest employment rates in our history.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/3">Our five-year strategy, 'Opportunity and Security throughout life' outlines how we aim to meet this challenge. With unemployment at low levels helping inactive people into work is crucial to achieving our aspiration. We must:</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/4" class="indent">support children and families&mdash;including helping lone parents into work by making work possible and making work pay</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/5" class="indent">help people on incapacity benefits to get the support they need to fulfil their ambitions to return to work</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/6" class="indent">break down the barriers that prevent disabled people meeting their desire to move back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.5/7">It will take time to achieve this. Key elements to the strategy will be the reform of incapacity benefit and the equalisation of state pension age from 2010. The principle behind the strategy is to help people to move back into work while still delivering financial security for those who need it.</p>

We know that the 15 authorities involved in our 10 Trailblazers have been able to make good progress towards introducing both indexes and the vital training and culture change required, within overall budgets of around &pound;1 million per Trailblazer. We will take decisions on the funding of a national infrastructure in the light of further work on the technical feasibility and an analysis of costs and benefits. We will not move to this phase until we are clear that the processes and systems are deliverable, and that we have secured sufficient funding.</p>

A consistent historical time series is currently unavailable due to issues with post-census local population estimates for individual ages for earlier years.

	<p pid="a.306W.2/1">The Department does not collect national data on this. Unless they have been specifically disapplied from this aspect of the national curriculum, we would expect pupils with special educational needs to receive the same amount of physical education and sport as other pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.306W.2/2">In 2003&ndash;04 the Department commissioned a survey of schools in relation to the PSA target of two hours of quality physical education or school sport each week (The School Sports Partnership Programme Evaluation 2004/05). Schools with higher proportions of pupils with statements of SEN were found to be more likely to be fulfilling the PSA than those with lower proportions of SEN.</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.2/2">Section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 defines antisocial behaviour in relation to antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) as behaviour that</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.2/4">ASBOs were introduced in April 1999. In 2000 the Home Office issued guidance to relevant agencies (including the police) on setting up local ASBO protocols.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.2/5">This guidance was superseded by more detailed guidance issued in November 2002 on ASBOs. That guidance offered some advice on the behaviour that might trigger an application for an ASBO. It advised that the most common behaviour tackled by ASBOs is general loutish and unruly conduct such as verbal abuse, harassment, assault, graffiti and excessive noise. The wide range of antisocial behaviour that can be tackled by ASBOs and the ability to tailor the terms of the order to each specific case illustrates their flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.2/6">However, ASBOs are just one tool available to tackle antisocial behaviour. Police, local authorities and other agencies need to assess the antisocial behaviour that is occurring and apply the most relevant tool available to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.314W.9/1">The sanction detections rate for West Midlands police was 25.0 per cent. in March 2004, which compares with a rate of 25.8 per cent. in March 2003. Despite this small decline in the sanction detections rate,, the West Midlands force continues to perform well when compared with their peer group of similar constabularies. The average sanction detections rate of the forces against whom the West Midlands force is compared was 20.5 per cent. in both March 2003 and March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.9/2">The Government acknowledges the need to raise sanction detections performance across all police forces. For that reason, a major drive has been under way since last summer with the aim of achieving a significant increase in sanction detection rates. Provisional data for 2004&ndash;05 shows that this concerted effort has already resulted in performance improvements and we are hopeful that all forces, including the West Midlands, will benefit from this.</p>

	<p pid="a.323W.9/2">Government funding for police authorities is chiefly allocated using a funding formula that distributes resources on the basis of relative need and resources. A damping mechanism subsequently applied to protect all authorities against financial instability ensures all authorities receive an increase in grant at least equal to the &quot;floor&quot; level on a like-for-like basis year-on-year. Grant floors are an integral part of the finance system.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.9/3">In 2005&ndash;06, every police authority will receive the amount of grant to which it is entitled under &quot;The Police Grant Report (England and Wales) 2005/06&quot;, &quot;The Local Government Finance Report (England) 2005/06&quot;, and &quot;The Local Government Finance Report No 2 2005/06&quot; for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.9/4">In 2004&ndash;05, all police authorities received a grant increase around 3.25 per cent. For 2005&ndash;06 it has been possible to reintroduce recognition of relative need, and grant increases range from the floor of 3.75 per cent. to 6.81 per cent. Grant provisions before and after damping are given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.9/5">We are currently reviewing the funding formulae and will be consulting local authorities during the summer of 2005 on the formulae for the 2006&ndash;07 settlement.</p>

I welcome the Colombian Government's assurances that there will be an impartial, swift and effective investigation into these murders. Officials from the human rights unit in the Attorney-General's office, as well as forensic specialists and other officials, are in the area where the killings happened and are carrying out their investigation. This process includes interviews with members of the Peace Community, as well as all local army units, to try and establish the facts. We have also stressed to the Colombian authorities the need for proper protection to be given to witnesses of the crimes and of human rights defenders following the case. The Colombian authorities have assured us that such protection will be available to anyone who needs it. We continue to closely monitor the situation.

	<p pid="a.338W.0/1">The recent report from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) on business and human rights notes that the UN Norms have the status of a &quot;draft proposal&quot;. Therefore, the draft Norms have no formal or legal role in setting governance standards for business. However, through the Business Leaders' Initiative on Human Rights (BLIHR), a number of multinational companies have been &quot;road-testing&quot; the draft Norms, using the content to inform their codes of practice. This process will continue until December 2006. In addition, the FTSE4Good benchmark takes the draft Norms into account in its assessment of companies' performance. And some potential investors consider the draft Norms in their requirement for &quot;human rights impact assessments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.0/2">The UK continues to play a constructive role in the debate on corporate responsibility and human rights. While we see merit in clarifying minimum standards for business in relation to human rights, we believe, as does the OHCHR, that future action on this agenda should take into account the many codes and initiatives which exist in this field, rather than focussing exclusively on the draft Norms. These include the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises, the International Labour Organisation Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and the UN Global Compact.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.0/3">The UK will be active at the forthcoming Commission on Human Rights in seeking to ensure proper follow-up to the OHCHR's report. We firmly believe that this exercise should listen to the views of all stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.338W.6/1">A number of provisions are made for the overseas countries and territories (OCT) of the UK and other EU member states in the EU Constitutional Treaty. Articles III-286 to III-291 in Title IV Part III of the Constitutional Treaty set out the provisions relative to the association of certain overseas countries and territories with the European Union. These articles closely follow Articles 182 to 188 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC). Annex II to the Constitutional Treaty contains the list of overseas countries and territories to which Title IV Part III of the Constitution applies. It is in substance the same as Annex II to the TEC.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.6/2">The following UK Overseas Territories are listed in Annex II to the Constitutional Treaty: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falklands Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena and Dependencies, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands. Although listed as an OCT in the Annex, Bermuda has been excluded from successive Association instruments at its own request.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.6/3">The geographical extent of the Union is set out in Article IV-440 of the Constitutional Treaty which corresponds to Article 299 of the TEC, with modifications to take account of successive accessions. Gibraltar is covered by paragraph 4 of Article IV-440, in substance the same as Article 299.4 TEC. Section 1, Title II of Protocol 8 to the Constitutional Treaty sets out the specific provisions relating to Gibraltar. These were originally incorporated in the UK's 1972 Act of Accession.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.6/4">The Sovereign Base Areas are the subject of provisions set out in paragraph 6 <i>(b)</i> of Article IV-440 and Title III of Protocol 9 to the Constitutional Treaty. These provisions were originally set out in Article 299 6 <i>(b)</i> of the TEC and Protocol 3 to the 2003 Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic.</p>

	<p pid="a.342W.3/2">As the legislation was only passed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase>, its impact has scarcely been felt. Much will depend on the reaction of others and how China seeks to apply it.</p>
	<p pid="a.342W.3/3">However, there is a risk that its introduction will slow or reverse the recent signs of progress in the relationship between China and Taiwan. We have made these concerns known to the Chinese and continue to watch developments closely. We continue to call on both sides to avoid unilateral actions which might heighten tensions. Although China has stressed its desire for a peaceful resolution of the issue, we are concerned that the legislation makes reference to the possibility of the use of &quot;non-peaceful means&quot;. We strongly oppose the use of force and believe that the Taiwan question should be settled peacefully through negotiation between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>

	<p pid="a.343W.3/13">Uganda has a well-developed and consultative budgetary process. Donors are involved throughout, and have an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual Public Expenditure Review. This level of consultation allows partners, including the UK, to ensure Government meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. Budget execution is generally good and closely monitored by Government and donors, including the International Financial Institutions. Our Poverty Reduction Budget Support, and that of other partners such as the World Bank, is conditional on our endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution.</p>
