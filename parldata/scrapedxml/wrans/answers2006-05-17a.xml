There remains much work to be done and the Government are working closely with Transport for London and stakeholders in the transport industry to take forwards this agenda. No decision has yet been taken on the implementation of the national bus concessionary fares scheme, announced in the 2006 Budget, although the recent agreement on compatible smartcard technology will be useful if a smartcard option is pursued.</p>

	<p pid="a.951W.9/1">The penalties for those who commit alcohol-related driving ofences are already very tough, whether or not they result in serious injury or death. For exceeding the legal alcohol limit for drivers, they include up to six months' prison, mandatory disqualification from driving for at least 12 months, and at least three years' disqualification for a second offence in 10 years. For causing death by careless driving when under the influence of alcohol the maximum prison sentence is 14 years, having been raised from 10 years under the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

	<p pid="a.962W.5/1">Defence spending is not split by Service. Instead, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) operates a system of delegated authority to Top Level Budget (TLB) holders. Some are single Service but several, for example, the Defence Procurement Agency, the Defence Logistics Organisation and the Chief of Joint Operations support all three Services and their budgets are not broken down by Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.5/2">Information on spending by TLBs can be found in the Government's Expenditure Plans (GEP) 2005-06 to 2007-08 MOD (Cmd6532) a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. This sets out past expenditure and future spending plans. It provides breakdowns of consumption by activity area. This includes the single Service Top Level Budget holders, and in the case of the RAF this shows the Commander-in-Chief Strike and the Commander-in-Chief Personnel and Training Command. More recently, the MOD has published the 2004-05 Annual Report and Accounts which provides the same breakdown. Figures for 2005-06 will be published in our Annual Report and Accounts which is planned for publication before the summer recess.</p>

	<p pid="a.963W.2/1">Assessment of the 1988 report, which examined cancer incidence up to the end of 1983, led to the conclusion that presence at the UK atmospheric nuclear test sites had increased the risk of multiple myeloma and leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) compared with controls selected from members of the armed forces who had not been present at the tests. This was because the level of these cancers among the control group was lower than would be expected for the general population rather than because it was higher for those who took part in the tests. These findings did not correlate with the risk of exposure from ionising radiation; rather levels in the controls were inexplicably low. The 1993 analysis extended follow up to the end of 1990. Rates of multiple myeloma and the relevant leukaemias in the additional follow-up years were slightly lower in test participants compared with controls, whose rates were as in the general population. Because the differential increase in incidence of the relevant leukaemias mirrors the likely pattern of radiation-induced leukaemias, it was accepted that a possible slight risk of lymphatic leukaemia (other than chronic leukaemia) in the first 25 years after participation could not be ruled out. The small hazard of multiple myeloma in the 1988 report was not found in 1993 and was considered a chance finding. Both the 1988 and 1993 studies, found that presence at the sites had no detectable effect on the risk of developing any other malignancy. A further study, published in 2003, also confirmed these findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.973W.2/8">The e-strategy is informed by independent research. The Becta Review 2006 (published <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase>) is an assessment of the state of technology in education based on the most recent research, evaluation and survey reports, most of which are produced by independent academic institutions or commissioned or managed by Becta itself. It presents the latest findings and provides a commentary and assessment of what the findings might mean for policy and practice. The review offers assessment of progress, where it can be identified, and highlights issues and challenges that may affect further change in the system. It has identified that mobile technologies are set to play an increasingly important role, with personal ownership of technologies such as laptops, PDAs and mobile phones on the rise in schools.</p>

This expressed serious concern at, &quot;inter alia&quot;, 'the escalation and increased frequency of discrimination and other human rights violations against the Bah&aacute;'i, including cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, the denial of freedom of religion or of publicly carrying out communal affairs, the disregard of property rights, the destruction of sites of religious importance, the suspension of social, educational and community-related activities and the denial of access to higher education, employment, pensions, adequate housing and other benefits'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has received several representations from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah&aacute;'is of the UK on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.997W.0/1">The Iranian Government have stated on a number of occasions that it does not wish to develop nuclear weapons. However, Iran's documented record of deception over the last two decades gives serious grounds for concern about the real intentions of its nuclear programme. There is documented evidence that Iran used a clandestine international procurement network. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also reported that Iran has in its possession a document describing the procedures for the reduction of UF6 to uranium metal in small quantities, and the casting of enriched and depleted uranium metal into hemispheres, related to the fabrication of nuclear weapon components. The IAEA has indicated that the existence of this document is a matter of concern. Information has also been made available to the IAEA concerning possible Iranian work on the design of a missile re-entry vehicle which could have a military nuclear dimension. Iran has refused to discuss this information with the IAEA.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.0/2">IAEA Director General, Dr. ElBaradei, in his report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-02">2 September 2005</phrase> noted that after &quot;two and a half years of intensive inspections and investigation, Iran's full transparency is essential and long-overdue&quot;. The IAEA is still unable to conclude that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran. At a press conference in Algeria, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-17">17 February</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Mr. Straw) said</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;There are strong suspicions internationally that Iran may be seeking to use its nuclear programme in order to develop a nuclear weapons capability.... but we do not have absolute proof&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.0/4">Estimates of the time Iran might require to develop a nuclear weapon vary, depending on assumptions made.</p>

	<p pid="a.997W.3/1">Iran's leaders have said on a number of occasions in recent weeks that Iran might consider withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in certain circumstances. For example, President Ahmadinejad said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/2" class="indent">'working in the framework of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the (International Atomic Energy) agency (IAEA) is our concrete policy, but if we see that they are violating our rights, or they don't want to accept (our rights), well, we will revise'.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-07">7 May</phrase>, 160 Majlis deputies issued a statement saying that if the United Nations Security Council adopted a Resolution on Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the Majlis would oblige the Iranian government to consider withdrawing from the NPT.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/4">Such comments are hard to reconcile with President Ahmadinejad's claim at the UN General Assembly in September 2005 that 'continued interaction and technical and legal co-operation with the IAEA will be the centrepiece of our nuclear policy', and with the commitment of Iran's Ambassador to the IAEA in August 2005 that Iran would 'never' leave the NPT. They have presumably been made to influence Security Council deliberations presently under way. As the IAEA Board and the Security Council have made clear, Iran needs to build confidence that its nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes, including by reinstating a full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activity and increasing transparency with the IAEA. Threats to withdraw from the NPT have the opposite effect, undermining international confidence still further.</p>

This process normally takes several years. The next steps will be to establish a working party of WTO members that indicate an interest, and for Iran to submit a memorandum of foreign trade regime describing its current trading regime and setting out the reforms it intends to make in order to ensure that this regime is compatible with WTO norms. The European Union has traditionally supported the principle of Iran's accession to the WTO, which should promote economic reform, liberalisation, transparency and respect for property rights, and reduce discriminatory trade practices. As part of the accession process Iran must agree acceptable terms and complete bilateral negotiations with all interested WTO parties before it could finally join.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.2/1">We have a clear cross-departmental strategy working with DTI and other Government Departments to put an end to the animal rights extremist threat and protect those targeted by it. We have introduced tough new legislation, supported the appointment of a dedicated senior police officer as national co-ordinator for domestic extremism and provided additional resources for the police to tackle the problem nationally. These steps have led to an increase in arrests, a reduction in incidents and a number of successful prosecutions which have seen leading activists receive lengthy custodial sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.2/2">We are looking at what more can be done. The Company Law Reform Bill already proposes protection for members by providing that companies do not have to release details of their registers of shareholders if a court is satisfied that the information requested is not being sought for a proper purpose. Following recent attempts to defraud or intimidate members of a number of leading companies, we are looking at what measures can be taken to strengthen shareholder protection further in the Bill. We also intend to consult on how to stop malicious applicants from getting members' details through Companies House rather than from the company.</p>

	<p pid="a.1026W.2/2">The Bruche site will continue to be used as a police training centre up until <phrase class="date" code="">26 May</phrase> this year. The situation remains that there are no options as to future use on which to consult locally yet. Any such options will be determined largely by who takes an interest in purchasing the site when it is put onto the market. The Home Office continues to work closely with Centrex on that process and, once options begin to emerge, we will be in a position to engage with local people over the future use of the site. The Centrex estates and facilities management team, along with staff working on behalf of my Department, have already begun preliminary discussions with local planning authorities around all three Centrex sites that are closing and will be focusing more effort on these discussions over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1026W.2/3">Any change in the use of sites will, of course, require planning permission and the local authority will then need to involve residents in consultation over their decisions on any applications that are made. We welcome the involvement, in all such discussions and consultations, of members representing those communities that are affected by the closure of Centrex sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.1029W.2/2">Chip and PIN is a finance and retail industry initiative introduced to help tackle counterfeit, lost and stolen card fraud. The Government have actively supported the introduction of Chip and PIN. I have not issued guidance to retailers on protection from fraud of customers using Chip and PIN technology but the banking industry makes available a large amount of fraud prevention advice to meet the needs of both merchants and cardholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029W.2/3">The impact of Chip and PIN has been seen in industry figures<sup>(1)</sup> published in March which show that in 2005 counterfeit fraud fell by 25 per cent. and fraud on lost or stolen cards fell by 22 per cent. compared to 2004.</p>

In view of the additional complexity of interpretation and cost implications of using LCN DNA analysis, each submission to a laboratory during an investigation will be considered on a case-by-case basis following discussion with the force Scientific Support Unit.

	<p pid="a.1035W.8/1">The discriminating power of the 10 marker system for profiling DNA (SGM+) is very high and while the probabilities vary with the features of the particular profile, e.g. if the profile is degraded or only a partial profile, the probability of a &quot;chance&quot; or &quot;adventitious&quot; match with a full SGM+ to SGM+ is generally less than one in a billion. In any event, the Crown Prosecution Service make it very clear that in every case involving a DNA profile there must also be appropriate supporting evidence before a case can proceed. It follows that any prosecution should be based on a DNA profile and other admissible and credible evidence.</p>

A match between DNA taken from an individual and that from a crime scene is intelligence, indicating that the individual has been present at the scene?the police and Crown Prosecution Service take account of the fact that there may be an innocent explanation for this. Home Office Circular 58/2004 to chief officers states that there should be further supporting evidence, in addition to the match, before someone is charged.

The available data for the number of police officers deployed in the Kingston-upon-Hull basic command unit is provided in the table along with the figures for Humberside.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.3/2">I understand from the chief constable, that in 2003 and 2004, criminal justice administration teams, command centres, dog handlers and scenes of crime officers were transferred from all of Humberside's basic command units to central force control. This accounts for the reduction in police officer numbers in Kingston-upon-Hull basic command unit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1050W.2/2">The throughput of prisoners in establishments (i.e. numbers of prisoners received and discharged on a daily basis) has increased significantly. It is to be expected that when prisons face operational pressures there may be an impact on a range of activities, including education and training, particularly in hard pressed local prisons. However, since April 2002, over 150,000 basic skills qualifications have been achieved by learners in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/3">The Home Office and DfES have established the Offenders Learning and Skills (OLASS) project which will introduce a new service of education and skills for offenders in both custody and the community. This combined with plans set out in the 'Reducing Re-offending through Skills and Employment' Green Paper launched in December 2005 will enable more offenders in custody and those serving their sentences in the community to complete their education and training successfully.</p>

	<p pid="a.1053W.2/1">Not every piece of research that is commissioned is published by the Home Office.

In these circumstances the researcher is usually released to publish the results through other means.

	<p pid="a.1056W.2/1">I share the hon. Member's concern at the portrayal of women in some parts of the media. However I believe there is a significant difference between material which is intended or is likely to stir up hatred and material which may 'objectify' a person and it would be a very large step to criminalise material in the second group. Moreover, in practical terms hatred is a concept well understood by the courts&mdash;it includes behaviour which is likely directly to drive up violence and the fear of violence. It is less clear what &quot;sexually objectifying material&quot; is and what the direct effects of such material would be. I believe there would be genuine difficulties for the courts in defining &quot;sexually objectifying material&quot;. This could cover a very wide range of material including much that is commonly available through the media, works of art and comedy material.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056W.2/2">Legislation, including the Obscene Publications Act 1959, the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981 and the Video Recordings Act 1984 already exists to protect people against illegal and harmful sexual material.</p>

	<p pid="a.1058W.8/1">Evidence obtained as a result of any acts of torture by British officials, or with which British authorities were complicit, would not be admissible in criminal or civil proceedings in the UK. It does not matter whether the evidence was obtained here or abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058W.8/2">During the individual appeals against certification under powers provided under Part four of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act (ATCSA), the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) emphatically rejected any suggestion that evidence relied upon by the Government was, or even may have been, obtained by torture. The Court of Appeal later confirmed the view of SIAC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058W.8/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase> the House of Lords ruled unanimously that evidence obtained by torture was inadmissible in SIAC proceedings. The decision will not impact on the Government's ability to fight terrorism, or change current practices, as the Government's own stated policy was already not to rely on evidence which we knew or believed to have been obtained as a result of torture. It is not always possible to know where all intelligence information has come from or the precise circumstances under which it was obtained. The Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service receive material from a wide range of foreign intelligence services. The agencies evaluate the reliability of this intelligence against other information available to them. It is then passed, together with an assessment of reliability, to the Government. It may be necessary in some circumstances to rely operationally on material which may have been obtained through the use of torture where it is considered necessary to do so, in particular for preventing terrorist attack and protecting life. The House of Lords' judgment confirmed that material which had, or may have been, obtained through torture could be used for operational purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058W.8/4">We do not condone torture in any way, nor would we carry out this completely unacceptable behaviour. However, we do have an obligation to protect national security and public safety. We would be deficient in this duty if we did not properly assess all the information available to us.</p>

	<p pid="a.1059W.2/1">We have no reason to believe that any convictions will be affected by this ruling. In criminal proceedings in England and Wales, the courts have a range of powers to prevent the admission of evidence that may have been obtained improperly or illegally, including through means of torture. Courts have the discretion to exclude evidence if it is unduly prejudicial or unfair, and a judicial discretion to stay proceedings if they are considered to be an abuse of the court's process. Defendants also enjoy the protections afforded by Article 6 of the ECHR, the right to a fair trial. Article three of the ECHR also prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. In addition, a confession is not admissible unless it meets the requirements set out in sections 76 and 78 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). That is, the evidence will not be admissible if it is unreliable or has been obtained by oppression. Section 76(8) of PACE states that oppression includes torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and the use or threat of violence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1060W.2/2">The table shows the rate of test-purchase failures (i.e. where alcohol was sold to a minor) from the various Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns (AMECs) which have taken place, up to AMEC three which ran during November and December last year. This shows encouraging reductions in test-purchase failures for all sectors of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060W.2/3">Data from the 'Drug use, smoking and drinking among young people in England in 2005' survey shows that the number of children aged 11-15 who reported having drunk alcohol in the last week was 22 per cent. in 2005, down from 25 per cent. in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.1064W.2/1">DFID recognises that fisheries can make a significant contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction in the developing world but that, in many countries, this contribution is being constrained by problems of poor management.

	<p pid="a.1064W.2/2">In the long run, the contribution of sustainable fishing to the economies of developing countries can only be realised if the rich countries take into account the impact of their policies on developing countries and if the latter have the capacity to manage! their own resources in a sustainable way</p>
