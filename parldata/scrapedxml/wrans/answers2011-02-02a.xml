This work is aimed at protecting and improving the health of honey bees. DEFRA also allocates funding to the NBU to control statutory diseases and pests of honey bees, to monitor colony losses and to provide advice to enable beekeepers to become more self-reliant in combating disease through improved bee husbandry; this year's allocation was &#163;1.3 million.

However, the Food and Environment Research Agency's National Bee Unit (NBU) and its bee inspectors provide free advice and guidance to beekeepers including to those in cities. Further information is available on the NBU's BeeBase website. DEFRA and the NBU recently supported the London Bee summit, which was a City of London initiative to encourage beekeeping in the city, and would be pleased to support similar schemes elsewhere.</p>

Figures are not held centrally on prisoners who have been so diagnosed and who are receiving treatment in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/2">However, in the most recent survey of prisoner backgrounds published by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in November 2010, 17% reported having been treated or counselled for a mental health or emotional problem in the year before custody.

	<p pid="a.796W.2/1">A prisoner will be employed in the community only under release on temporary licence (ROTL). Prisoners must be assessed as both eligible and suitable before ROTL is permitted. The criteria for each test are detailed in Prison Service Order 6300, which may be accessed via:</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.2/3">ROTL will not be granted unless the purpose of the leave is one that contributes directly to the prisoner's resettlement into the community or, exceptionally, it is required to enable them to deal responsibly with unexpected family and personal events. Leave for employment purposes falls under the resettlement heading and is reserved for the latter stages of the prisoner's time in custody. All prisoners released on ROTL must first pass a rigorous risk assessment taking into account the risks of harm, reoffending and absconding, and the impact of the particular release upon both the victim and public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.797W.0/2">In 2008-09, the commission convened to select replacements for Lord Hoffman, Lord Carswell and Lord Scott all of whom retired as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.

Lord Justice Collins, Sir Brian Kerr and Lord Justice Clarke were appointed.</p>

Lord Justice Dyson was appointed.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.3/4">The Regional Counting Officer's assessment is made on an individual basis and may only require a recount where the provisional statements provided to him by the Counting Officer suggest there has been a problem with the result in that area.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.6/1">Policy on referendums rests with Elections and Democracy Division in the Cabinet Office. A team of six officials within that Division is responsible for policy on referendums, political parties and party funding. Different members of the team have had involvement at various points in work on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill that makes provision for the referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons. In addition, other officials within the Division working on the conduct of elections have been engaged on the Bill. Given the range of responsibilities within the relevant team and wider Division, it is not possible to quantify exactly how much time officials have spent developing policy for the voting systems referendum. In addition to the officials developing policy referendums, special advisers to the Deputy Prime Minister provide advice across the range of his responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.813W.3/1">The Lord Lieutenancies of England are only partly funded by the public purse. The 11 Metropolitan Lieutenancies in England submit bids each year for a fixed amount of funding on the basis of an annual budget negotiated in advance between the Lieutenancy and the Cabinet Office. The 36 Shire Lieutenancies, however, are entitled to submit claims forms for certain costs to the Cabinet Office in order to be reimbursed for some of their duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/2">Due to the voluntary nature of the role, the expenses system for Lord-Lieutenants is not a public payment; it only serves to reimburse a small amount of the costs associated with performing the functions of the Lord-Lieutenant. There are limits to the amounts which can be claimed for certain areas of expenditure, such as secretarial costs and car hire and driver costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/3">The payments made in 2009-10 are shown in the table, with the Metropolitan Lieutenancies indicated. We do not have estimated costs for future claims. The specific role and functions performed by each Lord-Lieutenant vary widely depending on the Lieutenancy itself, the geography (i.e. physical size), population density, number of Royal visits, Lieutenancy engagements and other factors, and simple comparisons between the figures claimed by different Lieutenancies provide an inaccurate picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/4">In addition to these figures attributable to each Lieutenancy, a cost of &#163;660.22 was incurred for the repair of Lord-Lieutenants uniforms in 2009-10.</p>

We are not considering abolishing the schemes, but rather passing them over to be run by the industry itself instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.0/3">Whatever decision is taken on rating schemes, VisitEngland will continue to support, identify and share advice with English tourism firms and destinations on sustainability and accessibility. There is already a wealth of information on VisitEngland's website to help businesses develop a sustainability programme and to provide detailed information for disabled tourists.</p>

Expenditure will therefore primarily take place abroad. Tourism businesses in all parts of the United Kingdom, including East Anglia, will benefit from the one million additional overseas visitors per year that we expect the campaign to attract. The campaign will be co-ordinated by VisitBritain in co-operation with private sector partners who have contributed to the fund. Any of those partners operating in East Anglia will have input into its content and, of course, concerned local members of Parliament can also make representations about their constituencies to officials or to me in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="a.828W.9/1">The Consumer Credit Act 1974 requires providers of consumer credit to apply to The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for a license. The legislation was reformed by the Consumer Credit Act 2006. This included requirements for the OFT to adopt a more targeted, risk based, approach to consumer credit licensing, focusing on the areas of highest risk to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.9/2">The Government are now considering further reforms to the Consumer Credit regime as part of the wider changes proposed to the institutional framework for financial regulation. A consultation document published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-21">21 December 2010</phrase> is considering the merits of transferring responsibility for consumer credit from the OFT to the new Consumer Protection and Markets Authority, thereby bringing consumer credit into the same regulatory regime as other retail financial services and with a view to delivering stronger protections for consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.2/1">Since being given new powers in 2008, The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has focused attention on the debt management industry. It has set up a dedicated team to investigate the debt management market, carried out a comprehensive review of compliance in the industry and taken significant enforcement actions targeting the worst companies and behaviours.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/2">The key findings to emerge from the debt management compliance review, which included onsite compliance visits by Trading Standards Officers, a website sweep and a mystery shopping exercise, were that:</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/3" class="indent">misleading advertising is the most significant area of non-compliance, in particular failing to disclose a fee is retained by the business and misrepresenting debt management services as being free when they are not</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/4" class="indent">frontline advisers working for debt management companies are lacking in competence and are providing poor advice based on inadequate information</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/5" class="indent">there is low industry awareness of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) rules for resolving consumer complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/6">The OFT's compliance report set out a detailed action plan to improve standards across the industry, focusing on robust enforcement action against licensees that fail, or refuse, to change advertising and/or behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/7">The OFT published its compliance report in September 2010 and at the same time announced that it had warned 129 firms that they needed to submit evidence demonstrating compliance or face licensing action. As a follow up to this announcement, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-28">28 January 2011</phrase> the OFT confirmed that 35 debt firms had surrendered their licences, eight faced action to revoke their licences, seven were under further investigation and 79 had submitted evidence, which is now being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/8">If action is taken against the additional seven companies and/or some of the 79 firms who submitted evidence are found to be non-compliant, the OFT will publicise the details of this enforcement action at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/9">As well as taking action as a result of the compliance review, the OFT has also taken a number of other licensing actions in the debt management sector and has cracked down on look-a-like debt management websites posing as charity or official sites, misleading trading names, inappropriate cold calling (working with the Information Commissioners Office) and has refused to licence companies that cannot demonstrate sufficient competence or experience. Since April 2008, the OFT has taken 37 licensing actions, issued notices to 69 companies/ traders, sent 185 warning letters and 951 advisory letters.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/10">The OFT is also in the process of updating its Debt Management Guidance to take explicit account of new and emerging unfair business practices, and will work with the two main trade bodies, the Debt Managers Standards Association (DEMSA) and the Debt Resolution Forum (DRF) to support their initiatives to introduce higher standards in the industry.</p>

This rolling programme of compliance visits is a key element of the OFT's action plan for addressing problems identified in its compliance review findings report, published in September 2010, and forms part of the OFT's wider strategy for pro-actively monitoring compliance with its debt management guidance.</p>

However, in recognition of the potentially severe functional limitation caused by types of chemotherapy, these customers can be 'treated' as having limited capability for Work-Related Activity even if they do not meet the functional criteria. Chemotherapy can be associated with a range of side effects varying from mild to severe. The purpose of this policy is that those experiencing the most severe functional limitations as a result of cancer treatment are automatically entitled to enter the Support Group of ESA.

The Department's ratio of employee per desk and square metre per person has recently been adversely affected by headcount reductions, although the Department has plans in place to improve its efficiency by property rationalisation and bringing tenants into space recently freed up by these staff reductions.</p>

The Department has established a rolling programme of GP consortia pathfinders to test the different elements involved in GP-led commissioning and enable emerging GP consortia to get more rapidly involved in current commissioning decisions. A Pathfinder learning network has been established to support the development of emerging consortia and to facilitate shared learning during the transition. The shadow NHS Commissioning Board will produce and publish an analysis of the findings of the pathfinder programme and set out the lessons learned that will be applied as consortia become formally established during 2012-13.</p>

	<p pid="a.844W.3/1">The deprivation pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Pupil Referral Unit Census and Alternative Provision Census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy, via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting, or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting. The level of the pupil premium will be the same for every deprived pupil, no matter where they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/2">The same level of premium is available for looked after children who, at some point in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>, were looked after continuously for at least six months, and who were aged four to 15 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August 2009</phrase> as recorded on the April 2010 local authority return.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/3">The service child premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils who are registered as service child on the January 2011 School Census.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/4">Each pupil known to be eligible will attract &#163;200 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/5">The amounts allocated in 2011-12 will depend on the numbers of FSM pupils recorded on the January 2011 Censuses, so it is not possible to give figures for 2011 and subsequent years. We aim to extend the coverage of the pupil premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for free school meals. We intend to consult on this, including the question of which deprivation indicator to use, in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/6">It is possible to provide estimated figures for 2011-12 based on the number of FSM pupils in 2010, and these are given below. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed as the number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower. Numbers of pupils are rounded to the nearest five. Please note suppressed figures have not been included in any of the totals.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/7" class="italic"> North West Durham <i> c</i> onstituency</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/8">In North West Durham in January 2010 there were 1,865 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;801,950. These figures do not include looked after children or service children. Data limitations prevent alternative provision being presented at constituency level, so these figures also do not include an estimate for the number of eligible children in such provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/9" class="italic"> The North East Region</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/10">In the North East in January 2010 there were 76,100 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;32,723,000. The above estimates include pupils in maintained schools, alternative provision, pupil referral units and looked after children. In addition there were 810 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, which would give rise to a premium of &#163;162,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/11" class="italic"> England</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.3/12">In England in January 2010 there were 1,223,465 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;526,089,950. However, we expect the number of eligible pupils to rise appreciably in 2011 as schools and local authorities encourage parents who have failed to register in the past to register for free school meals, and therefore estimate that total expenditure for 2011-12 will be &#163;625 million. The above estimates include pupils in maintained schools, alternative provision, pupil referral units and looked after children. In addition to this there were 37,915 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, which would give rise to a premium of &#163;7,583,000.</p>

The funding settlement for 2010-11 protects funding per pupil for schools in cash terms, and provides additional funding for the Pupil Premium on top of that. We would expect schools to look to make efficiency gains in areas such as procurement and back office before they consider reducing their teaching staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.6/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</phrase>, the Department has removed the Aviation Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading scheme Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/2301), which were replaced by the Aviation Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/1996).</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.6/2">In June 2010, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, my noble Friend Lord Marland, responsible for the Department's regulatory agenda, wrote to 250 of the Department's key stakeholders asking for their views on ways to reduce DECC's regulatory burden. Following on from this exercise, DECC plan to repeal 28 regulations. The exact process for repealing these is still being explored (a suitable vehicle for repeal is being considered, and consultation with relevant parties such as the devolved Administrations needs to take place for certain policies). The response letter from my noble Friend and a summary of responses to this exercise was published in November 2010 on the DECC internet site:</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/better_reg/better_reg.aspx">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/about/better_reg/better_reg.aspx</a></p>
	<p pid="a.848W.6/4">In addition, in July 2010 DECC introduced two deregulatory statutory instruments which prescribe a power to allow local authorities to sell electricity generated from renewable as well as combined heat and power sources:</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.6/5" class="indent">The Sale of Electricity by Local Authorities (Scotland) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/1908)</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.6/6" class="indent">The Sale of Electricity by Local Authorities (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/1910)</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.6/7">Finally, the Energy Bill, introduced into the House of Lords in December 2010, sets out proposals to repeal the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 (HECA) in England, Scotland and Wales. This will reduce regulatory burdens, support the Government's localism agenda and remove redundant legislation from the statute book.</p>

	<p pid="a.852W.2/1">We have been in contact with Novartis, the suppliers of Femara (letrozole) tablets. They have confirmed that there are supplies of this medicine available for United Kingdom patients. If pharmacists have problems obtaining it from their wholesaler, they can contact Novartis Customer Services to arrange a direct supply to the pharmacy. We have had discussions about Femara tablets with the devolved administrations, and have made them aware of the supply situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.2/2">The Department, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders are working collaboratively to better understand and mitigate the impact of supply difficulties so that patients receive the medicines they need in a timely manner, and any arrangements take account of the time needed by pharmacists to source the medicines.</p>

	<p pid="a.855W.3/1">The White Paper &quot;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot; was published in July 2010, and set out our long-term vision for the national health service. Shortly after, we set out further details of our proposals to devolve power and responsibility for commissioning services to local consortia of general practitioner practices in &quot;Liberating the NHS: Commissioning for Patients&quot;, with the consultation on these proposals running from July to October.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.5/2">The Redfern Inquiry Report makes clear that the Atomic Weapons Establishment and the Ministry of Defence's involvement in these cases is believed to have been very limited, and, in most cases, was primarily to arrange for analysis of tissue samples at the request of individual coroners. It is our view that the findings of the Inquiry are not relevant to broader policy on nuclear test veterans, as the findings relate solely to the analysis of tissue samples from up to 15 individuals compared to some 28,000 that took part in the tests. The Redfern Report does not record any of the analyses as being productive in determining the cause of death. We do not believe that there are any wider conclusions that can be drawn that would be relevant to the nuclear test veterans' situation as a group or to any individual appeals currently before the War Pensions Tribunal.</p>
