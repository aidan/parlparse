The BHPS defines housing costs simply as weekly gross housing costs recorded on the BHPS. Rents include service and water charges, but these are excluded from the housing costs of mortgage payers. In addition, BHPS includes both repayments and interest in the housing costs of mortgage payers whereas HBAI excludes repayments from housing costs.<br/>  5, Numbers of children, pensioners and working age adults below 60 per cent. of median income in at least three out of four years have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions of children, pensioners and working age adults have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  DWP analysis of British Household Panel Study, 1991 to 2005.</td> </tr>

Delay: made for the loss of the use of money, arising where payments have been unreasonably delayed (payment is made in the form of interest on the arrears due). The percentage rate for calculating compensation is the same for all benefits. The Building Societies Commission provided the rate on a monthly basis until January 2008. Since then the rate is obtained from the Bank of England.<br/> 3. Actual financial loss: made in respect of losses incurred by customers as a direct result of agency error.<br/> 4. Number of payments rounded to the nearest 25. Amount rounded to the nearest &pound;1,000 and the average rounded to the nearest &pound;10.<br/> 5. Debt Management is not an Executive agency of DWP. A consolatory payment awarded because of error by Debt Management is paid by Jobcentre Plus.<br/> 6. The Rent Service (TRS) was formed in October 1999 as an Executive agency of the Department of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. TRS became an Executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions in June 2001. The Rent Service has not made any consolatory payments.<br/> 7. The Pension Service, Jobcentre Plus and the Disability and Carers Service were formed in 2002, prior to this they were part of the Benefits Agency (BA).</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.909W.2/1">Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), the police have the power indefinitely to retain profiles on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) derived from samples taken from persons arrested for a recordable offence and detained in a police station, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted. While the decision on whether to agree to a request from an individual to have their DNA profile removed from the NDNAD lies with the chief officer of the police force which took the sample, profiles will normally be retained unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.909W.2/2">Given that a number of factors may be applicable to each individual decision, there is no specific breakdown of the reasons for the removal and destruction of DNA samples from the NDNAD following a request to do so from the person from whom the DNA was taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.909W.2/3">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has a national Criminal Records Office (ACRO), based in Hampshire, which deals with matters relating to criminal records, DNA and fingerprints on behalf of chief officers. In the area of removals from the NDNAD, they assist chief officers in arriving at a decision, by providing examples of how requests have been dealt with in other police forces and offering advice. However, the final decision remains with chief officers, who are not obliged to refer cases to ACRO or to agree with its recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="c.916W.8/2">Statistics on the theft of red diesel and household fuel are not collected centrally. Such offences would be recorded within the Home Office offence classifications of 'theft from a vehicle', 'other theft' or 'other fraud' depending on the circumstances of the offence. Such offences cannot be separately identified from the other offences included in those classifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.916W.8/3">The Government's commitment that there will be a Neighbourhood Policing Team in every area by 2008 has been met. This marks three years of hard work from forces to roll-out Neighbourhood Policing. Neighbourhood Policing teams engage in proactive or preventative work to tackle low level crime and anti social behaviour which may be a persistent issue or concern that exists in the local community. In rural areas, this may include working together with local agencies to provide advice to the community on preventing fuel theft. Such advice would include restricting access where possible and the use of appropriate fencing locks. No formal assessment of the role of neighbourhood policing in preventing theft of red diesel and household fuel in rural areas, has been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.916W.8/4">Crime has reduced by a third over the last 10 years. The Government's Crime Strategy builds upon the achievements of the last ten years but moves away from centrally imposed targets toward making local agencies accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the local community. This means that local areas can focus greatest effort on reducing those crimes that matter most to people locally, whatever the crime. Where the theft of red diesel and household fuel emerges as a pressing local issue, whether in a rural or urban area, we would encourage local police forces to devote resources to tackling this crime.</p>

Public sector pay settlements should be consistent with maintaining the necessary levels of recruitment, retention and staff engagement needed to support service delivery; ensuring that total pay bills represent value for money and are affordable within departments' overall expenditure plans; and consistent with the achievement of the inflation target. Timing of pay decisions for a particular workforce depends on pay-setting arrangements for that workforce.</p>

These are the private finance initiative (PFI) for hospital facilities, ProCure 21 to deliver public capital funded hospital and primary care facilities, and the local improvement finance trust (LIFT) initiative in respect of primary care and hospital facilities that are commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs).</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.2/2">Information on the number of completed projects in these three programmes is given in aggregated form in the table. Detail on the proportion of new build to refurbishment on each project is not routinely collected.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.2/3">The figures given do not include those construction projects undertaken by the NHS by means other than the three procurement methods identified. These are predominantly the smaller public capital funded schemes commissioned locally by NHS trusts and PCTs and which are below departmental delegated approval limits.</p>

	<p pid="c.942W.2/1">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Healthcare Commission will cease to exist on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, with its regulatory function being replaced by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). In the reformed complaints process, we do not envisage the CQC having a direct role in handling individual NHS complaints (other than specific complaints as to discharge of powers or duties under the Mental Health Act, carrying forward the current Mental Health Act Commission (MHAC) role). Unsatisfied complainants will be able to approach the health service ombudsman directly if their complaint cannot be resolved locally. None the less, the issue of learning from complaints is certainly very important.</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.2/2">However, we do not believe that a specific legal requirement will be necessary. Requirement 10 of the CQC registration requirements, proposed in our recent consultation &quot;The future regulation of health and adult social care in England: A consultation on the framework for the registration of health and adult social care providers&quot;, would require registered providers and managers to have effective systems in place for handling complaints. This would place an obligation on care providers to ensure that learning from complaints is reflected in risk management, quality assurance, clinical governance and training and development arrangements. Learning would be informed by a variety of sources, but we would expect recommendations from the Ombudsman and other key sources to play a vital role. The new Care Quality Commission will be able to use the full range of its enforcement powers to take action where people fail to meet those requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.945W.9/2">Current fuel quality standards permit the blending of up to 5 per cent. of biofuel into ordinary petrol and diesel. The renewable transport fuel obligation, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-15">15 April 2008</phrase>, is likely to mean that over the period from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-15">15 April 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-14">14 April 2009</phrase>, 2.5 per cent. in aggregate of total UK road transport fuel sales will be made up of biofuels. In practice, we expect that road transport fuel suppliers will for the most part comply with this obligation by blending biodiesel into their diesel fuel, which is likely to mean that most diesel sold at UK forecourts over this period will contain near the maximum of 5 per cent. biodiesel, with some petrol also containing up to 5 per cent. bioethanol.</p>

	<p pid="c.946W.2/1">Local authorities have powers to regulate tattooing businesses under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. Under this legislation, a tattooing business is required to register with the local authority and observe local byelaws in relation to hygiene and cleanliness of the tattooist, equipment and premises. It is an offence for the tattooing business to trade without being registered or to breach the local byelaws.</p>
	<p pid="c.946W.2/2">Local authorities may also use health and safety at work legislation to regulate tattooing businesses if they judge that there is a risk to customers' health and safety. This allows local authorities to use improvement and prohibition notices, and ultimately to prosecute businesses if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.946W.2/3">If consumers are dissatisfied with the quality of the art work or the terms and conditions under which the work is done (as opposed to a health or hygiene issue) they have protection under general consumer law. For example, the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 requires a trader who agrees to provide a service to carry out that service with reasonable care and skill and in a timely manner. It also requires that any goods and materials supplied are of satisfactory quality. If the trader fails to comply with these requirements, the law treats the matter as breach of contract.</p>

	<p pid="c.957W.8/1">The Information Commissioner's Office's (ICO) policy is to resolve complaints at first examination where appropriate. In these cases, no initial acknowledgment is sent. In all other cases, an acknowledgment letter is sent to the complainant advising what will happen next, and the complaint is referred to the appropriate ICO department.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.8/2">The most recent period for which figures are available is the 2007-08 financial year. In 2007-08, 35 per cent. of all data protection cases and 54 per cent. of all freedom of information cases were resolved with the first letter to the complainant. 52 per cent. of all data protection and freedom of information cases were resolved within 14 calendar days of receipt, with 100 per cent. of these cases resolved or referred for investigation in under 40 calendar days.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.8/3">In 2007-08, it took an average of 69 calendar days from receipt to allocate freedom of information cases to a case officer. In total it took an average of 182 calendar days (including the time taken to allocate each case) to resolve the freedom of information cases closed during the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.8/4">In 2007-08, it took an average of 30 calendar days from receipt to allocate data protection cases to a case officer.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-02c.214470.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-02c.958W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" speakername="Michael Wills" colnum="958W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080702/text/80702w0017.htm#08070257007549">
	<p pid="c.958W.2/1">The Government are committed to both freedom of information and data protection. An important part of that commitment is ensuring that the Information Commissioner is adequately funded to fulfil all of his statutory responsibilities. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) regularly review the resources available to the Commissioner and as part of that dialogue my Department provides constructive challenge to ensure that the ICO delivers maximum efficiency and secures best value for the public money allocated for those statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.958W.2/2">The ICO's freedom of information work is funded by grant in aid paid through my department. In response to business cases presented by the ICO, in each of the last four financial years my Department has paid the ICO a larger sum in grant in aid than the amount in the original baseline for each year. In addition, my Department is promoting a secondment scheme to assist the ICO in tackling the outstanding backlog of freedom of information cases. Secondees from central Government Departments, paid for by their Departments, will work at the ICO on the outstanding freedom of information cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.958W.2/3">The Commissioner's data protection work is funded separately through notification fees paid by data controllers under s.26 of the Data Protection Act 1998, which his office retains with the agreement of HM Treasury. In 2006-07, this was &pound;10,200,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.958W.2/4">As I made clear in my response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights' 22nd Report, the Government are currently considering the Commissioner's case for increased resources for his data protection work. This includes the recommendation of the House of Common's Justice Committee report &quot;Protection of Private Data&quot; (January 2008) that a graduated fee scale be introduced to replace the current flat fee that applies to all data controllers.</p>
	<p pid="c.958W.2/5">My Department will continue to ensure that if the ICO is required to undertake additional or new responsibilities then these will be appropriately funded. For example, it was announced in November 2007 that the ICO would carry out spot checks of central Government Departments. The Departments being checked will pay the costs of the spot checks.</p>

	<p pid="c.959W.2/1">I meet regularly with the Information Commissioner to discuss operational issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.2/2">The Information Commissioner's Office's (ICO) current policy is to resolve complaints on first examination whenever possible. No initial acknowledgement is sent in these circumstances. Instead, a case that can be dealt with quickly is resolved on first examination. In all other cases, an acknowledgment letter is sent to the complainant advising what will happen next and the complaint is referred to an appropriate ICO department. The ICO aims to resolve or acknowledge all complaints within 14 calendar days of receipt.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.2/3">However, mindful of the need to keep its customers as well informed as possible and that delays can arise, the ICO is currently considering ways to automatically acknowledge all complaints as they arrive.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.2/4">Prioritisation of cases that relate to particular issues or events is considered on a case by case basis. Likewise, if a complaint raised by an hon. Member raises an issue which the ICO feels necessitates its prioritisation over a complaint made by a member of the public it will similarly consider this on a case by case basis.</p>

No specific account has been taken of current and future population growth in Chorley. The effects on residents of Chorley of the proposal to vacate the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) office in the town will be minimal.</p>
	<p pid="c.966W.3/2">Very little of the work currently carried out in local HMRC offices actually relates to the communities in which those offices are located, as most of HMRC's business is arranged on national lines. Although a decision has been taken to vacate the HMRC office in Chorley, its inquiry centre services will remain at the same location or nearby. HMRC customers will therefore still have access to face-to-face services should they need them.</p>

It is an undertaking to customers stated in HMRC's codes of practice and other publications. There are no set amounts or percentages available as decisions are made on a case by case basis.</p>

Academies place great emphasis on getting the basics right and improving behaviour in particular. As the new ethos and behaviour policy are implemented in an academy's early days, the number of exclusions may rise, but it typically falls as behaviour improves. This phenomenon is not unique to academies&mdash;the same effect is often observed when a new head teacher transforms a struggling maintained school.</p>

Non-vocational adult education courses offer a wide range of social and economic benefits for adults of all ages and backgrounds. We know that they help individuals to progress into qualification-bearing courses and have well-documented benefits in terms of personal health and well-being. Our recent consultation on informal adult learning is a measure of our commitment to this kind of learning and our intention to create a new vision of informal adult learning for the 21st century.</p>

Young people admitted to the secure estate are assessed for their health and well-being and educational needs. A new reception health screen for young people has been developed by the Youth Justice Board. The new health screen contains a section looking specifically at disability and impairment, which contains a question designed to identify speech difficulties in young people entering custody. Young people in young offender institutions with special educational needs are supported by special educational needs co-ordinators and by learning support assistants.</p>

	<p pid="c.982W.2/1">The Department has recently gone out to tender for research into the effectiveness of our anti-bullying strategies. This research will provide the necessary quantative and qualitative data needed to draw robust conclusions about the efficacy of different anti-bullying strategies. The successful bidder will report their findings to the Department in summer 2009 and summer 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/2">We commissioned an evaluation report from Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) into the work of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, one of the Department's key delivery partners in the field. PWC published their report in February 2007: it concluded that the ABA</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;plays a crucial role in accessing and brokering the broad range of available deep expertise and in consensus building&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/4">and that their programme of work is</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;broadly aligned to DfES stated policies and priorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/6">It recommended that the Department tendered for distinct elements of anti-bullying work to allow a greater range of providers into the system, maximise outputs and achieve greater value for money, and we have since done so.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/7">We have also carried out evaluations into individual initiatives for preventing and tackling bullying in schools including the Peer Mentoring and Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programmes: these showed positive evidence of their impact in tackling bullying. Schools using peer mentoring schemes reported substantial falls in aggressive behaviour with up to 85 per cent. of disputes solved in this way resulting in long-lasting agreements (Source: &quot;Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, 2002).</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.2/8">More generally the Department has built monitoring and evaluation arrangements into all of our contracts with the external bodies who are responsible for taking forward our anti-bullying programmes on the ground. We will monitor the situation closely to ensure each of these organisations achieve key outcomes and provide value for money.</p>

Public sector pay settlements should be consistent with maintaining the necessary levels of recruitment, retention and staff engagement needed to support service delivery; ensuring that total pay bills represent value for money and are affordable within departments' overall expenditure plans; and consistent with the achievement of the inflation target. Timing of pay decisions for a particular workforce depends on pay-setting arrangements for that workforce.</p>

	<p pid="c.998W.2/1">An assessment of the current and future skills base of grounds professionals has been undertaken by the Sector Skills Council Lantra (SSC for environmental and land-based industries), as part of their work to produce a Sector Skills Agreement for their sector as a whole. The chief executive of Lantra has written to the hon. Member about this matter and a copy of his response has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Peter Martin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-02">2 July 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills to write to provide you with further information regarding the recruitment, training and development of people involved in the maintenance and management of sports grounds. Lantra is the Sector Skills Council with responsibility for determining of the skills needs of all those people working in the land-based and environmental sector - which of course includes these occupations.</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/4" class="indent">Based on the most recent research that Lantra has undertaken, we estimate that over 85,000 people are involved in the management and maintenance of sports turf and green space facilities within the UK. The majority are employed as grounds staff, gardeners and greenkeepers in both the private and public sectors. Especially within local authorities, there are instances though where these people will have an extended skills base and be involved in other aspects of park and green space management. The above statistics do not include those mainly or wholly involved in the management and maintenance of botanic and historic gardens.</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/5" class="indent">It is estimated that today there are around 122,500 acres in England put over to various types of sports use. The majority of sports grounds are under local authority control; for instance, 80% of football pitches, - some 40,000 in England - are maintained by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/6" class="indent">A large percentage of groundsmen and golf greenkeepers are trained to a minimum of a Level 2 qualification in the main N/SVQ in Sports Turf Maintenance or equivalent within the suite of qualifications for amenity horticulture. The percentage of qualified staff is highest with golf greenkeeping due to the financial support provided for training by the sport. Regretfully, lower levels of qualified staff are found in other major sports such as tennis, rugby, cricket, football, horseracing and hockey.</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/7" class="indent">There are a number of potential reasons for this lower investment:</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/8" class="indent">the lack of priority by some sports governing bodies to ensure training of grounds staff. Too frequently, there are no set minimum standards for individuals maintaining facilities</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/9" class="indent">the lack of money in clubs (especially at amateur level) to ensure high levels of grounds maintenance</p>
	<p pid="c.998W.2/10" class="indent">the dependence on volunteers in many clubs to maintain facilities</p>

	<p pid="c.998W.2/15" class="indent">In doing this, Lantra works closely with the employers and trade associations involved in the area of sports turf and green space employment, notably the Institute of Groundsmanship (IOG) and the British and International Golf Greenkeepers Association (BIGGA). Both Institutes are particularly active in promoting higher investment in skills development as well as raising the profile of the sector as a whole. It is hoped that the 2012 Olympics and the theme of 'Greening the Games' will still further raise awareness of the sector. The Olympics sports legacy can only be sustained as long as there are sufficient people to maintain the grounds and ensure the safety of participants.</p>

	<p pid="c.1001W.2/1">The 2004/05 Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) estimated the average personal debt per student&mdash;student loan and commercial borrowing less savings&mdash;to be &pound;7,918 at graduation for English full-time undergraduates. A consistent time series of this estimate is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1001W.2/2">Estimates for samples with differing characteristics are available from earlier surveys. These showed the average personal debt on graduation was: &pound;3,462 in 1998/99 for UK full-time undergraduates; and &pound;8,666 in 2002/03 for English and Welsh full-time undergraduates aged under 25.</p>
	<p pid="c.1001W.2/3">Student loans are very different from commercial loans. Repayment of income-contingent loans is linked to income after leaving university and borrowers are not required to repay if their income is below &pound;15,000 per year. Interest is linked to the rate of inflation, so in real terms borrowers repay no more than they borrowed. Graduates who take out their first student loan in or after 2008/09, and enter into repayment in or after April 2012, will also be able to take a repayment holiday of up to five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1001W.2/4">From the 2008/09 academic year, increased income thresholds for the maintenance grant, will help a wider range of students and their families. I expect that one third of students will be eligible for a full grant of &pound;2,835 in 2008/09, and a further third will be eligible for a partial grant.</p>

	<p pid="c.1001W.5/2">A key focus for Level 3 is on helping young adults to finish their education and to be able to take up opportunities in higher education or establish successful careers. In &quot;Work Skills (Cm 7415)&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-12">12 June</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced the extension of the current entitlement for 19 to 25-year-olds studying a Level 3 in a college, to include those being trained at work. We expect this will benefit around 100,000 19 to 25-year-olds over the next three years. This will ensure that those young people who choose not to go to university are guaranteed support to continue their education and training.</p>
	<p pid="c.1001W.5/3">The Secretary of State also announced a pilot, as part of the Skills Account trials, to fund and support training for older adults, up to Level 3, who want to return to, or move on in work.

	<p pid="c.1006W.2/1">The UK has not made any specific representations to the Iranian government on this issue. And while the fate of the three captured soldiers is a regular part of the UK's dialogue with a range of partners, including Israel, Egypt and the UN, we have not received any direct representations about this issue. However, we would encourage all who have influence to use that responsibly to ensure the safe release of these soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1006W.2/2">We believe that the most effective way to achieve the release of the soldiers captured by Hezbollah is to support efforts by the UN to mediate between the parties as part of the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. We continue to support the efforts of the Governments of Israel, Egypt and others to negotiate the release of Gilad Shalit.</p>

	<p pid="c.1006W.5/1">The deployment of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) under UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701 has been a success. There are now approximately 13,000 UN troops deployed as part of the enhanced UNIFIL contingent alongside a similar number from the Lebanese army. Since the expansion of the UNIFIL force following the passage of UNSCR 1701 in August 2006, the cessation of hostilities has largely been maintained and the area of operations has been largely stabilised. The UK fully supports UNIFIL, whose presence has been critical in maintaining peace and security in south Lebanon.</p>

In addition, since the first round of presidential elections on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-29">29 March</phrase>, international organisations have dealt with 34,000 displaced people and 2,700 injured by the ZANU-PF campaign of violence.

The principal proposals include: an increase in basic votes for all countries (which would primarily benefit the poorest countries); measures to strengthen the voice of developing countries at the Board of Executive Directors; and a review of the process for selecting the President of the Bank. The UK Government welcome these proposals and is actively engaged in discussions to reach agreement by April 2009 on a package of measures that will increase the voice of developing countries at the World Bank.</p>
