The Secretary of State will be responsible for setting the level of penalties in England. The penalty level will be set when section 86 comes into force, which is currently expected to be in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.350W.11/1">The Department has commissioned a number of research projects in recent years to assess the environmental impact of road humps.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.11/2">The research has indicated that emissions from individual vehicles may increase with the implementation of traffic calming measures, due to increased driver acceleration and deceleration. However, the reduction in the volume of traffic within traffic calming schemes usually means that the overall changes in air quality are roughly neutral.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.11/3">After the installation of road humps and speed cushions, research has shown that the maximum noise levels from light vehicles (cars) are reduced, as is the overall traffic noise level when light vehicles form most of the traffic stream. However, the effect on noise from large vehicles is more complex. While there are some decreases in maximum vehicle noise levels from large commercial vehicles due to reductions in their speeds, this can be offset by increases in noise from the bodywork of such vehicles as they pass over the humps and cushions. The net effect of these measures on the overall traffic noise depends on the proportion of large commercial vehicles in the traffic stream, and on the type of road hump installed.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.11/4">The environmental impact of road humps has to be considered against the need to improve road safety. Around 3,500 people are killed and a further 34,000 are seriously injured on our roads every year. Nearly 2,400 of these casualties are child pedestrians. Compliance with speed limits would reduce these unacceptable numbers, and experience shows that traffic calming measures such as road humps have significant safety benefits.</p>

However adjusted grant data is available only from 1997&ndash;98 onwards. Please note therefore that the data for the period 1992&ndash;93 to 1997&ndash;98 is on an unadjusted basis while the data for the period 1998&ndash;99 onwards is on an adjusted basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.14/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Tamworth since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/2">In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Tamworth have benefited from two Sport England Lottery grants totalling &pound;582,152.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, west midlands grants increased from &pound;5.6 million to &pound;32.5 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in regularly funded organisations will be &pound;35.4 million. Tamworth has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including Black Country Touring and Arts Alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/4">Schools in Tamworth also benefit from the Staffordshire Youth Music Action Zone, known as Make Some Noise. Since its establishment in 2001 Make Some Noise has received three grants totalling &pound;804,800 enabling it to reach 6,000 young people through local music projects and events.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/5">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Tamworth will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/6">Renaissance in the regions has funded the appointment of a museums development officer to support museums in the west midlands regional hub. It has provided &pound;90,000 in 2004&ndash;05 for additional museums development support through the museums development fund and the hub's regional development fund to the Marches Curators group, of which Staffordshire is a part. This will be increased to &pound;155,000 in 2005&ndash;06. Training courses in leadership and conservation have been organised through the hub and a member of Tamworth council's staff has been seconded to Birmingham city council as part of a skills sharing initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/7">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/8">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Tamworth with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 3,865.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/9">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/10">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Tamworth, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/11">Tourism in Tamworth has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the regional development agencies, including Advantage West Midlands. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Tamworth .</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/12">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Tamworth are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million Lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the future action plan and library improvement programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/13">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community value of public libraries. In 1998&ndash;1999 the DCMS/Wolfson public libraries challenge fund allocated funding to the community learning network partnership in Staffordshire. This award of &pound;49,000 was granted in order to assist the provision of Open for learning&quot; centres in libraries across Staffordshire to support self-study and distance learning. Tamworth Library was one such Centre and received a proportion of the funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.14/14">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Tamworth has benefited from 175 awards totalling just over &pound;4.8 million. Of these, 23 awards worth over &pound;800.000 were made by the new opportunities fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The new opportunities fund merged with the community fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.8/1">No special arrangements have been put in place for those organising major sporting events where they wish to conduct licensable activities. They will be subject to the same provisions under the Licensing Act 2003 with regard to applying for permissions as other organisations or individuals. Of course, outdoor sporting events (with the exception of boxing and wrestling entertainment) are not in themselves licensable activities under the 2003 Act.</p>

If the claimant meets the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Refugee Convention, they are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If an application is refused, and any appeal is unsuccessful, then we expect the individual concerned to leave the UK voluntarily. If they do not, we consider that it is entirely reasonable for us to enforce the return of that individual.</p>

	<p pid="a.383W.0/2">The five-year Immigration Strategy that we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase> contained details of our plans through e-Borders to introduce an electronic system of counting in and out visitors to the UK. Automated electronic checks will record people's movements to provide a greatly enhanced passenger movement audit with significantly more reliable inbound and outbound data information than any of the border agencies have been able to obtain in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.0/3">The Immigration Service is taking forward a number of projects under the umbrella of the e-Borders programme. Advance passenger information combined with new technology will allow passenger information to be collected on departure from the UK. The departure information will provide vital management and intelligence information, which may then be reconciled against information held on failed asylum seekers (FAS). A number of other Government agencies, such as the Department of Health, Department of Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue have also expressed an interest in the potential benefits of a comprehensive passenger movement record.</p>
	<p pid="a.383W.0/4">The benefits of introducing a system for reconciling a passenger's departure from the UK against his/her arrival works only with a fully integrated comprehensive system covering all passengers and routes (including air, sea and rail). Such a system is planned as part of the full e-Borders solution. It is not intended to issue identity cards to failed asylum seekers. However, by reducing the opportunity for failed asylum seekers to work illegally, ID cards will make it less practical to remain in the UK as a failed asylum seeker.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.5/1">Information on community sentences for the years 2000 to 2003 is contained in table A. Statistics for 2004 will be published in the latter part of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/2">Restorative justice can form part of referral orders and reparation orders, which are disposals for juveniles. The Youth Justice Board has set a key performance indicator (KPI) for Youth Offending Teams (YOTS) which seeks to ensure that at least 75 per cent. of victims of youth crime referred to YOTS are offered the opportunity to participate in restorative processes by 2005. Table B gives performance against this KPI.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/3">The Government are keen to encourage the use of restorative justice throughout the adult criminal justice system. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 allows for restorative justice to be part of an offender's sentence, permitting sentencers to include it in activity requirements imposed as part of a Community Order. This will be piloted in due course. The Act also allows for the use of restorative justice in the new Conditional Caution. We are about to issue implementation guidance on restorative justice for Local Criminal Justice Boards and their constituent agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.5/4">As part of the reform of the sentencing structure in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, current community sentences for adults, including the community punishment order, will be replaced by a single generic community order with a range of possible requirements. Courts will then be able to choose different elements to make up a bespoke community order. Technological advances, such as electronic monitoring provide innovative ways to monitor compliance, reduce offending and ensure community sentences are not a soft option. The new community order will be available from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase> and will apply only to offences committed on or after that date.</p>

	<p pid="a.387W.2/1">The probability that an offender will be reconvicted is strongly associated with a number of factors such as age and previous criminal history. It is not appropriate to compare reconviction rates over time as allowances need to be made for any change in the characteristics of offenders being given community-based sentences. For instance, if young offenders were proportionally more numerous in some years than they were in others, we would predict an increase in the actual rate as younger offenders are more likely to be reconvicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.2/2">Home Office Online Report 59/04 controlled for such changes in characteristics, and also excluded the impact of more rigorous enforcement of breaches by the Probation Service. It found that, when compared to the reconviction rate that is predicted given their characteristics, there was a reduction of 2 per cent. in the reconviction rate between 1997 and 2001 for adult offenders given community sentences, although this reduction was not statistically significant</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.2/3">The tables give unadjusted reconviction rates for those receiving community based sentences in each year since 1997, broken down by type of sentence and offence committed. The figures given are for those aged 16 and over and show the percentage reconvicted within two years. Figures broken down by offence are not readily available for the years 1997 and 1998.</p>

In addition the independent Advisory Panel on Country Information provides rigorous external scrutiny of country information material produced by the Home Office and makes recommendations to help ensure that it is of the highest quality. The Advisory Panel rightly considered it essential that the Home Office's country information material should not only be objective in fact, but should also be perceived as being objective and have the confidence of all its users. That is why I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-08">8 September 2004</phrase> that in future, the production of country information material used by the Home Office will be undertaken by a country information unit dedicated solely to that function.</p>

	<p pid="a.395W.2/1">The Immigration Service provides a 24-hour service at John Lennon airport. Two immigration officers are scheduled for duty throughout the period, except from 07.30 to 10.00 hours when there is one. This shift coverage takes into account the schedule of incoming flights.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/2">There are no customs officers permanently based at Liverpool John Lennon airport. Customs attendance is determined on the basis of risk. Customs officers deploy to the airport in accordance with flight or passenger profiles or more specific intelligence. Mobile staff are deployed from the local area, or from the regional or national strike forces on a flexible basis in order to be able to respond to any identified risk. They attend selected arrivals for class 'A' drugs, revenue goods and other prohibited or restricted items, and selected departures for work in connection with the Proceeds of Crime Act. Therefore, there will be no customs staff on duty for some arrivals/departures, but a much larger number of mobile staff for others, where a risk has been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/3">The Immigration Service is working to identify and implement cost-effective improvements to ensure appropriate access to detention and escort facilities when required.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/4">Peel Holdings, as the airport operator, has overall responsibility for the security of John Lennon airport. A representative from the Immigration Service attends regular meetings with Peel Holdings, the police, HM Customs and Excise and other control authority partners, to discuss new airline routes and airport development. The Immigration Service also attend a monthly multi-agency threat and risk assessment meeting with other security stakeholders to make accurate assessments of any threats to John Lennon airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/5">Between April 2004 and January 2005 there have been three occasions where passengers whose identity was in doubt have absconded from the immigration control at John Lennon airport. To reduce the risk of this happening again, the Immigration Service are in negotiations to improve security at the immigration control there. Records of such absconders prior to April 2004 are not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.399W.2/2">We are committed to tackling racist behaviour wherever it occurs and in whatever form. The Government introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 nine new racially aggravated offences which carry higher maximum penalties where there is evidence of a racist motive or racial hostility in connection with the offence. The offences include assaults, verbal abuse and harassment and criminal damage. For these purposes Sikhs and Jews have been deemed by the courts to be racial groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/3">The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 expanded these provisions to cover religiously&mdash;as well as racially&mdash;aggravated offences, thereby affording the same protection against attacks to religious groups such as Muslims and Christians.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/4">Under the same Act the maximum penalty for incitement to racial hatred, an offence under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986, was increased from two to seven years' imprisonment. This offence makes it unlawful to use threatening, abusive or insulting language with the intention or likelihood that racial hatred would be stirred up.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/5">The Home Secretary has announced that as part of its Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, the Government are proposing extending this offence to afford the same protection against incitement to hatred to faith communities including Muslims.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/6">The Association of Chief Police Officers is updating its guidance to forces on dealing with hate crime and the Crown Prosecution Service has made clear in its published policy its determination to deal robustly with racial and religious hate crime.</p>

On completion of the exercise she was due to visit Plymouth (from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February</phrase>), but the weather conditions were too poor to enable a safe recovery of her towed sonar and she made a surfaced passage to Brest.</p>

Onboard holdings on deployed units are supplemented by spares carried afloat on Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels, and by shore stocks. The level of spares held ashore is a balance between ensuring normal commitments can be met and minimising the value and volume of stockholdings. These levels are adequate to meet operational commitments under the normal support/reduced support regime currently in place.</p>

The impact on electricity prices is difficult to assess and is dependent on the carbon price, so for example at a carbon price of &euro;5 per tonne of carbon dioxide the Department estimates that electricity prices to industry might increase by around 6 per cent. and prices to the domestic consumer by around 3 per cent.

	<p pid="a.415W.3/1">The high spot gas prices at the end of February and beginning of March appear to have been caused by high demand and market concerns over supply tightness during cold weather across Europe. There were also technical problems reducing supplies from the North Sea and issues around the levels in short and medium term storage. Temperatures have now returned to at or above the seasonal average, and supply concerns have lessened. Spot prices have reduced accordingly, and we still have supplies in storage to meet another cold snap. The impact on manufacturing companies will vary extensively and depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas individual companies use and the exposure of a particular company to the spot price.</p>

	<p pid="a.419W.8/1">Wherever possible, those alleged to have committed terrorist offences are prosecuted and committed for trial as soon as all the available admissible evidence has been gathered. However, in some cases the intelligence available may suggest that the person poses a potential terrorist threat but there is insufficient admissible evidence to bring a criminal charge. It is for that reason that the Government introduced the control order provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.426W.5/22">1. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation. Cataracts operations defined as 071,072,074,075 (OPCS4 Procedure).</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.5/23">2. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the data-year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.5/24">3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid="a.433W.6/1">There are 25 neonatal managed clinical networks. Information on the ratio of nurses to infants within units is not collected centrally. The ratio is not constant, but relative to the criticality of the infants. This varies according to demand both within and between units providing a range of special, high dependency and intensive care. Research suggests that, in practice, the ratio of nurses to infants in special care is between one nurse to three and one nurse to four infants. In high dependency care, the ratio is in the order of one to two. In intensive care the ratio is one to one, and with some more specialised procedures, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the ratio increases further.</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.2/1">The Government's objective is to enable people with learning disabilities to access a health service designed around their individual needs. The Valuing People&quot; (March 2001) White Paper included key actions on health and steps taken to achieve these; including the appointment of expert health advisers by the Valuing People&quot; support team.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/2">The health of people with learning disabilities should be part of mainstream health plans to ensure that all national health service services are accessible to everyone. The Public Health White Paper will address the issue of health inequalities. We are supporting the Disability Rights Commission's investigation into inequalities in access to health care services for people with learning disabilities and mental health service users. We are also discussing with the National Patient Safety Agency a scoping project into the confidential inquiry into premature deaths of people with learning disabilities. There will be an announcement shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/3">We are improving access to primary care services through a new performance indicator in 2005&ndash;06 to monitor registration of people with learning disabilities by primary care trusts. In addition, the Healthcare Commission is raising the profile of services for people with learning disabilities through the appointment of a learning disability specialist. We are further supporting the health needs of learning disabled people through funding given to the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/4">The Valuing People&quot; White Paper did not define targets; instead, it set out various actions and objectives. Many of the actions have been taken and the objectives achieved. Where work is in progress and the associated aims and objectives have not yet been achieved, we are working with the Valuing People&quot; support team to take remedial action to ensure their achievement in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.0/1">The national health service hospital eye service provides optical devices and loans low vision aids, such as high-powered reading lenses, hand-held and stand magnifiers and telescopes, to people with visual impairment. In addition, some primary care trusts have local arrangements for the provision of low vision aids through community-based opticians.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.0/2">Electronic magnifiers are classed as aids to daily living and as such providing them is the responsibility of local authority social services departments. Social service departments assess individuals' needs and arrange services to meet those needs. This can include the provision of closed circuit television (CCTV). However, hand-held, stand and spectacle-mounted magnifiers are generally easier to use, more widely available and more accessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.0/3">In keeping with the principle of flexibility in meeting local needs, NHS hospital trusts, primary care trusts and social service departments are being encouraged to work more closely together, including the possibility of establishing joint budgets for equipment which could allow for the provision of a wider range of services and equipment than has hitherto been available.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.4/1">Over the past three years significant work has been initiated or completed to improve communication between staff in Government Departments in Northern Ireland and people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/2">Examples of steps taken across Departments are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/3" class="indent">The formation of a partnership group whereby Departments, led by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, are working in partnership with representatives of the deaf community to develop ideas for improving access to public services by users of sign language;</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.4/6" class="indent">Departments have been delivering training in deaf awareness, sign language and in the use of text phones;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/7" class="indent">The Department of Finance and Personnel is implementing a programme to ensure people with disabilities can have physical access and communication access to Government buildings. This includes the installation of Deaf Loop systems (at counter points, reception areas and designated rooms in all buildings with a public interface), Deaf Alerter systems for evacuation purposes, Beacons in toilet areas, Quematic systems in public offices, Signage and Text Phones;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/8" class="indent">The Promoting Social Inclusion Working Group on Disability was established in 2004. This comprises members of Government Departments and those representing people with disabilities and is examining how services can be improved to better address the needs and rights of disabled people including those who are deaf or have a hearing impairment. This work includes conducting a major survey of people with disabilities across Northern Ireland during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/9">Examples of good practice within Departments are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/10" class="indent">The Social Security Agency (SSA) is working in partnership with the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) on a pilot scheme which will identify possible improvements on services for customers with hearing impairments. Furthermore the SSA has given a commitment to work towards the RNID's Louder than Words&quot; Charter Mark of best practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/11" class="indent">The Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency of the Department of the Environment makes extra time available to theory test candidates, if required;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/12" class="indent">Trainees with a disability, including those who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, who enter Jobskills, are entitled to additional training time and funding to assist them in achieving their qualifications;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/13" class="indent">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has provided support under the PEACE II programme for a project which will provide training, support and networking for people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/14" class="indent">The College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise identifies students who are deaf or have a hearing impairment when they enrol. Each student with such a disability is assigned a personal tutor;</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/15" class="indent">The Department of Education in co-operation with the National Deaf Children's Society has issued two booklets, Deaf Friendly Schools&quot; and Deaf Friendly Nurseries and Pre-schools&quot;, which provide a clear and friendly view of the context in which young deaf people's education takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.4/16">All of the above are examples of the standards which Government have set and will continue to review and improve by working in partnership with organisations representing people who are deaf or hearing impaired and from disabled people themselves via consultation and the gathering of information.</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.5/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the right hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. David Trimble, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question asking what plans the Government has to improve <i>(a)</i> the Portaferry Road between Newtownards and Portaferry over the next two years and <i>(b)</i> traffic management in Newtownards to alleviate traffic congestion at peak times (222123). I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/4" class="indent">I am pleased to be able to advise you that we are planning an improvement scheme during the 2005/6 financial year, costing approximately &pound;30,000 along the A20 Portaferry to Newtownards road at the Rowreagh Road/Gransha Road junction, subject to agreement on land acquisition. We are also starting work shortly on the reconstruction of Main Street, Kircubbin, from the junction with Blackhall Street to the junction with Roden Street, at an estimated cost of &pound;300,000. Unfortunately, a scheme to resurface approximately one kilometre of the stretch of Rowreagh Road south of Loughdoo Road to Abbacy Road at a cost of approximately &pound;120,000 has been postponed due to an impending major works scheme by Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/5" class="indent">With regard to traffic management schemes planned for Newtownards, you will be aware a number of road improvement schemes have been identified in the Draft Ards/Down Area Plan. I understand the Public Inquiry for the Plan is due to commence in early May. The schemes identified in the Area Plan include the:</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/6" class="indent">Bowtown Road link&mdash;from Portaferry Road to Bowtown Road;</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/7" class="indent">Southern Relief Road&mdash;from Portaferry Road to Scrabo Road via the Comber Road;</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/8" class="indent">Frederick Street Link&mdash;from Nursery Road to Frederick Street Roundabout; and</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/9" class="indent">Talbot Street/North Road upgrade&mdash;improvements to junction layout.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/10" class="indent">In addition, the construction of the Bowtown Road link extension to the Donaghadee Road via the Movilla Road, to the east of Newtownards, has been identified to be undertaken with the proposed development to the east of the town. All of these schemes will contribute significantly to the improvement of traffic movements in the town of Newtownards, although no definite timescale can be given for the delivery of most of these schemes at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/11" class="indent">It is likely that the proposed Southern Relief Road, which will greatly benefit traffic movement in the area, may well be provided over the next two years. Planning permission has already been granted for a section of this road and work is currently ongoing to progress the Direction Order on the remainder of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/12" class="indent">The Zion Place roundabouts on the Bangor Road have also been identified within the Draft Ards/Down Area Plan as requiring improvements and modelling work is ongoing for this junction. As the provision of the Southern Relief Road will alter the traffic movements at the New Road/Portaferry Road junction, this site is also being examined. Unfortunately, it is not possible at this time to be precise on when these junctions may be improved as any proposed schemes will be dependant on the findings of the Area Plan Public Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/13" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>, the provision of additional funding to enable the Chief Constable to expand the work of the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT) in a way that will command the confidence of relatives and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.2/2">The objective of the new unit will be to try and achieve closure where concerns remain from families and to allow the PSNI as an organisation to close inquiries with confidence in the integrity of the investigative process and satisfied that no further investigative opportunities exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.2/3">Where evidential opportunities exist these cases will be reinvestigated with the possibility of evidence being provided to the DPP. Of course, those convicted may be eligible to apply to the Independent Sentence Review Commissioners for early release under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.2/4">Where a judicial outcome is not possible, the unit will consider ways through which as much information as possible might be made available to the relatives of victims, if that is what they want.</p>

	<p pid="a.445W.5/2">I recognise that there is more to overall levels of funding than differences in funding rates and I acknowledge that there are other important differences between school and FE funding. This is a complex area and there is currently no reliable like-for-like comparison between schools and colleges. As part of its agenda for change the LSC is currently reviewing the funding systems and will be consulting later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.2/1">We did not abolish the project. A private company, UK eUniversities Worldwide (UKeU), was formed to take forward the UK e-University project. It was intended that this should secure equal funding from public and private sector investment. In autumn 2003 the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) commissioned an independent review of the UKeU plans. In the light of changes in the global financial market, the fact that student recruitment had not met planned targets in the first year, and the lack of any immediate prospect of matching private investment, the Board of the HEFCE concluded that the opportunity cost of providing further funds was too high. HEFCE then sought discussions with UKeU on a restructuring of the company's activities. On hearing of HEFCE's decision, the UKeU board resigned. The HEFCE Board then decided that future HEFCE funding should be used to support the development of e-learning in universities and colleges themselves, placing emphasis on public good objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.453W.2/1">Swimming and water safety is a compulsory part of the PE national curriculum at Key Stage 2. During key stages 3 and 4, schools must offer pupils two programmes of study from: swimming and water safety; athletics and; outdoor and adventurous activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/2">Swimming also has a significant role to play within our national strategy for PE, School Sport and Club Links. Since 2001 we have:</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/3" class="indent">created a new swimming and water safety website (<a href="http://www.nc.uk.net/safeswimming">www.nc.uk.net/safeswimming</a>) which provides practical support for schools and swimming teachers;</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/4" class="indent">published, in December 2003, a swimming charter, which sets out guidelines, shares best practice and provides practical support to help schools overcome many of the challenges they face when planning and delivering swimming; and</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/5" class="indent">carried out a pilot programme which tested out how best to support those children who reach the end of Key Stage 2 and are not able to swim 25 metres.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/6">We intend to implement this programme nationally from April 2006 and over &pound;5 million of funding has been allocated to support the scheme in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. We will be consulting shortly on what the detail of this programme might look like.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/7">Furthermore, as part of its wider provision, the PE and school sport national professional development programme will help to improve the quality of swimming teaching throughout England. The programme will identify where there is most need and provide specific professional development and support to help ensure high quality swimming tuition in schools. Every school will be able to access this programme free of charge from April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.2/8">As it is a statutory part of the national curriculum, no charge to parents can be made for the cost of providing swimming lessons, or for the cost of transport to carry pupils to and from the lesson. Schools can ask for voluntary contributions to cover the cost of swimming activities, but when requesting the contribution it must make it clear that no child will be treated differently, or left out of the activity, because their parent is unable or unwilling to make the contribution.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.3/3">Looking to the second round of parliamentary elections on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-13">13 March 2005</phrase> and the presidential elections later this year, I urged the Kyrgyz authorities in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-04">4 March</phrase> to take these issues into account and seize the opportunity to set a strong example for the rest of Central Asia.</p>
