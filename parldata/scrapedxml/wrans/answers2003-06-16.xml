	<p pid=".1W.6/1">The benefits to developing countries from the Doha 'Development' Round will depend on the final outcome at the end of the negotiations in 2005. A beneficial outcome for developing countries, including African countries, in the agriculture negotiations would need to address both domestic support and export guarantees. Reductions in currently high levels of trade-distorting support are necessary to address overproduction in the developed world and the swamping of world commodity markets, both of which are of interest to developing countries. Under export guarantees, more explicit rules on the terms of use of export credits and food aid, as well as reductions in export subsidies are needed to address the issue of dumping which is currently harming developing countries' local production and trade.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.6/2">The UK is committed to ensuring real reductions in OECD agricultural subsidies, as well as to making progress in other areas of concern not only to African developing countries. These include improving market access for agricultural products and establishing fair rules for special and differential treatment to safeguard food security and rural development in Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".2W.3/1">Price fluctuations are a feature of many primary agricultural commodity markets, including those for coffee, cocoa and cotton. This instability can have negative implications in producer countries at both national level (e.g. in terms of foreign exchange earnings, government revenues and the ability to service debt etc.), and at household level, even in countries where a degree of diversification has been achieved. Any negative effects on the natural and physical environment, such as inappropriate farming practices, cannot be disassociated from the livelihood challenges which a downturn in commodity markets creates for those dependent on the production, marketing and trade in these products.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/2">Many of the world's poorest countries, particularly those in Africa, remain dependent on these three commodities. We are committed to helping these countries reduce their dependence on these commodities and increase their resilience in the face of unstable world prices. The UK Government, through its development programme and other efforts at international level, are seeking to expand trade opportunities, although existing trade barriers (including tariff escalation) and developed country agricultural policies are major impediments to this. The UK is working to secure reform of international trade rules in general and to reduce the impact of protectionist regimes on developing countries such as the Common Agricultural Policy. In addition, there is scope for creating a more favourable domestic environment within commodity dependent countries themselves. This is necessary to generate broader more diverse economic growth that will provide the means to reduce vulnerability to shocks, such as falling prices. The UK provides support to a variety of activities in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.3/1">DFID supports a number of projects in Afghanistan, Iraq and Nigeria to assist women; these are detailed as follows. DFID also provides un-earmarked core funding to UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women), which will be &pound;3.6 million in 2003. This supports a partnership set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper agreed with UNIFEM in 1999. Women's human rights are central to all UNIFEM's programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.3/2">In Afghanistan DFID's assistance strategy targets vulnerable people, particularly women, who are in need of direct assistance. The World Food Programme, which DFID has funded as part of the strategy, runs employment projects solely for vulnerable women. These projects, such as bakery co-operatives and small farms, are run in both urban and rural areas. DFID provided &pound;4.7 million to WFP in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.3/3">This year DFID is also providing support to other projects that are targeted at vulnerable women; &pound;200,000 to a micro-finance initiative run in Afghanistan by the Bangladeshi Rural Advancement Committee, and &pound;1 million to an Aga Khan Network project for improving livelihood opportunities in Badakhshan province. This assistance is targeted at vulnerable women in general, rather than specifically at widows.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.3/4">In Iraq, DFID has provided &pound;819,000 to the NGO 4RS since 1999 for their work with widows and vulnerable households headed by women. Their work includes income generation projects in the Kirkuk area of northern Iraq and in particular the Anfal widows. In addition DFID has provided &pound;105,673 to 4RS for their work to assist displaced unsupported women in northern Iraq during the recent conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.3/5">In Nigeria, DFID has provided &pound;5,000 during the last six months to train 1,000 widows through the Access to Justice programme operating in Enugu state. A further 1,000 widows will receive training during the coming six months at a cost of &pound;3,700.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.3/6">In Angola, DFID has no projects directly aimed at helping widows, but our &pound;8 million Angola country programme focuses on reducing poverty for all Angolans and we are increasingly working with the Government of Angola to help it meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>

It is widely acknowledge that multilateral trade reform can have significant benefits for developing countries. For example, the World Bank estimates that eliminating all barriers to trade in goods would generate an extra US$250 billion&ndash;US$620 billion in global income, up to half of which would go to developing countries. In terms of poverty reduction, this could lift over 300 million people out of poverty by 2015.</p>

In Council negotiations we have made it clear that we will not support proposals that would damage business competitiveness while lacking a clear focus on achieving environmental gain.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.7/2">The assessment of the implications of compulsory financial security was carried out by my Department in consultation with business generally, with the insurance industry, and with other relevant Government Departments. It revealed that the cost to UK businesses of a compulsory insurance requirement could range from &pound;130 million to &pound;1.8 billion per annum. These costs would far outweigh the environmental benefits of the Directive, as evaluated in the Department's Extended Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (COM(02)17). These factors point strongly against such a requirement. The Government's policy therefore is not to support compulsory financial security.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.2/1">When Defra was created in June 2001 the Ministerial Correspondence Unit consisted of eight permanent members of staff. More staff were appointed in the following months to deal with the vastly increased volume of letters received following the creation of the new Department and on the foot and mouth disease outbreak. Staff rose to a peak of 26 in May 2002 and consisted of a combination of permanent and temporary staff. The Unit currently consists of 15 members of staff, eight of whom are permanent and seven of whom are employed on casual contracts.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.11/1">The Government believes that the tenanted sector has an important role to play in developing a sustainable and diverse future for the farming industry. Many Farm Business Tenancies are too short to provide the security a tenant needs to develop and diversify their businesses. That is why the Government asked the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to put forward proposals for tenancy reform. The Tenancy Reform Industry Group has reached an industry consensus on these issues and its report to Government was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-03">3 June</phrase>. We have welcomed the report and will be considering the Tenancy Reform Industry Group recommendations carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.11/2">The June Agricultural Census shows that there were just over 12,300 Farm Business Tenancies in England at June 2002. The recently published results of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers' Annual Tenanted Farms Survey for 2002 shows that in England and Wales some 18,200 hectares of previously un-let land have been let on Farm Business Tenancies. After taking account of losses of let land during the survey period there has been a net gain to the tenanted sector of some 10,500 hectares. The Central Association of Agricultural Valuers' survey also shows that the average length of a Farm Business Tenancy is just under 4 years and that some 80 per cent. of lets involve bare land.</p>

Funding under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) is available to support a range of local food initiatives. For example, we have made money available under the Rural Enterprise Scheme of the ERDP for a three year project to establish a Gloucestershire Farmers' Market Group which will help in the setting up of new markets, create a website and provide a one-stop advice service for local producers in the county. We will continue to deploy our various funding schemes to encourage a flourishing local food sector.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.2/3">Figures for prosecutions prior to the transfer of all anti-smuggling controls to HM Customs and Excise on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-11">11 April 2003</phrase>, were not held centrally. We are aware of one successful prosecution brought by Crawley borough council in July 2002, which resulted in a &pound;150 fine and &pound;100 costs. In September 2001, HM Customs and Excise brought a prosecution for the illegal importation of bushmeat derived from endangered species. The offender was found not guilty of these offences, but was however found guilty of an offence under Products of Animal Origin (Third Country Imports) (England) Regulations. The Corporation of London Port Health Authority issued six cautions in October 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.5/1">The Mersey Forest project is one of 12 Community Forests set up under the Countryside Agency's Community Forest Programme. The North West Regional Economic Strategy identifies the Mersey Forest, and other forestry projects in the Region, as factors that are helping to create the right conditions for inward investment, regeneration, tourist development and overall quality of life. In order to evaluate the programme the Agency has commissioned a range of independent research projects. These projects have identified a number of contributions that the Mersey Forest has made, or is making.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.5/2">The research has shown that the Mersey Forest and the Red Rose Forest (around Manchester) are identified, among other projects, as having a role to play in helping to reposition the region's image for attracting businesses and tourists to the region. The Mersey Forest project has helped develop an integrated approach to the development of rural businesses and the management of the landscape in which they work. In order to encourage more people to participate in outdoor activities, the Mersey Forest has created a network and support structure for the Mersey Forest Friends groups, which are self-managing and are given support to undertake the sustainable management of their local woodlands. In addition, the Mersey Forest's &quot;Schools Ground Development&quot; programme was established to create wooded play areas surrounding schools. Events to encourage outdoor activities include nature walks, moonlight walks, forest survival, volunteer days and play schemes. I understand that forest based activities have increased by 600 per cent. in the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.5/3">The research indicates that the Mersey and Red Rose Forests have been involved in pioneering work on closed landfill sites, establishing new methodologies for assessing sites and determining their suitability for woodland. I understand that 12 per cent. of the derelict land (4,000 hectares) within the Mersey Forest area has been reclaimed, of which some 65 hectares of woodland was planted on damaged or disturbed ground in 2001. The Mersey Forest (in association with the Red Rose Forest, the Forestry Commission, the North West Development Agency and the Environment Agency) is using the Capital Modernisation Fund to deliver community woodland on derelict, under utilised and neglected land.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.2/1">The 12 Community Forests (including the Mersey Forest) set up under Community Forests Programme (administered by the Countryside Agency) were envisaged as pilot projects. Through this Programme the Countryside Agency planned to test out the idea that &quot;community forestry&quot; could provide signficant benefits for the local community. Partners in many other areas could apply the lessons learnt and promote community forestry projects without national support, while the continued existence of the twelve pilot forests would stand or fall on the basis of the value placed on them by organisations in their locality and region.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.2/2">The commitment to support the pilot Community Forest projects was for a period of 10 years from 1995. I am considering the current position in the light of the development of regional agendas and strategies, including Regional Forestry Frameworks that are being brought together by the Forestry Commission. These frameworks will be owned by Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies. It appears likely that the Regional Forestry Frameworks will be the main vehicle for securing regional ownership for a mainstream role for community forestry in Government Office and Regional Development Agency strategies and future business plans.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.5/1">I assume that this question is about the environmental impact in terms of emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds from making use of the products listed.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.5/2">The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory gives the total of emissions to atmosphere in the UK of non-methane volatile organic solvents in the year 2000 as 1676 kilotonnes. Separate research conducted for us by ENTEC suggests that of this total about 50 kilotonnes of emissions were from decorative paints, and less than 1 kilotonne from the domestic use of adhesives and sealants. Emissions from the other products listed were not identified separately.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.8/1">I assume this question concerns the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) a common constituent of aerosol products and a known contributor to the formation of tropospheric ozone which has been widely researched, and which is known to cause damage to ecosystems and to human health, primarily to the respiratory system.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.8/2">Since 1990 overall UK emissions of VOCs have fallen by approximately 44 per cent. to 1514 kilotonnes in 2001. Under the National Emission Ceilings Directive we are committed to further reductions to 1200 kilotonnes by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.8/3">Estimated emissions of VOCs from aerosol household products makes up about 0.5 per cent. of total UK VOC emissions. This amounts to approximately eight kilotonnes out of the 2001 total of 1514 kilotonnes. Spray furniture polish constitutes a relatively small proportion of the total aerosol household products category.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.2/1">In general we believe that port developments should not need public subsidy, but each case is judged on its merits and if there is evidence of market failure and the project offers worthwhile economic and/or environmental benefits, it may qualify for an element of public funding. For example, since 1997 the Government has awarded three freight grants worth a total of over &pound;15 million to three UK ports to assist with capital projects designed to remove freight from road and onto to water. Information on other possible sources of public funding given to ports is not held centrally. Proposals to develop new ports are primarily matters for the private sector companies involved, subject to obtaining the statutory consents required.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.5/1">A Diplomatic Conference at the International Maritime Organization in October 2002, considered a draft amendment to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage By Sea, 1974. A draft instrument was duly adopted as the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage By Sea, 2002. When in force, following ratification by 10 States, the 2002 Convention will significantly increase the amount of compensation available for death or personal injury claims to fare-paying passengers travelling on international services by sea. It will also make it easier for claimants to access compensation through a requirement on ship owners to maintain insurance cover, and by means of a right of direct action against the ship owner's insurer. The UK actively participated in the Conference and welcomes its outcome. The Government is currently exploring legislative options for implementation of the Convention in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.14/1">In December 2002, the Government published the first National Crack plan. It recognises the particular problems caused by crack cocaine and the need to take specific and focused actions to address them. The Plan requires action to prevent crack use, deal with the criminality and disorder associated with it and provide appropriate treatment for those using crack. That we are treating crack as a priority is illustrated by the power to close crack houses contained in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill. Premises, in particular crack houses which are venues for Class A drugs, to be supplied and used causing serious nuisance to the community and neighbours will be closed rapidly and effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.5/1">My noble Friend Lord Filkin represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-08">8 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 21 (8922/03) (a copy of which has been placed in the Library). This included adoption of the Protocol amending the Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes as regards the creation of a customs files identification database (known as FIDE) which Ministers subsequently signed in the margins of the Council.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/3">Ministers discussed the Directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection with a view to resolving the outstanding reservations. However, one member state in particular maintained reservations on the text, including the definition of a refugee and on the right and benefits to be accorded to those with subsidiary protection status. The Presidency reiterated its intention to seek agreement to the Directive at the June JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/4">The Council agreed to exclude refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection from the scope of the Directive concerning the status of third country nationals who are long-term residents. This followed confirmation by the Commission that it would table by early 2004 a separate proposal for a Directive addressing the needs of those groups.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/5">The Presidency summarised progress on the follow up to the Seville European Council in view of the report to be submitted to the Thessaloniki European Council. The Commission reported on the implementation of the Afghan Returns Programme and the feasibility study on the Visa Information System which would be discussed at the June JHA Council. The Commission also confirmed that a Communication on international protection regimes would be prepared in time for that meeting. Lord Filkin urged member states to consider future priorities,&mdash;asylum (including recent UK ideas); reduction of flows of illegal migrants into the EU; more effective co-operation with source countries on returns; and better financing for JHA external action, including proper integration of JHA needs into other EU programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/6">The Presidency and Commission reported on the negotiations with Switzerland on participation in the Schengen Acquis and asylum measures, noting that they would be remitted to the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) and then discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/7">The Presidency reaffirmed its intention to seek adoption at the June JHA Council of the Council Decision authorising signature of the Agreements between the EU and USA on extradition and mutual legal assistance, with signature to take place at the EU-US Summit on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-25">25 June</phrase>. However, it noted that domestic parliamentary scrutiny was on-going for several member states, including the UK. A number of member states, including the UK, also indicated that they were considering the need to make constitutional statements in accordance with Article 24 TEU. One member state sought further amendments to the Extradition Agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/8">The Council reached a general approach on the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. The Presidency said that the European Parliament would need to be re-consulted on the text and further discussions were required on the recitals and accompanying certificate. Five member states, including the UK, maintained parliamentary scrutiny reservations.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/9">The Council agreed the appointment of two Europol Deputy Directors, including a UK candidate.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.5/10">Under any other business, Ministers also took note of the Commission's proposal for a Common Position on notifying the Council of Europe of the forthcoming application of the Framework Decision establishing the European Arrest Warrant between the member states. The Council received an update on recent discussions in the G8 which had reviewed progress made in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. Finally, the Netherlands drew the Council's attention to its contribution to the discussions on judicial cooperation in the Future of Europe Convention.</p>

	<p pid=".36W.6/1">The Cruickshank report of March 2000 rejected the idea of directly regulating the retail charges for ATM cash withdrawals or banning such charges. The Government agrees with this finding and currently has no plans to regulate fee-charging for ATM withdrawals.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.6/2">The costs of providing unrestricted access to cash, 24 hours a day at thousands of locations around the country are considerable. It is a matter of commercial judgment for ATM owners whether to pass these costs on to customers in the form of retail charges. Such charges allow ATMs to be located where otherwise it would not be cost effective to do so. Nevertheless, the Government do not think that it would be appropriate for ATM owners to charge customers in excess of reasonable costs.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.6/3">Recent years have seen a large increase in the number of ATMs&mdash;over 32 per cent. since March 2000. This expansion in the UK's network of ATMs has been to the benefit of consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.6/4">The Government remain committed to introducing legislation to give the Office of Fair Trading new regulatory powers to promote effective competition in payment systems&mdash;and aims to do so as soon as parliamentary time allows. Issues relating to ATMs will be considered as part of this process.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.9/1">We welcome the return of two million refugees to Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran. The successful returns programme is a testament to the work of the UN High Commission for Refugees. We also recognise that Pakistan and Iran have in recent years shouldered the burden of more than five million Afghan refugees, fleeing from more than two decades of civil war, the Taliban, and four years of drought.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.9/2">The Afghan Government has limited capacity to absorb returns. Afghanistan therefore needs the support of host countries seeking to return refugees to ensure that those returns are sustainable. This includes ensuring returns to Afghanistan are compliant with the terms of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, and are carried out with the consent of the Afghan Government.</p>

	<p pid=".53W.8/1">Hovercraft were used during the recent operations in Iraq for tasks including reconnaissance and mine clearance. The advantages of hovercraft include speed, the ability to access a higher percentage of beaches than conventional craft, the ability to travel over small obstacles and in shallow water and a relatively high level of immunity from the threat of mines.</p>
	<p pid=".53W.8/2">Currently, the Royal Marines (539ASRM) operate four Griffon 2000 TDX hovercraft. They have the capacity to lift 12 fully equipped troops or 2 x 1000kg pallets of stores and are capable of deployment in C130 Hercules aircraft. It is expected that the current fleet of hovercraft will be replaced in around 2007. There are no plans at present to increase overall numbers, although this will be kept under review, for example, in light of lessons learned from operations in Iraq.</p>

The UK and the IMAC are in the process of marking and documenting around 400 unexploded ordnance sites. In addition to this, the UK has, with the support of UNICEF and the ICRC, developed a Theatre Mine Risk Education programme.

	<p pid=".61W.11/1">The new form of conditional fee agreement (CFA) will for the first time enable people to enter into lawful agreement with their solicitor that in the event of winning the action the claimant will receive all of their damages and the solicitor will recover their reasonable fees from the losing party. People will have a clear choice between solicitors offering simple CFAs of this type and those offering other forms of CFA or funding arrangement. The simplified CFA is the first step in a programme the Government will be taking forward with key stakeholders including consumer groups to review and simplify the overall CFA regime. We would like to see a regime that it is easier for the consumer to understand and for solicitors to use and against which it is harder for mischievous challenges to be brought. The Government will be publishing a general consultation paper in the next few weeks and will be consulting widely to identify views and the specific actions needed.</p>

	<p pid=".72W.2/1">Non-medical staff, including administrative staff, are classified according to a simplified set of occupation codes introduced in 1995. The occupation codes are based on what staff do and make no reference to payscale information. This allows staff in particular work sectors of the national health service to be identified in a consistent way. The relevant groups for administrative staff are:</p>
	<p pid=".72W.2/2" class="indent">senior managers&mdash;staff at executive level (for example, chief executive and board members) plus those managers who report directly to the members of the executive;</p>

	<p pid=".72W.2/4" class="indent">administrative and clerical staff&mdash;more junior managers and supervisors as well as those involved principally in administrative duties within the NHS, with no direct patient contact.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.2/5">Administrative staff work across all the functions in the NHS, including those working in direct support of clinical staff, such as medical secretaries, as well as those who work in hotel and catering and central services such as human resources and finance.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.6/1">The Government have a target of a 30 per cent. reduction in the number of deliberate fires, including school premises, by March 2009. The target was set following the Spending Review 2000, and the results reported in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Annual Report 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.6/2">Following the Spending Review 2002, fire targets are being reviewed and a revised deliberate fires target will be announced in the Government's forthcoming Fire White Paper, due shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.6/3">Arson is one of the major fire threats facing us today. In 2001, we established the Arson Control Forum to provide the strategic direction to the national fight against arson. The Forum is taking forward a programme of measures that will address arson in its many forms, including deliberate school fires.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.6/4">To date, the Forum has invested some &pound;2.25 million in local initiatives. These include programmes aimed at educating children about the dangers of playing with fire. We have allocated a further &pound;13.3 million over the next three years to build on this programme of work.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.5/1">Although basic credit approvals are mainly issued by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, the total is determined as part of departmental spending plans. For 2003&ndash;04, each individual local authority's share of the total depended on</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/2" class="indent">1. the total of service based allocations for those services for which it is responsible (in this instance, Warwickshire and Worcestershire will comprise Education, Personal Social Services, Transport, and Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS)); plus</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/3" class="indent">2. adjustments to reflect updated receipts information for previous year and to provide for the EPCS Annual Capital Guideline; and</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/4" class="indent">3. the amount distributed according to ministerial discretion.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/5">The basis for distributing basic credit approvals for each of the individual service elements identified at 1. above differs:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/6"><i>The Department for Education and Skills</i> uses a needs based formula for credit approvals which is split 40 per cent. based on pupil numbers and 60 per cent. on the building condition need. This formula does have a regional weighting factor, which is based on a relative assessment of building costs in the area. Worcestershire's weighting factor is 0.96 and Warwickshire's is one.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/7"><i>The Department for Transport</i> bases its allocations on the length of networks and numbers of bridges etc. It also factors in the relative size of backlogs compared to the national picture. Some adjustments may be made to allocations based on information supplied by the Government Office, local authority and Department for Transport, which can take account of cost differentials.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/8"><i>The Department of Health</i> allocation of BCAs is based on two factors: tender price indexing for social housing (TPISH) and an authority's population figures. As both Worcestershire and Warwickshire are in the West Midlands region, the same TPISH figure will apply. Population figures are split into three age groupings (based on Census 2001 data) which are weighted. Allocation differences will arise from the individual local authority population differences.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.5/9">In addition to basic credit approvals, local authorities also receive supplementary credit approvals from Departments and these are mostly allocated following a bidding process. In these instances, local authorities supply the cost data supporting their bids, which are then assessed and processed by the relevant Government Departments.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.8/1">The area cost adjustment (ACA) is a top up in the grant formula, which provides extra grant to areas with higher labour and business rate costs. It is directed at those areas which, because of labour market pressures, have higher recruitment and retention costs. The following table shows the size of the ACA formula top up for four key services for the authorities named above. These figures correspond to those given in the 'simpler presentation of formula outcomes tables', produced for the 2003&ndash;04 local government finance settlement, detailed in the table.</p>

The Family Resources Survey 2001&ndash;02, on which the relevant Green Paper material was based, indicated that 11.8 million employees (45 per cent. of the total) were not at that time contributing to a private pension. Many of these may, of course, have private pension provision to which they were not contributing at that time.</p>
