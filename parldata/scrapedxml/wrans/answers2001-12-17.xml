If satisfaction falls below benchmarks (based on the results of surveys carried out at the time of franchising) the companies can be required to produce an action plan to remedy the problem. The Strategic Rail Authority have initiated a new National Passenger Survey (NPS) which asks passengers nationwide the same questions about service quality. This enables the Authority to compare companies against one another. As with the existing Customer Satisfaction Surveys, benchmarks for the NPS will be set in new franchise agreements.</p>

Engaging members of the local community to take decisions on solving local problems is a central aspect of neighbourhood renewal. This involves ensuring that groups which are often hard to reach are involved in and benefit from neighbourhood renewal activity. The neighbourhood renewal unit has developed a race strategy to ensure that this is the case in relation to black and minority ethnic communities. This strategy will be used as a pathfinder for other groups, including older people.

	<p pid=".21W.5/1">In July I announced a package of measures to streamline the handling in the planning system of major infrastructure projects, such as new airports, runways, rail links and roads. The objective was to speed up the decision-making process so as to cut the delay, cost and uncertainty of the present process, while making sure that people continue to be properly involved and have the opportunity to make their views known.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/2">The package comprised:</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/3" class="indent">up-to-date statements of Government policy before major infrastructure projects are considered in the planning system to help reduce inquiry time spent on debating the policy;</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/4" class="indent">an improved regional framework which will assist consideration of individual projects (e.g. through the revised arrangements for Regional Planning Guidance);</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/5" class="indent">new procedures to give Parliament the opportunity to approve projects in principle before consideration of the details at inquiry;</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/6" class="indent">improved inquiry procedures for major infrastructure projects;</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/7" class="indent">improved arrangements for compulsory purchase and compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/8">We are today publishing a consultation paper setting out our detailed proposals for new parliamentary procedures. Copies are being laid before both Houses. The deadline for comment is <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-22">22 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/9">It is right that Parliament should have the opportunity to consider infrastructure projects of major importance to the country and to the economy. Parliament's involvement will add weight and accountability to the process without reducing the opportunities for people to have their say. Parliament's endorsement of the principle of, need for and location of a project will speed up the decision-making process by removing the necessity for the subsequent planning inquiry to look at these issues. We propose to underpin this with new powers for Planning Inspectors to focus discussion at the inquiry, which will just look at the details of implementing the project on the ground. The final decision on a project will rest with the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/10">Our proposals give people a clear opportunity to make their views known before Parliament debates the issues. They provide a mechanism for people to make objections or other representations about a proposed project. Parliament would have copies of all of them and a summary. In addition, the parliamentary stage would be preceded by development of a statement of Government policy, on the content of which there would normally be prior public consultation, and people can express their views at a subsequent inquiry on the detailed aspects of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/11">These opportunities for people to be involved at three key stages of the process would be over and above the consultations between developers and local people on proposed projects before an application for planning consent is submitted. We want local people to be involved as early as possible in shaping proposals affecting them and the areas in which they live.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/12">Introducing the new procedures would require primary legislation. This will be brought forward when parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.5/1">The Government looked at the pressures facing local government when setting the spending plans for 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 in the Spending Review 2000. Those spending plans provide for good increases in grant to local authorities overall. Our proposals for the funding of local authority revenue expenditure next year provide real terms increases for education, social services and environmental, protective and cultural services. The proposals include the &pound;300 million over the SR2000 plans which the Government have provided for this year and the next to assist councils in building care capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.5/2">In allocating the overall level of funding between authorities, the SSA formulae recognise that pressures on social services are higher for some authorities than for others. For example, they take account of the size of the elderly population in each authority and other factors such as deprivation. General grant to West Sussex in 2002&ndash;03 under our proposals is &pound;343 million which is an increase of &pound;22.5 million or 7 per cent. on a like for like comparison. This is above the average for comparable authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.5/3">The Government have also provided &pound;26 million in emergency financial assistance through the Bellwin scheme to councils affected by flood damage as a result of last year's heavy rains. West Sussex county council received &pound;6 million. Revenue expenditure by West Sussex on flood defence not covered through the Bellwin scheme is taken account of in the calculation of West Sussex's flood defence SSA.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.5/4">In addition, recognising the severity of last year's floods, the Environment Agency in Sussex has benefited from &pound;1.1 million for emergency response and repair costs and &pound;0.2 million for design and feasibility costs of river strategies. It will also receive a grant for the capital programme of &pound;9.6 million in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

It is therefore working up proposals in partnership with local government for reformed grant allocation formulae to be introduced in 2003&ndash;04. One of the options, which is being considered as part of this review, is the inclusion of a sparsity indicator in the fire funding formula.

	<p pid=".25W.2/1">We have recently published the Local Government White Paper &quot;Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot; setting out our vision for a stronger local government and improved public services. E-government is essential to that vision and many councils are seizing this opportunity to transform the way they deliver services and engage their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.2/2">To this end the Government have committed &pound;350 million over three years to support putting local government online. So far, &pound;25 million has been allocated to 24 pathfinder projects (with a further pathfinder being funded under the Invest to Save Budget) to develop new approaches which can be shared with the wider government community.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.2/3">We expect all councils to rise to this challenge, and deliver e-enabled services by 2005. To help them achieve this the Government intend, subject to the agreement of Parliament, to provide a capital grant of &pound;200,000 each to 398 local authorities in 2002&ndash;03 to support proposals contained in their Implementing Electronic Government (IEG). Subject to demonstrating that they have made good progress, and have used the first tranche of money to good effect, we also intend them to receive a further &pound;200,000 each in 2003&ndash;04. We will accordingly lay a Special Grant report before the House setting out this intention, in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.2/4">We have also made provision for financial support to facilitate partnerships both between local authorities, and between local authorities and other public bodies, as well as for further national projects available for use by all local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.2/5">We shall be writing to leading potential partnerships between councils and with other public services seeking further evidence of how their partnership will contribute to delivering joined up, e-enabled services.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.2/6">We have struck a balance between resources for individual councils to help them meet local priorities, support for partnerships, pathfinders and other national projects which provide the essential building blocks for every council to use.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.2/7">The draft national local government Online strategy to be published early in the new year will set out how we will continue to support pathfinders, and seek views on new national products which can help all councils move quickly and cost effectively toward the standards of e-enabled service offered by the best. We will announce detailed plans for the remainder of the funding in the new year alongside the publication of this strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.3/1">The Government recognise the importance of combating counterfeiting and piracy for all the creative industries, and are working with the industries concerned towards achieving this objective. My Department does not collect independent figures for the financial impact piracy has on these industries and the Exchequer. Figures from a survey carried out by the Alliance Against Counterfeiting and Piracy indicate, however, that the cost of counterfeiting and piracy to UK industry as a whole was almost &pound;9 billion in 2000, an increase of 8.36 per cent. on the figure for 1999. This is estimated to be equivalent to approximately &pound;1.55 billion in lost revenue to the Exchequer. Within this total, it is estimated that the loss to the music industry in 2000 was &pound;20 million and to cinema and home entertainment &pound;180 million. There are no separate sectoral figures for the arts and television industries.</p>

However, the Court was not prescriptive about the mechanisms the Government should put in place in order to comply with their obligations under Article 2.

	<p pid=".39W.8/3">I should point out that some areas that caused the Court concern have already been addressed, notably through the establishment of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. The Government have also indicated the strong likelihood that they will remove Rule 9(2) of the Coroners Rules (Northern Ireland) 1963, dealing with compellability, and the Belfast Coroner was so advised on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-14">14 September</phrase>.</p>

Our final decision with respect to the changes that we intend to make to comply with Article 2 will therefore be a matter of public knowledge very shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.11/1">In the year following publication of the KPMG review of financial regulation in the Caribbean Overseas Territories and Bermuda in October 2000, the Overseas Territories have made good progress in strengthening their financial regulatory frameworks in line with international standards and good practice, particularly in the priority areas of money laundering, regulatory co-operation and the establishment of independent regulatory authorities. All the Overseas Territories reviewed now have comprehensive anti-money laundering frameworks fully in place. The HM Treasury/FCO press release of <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-03">3 December</phrase>, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House, provides further details of the progress that has been made in other areas and where further work is required.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.11/2">The Overseas Territories have agreed to publish further progress reports in February 2002 to explain how implementation of the KPMG recommendations are progressing. The UK will continue to work closely with the Overseas Territories to enable them to meet international standards in full.</p>

These are also important for our ambitions for international trade and development and for an enlarged EU. The Government's objective is to secure changes that benefit consumers, taxpayers, the rural economy, the farming community and the environment. There is increasing recognition within the European Union of the need for reform.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.5/4">There has been progress. In the 1980s spending on the CAP was over 60 per cent. of the European Community budget. In 2001 it will be around 45 per cent. As a result of the Agenda 2000 package agreed at the 1999 Berlin European Council, spending on the CAP will decline in real terms from 2002. Mid-term reviews of certain CAP regimes are scheduled for 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.3/1">The fight against drugs and crime requires political commitment and practical co-operation. In 2001, nine more ratifications of the three UN drugs conventions have been recorded, including from Turkey, Albania and Ukraine. The FCO's Drugs and Crime Fund (&pound;7.3 million in 2001&ndash;02), supports bi- and multilateral project work to combat drug production and trafficking, organised crime, paedophilia, child pornography and money-laundering in more than 40 countries committed to working with the UK and others on these issues. FCO-funded training for overseas law enforcement agencies and operational co-operation with them has led to some notable drug seizures, removing some of the heroin and cocaine consignments destined for the UK and Europe. The UK was a leading player in the negotiation of the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, which already has more than 120 signatory states, and will provide a new framework for international co-operation to fight serious organised crime world-wide. The UK is currently negotiating law enforcement memoranda of understanding with 14 countries as the basis for further practical co-operation with them.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.3/2">On the environment, FCO engagement helped secure successful outcomes at international climate change conferences this year in Bonn and Marrakech; in particular, by maintaining the commitment of key countries to the Kyoto Protocol following its rejection by the US. The FCO's contribution to the UK's work in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has been instrumental in maintaining the international commercial moratorium on whaling which came under heavy pressure but emerged intact from the IWC meeting in July 2001. FCO environmental project funds have helped leverage co-operation with other countries (and with UK's Overseas Territories) to directly address restoration of degraded habitats and the control or removal of invasive species of animals and plants.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.3/3">As a result of our achieving our targets on human rights, a number of people who would otherwise have faced the death penalty no longer do so; there is a stronger world-wide coalition against torture and improved mechanisms for exposing it and, more generally, growing recognition of the importance of human rights. Of course, there is still a great deal to be done&mdash;including on child rights, where we have not been so successful in meeting our target (on reducing extreme forms of child labour). The Government remain committed to promoting human rights at the heart of foreign policy and to backing up action in international forums with practical support from our Human Rights Project Fund.</p>

Typically the comparators are other western diplomatic missions, international agencies and major private companies. Our missions pay what is required to recruit, retain and motivate suitable staff. Normally we expect to be in the middle range of rates of pay: neither leading the market nor poor payers. We also meet the requirements of local employment law.

	<p pid=".58W.2/1">The Department of Education and Skills believes everyone should be allowed to balance their work and home commitments and that home working should be available to all staff, not just those with caring responsibilities. We encourage a culture of trust where people feel comfortable working from home and do not feel tied to working a fixed 9&ndash;5 pattern and try to discourage long hours working among staff. Staff can work at home on a full-time basis or for part of the week on a regular or occasional basis. Business needs remain at the top of our agenda. However, managers are encouraged to be sympathetic to all requests and grant them whenever possible.</p>

	<p pid=".66W.3/1">Arrangements for training in the landscape contracting sector are a matter for the employers in that sector, as in any other. A network of national training organisations (NTOs), set up by employers and formally recognised by the Government, provides strategic leadership and practical guidance about the learning, skills and qualification needs for a defined sector.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/2">The Construction Industry Training Board is the NTO for the building and civil engineering sector, which includes &quot;hard&quot; landscaping, that is laying driveways; constructing walls; constructing or repairing swimming pools, playing fields and grounds for sporting or recreational purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/3">Lantra is the NTO for land-based industries, including &quot;soft&quot; landscaping, that is horticultural activities such as the landscaping of gardens and parks.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/4">The Government recently announced plans to build a stronger sector network that will engage employers more fully in the planning and delivery of learning and skills. Sector skills councils will be set up which build on the achievements secured by NTOs.</p>

We are taking a fresh and objective look at what provision is needed, and at the additional costs some authorities undoubtedly face. We want a system that is both fair and clear. The element of the proposals set out in the Green Paper most relevant to Worcestershire's position is that LEAs should receive a basic entitlement per primary or secondary school pupil, with enhancements only for authorities where significant deprivation adds to costs, or schools need to pay more to recruit and retain staff. This would mean that a number of LEAs would get the same funding per pupil, rather than those like Worcestershire getting less than almost all others.</p>

An initial draft of the report was received within the Department for Education and Skills at the beginning of July. Ofsted's report confirms that four out of five of the schools surveyed are achieving the aims of the specialist schools programme and are making good use of the advantages it brings. The report's first main finding states that: &quot;For these schools specialist status has often been a catalyst for innovation and helped to sustain or accelerate the momentum of school improvement.&quot; Technology, language and arts colleges are improving attainment at a faster rate than is the case nationally and in GCSE examinations in 2000 the combined average points score for each pupil for specialist subjects was higher in all four categories of specialist school than the average for all other maintained secondary schools. Ofsted also found that, with few exceptions, the community dimension was the weakest part of the school's work. However, sports colleges had responded well to this challenge and the report found that about half of the technology and language colleges visited had developed good examples of community support. We expect all specialist schools to benefit from the findings in the Ofsted report.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.6/2">With regard to the potential cost of the proposed new scheme, it is Government policy that improvements in public service pensions should generally be paid for either by savings elsewhere in the scheme, or by scheme members through contributions. In addition, the review took account of the fact that the current Armed Forces Pension Scheme is one of the most expensive in the public sector. In the proposals issued for public consultation in March of this year, we sought to re-balance the benefits to reflect the needs of the modern armed forces, with regard both to those who can expect to serve a full career and those who we require to leave earlier. These proposals were cost neutral. We will, of course, consider carefully the views submitted in response to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.2/1">Over the last two years, the Ministry of Defence has objected to 26 proposals to site wind farms within the tactical training areas (TTA). The details of these are withheld for reasons of commercial confidentiality in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The objections relate to the physical obstruction that would be caused by the wind farms within areas where fixed wing aircraft are engaged in operational low flying (OLF) training down to 100 ft minimum separation distance (MSD). Outside the TTA low flying fixed wing aircraft are not permitted to fly below 250 feet MSD. In order to preserve the tactical freedom to practise OLF it is important that the number of tall obstacles, such as wind turbines, is minimised within those areas. For this reason an objection is often, but not always, raised to proposals to locate turbines in any of the TTA.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.12/1">The Ministry of Defence has conducted a Comprehensive Review of Aircrew Retention this summer. We sought to identify why we have a shortfall in this highly trained group of personnel and how that shortfall might best be addressed. A study team including representatives from the three Services, HM Treasury and external consultancy have reviewed aircrew requirements and have looked at employment patterns, career structures, training systems and remuneration as well as the recruitment and financial policies of the commercial sector.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.12/2">The Working Group collated the views of over 1,000 aircrew (probably the largest such survey the armed forces has undertaken) as well as those of managers. They examined and identified why people leave service life, as well as the attraction of the commercial sector.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.12/3">The main cause of the shortage of aircrew was a failure of the training system to deliver against challenging targets. That has already been addressed, but it will take time to deliver. We intend, therefore, further to improve the retention of our current aircrew.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.12/4">The Working Group identified a series of issues impacting on retention. Many of the quality of life issues emerging from the Review of Aircrew Retention were already being tackled. For example, the very significant programmes introduced to spend an additional &pound;1 billion over the next 10 years on modernising single living accommodation and to spend &pound;650 million by November 2005 on upgrading married quarters. We recognise that accommodation problems spread beyond housing and action is needed to address sub-standard working and technical accommodation as well. Senior service officers have also set in hand work to address a number of key concerns raised by aircrew&mdash;for example on operational tempo, career management, frequency of moves, and more. The impact of resolving these concerns will also be of benefit to personnel beyond the aircrew community. Some of the issues raised by aircrew are misperceptions, and to address this better communication is being developed across the services.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.12/5">There are some remuneration aspects arising from the review and, as is usual, we have made proposals to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The outcome will be reported to the House in due course&mdash;probably early February.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.12/6">We are monitoring closely developments in the commercial sector. But, even if the pull to the private sector decreases as a result of a contraction in the civil sector, we still have a responsibility to deal with the natural factors which cause personnel to leave, and which are preventing us reaching aircrew manning balance.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.2/2">Information on re-offending rates for discharged prisoners is not collected. However information on two-year reconviction rates is collected and published annually in Prison Statistics England and Wales. The latest reconviction rates cover prisoners discharged during 1997 and the first quarter of 1998 and are contained in chapter 9 of Prison Statistics England and Wales 2000 (Cm. 5250) a copy of which is available in the Library. Prisoners who have served sentences of two years or more will often have spent time in a number of prisons. It is therefore difficult to attribute reconviction rates to the impact of a particular prison.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/3">Two offending behaviour programmes within prisons have been evaluated using offenders' reconvictions following discharge. The following tables show the percentage of offenders (both treated and similar untreated offenders) who have been reconvicted of an offence within two years of discharge by risk category. Comparison group offenders were matched to those who had participated in treatment on factors which are known to increase the likelihood of reconviction eg age at discharge, number of previous offences etc. This is to ensure, as far as possible, that the evaluation was comparing like with like offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/4">Table 1 refers to offenders who participated in two pre-accredited cognitive skills programmes (Thinking Skills and Reasoning and Rehabilitation). These offenders were treated between 1994 and 1996 and had been sentenced to two years or more. Table 2 refers to offenders who completed the pre-accredited Sex Offender Treatment Programme between 1992 and 1996 and had been sentenced to four years or more.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/5">Overall, the results illustrate that offenders who have participated in offending behaviour programmes have consistently lower reconviction rates, two years after discharge, than similar untreated offenders.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.11/1">The information requested is not routinely collected by police forces or held centrally. Youth disturbance may vary from nuisance behaviour through to more serious disorder and criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.11/2">Tackling the problems associated with underage drinking is a key objective of the Home Office action plan on alcohol-related crime, disorder and nuisance. The most recent Youth Lifestyles Survey, published in October 2000, showed that 15 per cent. of young people aged 12 to 17 admitted to committing some form of antisocial behaviour during or after drinking&mdash;most often getting into a heated argument. Frequent drinkers were also more likely to have behaved antisocially.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.11/3">We have strengthened the law, from <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December</phrase>, to go further in tackling the sale of alcohol to underage drinkers. Section 30 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 now places a positive duty on staff in licensed premises to check the age of young customers before selling alcohol, and section 31 provides a power for the police and local authorities to enforce the law by using under-18s to make test purchases. We expect these important new measures to assist in our determination to tackle under-age drinking as part of our wider programme to reduce youth crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.3/2">The Scotland Office appointed Steer Davies Gleave to undertake a transport and economic appraisal of the Campbeltown-Ballycastle ferry in consultation with the Scottish and Northern Irish Executives and after a competitive tendering process. The fee paid to the consultants was &pound;18,600. In the course of their work on this study, I understand that the consultants questioned a number of companies within the local areas of Kintyre and Moyle and beyond to assist them in evaluating the likely usage and benefits from a new ferry service.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.2/1">Annually managed expenditure (AME) for the Export Credits Guarantee Department has risen due to the extra cost needed to unwind interest rate swaps. These swaps were used to hedge interest make up (IMU) costs on fixed rate export finance loans and commitments being guaranteed by ECGD. These loans are now being refinanced using direct funding from HM Treasury, as this produces greater value for money in terms of cost and hedging uncertainty. AME estimates have risen as the cost of unwinding swaps in the financial markets has increased since the AME forecast figures were last published at the time of the Budget 2001.</p>

The main mechanism through which this development will be supported is the Renewables Obligation and the associated Renewables Obligation Scotland. This will oblige all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. The Obligation will create a long-term market incentive for renewables which taken with the exemption of renewables electricity from the climate change levy (CCL) and continuing support for NFFO projects, is expected to be worth over &pound;1 billion by 2010.</p>

Where a gas facility is dual fired, power stations usually hold stocks of their alternative fuel&mdash;predominantly coal or oil products. Some gas is stored, but this tends to be at the extremities of the transmission system in facilities such as salt cavities' offshore fields or as liquefied natural gas.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.5/2">Some liquefied natural gas is held by Transco to cope with system emergencies. The remainder is used to help maintain the overall balance within the gas transmission system between supply and demand for gas. The stored gas tends to be used during periods of peak demand (e.g. winter months) and to meet shortfalls of gas supplies at other times during the year. Combined cycle gas stations compete for any gas coming from storage along with other gas users.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.0/1">The Deputy UK Permanent Representative to the European Union, Bill Stow, attended the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-06">6 December</phrase> on my behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/2">The Presidency reported to the Council on the state of play of negotiations with the European Parliament on the proposed new regulatory framework for electronic communications. The most contentious issues on which agreement is still outstanding are:</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/3" class="indent">whether and the extent to which the Commission should be able to override proposed decisions of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) in order to protect the integrity of the single market;</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/4" class="indent">the grounds on which undertakings should be able to appeal NRA decisions at the national level; and</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/5" class="indent">whether a digital television standard should be mandated.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/6">The March 2000 Lisbon European Council set a target of the end of 2001 to agree this legislative package. Informal discussions between the Presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament will continue during December with a view to finding an agreement as soon as possible and so avoid the need for conciliation under the forthcoming Spanish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/7">The Council reached political agreement on the proposed Communications Data Protection Directive by qualified majority; the UK voted in favour. In particular, the Council agreed on:</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/8" class="indent">a harmonised &quot;opt-in&quot; solution for unsolicited commercial e-mail, with an exception where there is an existing customer relationship;</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/9" class="indent">the introduction of an obligation to provide users with clear and comprehensive advance information about the purposes of cookies and similar devices and to offer them the possibility to refuse; and</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/10" class="indent">a clarification of the scope for member states to legislate on data retention for law-enforcement purposes as long as this is in accordance with the agreed principles of Community Law. This was inserted in the body of the Directive itself at the request of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/11">The Council adopted a Resolution on &quot;a common approach and specific actions in the area of network and information security&quot;, and the Commission will now bring forward proposals for setting-up a cyber-security task force to assist member states in developing the capabilities to address network security problems.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/12">The Commission presented a Communication on the exploitation of public sector information which aims to remove many of the barriers that content companies currently face in trying to develop the next generation of cross-border information services and products based on public sector information. The Commission may now propose a Directive to cover the commercial exploitation of public sector information. The Commission also gave a presentation on the seventh implementation report on telecoms regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".112W.9/2">The aim of the Manufacturing Summit was to bring together national Government, devolved Administrations, regional development agencies and industry and trade union leaders to reach a shared view on the challenges facing UK manufacturing industry. The summit built on the joint work of the CBI and TUC on productivity, which was recently presented to the Chancellor and myself.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.9/3">Acting on a recommendation from the CBI and TUC, I announced at the summit an additional &pound;20 million of funding over two years to expand the Industry Forum and the Partnership Fund. This funding will help more firms to work to spread best practice within the supply chain through the extension of Industry Forum principles to additional sectors. The expansion of the Partnership Fund will help employee and employer representatives to work together to achieve better performance in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.9/4">As a result of the summit, RDAs will work closely with manufacturers, unions and other local partners to implement regional industrial policies in accordance with their regional economic strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.9/5">At the meeting, industry representatives recognised the need to boost training and skills in order to achieve the productivity improvements that are necessary. We agreed to work more closely to share ideas and best practice on the promotion of innovation and skills that are key to the future success of our manufacturing industry. We will also ensure that Government agencies are working together more effectively to help people who are made redundant to get new skills and jobs as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".114W.2/2">The Phoenix Fund, operated by the Small Business Service, is the only competitive grant scheme that my Department runs specifically to help tackle social exclusion. It is designed to encourage enterprise by promoting the provision of business support for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged neighbourhoods or groups of people. Community and voluntary groups can apply for the bidding rounds. There are no application forms. Bidding guidance is published and copies are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".114W.2/3">There have been four rounds of bidding (Development Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Community Development Finance Initiatives Rounds 1 and 2). A list of successful applicants and a summary of their individual projects is available on the SBS website <a href="http://www.sbs.gov.uk">www.sbs.gov.uk</a>. Awards totalling &pound;15 million were offered to 50 applicants, from a total of 253, in December 2000 (Development Fund Round 1). In January 2001 &pound;6 million was offered to 16 applicants, from a total of 58 (CDFI Round 1). A further &pound;15 million was awarded to 46 organisations (from a total of 358) in September 2001 (Development Fund Round 2). Up to &pound;15 million will be offered from the current round being appraised (CDFI Round 2), which has received 50 applications. The projects to be supported will be announced in February 2002. Details of individual awards are not published. Although the Phoenix Fund is project based, it is possible for some core costs to be supported.</p>
	<p pid=".114W.2/4">It is not possible to give a total for the administrative costs to the State, as the staff involved also undertake other duties. However, these costs are small in relation to the total grants awarded. The cost of the application will depend on the complexity of their bids, but again, these are small in relation to the average grant offered.</p>

On the back of record growth in the register in 2000&ndash;01, the target was bettered by 100 per cent. in that year. It is not possible to anticipate results for 2001&ndash;02 as calculation requires end-year figures.

	<p pid=".119W.14/1">Good progress is being made on universal banking services in advance of the migration of benefit payments to ACT in 2003. Through universal banking services there will be post office access to a range of bank accounts. This will enable all those who wish to do so to continue to be able to collect their benefits in cash at post offices. The Government are currently negotiating with the Post Office for the provision of the Post Office Card Account and is developing a detailed migration and marketing strategy for the transition to ACT.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.14/2">The emphasis of the ACT migration and marketing strategy will be to ensure that each customer has the best account for his or her circumstances. Conventional and basic bank accounts offer more services and do not have the limitations of the Post Office Card Account so are likely to be the best option for the vast majority of people.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.14/3">Our operational assumption is that around three million benefit and tax credit recipients will open a POCA, but there will not be a cap on numbers or eligibility criteria for a POCA. For most people the best account will be a conventional bank account or a basic bank account, whether new or existing. The vast majority of claimants already have an existing bank account and we expect that they will choose to use them when they start to be paid by ACT.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.14/4">If claimants do not have a bank account, staff of the Government Departments concerned will discuss options with them to help them take the best choice for their circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.11/1">The official guidance on voluntary equal pay reviews is that published by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) as a statutory code of practice on equal pay in 1997. The Government have recently provided the EOC with an extra &pound;100,000 to produce a model for voluntary pay reviews. It will offer a technical example for employers in how to review the pay of their male and female employees and will soon be piloted so that it is shown to be workable for business and effective for women.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.11/2">The Employers' Association for Local Government has produced equality guidance which includes advice on pay reviews. The Chartered Institute of Personnel Development has also produced an &quot;Equal Pay Guide&quot; for its members who are generally personnel managers.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.11/3">The Government have recently announced the annual Castle Awards for employers to encourage them to undertake and act on voluntary pay reviews. They will recognise employers' excellence in addressing equal pay and related issues. Earlier this year the Government appointed 'Fair Pay Champions' from business, the public sector and trade unions to help with our drive towards achieving fair pay for women through promoting and sharing good practice and heightening awareness of employment rights and responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.9/1">The UK Fuel Poverty Strategy sets a target date of 2010 for assisting all vulnerable fuel poor households, as well as all other fuel poor households living in social sector housing. Together these two groups represent some 90 per cent. of all the fuel poor households in England in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.9/2">The Strategy therefore meets the terms of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 for England in ensuring that as far as reasonably practicable, persons do not live in fuel poverty. We intend to work with interested groups to develop practical, cost-effective mechanisms for assisting the remaining group of fuel poor: the healthy adult households living in private sector housing.</p>

The review was undertaken because of public concerns about the potential toxicity of these chemicals and in the absence of any supporting safety data from the approval holder, products containing carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos will not be available to users from the end of 2001. The economic impact on a particular sector of the industry would not form part of an assessment where the overriding priority is to protect those who work in the industry and consumers of the treated crop. However, my officials are aware of the difficulties the withdrawal of these products from the market may cause and will of course give any assistance they can to exploring other sources of control.</p>

	<p pid=".129W.5/2">The wording of the current draft points to targets for the re-use of whole appliances being set in the future. Although these have yet to be set, an objective of this draft is to minimise the amount of electrical equipment becoming waste and so the proposal ensures that priority would be given to the re-use of whole appliances. There is a requirement for appliances to be collected and transported carefully to ensure that any re-usable equipment does not get damaged in transit. There is also a requirement for consumers to be informed of return systems, which could include information on offering equipment for re-use.</p>
	<p pid=".129W.5/3">The draft Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive defines re-use as any operation by which waste electrical and electronic equipment or components thereof are used for the same purpose for which they were conceived, including the continued use of the equipment or components thereof which are returned to collection points, distributors, recyclers or manufacturers.</p>

It is anticipated that by March 2003 the core Department will have realised the level of savings identified.</p>

	<p pid=".135W.0/2">DEFRA publicises its policy on flexible working and encourages managers to respond positively to requests as part of their commitment to the diversity agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.0/3">Information on the number of staff undertaking home working on a regular basis is not kept centrally and a complete list of those using working from home arrangements could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, IT dial-in facilities which enable staff to work remotely are widely used, with around 1,400 having access to this facility. A regular element of home working is normal practice for certain groups of staff. It is estimated that around 10 per cent. of staff make use of informal arrangements to work from home occasionally.</p>

The objective was for companies to reach their economic level of leakage by 2002&ndash;03 and all companies, with the exception of Thames Water, are on target to reach that level. To date, this amounts to a reduction in leakage of about 30 per cent. Thames Water has been required to take the necessary corrective action by 2003&ndash;04. Details of the action required of Thames and other companies' performance are contained in the Ofwat report 'Leakage and the efficient use of water 2000&ndash;01', a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>

The Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001 provides for rate relief on buildings and land used for all non-agricultural enterprises on what had previously been agricultural premises. An amendment to guidance in Planning Police Guidance note 7 (PPG7), &quot;The Countryside&mdash;Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development&quot;, on farm diversification makes clear the importance that the Government attach to diversification. It encourages local planning authorities to support well-conceived schemes that are consistent in their scale with their rural location.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.8/3">Overall the percentage drop from February to October 2001 was: for SVS and LVIs 81 per cent.; for TVIs 87 per cent. and for administrators 53 per cent.

This reflects the fact that the area covered by these staff was more heavily and more persistently affected by FMD and that FMD-free status was only gained by mid-October.</p>

Prior to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak, the ISG advised in its second report that firm scientific data were likely to be available to inform policy by 2004. The group has indicated that the FMD emergency might delay this timetable by a calendar year.</p>

	<p pid=".139W.2/2">In 1999, one three-year and three five-year research projects for finding a vaccine for TB in cattle were commissioned by MAFF at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and at the Institute of Animal Health. &pound;1.2 million funding is being provided by DEFRA in this area each year up to 2004. The key objectives of the research are to produce live candidate vaccines, to develop a test to differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals and to evaluate the vaccine candidates in the host species. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) is undertaking a detailed study of vaccine development and their potential use. In its third report the ISG advised that vaccines in either cattle or badgers remains a potential policy option although likely to offer prospects only in a long-term context. Nevertheless, research into vaccines remains an important element in the strategy to control TB in cattle and will receive funding accordingly.</p>

The outturn figures for 2001&ndash;02, when they become available, will almost certainly show a more marked reduction because of the diversion of resource to deal with FMD and the length and severity of the outbreak in this financial year.</p>

I hope that it will not be long before the country can, with reasonable confidence, be regarded as free of disease. We still need to maintain precautions against the recurrence of the disease. This will need to be recognised in an interim animal movement regime which, assuming all continues to go well, we hope to introduce in mid-February.

	<p pid=".143W.2/1">My letter of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September</phrase> provided the following information:</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-09">9 July</phrase> you tabled a parliamentary question in which you asked what assessment has been made of the damage to the agriculture and tourism sectors of the current foot and mouth outbreak. I am sorry I was unable to reply before the House rose for summer recess, but had I had done so, I would have said that the Department does not have statistics on job losses in the agriculture sector resulting from foot and mouth. We are, however, developing proposals for a survey to collect information relating to the impact of foot and mouth disease on farmers directly or indirectly affected by the outbreak, including details relating to employment.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/3" class="indent">As regards tourism, our best estimate is that overall UK tourism revenues may fall by over &pound;3 billion over the eight month tourism season (March-October). However, figures from the International Passenger Survey, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show that overseas visitors to the UK increased by 1 per cent. to 2.3 million in June 2001 compared with June 2000, up from April and May, when visits fell by 7 per cent. and 11 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/4" class="indent">The latest figures are quite encouraging and suggest that some of the work Ministers and British Tourism Authority have been doing in overseas markets is starting to have an effect.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/5" class="indent">A copy of this letter was placed in the Library of the House.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/6">Our best estimate continues to be that overall UK tourism, in terms of gross value added, may fall by over &pound;3 billion over the eight-month tourism season (March-October). More recent International Passenger Survey statistics, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show that on average over the seven months between March and September the number of overseas visitors was down by 7 per cent. compared to the same period in 2000. The number of overseas visitors was also down on average 7 per cent. in the first nine months of the year, including those months prior to the outbreak of FMD. There was also an 11 per cent. fall in spending by overseas visitors over the same period.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/7">The survey of farmers mentioned in my letter has now been completed by ADAS. Officials are now considering the results and these will be made available early in the new year.</p>

Additionally, a negative test result does not necessarily mean that the premises was free from disease. For instance, if the disease is old the virus may not be present in the sample collected, and blood tests from newly infected animals may not give a positive reaction to the laboratory test as antibodies may not yet be present.</p>

	<p pid=".144W.3/2">There are three principal lines of scientific evidence which demonstrate that suitable foot and mouth disease (FMD) vaccines, properly applied, can minimise or prevent the spread of the disease. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".144W.3/3" class="indent">the results of routine, laboratory-based, vaccine potency tests which are required of licensed vaccine manufacturers in compliance with pharmacopoeial criteria;</p>
	<p pid=".144W.3/4" class="indent">the testing of the duration of immunity engendered by FMD vaccines, by means of similar tests. These tests have shown immunity following a primary course of vaccination with conventional FMD vaccine typically lasts for four to six months; and</p>
	<p pid=".144W.3/5" class="indent">the results of vaccination campaigns which have been associated with the successful control of FMD, as has been apparent in a number of countries.</p>
	<p pid=".144W.3/6">It is essential that any vaccination campaign is both effectively and efficiently managed in order for it to work and there are many aspects to this, including, the correct strain of vaccine and enough of it, targeting the correct population of animals in the right location and that there are enough trained vaccinators.</p>
	<p pid=".144W.3/7">Throughout the outbreak, the Government have kept vaccination actively under review. Vaccination would be used if scientific advice were clear that it was the most appropriate measure to shorten the outbreak. But vaccination on its own could never have eradicated FMD entirely.</p>

	<p pid=".145W.3/1">The disease control policies employed by the Government to eradicate foot and mouth disease are being guided by advice received by the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser. The requirements to slaughter animals which are infected or suspected of being infected with FMD is also a key part of the rules established by the European Union on the control of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.3/2">The use of vaccination in certain circumstances would be considered if scientific advice were clear that it was the most appropriate measure to shorten the outbreak. However, vaccination does not provide complete protection against FMD and could never be used solely to eradicate FMD entirely. The Government recognised early in this year's outbreak that future EU and international policies for handling FMD would need to be reassessed, including the role of vaccination. The UK, with the Dutch, took the initiative to organise an International Conference on Prevention and Control of Foot and Mouth Disease on 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2001-12-13">13 December</phrase> in Brussels.</p>

	<p pid=".145W.6/2">Although experimental studies demonstrated a degree of susceptibility to FMD in some dogs, there is no direct evidence to show that the species has been involved in the transmission of FMD to susceptible livestock. There is a theoretical risk that dogs could be involved in the mechanical transmission of the virus by carrying infective virus on their paws or coat. There is also a remote possibility that the consumption by a dog of FMD infected material could pass infection on to susceptible livestock, particularly if the dog vomited soon after consuming the infected material. However, provided the dog had a normal digestive process, it is unlikely that any viable virus would survive passage through the stomach and intestines. It is considered most unlikely that this theoretical possibility poses a serious risk of spreading FMD.</p>

	<p pid=".146W.5/1">An accurate and complete list of headline changes in the management and eradication of foot and mouth disease since 1967 would need to pick up a wide range of issues such as changes in legislation, science and technology. This could be produced only at disproportionate cost. However, a comparison of the way in which the current outbreak differs from the 1967 outbreak may be found on the DEFRA website at http:\\<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/about/current/comparisons/1967a.asp">www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/about/current/ comparisons/1967 a.asp</a>. This contains a section on how the 1967 and 2001 outbreaks were tackled.</p>

	<p pid=".151W.0/2">It would make no sense to carry out research into the relationship between interest rates and the level of tariff income deducted. This is because a tariff is deducted from income support on a sliding scale for capital held between the lower and upper capital limits. Capital is treated in this way so that people with capital in excess of the lower limit make a reasonable weekly contribution from those resources to help meet their normal living expenses before having recourse to public funds. It is not intended to represent any return that could be obtained from investing capital and is not based on the current bank interest rate.</p>

	<p pid=".151W.6/2">Departmental Ministers and officials consider many policy questions and issues on a routine and on-going basis and frequently seek the views of people external to the Department on a more or less informal basis. The following taskforces, ad hoc advisory and policy review groups with external members, have been established since January 2000 with formalised terms of reference:</p>
	<p pid=".151W.6/3">Older People&mdash;Media Images Working Group was established in August 2000 and terminated in March 2001 with no report being published.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.6/4">Partnership Against Poverty and the Scottish Partnership Against Poverty were established in March 2001 and November 2001 respectively. The groups are on-going with no planned formal reports or end dates. The Partnership Against Poverty group has formed a Black and Ethnic Minority Elder sub-group.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.6/5">Jobcentre Plus Employers Forum and Jobcentre Plus Stakeholders Forum were both established in May 2001. Both are consultative groups and have been involved in discussions about the development of Jobcentre Plus. The Jobcentre Plus Stakeholders Forum has formed two sub groups, the services sub-group and the training sub-group which are looking at specific issues and will report to the main forum. None of the groups have a time-bound existence, although both the Employer Forum and Stakeholder Forum are under review, and the Stakeholder Forum sub-groups are likely to complete their work by April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.6/6">The National Employment Panel was launched in October 2001 as the successor to the New Deal Task Force. The National Employment Panel is an employer- led body which provides independent advice to Ministers on the design, delivery and performance of the UK Government's labour market services. The panel reports on a regular basis to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The panel has established the following sub-groups: the Performance Committee; the Minority Ethnic Advisory Group; the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Board; and a Skills sub-group which will report to the Under-Secretary of State for Adult Skills, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/949" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth (John Healey)</phrase>. The panel does not have a time-bound existence.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.6/7">The Private Pensions Simplification Review was announced on the <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-26">26 September 2001</phrase> and is expected to report in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.6/8">The Minimum Funding Requirement Consultation Panel was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-18">18 September 2001</phrase>. There are currently no plans for the panel to produce a report. It will continue to meet while legislation for the replacement for the MFR is being developed. The termination date for the panel depends on when a Bill is secured and legislation is in place, so it is not possible to give a precise termination date as this is subject to the parliamentary timetable.</p>

	<p pid=".153W.5/1">As set out in our 1998 Green Paper &quot;Partnership in Pensions&quot; the Government's long-term pension reforms are designed to ensure that all pensioners have a decent income in retirement, building on the foundation of the basic state pension available to all. This means everyone recognising their responsibilities; with those who are able, saving for their retirement, the Government supporting those who cannot save, and the private sector providing affordable and secure second pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.5/2">Before April 2001, many of those who could put money aside to provide for themselves in retirement had no straightforward, good-value way to enter a pension scheme. Stakeholder pensions, which were introduced from that date, offered such people a route through provision of a simple, low-charge, flexible pension scheme which, for many employees, can be accessed through their workplace.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.5/3">Stakeholder pensions are open to everyone and over 490,000 have been sold in their first seven months on the market. They are particularly targeted at moderate and higher earners who do not have access to an occupational pension or to a cost-effective personal pension. Many of the target group work for employers without a comprehensive occupational or personal pension scheme for their staff before the introduction of stakeholder pensions. The requirement for such employers to provide their work force with access to a stakeholder pension scheme came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-08">8 October</phrase>. It is too early to have sufficient information on which to base a reasoned assessment of take-up by the target group.</p>

These proposals reflected the fact that the safety of staff has been our number one concern in developing the Jobcentre Plus offices. Security measures are stronger than ever, underpinned by comprehensive risk assessments which were developed in conjunction with PCS. In November, following further discussions, the PCS were asked, if they were still unable to accept the previous proposals, to put forward their own tangible and detailed proposals on which the dispute could be settled.

	<p pid=".157W.6/1">We are firmly committed to tackling the high levels of economic inactivity among people over 50 in all areas of the country. The employment rate of older workers is up for the fourth year running, by 1.3 percentage points on last year's figures. In 2001&ndash;02 our range of nationally available new deals, including new deal 50 plus, new deal 25 plus and now new deal for disabled people, is expected to help some 50,000 over-50s into employment. In areas of particularly high unemployment people of all ages may be able to benefit from the additional support available through action teams for jobs and employment zones.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.6/2">Older people can offer a wealth of talent and expertise to employers. Additional incentives for employers include the new deal 25 plus employer subsidy, and the new deal 50 plus in-work training grant, which can both be paid to the employer.</p>

Membership of the group includes representatives of the independent care home sector.

In recognising difficulties experienced by staff, an NHS housing co-ordinator has been appointed and the NHS plan set a target to provide an additional 2,000 extra units of accommodation in London within three years. In addition suitable accommodation is being sourced outside of London in appropriate locations.</p>

However, we are very well aware of the consequences, including a range of long-term effects for a proportion of those directly involved. Following the tragic events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September</phrase>, Government Departments worked together to ensure support would be available.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.11/2">A dedicated helpline was set up; support for family liaison officers was provided; and the Department issued a leaflet to all general practitioners on the management of acute stress disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. We have embarked on a radical programme of modernisation to improve access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation, raise standards, and provide quicker and more convenient services across the spectrum of mental health services. The National Service Framework for Mental Health, published in September 1999, sets out general standards for treatment and care. In addition, the Allen Report 1989 and 'Planning for Major Incidents: the NHS guidance' 1998 were issued to help those involved in the provision of support for people with post traumatic stress disorder to identify psycho-social support, and disseminate messages about good practice.</p>

Organisations undertaking research into xenotransplantation in the UK are required to comply with all relevant legislation. No clinical trials involving humans have yet been approved in the UK.

	<p pid=".166W.3/1">The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children investigation into allegations of abuse at Betts Way Residential Centre was conducted with the full co-operation of Bromley Social Services Department, the Ravensbourne National Health Service Trust and local police. A copy of the NSPCC's summary report has been made available to departmental officials. In the context of the terms of reference established for this investigation the NSPCC concluded that no young person at the centre could be identified as having suffered significant harm or abuse. The report also found no evidence that there had been, or was, widespread poor practice or that there was a culture of institutionalised risk for services users at Betts Way.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.3/2">However, the report did recommend a review of policy and practice. Bromley Social Services Department and the other relevant agencies are taking this forward together. The London borough of Bromley has also recently commissioned an independent review of the investigation process to identify what further lessons can be learned from the Betts Way case about conducting investigations of this nature with service users whose needs are complex. Officials from the Department have asked to be kept informed about progress.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.3/3">Part II of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 sets out a range of special measures to assist vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give evidence in court. These include the use of video-recorded statements, screens, live TV links, clearing the public gallery and an intermediary to put questions to a witness. The categories of persons eligible to apply for special measures under the first chapter of Part II of the Act are: children under the age of 17; those who suffer from a mental or physical disorder, or have a disability or impairment that is likely to affect their evidence; and those whose evidence is likely to be affected by their fear or distress at giving evidence in the proceedings. The special measures are part of a much larger programme to implement the &quot;Speaking Up For Justice&quot; report, which contains over 70 recommendations designed to encourage and support vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give their best evidence in criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.3/4">The Act also changes the law on competency. It will allow someone who is unable to understand the implications of taking the oath to give unsworn evidence, providing that they can understand questions asked of them in court, and can answer in a way that can be understood.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's pre-Budget statement has made clear the need to secure substantial additional resources to ensure a modern health service across all clinical areas. There is no doubt that increases in national health service expenditure over the next decade will see substantial increases in spending on mental health including preventive interventions, increased use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, increased staffing, and spending on capital projects. We are studying the Wanless report with great interest and it will be an important source of analysis and information in the allocation of resources to the service.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.5/1">A survey of the mental health of children and adolescents in Great Britain was carried out in 1999 by the Office for National Statistics on behalf of the Department, the Scottish Health Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The intention was to provide up-to-date baseline information on the prevalence of mental disorders among 5 to 15-year-olds. Prevalence rates were produced for the three main categories of mental disorder, for example conduct disorders, hyperactivity and emotional disorders.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.5/1">I am responding on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to the reports of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) and the Review Body on Nursing staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB), which are published today. I understand that a similar announcement is being made by the Minister for Health and Community Care in Scotland, and the Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales. Copies of the reports are available in the Vote Office and the Library. I am grateful to the chairmen and members of both Review Bodies for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/2">The pay recommendations of the two Review Bodies are being accepted in full and without staging.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/3">Nurses, midwives and health visitors are to get an across the board increase of 3.6 per cent. Some 45,000 of the lowest paid nursing support staff on grade A will benefit from a minimum cash uplift of &pound;400 giving them pay rises of up to 4.3 per cent. Non registered staff on grades A and B will also have access to an additional incremental point if they achieve National Vocational Qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/4">On call and standby payments increase by 50 per cent. while Psychiatric and Regional Secure Unit Allowances are increased by 32 per cent. Other cash based allowances are increased by 3.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/5">London Allowances will be increased by 3.6 per cent. and the earnings related element will be consolidated into a new rate of &pound;3,228 for all nursing staff working in inner London irrespective of their earnings.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/6">This year additional action has been targeted to support clinical leadership in the national health service. Staff undertaking matron roles will have access to an increased maximum salary up to &pound;32,760. The lowest three incremental points on the Nurse Consultant scales will be deleted giving a new minimum rate of &pound;33,940. Nurse Consultants will potentially be able to earn up to &pound;46,675.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/7">On top of these increases the extension of the geographic coverage of Cost of Living Supplements from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> to a further six health authorities will result an estimated 20,000 more qualified NPRB staff benefiting from additional increases worth between &pound;400 and &pound;600.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/8">The minimum starting pay of a newly qualified nurse will rise to &pound;16,005, in Inner London starting pay for a new nurse will be &pound;19,873, including London Weighting and the Cost of Living Supplement.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/9">The NPRB has also recommended an across the board increase of 3.6 per cent. for physiotherapists, radiographers and other allied health professionals within its remit. The lowest increment of the basic grade will be deleted with the assimilation arrangements for all existing basic grade staff. Starting pay for newly qualified staff will increase by 7.5 per cent. on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> to &pound;17,115 or &pound;21,028 in London, inclusive of London Weighting and the Cost of Living Supplement. Cash based allowances are increased in line with awards made to nursing staff.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/10">The Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB) has recommended an overall pay increase of 3.6 per cent. for salaried doctors and dentists and general dental practitioners. In addition the DDRB has recommended adjustments to the pay scales, including increases in the scale maxima, for senior house officers, associate specialists, staff grade practitioners, and dental officers, and an extension in the dentists' commitment scheme worth around an extra &pound;5 million per year.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/11">For general medical practitioners it has recommended an increase in the amount to be delivered through the fee scale of 4.6 per cent, together with an increase in the out of hours supplement for GP registrars from 30 per cent. of basic salary to 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/12">The pay rise recommended by the DDRB takes the starting consultant salary to &pound;52,640 and that of a consultant on the maximum of the scale with maximum distinction award to &pound;133,585. The number of distinction awards has also been increased by 186 which will support the Government's proposals to reform the existing schemes to give more opportunity to reward consultants for their commitment and contribution to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.5/13">These above inflation increases are fair and reflect the important contribution that these key staff are making to delivering the modernisation agenda outlined in the NHS Plan.</p>
