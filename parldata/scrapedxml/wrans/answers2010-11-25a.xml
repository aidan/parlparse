	<p pid="a.388W.3/1">Mine clearance programmes in Angola funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) cleared around 6,000 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in 2005, 8,000 in 2006, 11,500 in 2007, 12,000 in 2008 and 7,000 in 2009. From 2009, work was concentrated in Kuando Kubango province, with smaller programmes in Bie, Huambo and Benguela. In addition DFID has funded clearance in Moxico province, clearing a further 3,059 items in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.3/2">The demining work DFID has supported in Angola has made large areas of land accessible to local civilian populations. It is our assessment that the majority of mines remaining in Angola are in more remote areas where there is less impact on civilian populations. Angola's Inter-sectoral Commission on Demining and Humanitarian Assistance (CNIDAH) reported that annual casualties decreased from around 250 per year in 2002-05 to around 50 by 2008. Landmine Monitor 2010 identified 28 casualties in Angola, a relatively small percentage of the worldwide total of 3,956.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.3/3">While there is still work to be done, Angola is a middle income country, with national authorities that are well placed to complete this work. Our work aims to support demining that contributes to development, help governments assume increasing responsibility for resolving problems caused by mines and improve value for money through increased efficiency. Ceasing funding to Angola will allow us to allocate more resources to mine-affected countries where our funding will have greater development impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.394W.2/1">In July 2010, the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology (Peter Luff), set out the five criteria against which future equipment programmes will be assessed. One of the criteria is exportability: making sure we consider the export potential and viability when considering new project requirements. This is now embedded in the Project Start Up/Foundation process, as part of the Ministry of Defence's acquisition cycle. Where appropriate, we will then consider how adjustments can be made to our own procurement programme to support export prospects. This may include more modular design or acquisition options which provide greater flexibility to meet export requirements at minimal cost, for example, while ensuring the UK still obtains the capability it needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.2/2">The Defence and Security Industrial and Technology Paper will consider how the Government can further support responsible defence exports. Interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on this paper during the public consultation period which will begin after the Christmas recess for a 12 week period up to the end of March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.404W.2/1">I have received a number of letters from schools, other education providers and individuals recently and I am aware of the effect of many of the outreach activities it supports.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.2/2">In 2004, Aimhigher's funding for the year was &#163;136 million. By the time Labour left office, its annual funding had been reduced by 43% to &#163;78 million. We have been very clear about the importance of widening participation and improving fair access in higher education-all those with the ability should have access to higher education irrespective of family income.</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.2/3">This is why the Coalition is taking a new and different approach that builds on existing best practice, while developing it further. We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation; and greater Government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Within this context, the Aimhigher programme will cease at the end of this academic year (July 2011).</p>
	<p pid="a.404W.2/4">In the future institutions will be accountable for the steps they take to widen participation. Those wanting to charge more than a &#163;6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new &#163;150 million National Scholarships Programme. This work will be further supported by the &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium to turn their school-based achievement into success at university. Universities and schools have learned a lot from the Aimhigher programme about &quot;what works&quot; in raising the aspirations of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Much of this knowledge is now embedded in the sector. It is right that universities have the freedom and flexibility to decide how to spend their resources on promoting access in the ways that will have the most impact for that institution, including through partnerships. This freedom will be accompanied by a regime of sanctions. Access will remain a focus for all institutions, who will continue to submit a Widening Participation Strategic Assessment to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. We are putting student choice at the heart of the system and will support this by ensuring institutions provide prospective students with clear and comparable information about course content, teaching methods and the employment outcomes of previous students.</p>

	<p pid="a.409W.3/1">The Government expect all internet service providers (ISPs) providing an internet access service-both fixed and mobile-to offer all legal content. Consumers should always be able to access any legal content or service they want to and content providers and applications should be able to access consumers. ISPs should not be able to discriminate unfairly against services or users. That means no blocking or discriminatory degradation of services or applications for commercial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.3/2">There is not yet any evidence that discriminatory practices are emerging, or that there is a problem with regards to how ISPs or networks manage the traffic that flows over them (something they all engage in for technical reasons to deliver the best possible service to consumers). And this is enforced by the initial responses to Ofcom's recent consultation on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.3/3">A contributing factor to the success of the internet has been the lack of legislative restraints that have been placed on it. It is important that we give the market the opportunity to self regulate. Ofcom will closely monitor how the market develops and if it develops in an anti-competitive way they will intervene.</p>

	<p pid="a.409W.6/1">The Department holds information on pay differentials between graduates and non-graduates from a wide range of sources-published statistics, internal analysis, and external research. Much of it draws on data from the Labour Force Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/2">It all shows that, on average, graduates earn more than non-graduates. The key points are summarised here, in terms of actual earnings and the lifetime earnings premium.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/3" class="italic"> Average earnings</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/4">The following table shows recent estimates from the Labour Force Survey of the average earnings for employees of working age in the UK, split by those in full-time and part-time employment, according to whether they hold qualifications at Level 4 or above, or Level 3 and below.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/5">Qualifications at Level 4 and above (L4+) correspond to 'HE level qualifications', ranging from HE certificates and HNDs, through first degrees, up to and including doctorates; they also include vocational equivalents (e.g. higher level NVQs). The estimates are for Quarter 2 (April to June) 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.409W.6/15" class="italic"> Lifetime earnings</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/16">There are also estimates of the lifetime earnings benefits of having a degree over and above two or more A-levels (the 'graduate premium'), which control for other factors that influence earnings. The Department draws on various estimates of the lifetime earnings benefits for degree holders, arising from both external and internal analysis. Generally they all estimate the lifetime earnings benefits of having a first degree over and above two or more A-levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/17">These estimates indicate that first degree graduates can expect to earn, on average, over &#163;100,000 more over their working life, in today's values and net of taxes, than similar individuals who stop their education with two or more A-levels</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/18">This is for the average graduate, and the actual position for any individual will vary around this average.</p>
	<p pid="a.409W.6/19">There have been several calculations of the graduate premium in recent years, using data from different time periods and/or slightly different methods, though they have all used data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS-a sample survey) and the broad approach is consistent. These have all come to similar conclusions, albeit with slightly different estimates, which is why it is generally not expressed as a single figure but rather as a range or being above a certain value.</p>

	<p pid="a.409W.6/22" class="indent">'The Economic Benefits of a degree, UUK/PWC, Feb 2007' (this gave the graduate premium as being around &#163;160,000 gross)</p>

	<p pid="a.420W.2/1">The effect on small businesses of the workplace pension reform regulations is set out in the 2010 Impact Assessment. The impact assessment looks at the impact on employers by employer size, looking specifically at small employers (defined as those with fewer than 50 workers) and micro employers (defined as those with fewer than five workers). Annex A presents the detailed assessment, as well as elements of the reforms that are designed to help small and micro employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/2">Copies of the impact assessment can be found in the Commons Library or at:</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/772/pdfs/uksiem_20100772_en.pdf">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/772/pdfs/uksiem_ 20100772_en.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/4">An independent review of the workplace pension reforms &quot;Making automatic enrolment work&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-27">27 October 2010</phrase>. One of the things the review team examined was the impact of the reforms on business. David Yeandle, of the Engineering Employers' Federation, was part of the review team to ensure that business interests were well represented in the review process.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/5">The review team recognised that easing burdens on business was important. So a number of their recommendations are aimed specifically at making things more straightforward for employers and we have accepted these recommendations in full. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/6" class="indent">Increasing the threshold at which an individual is automatically enrolled (currently &#163;5,035 at 2006-07 prices) to align it with the PAYE tax threshold (&#163;7,475 in 2011-12) and aligning the threshold at which contributions become payable (currently &#163;5,035) with the national insurance contributions threshold (currently &#163;5,715).</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/7" class="indent">A simpler way for employers to check that their defined contribution schemes meet the required standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/8" class="indent">An optional waiting period of up to three months before an employee needs to be automatically enrolled.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/9">Such recommendations will give employers greater flexibility in how they implement the new requirements and will mean that there is a much more proportionate impact on employers. The increased earnings threshold and waiting period are particularly beneficial for smaller employers, as they tend to have more lower earners and higher staff turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/10">The review team recommended a range of further measures specifically aimed at helping smaller businesses including:</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/11" class="indent">Ensuring that micro employers are aware that the design of NEST specifically takes account of their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/12" class="indent">Providing the maximum possible comfort to small employers that they will not be held liable for their scheme choice, particularly if they opt for NEST or a stakeholder pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/13">In addition, smaller businesses will not be required to do anything until 2014, once larger employers have been fully brought in. This gives them more time to prepare and more time for us to ensure that the processes work well. Even then they will not be required to contribute the full three per cent minimum contribution until October 2017. New businesses will be given further protection by being brought into the reforms last. Any new businesses set up after April 2012 will not have to automatically enrol until March 2016 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/14">The Government are taking forward the recommendations from the review as part of the forthcoming Pensions and Savings Bill, which is scheduled for introduction to Parliament in January 2011. The accompanying impact assessment will set out in detail how the changes affect smaller employers.</p>

	<p pid="a.422W.3/1">The Department does not collect administrative data on the actual mortgage rates paid by support for mortgage interest customers, or information on the average or total difference between eligible mortgage interest outgoings and benefit awards for people in receipt of support for mortgage interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.3/2">In November 2009, we received a sample of data on almost 6,000 support for mortgage interest claimants (around 3% of the total case load) from 16 different mortgage lenders, collected on our behalf by Council of Mortgage Lenders and HM Treasury. While the data are not a statistically robust sample and any results should be considered illustrative, and it is likely that the distribution of mortgage rates will have changed since the data were collected, they can provide a useful insight into the mortgages of support for mortgage interest customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.3/3">Based on this sample, we have made estimates on the proportion of eligible mortgage interest that we would be covered under a standard interest rate of 3.67% (the Bank of England published mortgage rate for April 2010), and these are available in table 3 of the equality impact assessment published on the departmental website.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/support-for-mortgage-interest.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/support-for-mortgage-interest.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.422W.3/5">It was necessary for the Government to put support for mortgage interest on a more sustainable footing, and to better reflect mortgage costs, which is why we set the standard interest rate at a level equal to the Bank of England's published monthly average mortgage rate from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase>. The rate is currently 3.63%. The previous rate of 6.08% was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers. The plans of the previous Government would have meant that the standard interest rate would have reverted to a formula-the Bank of England base rate plus 1.58%-which, at present, would produce a rate of 2.08% from January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.3/6">Although arrears levels may increase for those few borrowers whose new payments do not cover their mortgage, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has advised that that does not translate into an immediate possession risk, and that lenders will continue to exercise forbearance where it is fair to do so for the borrower, and the borrower has a chance of rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.3/7">Although there are no current plans to change the standard interest rate, we do intend to carefully monitor the impact of the policy. The Government will also continue to explore with mortgage lenders the scope for them to &quot;freeze&quot; benefit claimants' mortgage accounts and apply a standard interest rate for a fixed period.</p>

	<p pid="a.431W.0/2">Research by the Department shows that service children who regularly move schools tend to underperform and several studies have found that children in military families face certain social and emotional challenges. But overall, a higher proportion of service children achieve expected levels in English and mathematics at key stage 1 and 2 than their peers; and a higher proportion achieve five A*-C GCSEs. However, it remains important that schools are aware of the challenges facing children of those who are on active service, or who have recently returned from active service, and are ready to offer appropriate support when necessary.</p>

This funding is in addition to mainstream funding for schools. Places for engineering diploma students aged 16 to 18 are fully funded by the Young People's Learning Agency, as with all accredited qualifications, but their allocations to institutions are not made on the basis of specific qualifications and as such we cannot say how much will fund the engineering diploma in 2010-11. Further details on funding for 2011-12 will be made clear when the Department for Communities and Local Government announces local authority allocations and on the publication of the statement of priorities for the Young People's Learning Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.0/3">Local authorities in England and Wales have had, since February 2007, a statutory duty to make arrangements to identify all children missing from education in their area.

	<p pid="a.434W.0/4">It is important that schools and local authorities implement the systems and regulations and follow the guidance in place around keeping registers, excluding pupils and removing pupils from the school roll. Schools must fulfil their requirement to inform local authorities when pupils' names are deleted from the school roll or have &quot;disappeared&quot; following 10 days unauthorised absence from the school. Notifying the local authority is important because the local authority can then attempt to trace the children and ensure that any pupils whose names removed from the roll of a school are receiving a suitable education.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.3/1">The annual PE and sport survey has collected data relating to PE and school sport since 2003. The 2009-10 survey showed that, after investment of &#163;2.4 billion of Exchequer and lottery funding and seven years of work, only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools. The coalition Government are committed to creating an annual Olympic-style school sport event to encourage more competitive sport in schools. Our approach differs fundamentally from that of the last Government. While the network of school sport partnerships helped schools to increase participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, the proportion of pupils playing regular competitive sport has remained disappointingly low.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.2/4">The Department does not require local authorities to provide specific information on deaf children. However, the Special Educational Needs (Provision of Information by Local Education Authorities) Regulations 2001 and the School Information Regulations 2008 require local authorities to publish their arrangements and policies on the provision available for children with special educational needs, which will include deaf children.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.2/5">The Special Educational Needs Information Act (2008) requires the annual publication of information about children in England with special educational needs.

	<p pid="a.439W.2/1">DECC does not hold the information requested. To meet its principal duty, to protect the interests of consumers, Ofgem collects relevant information, including on switching.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.2/2">Since the publication of their consumer engagement survey in August 2008 Ofgem has, in an update report published in March 2010, found that switching levels have fallen slightly, with 17% of gas customers and 18% of electricity customers switching during 2009, down from 20% for electricity and 19% for gas during 2008. However, Ofgem point out that this was in the context of the more static pricing strategies seen during 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.2/3">This report also found that 8% of those who have never switched say they found the number of tariffs confusing. In addition, 67% of customers who had switched their electricity supplier and 64% who had switched their gas supplier believe they are now paying less as a result of their switch. This is a statistically significant improvement for electricity where, in 2008, 62% said they believed they were paying less than they would have without switching.</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.8/1">The main financial mechanisms that the Government have to incentivise the generation of renewable electricity are the Renewables Obligation (RO) and the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.8/2" class="indent">The RO supports large-scale generation of renewable electricity. Since its introduction in 2002, it has tripled the level of renewable electricity in the UK from 1.8% to 6.7%<sup>(1)</sup> in 2009, and is currently worth around &#163;1.4 billion/year<sup>(2)</sup> in support to the renewable electricity industry. The spending review announced that this level of funding will continue, confirming the Government's commitment to the increase of renewable electricity. The Electricity Market Reform consultation document is due to be published next month and will set out proposals for changes to the existing market in order to meet our renewables and decarbonisation goals. But whatever the proposal, Government understands the need for investor certainty, and is not looking to make retrospective changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.8/3" class="indent">The FIT scheme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April</phrase> of this year and supports small-scale low carbon electricity generation up to 5 MW (2 kW for microCHP) in capacity. Initial figures for the first six months of the scheme (taken from Ofgem's online database) indicate that 8,960 installations commissioned since the announcement of the scheme in July 2009 were supported. This amounts to a total installed capacity of 35.8 MW.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.8/4">In addition, the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is due to go ahead in June 2011 to support renewable heat. We expect to be in a position to announce the details of the scheme before the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.8/5">DECC will continue to fund a targeted Warm Front programme for the next two years to provide support for heating and insulation measures for the most vulnerable households. Warm Front and associated fuel poverty funding of &#163;110 million in 2011-12 and &#163;100 million in 2012-13 will be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.8/6">In addition, to December 2012 energy companies are expected to invest more than &#163;2 billion in the promotion of energy efficiency measures to householders to achieve their obligations under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and Community Energy Saving Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.8/7">The Green Deal, which will be introduced in late 2012, will provide households and businesses energy efficiency improvements at no up-front cost, with consumers repaying through the savings they make on their energy bills.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.0/1">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture (CEFAS) and Marine Scotland Science send scientific observers to sea with fishermen to sample the quantity of fish discarded and retained by fishing vessels. This sampling is intended to provide estimates of discards of the main commercial species, but at present is not fully representative of all UK fisheries. It is only possible to sample a proportion of the vessels participating in any fishery.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/2">Approximately 294,878 tonnes of quota stocks were landed into port by UK vessels in 2009. Estimates of landings and discards by English and Welsh vessels fishing in UK waters in 2009 were provided for the following fisheries:</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.0/26" class="indent">59,763 tonnes were landed and 24,401 tonnes were discarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/27">We are urging all member states and EU institutions to take the opportunity through reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) to radically overhaul the way we manage fisheries in order to overcome the CFP's serious failures, not least in addressing discards. We want a reformed CFP to provide the incentives and regulatory framework to enable us to catch less but land more, for example replacing landing based quota with catch quotas.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/28">The UK has been piloting an alternative quota management system for cod based on catch quotas (a quota for what you catch rather than land at port). Interim results from these trials are positive; discards of cod are low (1-7%) and fishermen are fishing more selectively in order to maximise the value of their catches. The interim report is available from the CEFAS website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/29" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cefas.co.uk/">http://www.cefas.co.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/30">An expansion of this scheme, both in terms of the number and type of vessel participating and the number of species, is essential to gain further evidence on the wider application of catch quotas in mixed fisheries. The European Commission and their technical advisers (The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries) are supportive of our intentions to expand the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/31">Discussions regularly take place with representatives of the fishing industry on reducing discards through improving gear selectivity and altering fishing practices. For example, the Discard Action Group is a forum, facilitated by seafish, that brings industry, managers, scientists, and seafood organisations together to discuss research, share knowledge and come up with novel ways to reduce discards. The industry has been encouraged through such groups to use gear modifications or methods which are successful at reducing discards.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/32">There are many examples of collaborative work to reduce discards which have been carried out by the UK fishing industry in partnership with the UK fisheries departments. The Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) is one example of a continuing initiative to encourage industry-led research on a range of subjects, including the trials of alternative fishing gears, eg square mesh panels used to reduce the bycatch of cod in other whitefish and prawn (Nephrops) fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/33">The UK has been at the forefront of encouraging uptake of measures to reduce discards of cod. For example, this has been achieved through the Scottish Conservation Credits Scheme and English/Northern Irish equivalents. Incentives of extra days at sea for the industry are used to encourage uptake of selectivity measures (eg increasing mesh sizes) to reduce the bycatch and subsequent discarding of juvenile cod. Since 2009, this scheme has been enhanced with mandatory real time closures (RTCs) in operation throughout the cod recovery zone. We believe that localised RTCs provide the necessary protection for local aggregations of fish, and that these closures are beneficial for the health of the protected stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/34">The industry has also been involved in targeted regional pilots like 'Project 50%'. On average vessels participating in these trials managed to reduce discards in the South West beam trawl fleet by an average of 52%.</p>

It is still in the implementation phase. An important part of that is the production of strategies for nuclear LLW and non-nuclear LLW, which will guide waste producers, regulators and waste planners on implementation of the policy. The nuclear strategy was published by the NDA in August this year and we will begin consultation on the non-nuclear one shortly. Once the policy is fully implemented it may then be appropriate to review its effectiveness.</p>

Full implementation of the provisions in the code needs to be accelerated by the European Statistical System, in particular to reinforce mandates for data collection and to further enhance quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.461W.9/2">The facilitated return scheme (FRS) is a cost-effective means to facilitate quick returns of foreign national prisoners who chose not to exercise their appeal rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.9/3">The chief executive of UK Border Agency, Lin Homer, wrote in detail about the facilitated return scheme and the savings generated to the public purse in her letter to the Home Affairs Committee of February 2010. A copy of this letter is available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.9/4">The facilitated return scheme accounted for approximately 30% of the 5,530 foreign national prisoner removals from the UK in 2009, and for around 50% of the 2425 foreign national prisoner removals in quarters 1 and 2 of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.9/5">Due to the current economic situation it has been decided to reduce the value of assistance offered under FRS and bring the scheme in line with other assisted voluntary return programmes. Although the impact of the changes is unknown we anticipate that it will continue to deliver significant foreign national prisoner removals and offer good value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.461W.9/6">The financial assistance in the country to which the individual returns is a low-cost option when compared against post-release support in this country. There is a saving to the UK Border Agency in terms of caseworking costs and potential transfer to and detention in an Immigration Removal Centre, at a cost of &#163;110 per night, if deportation cannot take place immediately at the end of an individual's sentence. The scheme offers an incentive for foreign national prisoners to comply with the travel documentation process, and to leave the UK before the opportunity arises to frustrate removal with various legal barriers. FRS not only saves money but also keeps our streets safer.</p>
