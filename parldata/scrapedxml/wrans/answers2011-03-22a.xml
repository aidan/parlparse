Responses to the question helped provide information which supplemented the output from the ethnicity question by identifying ethnic minority sub-groups, particularly those originating from the Indian sub-continent, in terms of their religion. The wording and design of the question and response categories were determined after extensive consultation with users and other key stakeholders and a programme of question testing. Information from the religion question is used to supplement ethnicity data to gain a general understanding of society; to inform service provision and resource allocations; and for fulfilling legal obligations to monitor inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.7/5" class="indent">Consultations in 2005 and 2007 revealed again a high demand for the inclusion of a question on religion in the 2011 Census. The majority of users responding to the 2007 consultation indicated a requirement for comparability between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.7/6" class="indent">ONS recognised that no single religion question could meet all user needs and after a programme of research and testing, ONS decided that religious affiliation - the number of people who identify with a religion irrespective of the extent of their religious belief or practice-was again the most appropriate concept to measure. Affiliation is a socially significant indicator in its own right that relates to a person's cultural background and values.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.7/7" class="indent">Consequently, the UK Statistics Authority proposed in the White Paper 'Helping to shape tomorrow' (published in December 2008) to repeat the 2001 question as one of a suite of census questions that would allow individual respondents to indicate their identity in the way they consider most appropriate. As was the case in 2001, and in accordance with the provisions of the Census Act, the question is-unlike all other questions in the Census-voluntary.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.7/8" class="indent">The question wording takes account of the fact that a significant number of people are likely to choose to respond by indicating that they have no religion. Thus to make the facility for making such a response explicitly clear, the 'None' tick box has been placed first in the list of optional responses.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.0/1">There are no immediate plans to commence Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2006. Instead, the future licensing and regulation of public charitable collections will be considered as part of the review of the Charities Act 2006, due to begin later this year. In the current economic climate implementation of the Charities Act 2006 licensing provisions has to be weighed against other priorities. Affordability and value for money are likely to be determining factors in whether the new licensing regime is implemented. Whatever the outcome of the review, we want to make it easier for legitimate charities to fundraise responsibly, while deterring bogus collectors and preventing nuisance for members of the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.911W.3/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government is committed to removing bureaucracy and unnecessary burdens contained within existing secondary legislation and other forms of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/2">In this context, I refer my hon. Friends to the answer I gave to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> of <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-24.304"><i> Official Report,</i> column 304W</phrase>, illustrating how the core programme of the Department is deregulatory.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/3" class="italic"> Subsequent to that answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/4" class="indent">1. We have scrapped planning rules which forced up parking charges and imposed artificial caps on parking spaces in new homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/5" class="indent">2. We have made changes to the regulations governing homes in multiple occupation to allow areas experiencing problems with homes in multiple occupation to put in place local solutions without imposing unnecessary burdens on the whole of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/6" class="indent">3. We have cut red tape to make it easier for communities to hold street parties for the Royal Wedding.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/7" class="indent">4. The Localism Bill has been introduced to Parliament. The Bill seeks to achieve a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central Government and towards local people. Reducing bureaucracy is one of the key aims of this Bill and we have committed to a number of bold and transformative measures in order to achieve this aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/8" class="indent">5. We have also carried out an extensive review to identify the changes that are needed to building regulations and are working up detailed proposals for consultation towards the end of this year, taking forward the spending review 2010 commitment to reduce the overall regulatory burden on house builders.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/9" class="indent">6. We are also working to remove bureaucratic barriers that hold back local action, and have opened up a 'barrier busting' website for communities to identify them.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/10">All future regulations will be developed in full compliance with the Government's One, In-One, Out rules-meaning that new regulatory burdens we impose on businesses will be given full consideration to ensure that the costs being imposed are offset by reductions in the overall cost of regulation imposed by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.3/11">In the period since <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November 2010</phrase>, we have introduced 19 new statutory instruments. Most of them relate to minor technical revisions. Having reviewed them, I can confirm that none of these statutory instruments impose new net additional costs on business or the voluntary sector (compared to the policy status quo). Four of them are effectively deregulatory, as they serve to reduce regulatory and administrative costs on local government or business relative to the status quo. In this context, I would maintain that over this period there has been a net reduction in four sets of 'regulations', as a result of these changes to statutory instruments. A table with details of the statutory instruments that have been introduced has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.914W.5/1">Councils will be rewarded under the New Homes Bonus for an increase in effective housing stock-either building new homes or bringing long-term empty properties back into use. This empty homes incentive will thus encourage refurbishment of empty properties, which will deliver social and environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.914W.5/2">Notwithstanding, councils will not be financially penalised for demolishing long-term empty properties. If such a demolition is replaced with a new build property, the New Homes Bonus will still be paid on the new property.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.2/1">DEFRA set up a Raptor Working Group in 1995 to consider issues arising from perceived conflicts between the recovery of some raptor populations and their impact on game birds, moorland management and racing pigeons. The group noted in its final report, which was published in 2000, that in its view there was no scientific evidence that sparrowhawks or other birds of prey have had significant population effects on British songbird populations. The group also reported that the evidence showed that changes in agricultural practice were more likely to have caused the substantial changes in farmland bird populations. The report is available on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee website.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.2/3">A 2004 study funded by Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Homing Union, suggested there is no evidence that birds of prey cause major losses of racing pigeons at lofts or during races. The report &quot;Racing Pigeons-Impact of Raptor Predation&quot; concludes that much more could be done to use deterrents and other novel techniques to reduce the small number of successful raptor attacks that do take place. The report is available on the Scottish Natural Heritage website.</p>

The number and type of coloured rings used varies according to the species of bird concerned and the objectives of the relevant scientific study. Since the purpose of bird ringing is to collect information on the movements and survival of a representative sample of wider populations, it is essential that ringing (or other forms of marking) does not influence the health or behaviour of the birds concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.921W.3/1">Ringing of birds in the UK is regulated through the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). According to BTO, 1,032,013 wild birds were ringed in the UK in 2010. BTO's Ringing Committee oversees ringing activities and regulates permission for the use any new or 'unconventional' marks proposed for use on birds. Since the purpose of bird ringing is to collect information on the movements and survival of a representative sample of wider populations, it is essential that ringing (or other forms of marking) does not influence the health or behaviour of the birds concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.921W.3/2">BTO works with other national schemes through the European co-ordination scheme EURING. As well as exchange of data, this international co-operation ensures there is regular exchange of information on issues relating to ringing, and bird health and welfare.</p>

	<p pid="a.921W.6/1">The Government aim for a cheese industry that is part of a profitable, thriving and competitive UK dairy sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.921W.6/2">To this end, we have reinvigorated the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, challenging key representatives to discuss issues and opportunities, the health and future of the dairy sector, and how the industry might address the trade balance and secure its own sustainability and long-term British milk supply. The first meeting in this more productive format was <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-20">20 January 2011</phrase>. The focus of the next forum this summer will be how individual businesses and groups of suppliers and customers through the chain need to establish clear strategies to secure the long-term sustainability of British milk supply and the industry as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.921W.6/3">The Government are committed to ensuring that food and drink procured by Government Departments meet British or equivalent standards of production where this does not lead to an overall increase in costs. We want Government to lead by example and to see top quality British produce on public sector plates, which provides value for money, meets customers' requirements and delivers on sustainability. We aim to introduce Government buying standards, which will be mandatory for central Government, by the end of March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.921W.6/4">We are establishing a groceries code adjudicator (GCA) to monitor and enforce the groceries supply code of practice (GSCOP). The GSCOP was introduced so that major retailers with buyer power would be prevented from passing excessive risks or unexpected costs on to suppliers. In a period where input costs are rising and forecast to rise further, this is more important than ever. The GCA will investigate complaints from anyone in the supply chain that is directly or indirectly affected by a breach of the code and can deal with them anonymously. This means suppliers from both the UK and overseas will be able to complain confidentially for the first time about breaches of the code. A Bill is currently being drafted.</p>

This is just one element of the structural changes that have taken place in the sector. The long-term trend in dairy production is towards fewer, larger and more productive herds. The table also shows how the decline in the number of dairy cows has been offset by an increase in average herd size and milk yields. So while the number of dairy cows, in England has fallen by 20% between2001 and 2010, the level of milk production (at the UK level) has only fallen by 5%.</p>

	<p pid="a.925W.0/2">All but the smallest petrol stations are subject to control over vapour emissions from the unloading and storage of petrol, in accordance with the EU Stage I Directive on petrol vapour recovery (1994/63/EC). Larger petrol stations in England were also required to fit equipment to minimise vapour emissions from refuelling of vehicles by <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.925W.0/3">The EU Stage II Directive (2009/126/EC), which also deals with emissions-during refuelling, was adopted in 2009 and will be transposed into national legislation by the end of this year. The development of all these measures took account of health impacts. Where a planning application is required for the siting of a new petrol station, it is a matter for local planning authorities to decide whether the application should be granted, having regard to the policies in their development plans and any other material consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.925W.3/1">DEFRA has not made a formal assessment of the variation in costs between different local authorities of either waste prevention or recycling. Costs will vary depending upon local demographics, environments and facilities, and it is for local authorities to determine how best to provide services. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) works with councils on benchmarking quality of service and performance. WRAP reported in 2008 on relative costs of different collection systems; the report is available on its website.</p>

This allows a new entrant to replace an existing provider for a specific geographic area.</p>
	<p pid="a.926W.5/2">Business customers with premises in England and Wales that use 50 megalitres or more of water a year can also switch to a new supplier under the water supply licensing regime (WSL). However, the WSL does not currently permit eligible customers to switch their sewerage service provider. The Government intend to lower the WSL threshold to five megalitres a year within the area of water companies that are wholly or mainly in England at the earliest opportunity. This would increase the size of the competitive water supply market from 2,200 eligible customers to around 27,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.926W.5/3">Household customers (and ineligible business customers) do not have the opportunity to change their supplier under the above regimes. Options for extending choice in the water sector will be considered in the forthcoming Water White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.931W.8/1">The new process for managing family returns emphasises the importance of engaging with the family and understanding their heath and welfare needs. These will be recorded on a family welfare form which will be updated through the family's progress through the system. If it is appropriate the UK Border Agency will also seek information from children's services departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.8/2">Where a family has chosen not to leave the country voluntarily, either though an assisted voluntary returns package, under their own steam or via a self-check in return, the UK Border Agency will refer the case to an independent Family Returns Panel who will advise on the best method of ensuring their return taking account of the welfare of the children. Under the new arrangements for managing family returns, families without any criminal history would be separated by detention only in exceptional circumstances and after advice had been sought from the independent Family Returns Panel.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.2/1">Safeguarding children and concern for their welfare is a consideration in every case where an adult who is known to have children is held in immigration detention. There are three main situations involved. The most typical cases are those where a member of the family is also a former foreign national prisoner and a decision has been made to maintain their detention pending deportation. In these cases care arrangements will already be in place having been made when the sentence of imprisonment began.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.2/2">In those cases where it is necessary to detain a parent in an immigration removal centre who then states that they have a child in the community, the UK Border Agency will seek to facilitate contact between the parent and child, subject to the wishes of the family, and in liaison with the local authority where appropriate.</p>

Figures for total seizures worldwide are published in SOCA's Annual Reports. The SOCA Annual Report for 2010-11 will be published in July 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/2">The following table contains volumes of cocaine and heroin seized by SOCA in the UK since the Agency was established in 2006. SOCA is a UK-wide organisation and does not publish seizure data by geographical area. A significant part of SOCA's operational activity in Northern Ireland is in support of the PSNI. Part of that support includes activity leading to the seizure of drugs by the PSNI.</p>

	<p pid="a.959W.3/1">As the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend, said in his speech to the House during the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-17">17 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-03-17.494"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 494-583</phrase>, an unprecedented wave of change is sweeping across the Arab world triggering a series of simultaneous crises. In Egypt and Tunisia this has led to new Governments and hope of a more democratic future. In Libya, legitimate protest has been followed by bloody civil strife, at the hands of a Government willing to countenance any loss of life in order to retain power. There is continued unrest in Bahrain, and deep instability in Yemen. And we expect further instability in the region in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.3/2">Our immediate priorities remain the welfare of British nationals as well as the need to support dialogue and political reform. Across the region, we continue to press Governments bilaterally and through the EU and UN to respond to the legitimate aspirations of their people for greater political and economic freedom. In Tunisia the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend, announced our new Arab Partnership which will support the development of the core building blocks of more open democratic societies, including a free media, broad political participation and private sector development. The United Kingdom will continue to press for progress on the Middle East Peace Process. Our work to tackle Iran's nuclear threat also remains vital.</p>

	<p pid="a.961W.5/1">Requests to arrange visitor tours of the White House were previously made through our embassy in Washington, which facilitated such tours for visiting UK nationals. However, this practice was discontinued in September 2010 as a result of the increasing difficulty of securing tour places for UK nationals. This is due to the rise in demand from US citizens for White House tours and the fact that the White House gives priority to American visitors over those from other countries. This change brings us into line with many other embassies in Washington that similarly do not offer to process White House tours for their citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.963W.6/1">In the Department for Work and Pensions outsourcing forms part of the procurement function. All DWP commercial activity is covered by a DWP commercial strategy and most is conducted as a corporate service covering the DWP centre, agencies and most NDPBs. The cost of the DWP corporate procurement function for 2009-10, and of those non-departmental public bodies that have their own procurement teams is as follows.</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="a.963W.6/12">This response reflects the cost of delivering the procurement function across DWP in 2009-10, the latest full financial year for which figures are available. The cost of function is not the same as procurement expenditure which is paid to external suppliers. DWP has a largely joined-up procurement function where the corporate centre provides services to DWP, its agencies and most NDPBs. As a result of past efficiency and modernisation programmes the cost of the procurement function has reduced by 35% over the last seven years. A current Commercial Improvement Programme will develop plans for the function to reduce by a further 40% over the SR10 period.</p>

As more detailed design is completed savings estimates will be updated to reflect the increased level of detail. The Chancellor announced in June 2010 that he anticipated that the overall impact of reform will result in savings equivalent to 20% of forecast working age DLA expenditure overall but savings have not been attributed separately to the care and mobility components of DLA.

However, customers attending job interviews that are considered to be outside the local travel to work area may get help with the cost of their fares through the Travel to Interview Scheme and in exceptional circumstances help with accommodation. Customers participating in a Work Trial are also entitled to claim their travel expenses. No meal expenses are paid in relation to attending interviews or a Work Trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009W.0/1">It is currently the responsibility of primary care trusts to commission services for the care of children with brain tumours from their funding allocations, including specialist care.

A copy has already been placed in the Library.

	<p pid="a.1009W.0/4">This Strategy includes &#163;150 million for the expansion of radiotherapy services, which includes funding for proton beam therapy (PBT). PBT is a very precise form of radiotherapy which has been shown to deliver improved outcomes and reduced acute and late effects in treating children with cancer, including those with brain tumours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009W.0/5">The Strategy also confirmed that the principles in &quot;Improving Outcomes in Children and Young People with Cancer&quot;, published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, will continue to be a feature of all commissioned services. This guidance serves to assist NHS trusts in planning, commissioning and organising services for children and young people with cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1014W.0/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has consulted across the United Kingdom on proposals for full cost recovery by removal of current discounts, with options for a phased introduction and a reduction in charges for low throughput businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.0/2">On the basis of the information available prior to the consultation, the FSA estimated that full cost recovery for meat controls would cost the Welsh meat industry approximately &#163;2.2 million, and the meat industry across Great Britain approximately &#163;29.41 million. Of these amounts, the FSA estimates that &#163;1.14 million would be attributable to low throughput, small, and medium meat plants in Wales, and &#163;17.92 million would be attributable to low throughput, small and medium meat plants across Great Britain. The term 'independent meat industry' has been interpreted as meaning the smaller scale businesses, and the low throughput, small and medium meat plants have been used as a proxy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.0/3">The FSA has identified 10 abattoirs in the small category in Wales which are considered most likely to feel the greatest impact of the proposed changes. Meetings or telephone discussions took place with nine of these businesses, and views expressed will be included in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.0/4">In the draft impact assessment<sup>(1)</sup>, the FSA notes constraints on the potential to pass costs forward along the supply chain, and has assumed that slaughterhouses will absorb approximately one-third of the cost associated with full recovery charging and farmers the remaining two-thirds. The FSA is currently refining the impact assessment in light of information received in responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.0/5">141 written consultation responses have been received across UK, 20 in Wales, including 11 from Welsh slaughterhouses of varying sizes. A number of stakeholder meetings have also taken place, and views expressed at these meetings have been captured.

	<p pid="a.1016W.2/1">When developing the White Paper &quot;Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot; the Government considered whether their aims could be achieved through the existing framework of primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs), and concluded that they could not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/2">First, PCTs and SHAs lack accountability. The Government's proposals will bring together elected councillors with decision-makers from the national health service, public health and social care on new health and well-being boards within local authorities. This will radically improve local democratic legitimacy, in a more effective and cost-effective way than the original proposal in the coalition agreement of introducing elected members on to PCT boards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/3">Second, our proposals will improve the quality of commissioning, which under the current system has failed to deliver sufficient improvements in outcomes for patients. General practitioner (GP) consortia will bring clinical expertise, with decisions made closer to patients, while a stronger role for local councils will bring greater expertise in assessing population needs, and greater integration between local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/4">Third, our aim is to decentralise decision-making, to free front-line professionals from political interference and central targets that distort local priorities. It is not possible to achieve this aim through the hierarchical structure of SHAs and PCTs, which are entirely subject to the direction of Ministers. The Health and Social Care Bill creates a transparent legal framework where local organisations have their own clearly defined functions, with no ability for Ministers to micromanage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/5">Fourth, the management costs of PCTs and SHAs have risen disproportionately and are not sustainable. The Government's plans will cut administration spending, saving &#163;1.7 billion every year from 2014-15, to reinvest in front-line NHS services. Savings on this scale would not be possible while retaining the superstructure of PCTs and SHAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/6">PCT and SHA staff will continue to play an important role during the transition. They will increasingly be involved in supporting the emerging GP consortia to ensure that existing skills are retained.</p>

	<p pid="a.1017W.2/1">In terms of suppliers of goods and non-clinical services to the national health service, the Department is currently considering a number of measures to reduce the burden such suppliers face bidding for NHS contracts. These will be announced as part of 'The Growth Review' which will be published shortly by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1017W.2/2">In terms of suppliers of clinical services to the NHS, the Government's policy is that for most services, patients will have a choice of 'any willing provider'. This will involve a qualification process for providers and means the need for tendering by commissioners for such services should diminish considerably. In addition, it is expected that the NHS Commissioning Board, when established, will be reviewing contracting and procurement procedures to both simplify them and ensure a greater focus on quality.</p>

This includes protection from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. The Plan is informed by The Impact of Smokefree Legislation in England an academic review of the evidence on the effectiveness of the 2006 smokefree law (which was published alongside the Plan) and by Passive Smoking and children: a report of the Royal College of Physicians.

We want smokers to change their behaviour so as to make sure that they do not harm those around them, particularly children in the home or in family cars. We will work with national media to raise awareness of the risks in exposing children to secondhand smoke. The Department's new marketing strategy for tobacco control will set out further details of how we will support efforts to encourage smokefree homes and family cars.</p>

	<p pid="a.1023W.6/1">The Department for Education has worked closely with other Government Departments to develop a free school meals eligibility checking system (ECS). This has made it much easier for parents to apply for free school meals (FSM) and to reduce the stigma that can be associated with applying for them. The ECS enables local authorities to check data simultaneously from the Department for Work and Pensions, Home Office and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in order to ascertain whether a parent qualifies for FSM and removes the need for paper proof of benefit. An increasing number of local authorities allow parents to apply online for FSM and receive immediate notification of their eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.6/2">The ECS reduces the burdens on schools associated with FSM administration. This is as a direct result of a Cabinet Office study and report that called for a reduction in the involvement of school staff on administering FSM. As a consequence, the use of the ECS is restricted to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.6/3">Academies receive funding for FSM processing through their funding formula. Local authorities may check FSM eligibility on behalf of academies and schools and are entitled to charge for this service. Where an authority decides to charge, we would expect the charges to be reasonable so that parents of pupils in academies are also able to benefit from the ECS.</p>

We have no plans to change this position but I am currently looking at ways we can insure that contested adoptions are handled fairly and be seen to be handled fairly and always in the best interests of the child.</p>

	<p pid="a.1026W.3/1">The Secretary of State for Education and I have had no recent discussions with local authorities or police forces specifically on missing children and young people. However, the issue is extremely important to this Department, not least because we know that children who go missing or run away regularly are at risk of harm, including sexual exploitation. We are fully committed to working with the Home Office and other Government Departments to consider what further action is necessary. In so doing, we are taking account of relevant developments including the Munro Review of Child Protection and the transfer of responsibility for missing children from the National Policing Improvement Agency to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.1031W.5/1">The Department for Education plans to reduce significantly the size and cost of its estate over the forthcoming spending review period, as part of the drive to reduce costs. This will include a number of key measures, such as making more efficient use of the buildings we retain, the expansion of our existing Flexible Working Policy and enabling surplus space to be disposed of or used by other Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031W.5/2">In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines and Property Controls, the Department will also take opportunities to not renew any commercial lease at expiry and to operate break options wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031W.5/3">The Government announced in spending review 2010 that as a first step to introducing a more co-ordinated approach to property management in the central civil office estate it would set up, through the Government Property Unit, Property Vehicles for the Central London and Bristol office estate from 2011/12.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031W.5/4">Property Vehicles will be responsible for managing a more co-ordinated Government-wide approach to property. They will manage the estate strategically, achieving more efficient use of the property assets, as well as work with Departments to reduce their estates and maximise the commercial potential of their property portfolios.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031W.5/5">Furthermore the Government announced this month a new system of National Property Controls across the central civil estate. These controls require Departments to adopt a common, disciplined commercial approach to the use of the estate. These build on the success of the Lease Moratorium introduced in May 2010, which to-date has reduced property costs by around &#163;50 million.</p>

Sixth form colleges and further education colleges are inspected and graded using the criteria in the Common Inspection Framework. Ofsted seeks as much alignment as is appropriate between the frameworks. There are, however, different statutory requirements for the inspection of the different types of provision and, consequently, it is inevitable that there are differences between the two frameworks.

	<p pid="a.1036W.6/1">The Department for Education has worked closely with other Government Departments to develop a free school meals eligibility checking system, known as &quot;the ECS&quot;. This has increased identification and support for free school meals because it enables local authorities to check data simultaneously from the Department for Work and Pensions, Home Office and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in order to ascertain whether a parent qualifies for free school meals and removes the need for paper proof of benefit. An increasing number of local authorities allow parents to apply online for free school meals and receive immediate notification of their eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1036W.6/2">Take up of school lunch is rising. Every day three million children are eating a healthy school lunch which meets the school food regulations. The latest school lunch take-up survey shows that for the second year running, take up of school lunches has increased; it is now 41.1% in primary from 39.3% in 2009, and 35.8% in secondary schools from 35.0% in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1036W.6/3">From 2011-12, the Government will be introducing a pupil premium worth &#163;2.5 billion by 2014-15, to support the attainment of disadvantaged pupils. The pupil premium will provide schools with an additional &#163;430 for each child known to be eligible for free school meals, in order to help them boost their attainment. Schools are already promoting and supporting parents in applying for free school meals. We therefore expect that the pupil premium, together with the ease with which parents can now apply, will increase take-up further.</p>

	<p pid="a.1039W.5/1">We are concerned that the number of pupils, especially those in disadvantaged areas, who receive a broad education in core academic subjects is far too small. We want to encourage more pupils to take these core subjects and to bring about greater fairness of opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039W.5/2">The English Baccalaureate does not include all the subjects worthy of study. We recognise that study in other subjects will be just as valuable to pupils and we will encourage all pupils to study non-English Baccalaureate subjects alongside the English Baccalaureate in order to benefit from a well rounded education. This is why we have kept the number of core subjects small enough to allow wider study. Subjects, such as music, which do not count towards the English Baccalaureate, can and will play a part in a well rounded, rigorous education. Achievement in these subjects, as with all GCSEs, will continue to be recognised in the performance tables as part of the A*-C measure, which will remain the basis for secondary school floor standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1042W.2/2">In our Schools White Paper, The Importance of Teaching, we announced measures to ensure head teachers take a strong stand against all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying. These measures include radically reducing the existing 481 pages of bullying guidance for schools to make it sharper. We will also encourage the promotion and sharing of good practice, so that what works in one school or area is learnt by others. This will help ensure that excellent ways of tackling bullying and cyberbullying are replicated everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042W.2/3">We continue to work with the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), which is co-chaired by Ministers; the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (James Brokenshire) and I. Several of its members, for example Childnet and BeatBullying, work directly with children, young people and families, as well as in schools, to promote e-safety and tackle cyberbullying. Industry is also working with UKCCIS to self-regulate and promote good practice to make cyberbullying easier to report, and enable prompt removal of harmful content, while making it harder for users to engage in such activity.</p>

Funding for young people that live in the most disadvantaged areas of England and those who are disadvantaged by other circumstances will increase by over a third in 2011/12 to a total of some &#163;770 million. This, along with the additional funding we have also made available to support foundation learning, will ensure that funding is targeted where it is most needed. We have committed to reviewing the funding formula to determine how a 'young person's premium' might operate in future in order to increase attainment by the most disadvantaged students.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042W.8/2">We will not be directing schools and colleges to use the increases in funding for disadvantaged young people in any particular way, because they know best the needs of their students. However, we expect at least some of it will be used to support the sort of enrichment activity that will benefit the hardest to reach young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1042W.11/2"><i> :</i> The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Pupil Referral Unit Census and Alternative Provision Census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042W.11/3">Local authorities will also attract the Looked After Child Pupil Premium for 2011-12 which will be allocated to local authorities for pupils who at some point in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> were looked after continuously for at least 6 months, and who were aged 4 to 15 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August 2009</phrase> as recorded on the April 2010 Local Authority return. Each pupil will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the responsible local authority that will pass it to maintained schools for eligible pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042W.11/4">The January 2010 School Census allows an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In the Peterborough constituency in January 2010 there were 3,352 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;1,441,360. In addition to this there were 37 pupils known to be eligible for the Service child premium, paid at a lower rate of &#163;200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further &#163;7,400. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. It is not possible to determine the number of parliamentary constituency pupils recorded on the Alternative Provision census or recorded as Looked After as they are both local authority, rather than establishment level, returns.</p>

However, we have been clear that creationism should not form part of any science curriculum or be taught as a scientific alternative to accepted scientific theories. We expect to see evolution and its foundation topics fully included in any science curriculum. Under the Government's planned reforms to school inspection, there will be stronger focus on teaching. Teachers will be expected to demonstrate that their subject knowledge is secure. If creationism is being taught as a scientific fact in science or any other areas of the curriculum outside denominational RE and collective worship, this would be noted in the Ofsted report.</p>

The particular needs of rural areas will be looked at as part of the review.

	<p pid="a.1046W.3/1">The Secretary of State for Education has said he expects levels of provision of sport in schools at least to remain the same. To help make this possible, school sport partnerships will receive funding to allow them to continue to function up until the end of the 2011 summer term. This funding will be used to fund the provision of physical education and sport; to embed existing good practice throughout the system; and to introduce sporting competitions for more pupils as part of the coalition Government's School games.</p>
	<p pid="a.1046W.3/2">In addition, we will make available &#163;65 million of new funding for schools to enable them to provide more opportunities for competitive sport. This funding will pay for one day a week of a secondary PE teacher's time to be spent out of the classroom, encouraging greater take-up of competitive sport in primary schools and securing a fixture network for schools to increase the amount of intra-and inter-school competition. We will be writing to schools with further details shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1046W.3/3">The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport (Mr Hunt) recently announced the creation of a network of school games organisers. These games organisers will work with released PE teachers to ensure every primary school pupil has access to high quality competitive sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1046W.3/4">This approach will mean that funding and support are there so that schools can continue to work in partnerships to deliver sport if they wish to, in order to increase competitive sport.</p>

	<p pid="a.1050W.2/1">Other than in prescribed circumstances, such as for the purposes of an assessment, only children who have a statement of special educational needs (SEN) can be admitted to a special school. Decisions on whether to place children with statements in special schools are for local authorities, acting in accordance with the Education Act 1996 and taking account of the Department's statutory guidance the SEN Code of Practice (2001) and Inclusive Schooling (2001).</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/2">The parents of children with SEN statements can request that their children are admitted to a maintained special school. Where they do so, the local authority must place the child in that school unless it is unsuitable to the child's age, ability, aptitude or SEN or attendance at the school would be incompatible with the efficient education of the other children with whom the child would be educated or the efficient use of resources. Parents can also make representations to the local authority for their child to be educated at an independent or non-maintained special school. The local authority must consider those representations and can arrange for the child to be admitted to such a school if doing so is necessary to meet the child's SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/3">Local authorities can admit children with SEN statements to special schools even where there parents have requested a mainstream education for their child. If the parents have requested that the child is educated in mainstream schooling without requesting a particular school, the local authority can instead place the child in a special school if mainstream education is unsuitable to the child's age, ability, aptitude and SEN or attending a mainstream school would be incompatible with the education of other children and there were no reasonable steps that could be taken to prevent that incompatibility. If the parents request a particular mainstream school then the local authority also has to consider whether placing the child at the school would be incompatible with the efficient use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-09">9 March</phrase> the Department published a Green Paper, &quot;Support and Aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability&quot;, for consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June</phrase>. The document mentions Inclusive Schooling in the context of parental choice of school for their children and asks readers whether they:</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;feel that the statutory guidance on inclusion and school choice, Inclusive Schooling, allows appropriately for parental preferences for either a mainstream or special school&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/6">The Government will consider responses to the questions in the Green Paper carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.2/7">The Green Paper refers to the Government's White Paper &quot;The Importance of Learning&quot; which sets out plans for a new school system. These plans include an expanded Academy programme which will give special schools, starting with those judged by Ofsted to be outstanding, the opportunity to become Academies and the opportunity for teachers, charities, parent groups and others to open special free schools, in response to parental demand. The Government intend to introduce legislation to ensure that the parents of children with statements, or the Education, Health and Care Plans which will replace them, have equivalent rights to request any state-funded school, whether that is a special school, mainstream school, Academy or free school.</p>

It will provide substantial funding (a total of &#163;2,222 million in 2011-12 and &#163;2,307 million in 2012-13) with new flexibility to enable local authorities to act more strategically and target investment early, where it will have the greatest impact.

	<p pid="a.1071W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.0/2">To reduce the burden of taxation on small business, the Government announced in the June 2010 Budget that it will reduce the small profits rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% from <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>. This reduction will enable approximately 850,000 companies with profits below &#163;300,000 to retain a greater a share of their profits to reinvest. For small business with employees, the Government announced, from April 2011, a rise in the secondary threshold for national insurance contributions and income tax personal allowance. These measures will reverse the impact of the previous Government's planned &#163;6 billion a year rise in the taxation of labour and will reduce the amount the government takes, from what an employer sets aside to cover wages, before it becomes take home pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.0/3">The Government launched the independent Office of Tax Simplification in July 2010 and tasked them with a review of tax reliefs and a review of small business taxation. The Office of Tax Simplification's final report on tax reliefs was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-03">3 March</phrase> while the interim report on small business taxation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March</phrase>. The Government will respond to these reports at Budget. The Government is committed to simplification and easing the burden of tax administration on business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-09">9 February</phrase> the Chancellor announced a new lending commitment by the UK's biggest high street banks. As part of these commitments:</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.0/5" class="indent">The banks intend to lend &#163;190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from &#163;179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more. &#163;76 billion of this lending will be to small and medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). This is a 15% increase on 2010 lending of &#163;66 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.0/6" class="indent">The banks have also proposed to increase the size of the &#163;1.5 billion Business Growth Fund (set up by the British Bankers Association Taskforce), announced in October last year, which will invest in small businesses with strong growth potential. The four major UK banks had already pledged &#163;1.5 billion to the Business Growth Fund. They have now committed to increase its capital by a further &#163;1 billion over the next three years, front-loaded over the next two years so that more help can be given to businesses sooner.

	<p pid="a.1084W.8/1">There are four officials who cover policy on anti-Semitism as part of their remit-by grade these are two senior civil servants, one team leader and one higher executive officer. Policy officials have access to a range of information sources from both across government and external partners, including published reports. I have received information about the most recent Community Security Trust report on anti-Semitic incidents in the UK which reported a continued fall in incident numbers in UK universities, from 97 incidents in 2009 to 44 incidents in 2010 (there were 67 incidents in 2008). The 2009 figure includes 38 incidents, it is believed, committed by one perpetrator leading to a high overall total</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.8/2">There is no place for racism of any form, including anti-Semitism, in higher education. Universities have access to a strong legislative framework and guidance to help them deal effectively with instances of intolerance, racism and harassment in their institutions. Government would expect them to vigorously tackle these issues when they arise and has supported institutions with key guidance on promoting good campus relations in the sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.5/1">This Department and HM Treasury are carrying out a joint review of consumer credit and personal insolvency that will look at all aspects of the consumer credit lifecycle from the decision to take out a loan through the lifetime of the loan. A call for evidence connected with the review has recently concluded and Government are considering the substantial number of submissions received. The review will also provide a framework for us to consider how best to take forward the recommendations from the recent Office for Fair Trading review of the high cost credit market. Government will make an announcement on next steps following the May local elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.1091W.0/26">In prisons in England in the 2009-10 academic year 1,513 (69%) of prisoners completed and 1,293 (59%) passed the Open University course<sup>(1)</sup> for which they were studying. A typical course is worth 60 credit points and requires 16 hours of study each week over nine months. Students aiming for an Open Degree need to earn 300 credit points, the equivalent of five years of 60 credit point courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1091W.0/27">Nearly all Open University undergraduate courses have no formal entry requirements, either prior qualifications or experience: this allows people who have missed out on education to fulfil their potential and achieve a university-level qualification. The bar is set higher for prisoners, with prospective students who wish to secure funding through this Department required to demonstrate that they have achieved level 2 qualifications and to show evidence of serious commitment to learning for rehabilitation purposes. All applications are considered individually by the Prisoners' Education Trust which administers the scheme on the Department's behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.1091W.0/28">Prison Service Instruction 33/2010 requires the Prison Governor/Director (or their representative) to apply a sift procedure to all prisoners wishing to apply for an Open University course<sup>(1)</sup>, regardless of the funding source. The sift ensures not only that applicants have been properly advised about the nature of study, and have the aptitude, ability and motivation to complete the course successfully, but also that the course the prisoner is applying for is appropriate in the context of his/her conviction.</p>

However, in the financial year 2010-11, the Prisoners' Education Trust has approved funding for three foreign national prisoners, and refused one. Foreign nationals are only funded if they make an exceptionally strong application, taking into account their previous employment history and their commitment to self-reform and avoidance of further crime. They must also have sufficient time to complete the course inside custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.1091W.0/217">The Government continue to believe that higher education is an important learning progression route for some prisoners. A small number of prisoners are able to study higher education full-time as they approach the end of their sentences while released on temporary licence. They are expected to meet their own higher education costs, supported by access to fee loans in exactly the same way as other higher education students. Maintenance loans are not available for prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1091W.0/218">Mainstream students studying part-time higher education courses are supported through grant arrangements: prisoners are not eligible for those grants. Where prisoners have the means to support their own part-time higher education study, they are expected to do so. Where a prisoner cannot afford to support their own learning, we make arrangements to support that learning as described in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-08">8 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-03-08.1054"><i> Official Report</i>, column 1054W</phrase>, on prisoners' education. As that earlier answer noted, we are considering how higher education for prisoners should be funded as part of the Government's review of offender learning. We expect that review to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1095W.2/1">One of a range of metrics used to assess the locality of bids to the Regional Growth Fund was the share of employee jobs in the public sector from the Office for National Statistics Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). Employee jobs provide a count of jobs not people/employment and do not cover self-employed jobs, HM forces and Government-supported trainees. Public sector employee jobs are those in: public corporations/nationalised bodies, central Government and local authority. The private sector is defined as: company, sole proprietor, partnership and non-profit body or mutual association. Full information on these data can be found on the BIS website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.5/1">The decision to close the Department for International Development's (DFID's) bilateral aid programme with Lesotho on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August 2011</phrase> was taken under the Bilateral Aid Review (BAR). DFID's office in Lesotho will close on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. All projects will come to an end as planned-none will be closed early. DFID's bilateral programme represents a small fraction of Lesotho's overall aid. Our experience is that such small programmes often struggle to achieve sufficient impact, Lesotho is one of the highest per capita aid recipients in Africa. Even without the DFID bilateral programme, Lesotho will continue to receive more aid per person than most African countries, including some which are far poorer in income terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.5/2">Senior DFID officials discussed these plans with the Government of Lesotho in October 2010 and February 2011. Future funding plans of other donors were assessed prior to making our decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.5/3">The BAR also considered multilateral aid received by individual countries. Lesotho will continue to benefit from UK funding provided through the multilateral development organisations. This amounted to &#163;3.6 million in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099W.5/4">In 2009-10 DFID's bilateral programme to Lesotho totalled &#163;3.2 million. This represented 4% of the &#163;79 million official development assistance (ODA) received by Lesotho in 2009. Total ODA to Lesotho has jumped since 2009-with local sources estimating disbursement of over &#163;150 million during 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.2/1">The Bilateral Aid Review (BAR) considered which countries should receive UK bilateral aid, how much they should receive and which countries should stop receiving this aid. The decision taken in 2008 to close the UK's bilateral programme in The Gambia was confirmed as part of the BAR process. Since 2008 the UK Government have worked closely with the Government of The Gambia and other donors to agree a responsible exit strategy to ensure that gains made with DFID bilateral assistance are sustained and extended into the future, including funding for a post in the European Commission office in Banjul. During the course of the review I met the Gambia Minister of Finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.2/2">The BAR also considered multilateral aid received by individual countries. The Gambia will continue to benefit from UK funding provided through the multilateral development organisations. This amounted to &#163;0.9 million in 2008-09. In 2009, The Gambia received $126 million in net Official Development Assistance. UK bilateral aid comprised &#163;2.39 million (approximately $3.4 million) or 2.7% of the total.</p>

	<p pid="a.1101W.3/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID's) bilateral aid programme in Burundi will close in March 2012. This decision was taken under the Bilateral Aid Review (BAR), which concluded that better value for money and results could be delivered through our larger existing programmes and regional support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.3/2">DFID Burundi has been working in four sectors-health, education, justice and regional integration. DFID is in discussions with the European Union (EU) to transfer programming in the health sector. The bulk of DFID's education funding is through a joint-donor basket fund with Belgium and France, which will continue following DFID's departure. The majority of funding for the justice sector is to an EU programme that will also continue. From 2012, DFID will concentrate exclusively on supporting Burundi's integration into the East African Community through regional funding, as we believe this will be a critical factor in the country's medium term growth. All remaining programmes will be coming to an end during the financial year 2011-12. No programmes will be closed early.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.3/3">Discussions about the closure of the bilateral programme were held with the Government of Burundi and other partners in November 2010. Earlier discussions about the likelihood and implications of closure were held with the two major bilateral donors in Burundi-the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Belgian embassy-in June 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.3/4">The BAR also considered multilateral aid received by individual countries. Burundi will continue to benefit from UK funding provided through the multilateral development organisations. This amounted to &#163;12.7 million in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.3/5">For the calendar year 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available, DFID support comprised 2.6% of total donor aid to Burundi.</p>

	<p pid="a.1104W.2/2">All allocations for 2013-15 will depend on results. We have provisionally allocated &#163;80 million per year for 2013-14 and 2014-15. Of the provisional total allocation of &#163;250 million for the period 2011-15, we plan to spend 40% in Somaliland. The remaining funds will be allocated to other parts of Somalia depending on needs, opportunities and progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.1104W.5/1">The Secretary of State for International Development is aware of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs' views from discussions with the Department for International Development before the Secretary of State's visit to Somaliland in January. The UK, like the rest of the international community, does not recognise Somaliland as an independent state. While we keep this policy under review, we continue to believe that recognition of any new arrangement should begin in the region, ideally with the Somali people themselves determining their future relationship.</p>
