	<p pid="a.366W.0/1">The Government's updated impact assessment published in August 2013, estimates that the rollout of smart meters to the domestic sector will deliver a net benefit of almost &#163;5 billion, leading to an average bill saving of &#163;22 per household in 2020 and &#163;42 in 2030. This reflects an estimated total gross cost of the domestic rollout of &#163;11 billion, offset by &#163;16 billion in gross benefits.

	<p pid="a.366W.3/1">Ultimately it is for the industry to propose what type of fuel to use in any future nuclear reactors, the designs of which would be subject to independent regulatory assessment and acceptance. To date, no potential operator has put forward proposals for a thorium fuelled plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.3/2">That said, the Department is aware of the potential of thorium fuelled nuclear reactor designs, including those using liquid fluoride thorium fuel, and is in the process of assessing claims regarding its suitability as an alternative to uranium based reactors in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.3/3">The current view of thorium reactor technologies from the nuclear industry is that, while the science is reasonably sound, developing reactors based on a thorium fuel cycle would carry major technological and commercial risks. The resources required to develop these technologies to the point at which they might be deployed successfully at a commercial scale are also very significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.3/4">To date, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world, this has prevented private industry and Government from investing significantly in the development of the technology. No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.3/5">While thorium does not appear to have a part to play in the UK's near to mid-term energy market, we do maintain an interest in its development. The Secretary of State has asked the NNL to look further into the wider benefits of next generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. We are expecting the findings to be available in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.2/2">The UK has fully implemented a comprehensive EU regulatory framework that has been in place since May 2006 to control emissions, as part of the EU's commitments under the Kyoto protocol. The major focus is to minimise emissions of fluorinated (F) gases from products and equipment. This is mainly carried out through containment, leak reduction and repair and recovery of F gases.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.2/3">In 1995, UK F gas emissions were 17.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (mt CO2e). The late 1990s saw a sharp drop as the two plants in the UK that produced the ozone depleting substance R22 installed equipment that captured and destroyed F gas emissions created as a by-product of the process, these two plants have since closed. From the end of the 1990s, F gas emissions have been relatively steady. The latest finalised UK greenhouse gas figures are for 2009, and indicate F gas emissions were 11.7mt CO2e. With the recent full implementation of the EU F gas regulatory framework and the impact of technological change, we anticipate significant emissions reductions in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.8/1">In its recent market study into the off-grid energy market, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) examined the heating oil market. The OFT found most consumers have a reasonably large choice of supplier with less than 3% of UK off-grid households living in a location with fewer than four distinct suppliers. It also found that heating oil consumers are normally able to switch supplier because they usually own their storage tanks and very few are tied into supply contracts. Moreover the OFT also indicated that consumers do not necessarily have to switch to a rival supplier to obtain lower prices if they can do so through the threat of switching.</p>

	<p pid="a.370W.3/2">As I noted in my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-18">18 October</phrase>, OFT has just published its findings from its market study into the off-grid energy market that includes the market structure and pricing of LPG. The study followed an investigation in 2006 by the Competition Commission into the supply of domestic bulk LPG. The recent market study has found that the Orders made subsequent to the market investigation appear to have substantially increased switching rates for individual tank customers but the OFT will keep the effectiveness of and compliance with the Orders under review. The study highlighted that many pricing concerns with LPG tended to stem from contract terms. The OFT has considered consumer protection issues and is engaging with suppliers to seek improvement in the clarity of contract terms, particularly concerning cancellation and switching rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.370W.6/2">The Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme will incentivise energy efficiency improvements in large organisations, through its combination of financial, reporting and reputational drivers. This should include incentivising the installation of motion-sensitive lighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.6/3">Under the Green Deal, we propose to include energy efficient lighting and lighting controls as an eligible measure in the non-domestic sector. Businesses will be able to install new lighting systems at no up-front cost with payments recouped through the electricity bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.6/4">The Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme for energy efficient products provides an incentive to industry to invest in plant and machinery where energy efficiency needs to be encouraged, enabling them to write off 100% of the cost of the asset in the year of purchase. High efficiency lighting units are included in this scheme and might qualify.</p>
	<p pid="a.370W.6/5">We also work closely with the Department for Communities and Local Government who lead on building regulations.

	<p pid="a.371W.8/1">The UK has a robust regulatory system. All onshore oil and gas projects, including shale gas exploration and development, are subject to appropriate environmental controls, including scrutiny by the relevant environmental agency (for England and Wales, the Environment Agency), and are subject to safety regulation by the Health and Safety Executive. They also require planning permission, and consent from DECC, before drilling activities, which may include hydraulic fracturing, can commence.</p>
	<p pid="a.371W.8/2">Further planning permission and development consent would be required, from the planning authority and DECC respectively, should the operator intend to move forward with the commercial development of the resources. An environmental impact assessment may also be required, depending on the area of the proposed works, or (if commercial production is proposed) on the expected level of production. Appropriate assessments under the habitats and birds directives may also be necessary in specific locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.371W.8/3">I have made no assessment of the regulatory framework in other countries. Government do continue to study the experience already gained in north America, and any available learning for shale gas activities in the UK. However UK conditions, including the geology, and the UK regulatory framework, are different, and there will not necessarily be any straightforward read across from the experience of other countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.5/1">There is already a great deal of international activity looking at the issues of the future development of nuclear power and responsibilities for non-proliferation and nuclear security and safety worldwide. We recognise the value of co-operation between operators and Governments and support closer working between the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), the World Nuclear Association (WNA) and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). Indeed, at the recent WANO biennial general meeting in China, the IAEA Director-General encouraged closer co-operation between the IAEA and WANO. However, we believe that this can be achieved without the need to set up new fora and secretariats.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.2/1">There have not been any changes to the EU treaties since May 2010 which have resulted in a transfer of competence from the EU to the member sates. Following the amendments introduced by the Lisbon treaty, the treaty on the functioning of the European Union now recognises the possibility that the European Union might decide to cease to exercise a competence conferred upon it by the member states and for this competence to be returned to the member states. The final sentence of Article 2(2) TFEU provides that:</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/2">&#8220;The Member States shall exercise their competence again to the extent that the Union has decided to cease exercising its competence.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/3">Article 5 of the treaty on the European Union makes clear that the Union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the member states under the treaties. The treaties and subsequent amendments thereto have been agreed by the member states by consensus and not by either majority voting or unanimity in the Council of Ministers. There have been no treaties agreed since May 2010 which have transferred competences from the UK to the EU. There has been a decision under the simplified revision procedure to allow for the amendment of Article 136 TFEU. This does not apply to the UK, nor does it transfer any competence from other EU member states to the EU. It remains to be ratified by all member states and therefore is not yet in force.</p>

	<p pid="a.376W.2/1">The elections held in Tunisia on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-23">23 October</phrase> were a success. The Tunisian authorities and the Tunisian people should be congratulated for the orderly way in which the voting was carried out, the high turnout, and the access the Tunisian authorities granted to observers. Those observers, both domestic and international, saw a consistent, clear and systematic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.376W.2/2">The Constituent Assembly will face the challenges of electing a speaker, nominating a president and then forming a government, before the work of drawing up a new constitution can begin. We look forward to engaging with the new democratically elected Tunisian Government, once it has been formed, including through our embassy in Tunis and officials here in London.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.2/1">The Government are working with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of waste collections and to make it easier to recycle. We strongly believe that the best way to drive up recycling performance is for local authorities to determine the most appropriate form of recycling services for their areas, to reflect local circumstances and demographics. This enables local authorities to work with their residents to deliver recycling services that people will use. The Government will continue to provide advice and support to inform the decisions made by councils, through the work of the Waste and Resources Action Programme and others.</p>

In addition, the average time taken from the date of offence to date of completion of the case has been provided for defendants in all criminal cases, including summons cases.

These are provided in Table 2, and are estimates sourced from the discontinued Time Interval Survey. Since the data are survey data and relate to the completion of a defendant's case in the magistrates courts only, note that these data are not comparable to the figures in Table 1.</p>

	<p pid="a.391W.0/1">The Public Bodies Bill consultation mailbox was created and activated on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-05">5 July 2011</phrase>. The consultation was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.0/2">The non-receipt of some responses e-mailed to the mailbox was due to a mailbox migration to the new Ministry of Justice e-mail exchange service prior to the start of the consultation. There were components missing within the mailbox at the point of migration meaning that some e-mails were not redirected from the legacy system to the new system. These e-mails would have been sent back to the sender and they should have received a non-delivery receipt.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.0/3">Ministers were satisfied that the steps taken once the fault was identified meant that extending the consultation was not necessary. A message was sent to some 7,000 stakeholders on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-23">23 September</phrase> advising them of the fault and requesting that any responses submitted via e-mail were re-sent. A similar message was placed on the consultation page on the Ministry of Justice website. E-mail was not the only available method of submitting responses to the consultation and the fault did not affect the receipt of hard copy responses or the use of the questionnaire that could be completed on the Ministry of Justice website.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.0/4">It is not possible to ascertain how many responses were not received. However, only one response was re-submitted that had not already been received.</p>

This involves some estimation. 3. Data for Elmley, Standford Hill and Swaleside are reported under the Sheppey cluster; data for Parkhurst, Camphill and Albany are reported under the Isle of Wight cluster; similarly, data for Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange is reported together as a cluster. 4. Dover and Haslar are not included as they are Immigration Removal Centres operating under Detention Centre Rules 2001. 5. Lindholme includes Lindholme IDC as it is a split site, part Category C Training Prison and part Immigration Removal Centre. 6. The following expenditure is not included: impairment charges, including the revaluation of land and buildings (2009-10: &#163;525 million; 2010-11: &#163;6.9 million); Operation Safeguard (use of police cells); cost of capital on assets in the course of construction (2009-10: &#163;22.5 million); project, operating and commissioning costs at HMPYOI Isis in 2009-10 (&#163;2.7 million), as the establishment was not opened during the course of year; costs associated with Probation (2010-11: &#163;l,038 million); electronic monitoring (2010-11: &#163;112.5 million); payment to Department of Health towards Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (2010-11: &#163;22 million). 7. For certain prisons the unit cost is not typical, because they were in the process of change, e.g. Isis (2010-11) and Bure (2009-10) were building up capacity during the respective years.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.405W.8/3">Recent developments aimed at improving procurement of the services include the establishment of a team to develop and roll out a Navy Command procurement process with the objective of harmonising and simplifying procurement activity initiated throughout the naval service. This team is drawing upon experience in other parts of the Department and lessons learned in recent procurements. The Navy Command is also participating in pan-Department initiatives in respect of future hard and soft facilities management, use of pan-Department or pan-Government enabling arrangements and introducing a number of e-tools as part of an improvement programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.12/2">Primary schools are considered for conversion to academy status following an application being submitted to the Department by the school. The following criteria are taken into account in determining whether to approve an application to convert to an Academy:</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.12/3">The school's last three years exam results and the general performance trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.12/4">Comparisons, both locally and nationally, with exam performance in similar schools i.e. the percentage of pupils making expected progress in English and Maths with KS2 for primary schools, and KS2-4 in secondary schools. We will be looking at whether the results are above, or moving rapidly towards, the national averages in attainment and progression.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.12/5">The last Ofsted inspections, taking particular notice of the school's capacity to improve; its outcomes; and effectiveness of the leadership team.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.12/6">Any other evidence of a school's performance which a school considers to be significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.12/7">Consideration is also taken of the school's financial position, the school's plans to support improvement in weaker schools, and whether the necessary legal requirements have been met. Less strongly performing schools may still be considered for conversion to Academy status provided they convert in an appropriate chain arrangement with a high performing school or sponsor.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.12/8">In determining the school&#8217;s performance the Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" name="Michael Gove">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.435W.2/1">As far as I am aware, the Department has not received any formal representations concerning the big society bank since June 2011. However, we welcome the creation of big society capital (formerly known as the big society bank) which will provide new investment for voluntary organisations and support them to deliver vital services for children, young people and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/2">Responsibility for the new Work programme falls to the Department for Work and Pensions and as far as I am aware, no formal representations about this programme have been made to the Department for Education. However, Government Departments are working closely together to widen opportunities available to young people aged 16 to 24 to maximise their participation in education, employment and training. We are committed to supporting all 16- and 17-year-olds to participate in education or training, and to raising the participation age to 18 by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/3">I can confirm that the Department has received a number of written responses since June 2011 relating to volunteering as part of a wide-ranging consultation on a new cross-Government statement on youth policy. These are being reviewed to inform the final statement which will be published, together with a summary of responses, later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.8/2">Local authority maintained schools are funded on a financial year basis and their budgets are set locally on a formula determined by local authorities in consultation with schools forums. For 2011-12 financial year basis, the average budget share per pupil in (i) London is &#163;5,505 and (ii) for England is &#163;4,667. These figures are taken from local authority section 251 Budget Statements for 2011-12 and include local authority maintained schools at the time the statements were completed by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.8/3">Academies are funded on an academic year basis by the Young People's Learning Agency according to the same local funding formula as maintained schools. This ensures funding equivalence with maintained schools in the local authority. Free schools are funded using a model designed to provide per pupil funding equivalent to maintained schools in the same local authority area. For the 2011/12 academic year, the average funding per pupil for academies in (i) London is &#163;6,320 and (ii) for England is &#163;5,483. The funding per pupil for free schools in (i) London is &#163;6,507 and (ii) England is &#163;5,092.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.8/4">The inclusion of LACSEG and post-16 funding means that per pupil figures for academies and free schools are not directly comparable with the budget share per pupil figures for local maintained schools above. Academies and free schools both receive the Local Authority Central Services Equivalent Grant (LACSEG), to reflect the additional responsibilities they undertake that were previously the responsibility of their local authority. Funding for academies and free schools also includes funding for post-16 pupils, where relevant.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.14/2">Applications to the Priority School Building Programme (PSBP) are currently being assessed and we expect to announce those projects that will go forward later in the year. The programme aims to address school buildings in the very worst condition. It is not a priority to provide single storey buildings or to replace coal-fired boilers through the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.14/3">There are no health and safety implications of building a school of more than one storey that cannot be overcome easily; and there is no reason why children with disabilities should be adversely affected by the provision of upstairs classrooms, where these are provided as part of PSBP. Any new building work has to comply with the building regulations which deal with the health, safety and welfare of people in and around buildings. Any new building work has to comply with part M of the Building Regulations (Access to and use of buildings). Schools also have to comply with the Equalities Act 2010, which sets out that people cannot be discriminated against, including because of their disability.</p>

The Lean Review conducted in late 2010 set out to uncover wasteful practices and examine how the procurement process could be accelerated. The report was published in February 2011 identifying significant potential to reduce turnaround time and costs in the way government procures. Since then, the Cabinet Office has developed a new lean sourcing process embracing 'lean' management practices. The new process is being tested on live procurement projects, with promising early results, and a pilot training course has been designed and run. Roll out across central Government is due to commence in early 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.9/1">NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) collects and supplies blood to hospitals in England and North Wales. Its overall stock target is around 45,000 to 55,000 units of blood, which is approximately seven days' stock. A regular supply of blood is vital because donated blood has a short shelf life&#8212;once it is outside the body, red cells last 35 days and platelets only seven days. There has been no shortage of blood for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.9/2">NHSBT has an alert system in place to monitor and take action if supplies of any blood group are below the target levels. In addition, NHSBT runs appeals for donors to come forward at times of the year when they may be less likely to donate, for example during high profile sporting events such as the World Cup, or when bad weather makes it more difficult for donors to attend blood donation sessions.</p>

It is anticipated that data on NIHR spend in 2010-11 in the HRCS Health Categories will be available by December 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.2/2">The NIHR Clinical Research Network currently has 211 studies in diabetes that are in set-up or recruiting patients. The breakdown is as follows:</p>

There are also important modifiable risk factors for all these diseases that are smoking, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and obesity.

	<p pid="a.451W.8/2">The NHS Health Check programme is a universal and systematic programme for people in England between the ages of 40-74 that assesses individuals' risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease and will support people to reduce or manage that risk through individually tailored advice and support. This programme has the potential to prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes a year and detect at least 20,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease earlier allowing individuals to be better managed and improve their quality of life.</p>

Breaches of the regulations are a criminal offence and can be punished by up to two years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Prior to the date of full implementation of Directive 2004/24/EC the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) wrote to 272 companies which it believed to be involved in the supply of herbal products in the United Kingdom. 132 replied saying that they marketed some 2,915 products under the section 12(2) exemption from licensing contained in the Medicines Act 1968. The Medicines Borderline Section of the MHRA is currently investigating nine companies complained about by the manufacturers of registered herbal medicines. The time taken to process a complaint will depend on the complexity of the case, the number of products involved and the response from the company concerned. Five other complaints have been investigated by the section and closed. The average time taken to process these was 19 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.456W.11/1">In &#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase>, we have committed over &#163;450 million over the next four years to support earlier diagnosis of cancer. This money will fund increased general practitioner (GP) access to diagnostic tests; pay for more testing and treatment in secondary care; and support campaigns to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer. One of the tests we are increasing access to is non-obstetric ultrasound to support the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. GPs will be able to access these tests directly in cases where the two-week urgent referral pathway is not appropriate but a patient's symptoms require further investigation. The intention is that more people presenting with relevant symptoms will be tested at an earlier stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.456W.11/2">Early symptoms of ovarian cancer can include pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, persistent bloating and difficulty eating. However, they can be difficult to recognise, especially when the disease is at an early stage, as they are often the same as the symptoms of other, less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or pre-menstrual syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="a.456W.11/3">In April this year, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a clinical guideline, the &#8220;Recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer&#8221;, which sets out recommendations for the detection of the disease in primary care. In addition to this, NICE is developing a Quality Standard for ovarian cancer which will set out what good ovarian cancer treatment and support looks like and will help support clinical commissioning groups when they take responsibility for commissioning ovarian cancer services. Detection of ovarian cancer in primary care will be considered when developing this standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.456W.11/4">The Strategy also sets out our commitment to work with a number of rarer cancer-focused charities to assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate, referrals to secondary care and to diagnose rarer cancers earlier. Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including an ovarian cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.456W.11/5">We are also part of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership to understand why there are differences in survival rates across a range of counties. Ovarian cancer is one the four cancers we are looking at as part of the study. This will help identify what more we should be doing to improve survival rates for ovarian cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.459W.5/1">There have been no assessments carried out centrally. It is for local national health service organisations to decide how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, and to commission services accordingly. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community, including the provision of speech and language therapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.5/2">Where NHS organisations are planning changes to their work force, they will need to demonstrate that their systems, processes and governance arrangements, including clinical leadership, are appropriate for assuring that the proposed service does not compromise the quality and safety of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.5/3">The Health and Social Care Bill provides the basis for better collaboration, partnership working and integration across local government and the NHS at all levels. The drivers of integration in the modernised NHS will be clinical commissioning groups and the NHS Commissioning Board. Both have new duties to promote integrated working by taking specific action to secure integration (where beneficial to patients). In addition, the Bill gives health and well-being boards a duty to encourage health and care commissioners to work together to advance the health and well-being of the people in its area.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.5/4">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) produces Quality Standards for England. NICE, jointly with the National Quality Board, recently ran an engagement exercise on the library of NICE Quality Standard NHS healthcare topics. As part of this, exercise a provisional list of topics that might form part of the overall library was published inviting comments. Although a quality standard on speech and language therapy was not included in this provisional list, the purpose of the engagement exercise was to canvass views on whether other topics should be included within the library. The engagement exercise closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-14">14 October 2011</phrase>. NICE are currently analysing the responses received and will be able to provide more information in due course. Once published, the library of topics will be reviewed at regular intervals allowing new topics to be added and quality standards in those areas to be included within NICE'S production schedule.

Support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria will provide 37,000 HIV-positive women with treatment to prevent transmission to their babies and 268,000 people with treatment. Our work with the Clinton Health Access Initiative will generate cost-savings to buy AIDS medicines for 500,000 more people by 2015. Our focus on care and support will include cash transfers in at least five high-prevalence countries reaching at least 120,000 people affected by HIV.</p>

	<p pid="a.472W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports projects in developing countries which specifically aim to reduce human trafficking. We support the Malawi Anti-Child Trafficking Project, which aims to improve knowledge of and access to rights for children in Malawi who have been trafficked or are vulnerable to being trafficked. In Bangladesh we support a Police Reform Programme which has established a Human Trafficking Investigations Unit. In Uganda, we have supported UNICEF to help identify and support trafficked women and children in the northern Karamoja region. DFID is currently developing a new regional anti-trafficking project in South Asia. The programme aims to reduce trafficking of women and girls in the region by 10% over four years. It will focus on trafficking into domestic work and the garment sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.2/2">DFID also works to tackle the underlying factors which put people at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking, such as poverty, lack of education, lack of economic opportunities, vulnerability to economic shocks, and social exclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.472W.5/1">Addressing malaria is one of the main priorities of the UK Government. We announced in March 2011 that we are committed to helping halve malaria deaths in at least 10 of the worst affected countries by 2015. We will support action to sustain and expand gains into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) will deliver on this through support to country programmes, international organisations and research. In Nigeria, this includes distributing an additional 6 million long-lasting insecticide treated nets and help improve access to malaria treatment; in Sierra Leone it includes supporting prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnant women and young children, leading to a further 867,000 children sleeping under a LLIN and 230,000 women receiving malaria preventative treatment during pregnancy; and it includes providing support to the World Health Organisation's Global Malaria Programme to identify threats to malaria control and elimination, and to ensure new evidence results in better policies in country programmes.</p>

The Department for International Development helps developing countries to strengthen their health systems so that they can provide these services, for example by ensuring that skilled, motivated staff are in place and a reliable supply of medicines is available at all times. We also work with Governments to make services more accessible to the poor, for example by replacing health service user fees with more equitable financing mechanisms. In addition, our contribution to the GAVI Alliance provides vaccines against infectious diseases, including those that can pose particular problems for people with sickle cell anaemia.</p>

	<p pid="a.475W.5/1">The improvement of the quality of health care is one of the key priorities of the Government of South Africa. As part of its support to achieving this improvement the Department of International Development is facilitating learning between the UK Care Quality Commission (CQC) and counterparts in South Africa. South African inspectors have been invited to join the CQC inspector orientation training programme at a total cost of &#163;57,860 for all 10 South African inspectors. These costs will be met by DFID and are inclusive of flights; accommodation and all other expenses. There are no cost implications for the CQC or the Department of Health. This represents good value for money in that CQC is a global lead in this area and will not in this case be charging any fees. This is a good example of how UK expertise can benefit partner governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.484W.3/1">The contract between Ofcom and Equiniti requires destruction of equipment in accordance with environmental regulations, return or modification for lawful use. Further, there is a requirement that any purchaser of surrendered equipment agrees to take the equipment out of use by the time licensed (and therefore lawful) use of channel 69 expires and confirm in writing to Equiniti that they have either modified the equipment to operate on Channel 38 or Channel 70, disposed of the Equipment under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations or returned it to Equiniti. Ofcom can request purchasers provide documentary evidence of disposal or modification (and to make equipment available for inspection on request in the case of modification). Any use of programme making and special events equipment in Channel 69 (re-sold or otherwise) after the deadline will be unlawful and Ofcom has powers under the Wireless Telegraphy Act to take enforcement action against unlawful use of spectrum.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40595" name="Andrew Mitchell">the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)</phrase>, meets regularly with destination management organisations and industry bodies. Over the next four years VisitBritain will be running a major international marketing campaign, aimed at core and emerging markets, based on investment of almost &#163;50 million from their funds, and additional support from the private sector, toward generating a &#163;100 million marketing fund.

	<p pid="a.485W.3/2">VisitEngland is working closely with local areas and destinations, in line with Government's localism agenda, to grow the value of local tourism economies. This is co-ordinated through the National Strategic Framework for Tourism, which includes an action programme developed in consultation with the tourism sector. This will include a four year domestic tourism campaign to promote domestic destinations, taking advantage of the &#8216;staycation' effect and revitalising our domestic offer, generating up to &#163;500 million in additional visitor spend and 5.3 million additional overnights.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.3/3">Tourism policy seeks to help improve the sector's productivity and competitiveness, in particular, to address the burden of regulation affecting the industry. The Government's Red Tape Challenge focused on the hospitality sector in May, inviting the industry and the public to identify regulations holding back the industry and stifling growth. Alongside this, the Government have set up an industry task force, led by senior industry figures, which is working on identifying rules, regulations and inspections impeding the sector, and which might be cut, modified or abolished.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.3/4">The Government's plans for promoting the growth of the visitor economy are set out in detail in the paper, &#8220;Government Tourism Policy&#8221; published in March 2011, and available at:</p>
