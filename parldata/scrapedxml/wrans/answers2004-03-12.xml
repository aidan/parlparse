	<p pid=".1750W.2/1">Ministers and officials from the Treasury and Chancellor's Departments regularly receive a wide range of representations from museums and the heritage sector, including many on the benefits they receive from Gift Aid.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/2">In April 2000 the Government made improvements to the Gift Aid scheme, as part of a wider package to make the tax system simpler for charities and their donors and to encourage greater charitable giving. In 2002&ndash;03 charities received donations under Gift Aid of &pound;2.3 billion, including tax relief from the Government of &pound;506 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/3">Under a special exemption introduced in 1989 and imported into Gift Aid as part of a wider reform in 2000, certain heritage and conservation charities are able to claim Gift Aid on membership subscriptions in the same way as they were previously able to claim tax refunds under Deeds of Covenant. Deeds of Covenant lasted for at least three years, meaning that a donor was required to have an ongoing commitment to a charity, but Gift Aid can apply to one-off donations as well.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/4">A number of charities eligible for the special exemption are claiming Gift Aid tax refunds under so-called 'day membership' schemes. These schemes do not generate additional giving, but simply reclassify admission fees as donations on which Gift Aid is being claimed.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/5">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the pre-Budget report (Cm 6042) that the Government will amend the Gift Aid legislation to ensure that the special exemption applies as it was originally intended and not to these 'day memberships'.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/6">This will mean that heritage and conservation charities will continue to benefit from the special exemption where a donor has an ongoing commitment to the charity, such as an annual membership, and these charities&mdash;like other fundraising charities&mdash;will continue to benefit from Gift Aid on other donations of money.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/7">The Government is consulting closely with charities that might be affected, directly and through their associations and representative bodies, on the detail of how the change may best be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".1750W.2/8">As I made clear in my earlier answer, no estimate is available of the amount of money being claimed by charities which are taking advantage of this. Charities are not required to differentiate on their Gift Aid claims the amounts they are claiming for 'day membership' income from other amounts they are claiming. No estimate has been made of the cost to museums of claiming the Gift Aid benefits they enjoy.</p>

	<p pid=".1755W.6/1">Crosby is included in the Merseyside Local Transport Plan (LTP) area. The Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) is the local transport authority responsible for improving public transport in Merseyside including, for example, implementing bus priority measures. The PTE has recorded that it has delivered or is planning to deliver 37km of bus lanes in Merseyside between 1998&ndash;99 and 2005&ndash;06&mdash;including 5.9km of bus lanes in Sefton. These figures do not take into account other bus priority measures such as Quality Bus Corridors/showcase routes or other schemes, which may incorporate bus priority measures.</p>
	<p pid=".1755W.6/2">It is not possible to provide data from before 1998&ndash;99 nor is it possible to identify separately how many km of bus lanes the PTE has delivered or is planning to deliver in Crosby. It is ultimately a matter for local transport authorities to decide how to distribute the annual capital allocation received from the Government for spending on local transport in their areas, in line with local priorities and in order to achieve the objectives set out in their LTPs.</p>

	<p pid=".1756W.5/1">Environmentally sustainable procurement strategies have driven innovation in this Department in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/2" class="indent">It is Government policy to use recycled paper and this Department has developed a Recycled Printing Papers Framework to meet the requirements of the Waste Strategy Initiative. Since the Framework started in August 2000, the success can be measured in terms of awareness, quality, availability and price advantage, demonstrated in savings to Government of &pound;1.8 million, growth in the market place and improvements in supply and quality. There are now more than 25 Government Departments and agencies using the Framework.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/3" class="indent">It is now a contractual provision within the Department to use legal and sustainable timber for all central furniture and property management contracts. Certification to this effect is required for all furniture supplied. A decision has also been taken to discontinue use of natural wood veneers on ranges of furniture where alternative finishes are available.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/4" class="indent">The Department's catalogue of core stationery items clearly identifies &quot;green&quot; products. All toner cartridges are recycled.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/5" class="indent">The Department's IT disposal contract offers surplus equipment to schools under a Home Office scheme. Any equipment where this is not appropriate is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/6" class="indent">All the Department's personal and laptop computers have power saving software which puts the hardware into power saving mode after approximately 20 minutes of inactivity. In addition, a rolling program is in place to refresh hardware: this has recently included the replacement of monitors with flat screen technology which has a much lower power consumption and heat output. All PC, laptop and network printer hardware also complies with EU energy saving and electrical regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/7" class="indent">The Department has encouraged its main suppliers of furniture, stationery and office machinery to aim for ISO 14001 certification. Most have now received accreditation with the remainder expected to achieve it in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/8" class="indent">The Department carries out an annual environmental audit of suppliers of goods, irrespective of whether they have an ISO 14001 accreditation. The audits are carried out internally by trained staff. Examples of good practice are shared with other suppliers where possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1756W.5/9" class="indent">The Department (in collaboration with ODPM) has awarded a contract for an electronic environmental management system (EMS) which is now being rolled out to other Government Departments.</p>

	<p pid=".1760W.5/1">If milk prices fully reflected the reductions in intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder in the period 2004&ndash;07, there would be a decrease of 4.5 pence per litre, assuming current exchange rates. The Commission in its economic assessment of the reform proposals concluded that prices would not fall to the full extent of any support price cuts. Colman and Harvey in their recent study for the Dairy Supply Chain Forum concluded that the average farm gate price in the UK could fall to just above 15 pence per litre. However, the effects of these lower prices on farm incomes will be, at least in part, offset by the introduction of direct payments. Furthermore, decoupling should lead to some improvement in prices and incomes as farmers produce for the market, rather than subsidy.</p>

	<p pid=".1762W.0/29">Emissions from diesel trains have fallen substantially in the last decade. In 2001, emissions from diesel trains accounted for approximately 0.2 per cent. of UK CO <sub>2</sub> emissions, compared to 0.3 per cent. in 1990. For NOx the proportion of UK emissions originating from diesel trains fell from 0.8 per cent. in 1990 to 0.6 per cent. in 2001. PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> emissions from diesel trains accounted for 0.6 per cent. of total UK emissions in 1990, reducing to 0.5 per cent. in 2001. Finally, SO <sub>2</sub> contributions have remained about the same over the same time period at about 0.08 per cent. of total UK emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".1762W.0/30">Defra has not assessed specifically the environmental implications of emissions from diesel locomotives because they are a low proportion of total national pollutant emissions. It is however possible that these emissions might have an impact on local air quality. Local authorities have a duty to review and assess air quality outside of buildings to identify areas where it is considered likely that Air Quality Objectives will be exceeded. Some local authorities are now beginning to perform monitoring in the vicinity of rail stations.</p>

	<p pid=".1763W.2/1">I attended the Environment Council on 2 March 2004, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".1763W.2/2">The Council agreed by consensus a set of Conclusions as the contribution by Environment ministers to the Spring European Council. We were pleased with the priorities reflected in the Conclusions. They included rapid implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan, a proposal that the Commission should report annually to Spring council on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, and called on the Community and member states to consider mid and long-term emissions reduction strategies, including targets, in preparation for the 11th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change in November 2005. We called on the Commission, in preparing its review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy by the end of 2004, to incorporate the external dimension of sustainable development so as to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international commitments.</p>
	<p pid=".1763W.2/3">We held a short policy debate on the proposal for a Regulation on shipments of waste. Replying to a series of questions from the Irish Presidency to all the delegations, I indicated that any measures aimed to prevent 'eco-dumping' should work through establishing community-wide standards and preserve the internal market; that in handling mixed 'green waste', the UK would support a proportionate, risk-based approach, aligned to the OECD Decision on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Wastes Destined for Recovery Operations; and that the 'take-back'requirements of the Regulation should not be applied to 'green waste'.</p>
	<p pid=".1763W.2/4">The Commission gave a progress report on the proposal for a Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We were informed that further work is being done on assessing the impact of the proposals. There are to be policy debates in both the Competitiveness and Environment Councils, in May and June respectively. We were also updated on the progress of negotiations on the proposal for a Directive to amend the EU emissions trading scheme in respect of the Kyoto Protocol's project mechanisms. Although work remains to be done, the Presidency remained hopeful that an agreement could be reached which would also receive the early support of the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1763W.2/5">There was a brief report back from the 7th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity/1st Meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, noting the good progress made there on protected areas and the conservation of high seas biodiversity, and also the very good EU co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid=".1763W.2/6">Other items were considered under Any Other Business and included a statement by the French delegation on the need to continue to press forward on maritime safety issues; a statement by the Belgian delegation on the protection of the marine environment, and in particular the problems of species spreading through ballast water and of by-catches of small mammals; written briefing from the Commission concerning its action plan on establishing a Global Monitoring for Environment and Security system; briefing from the Presidency on its plans to progress the proposal for a Regulation extending the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE); and briefing from the Commission on its action plan on environment and health.</p>
	<p pid=".1763W.2/7">Over lunch we discussed the preparations for the 8th special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum (UNEP) to be held in Jeju at the end of March, and the 12th session of the Commission on Sustainable Development to be held in New York in April.</p>

	<p pid=".1764W.5/1">Producer responsibility Directives include the Packaging, End of Life Vehicles (ELV), and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directives. The WEEE and ELV Directives contain provisions on product design that are expected to increase the recyclability of vehicles and electrical and electronic equipment when they are transposed later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1764W.5/2">The Packaging Directive is implemented in England and Wales by (i) the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) (&quot;the packaging Regulations&quot;) and the parallel instruments in the devolved administrations; and (ii) the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003. The Producer Responsibility Obligations provide incentives to minimise packaging as the amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they handle.</p>
	<p pid=".1764W.5/3">The Government recently commissioned a study on the impact of the Essential Requirements Regulations, which can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/sustainability/packagingfinalreport.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/sustainability/packagingfinalreport.pdf</a>. The report highlights a number of instances where packaging has been minimised as a result of the Essential Requirements Regulations. For example one large retailer has reduced the weight of plastic packaging on a range of cosmetic products saving around 30 tonnes of plastic per year.</p>

	<p pid=".1766W.8/1">Two of the principal aims of the Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Regulation (EC 2037/2000) are to prevent the release of existing ODS and ensure their recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".1766W.8/2">When setting performance standards the Environment Agency must have regard to the ODS Regulations and the criteria set out in Waste Management Paper No4 (WMP4). Licence conditions must be necessary, enforceable, unambiguous and comprehensive. The standard set by the Agency is based on the emission loss to the atmosphere from the process based on throughput, and the percentage loss through attachment to residual metal, plastic, foam and oil. The ODS Regulations do not require minimum recovery; only that releases are prevented and ODS recovered. The Environment Agency considers that the performance standards set meet these requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".1766W.8/3">Setting a minimum standard of ODS recovered would be problematic when assessed against the aforementioned criteria and the fact that fridges accepted at the facilities do not contain an average or an assumed amount of ODS, as carried out by certain other standards.</p>

	<p pid=".1767W.2/1">To calculate the percentage of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) from recovered refrigerators the average recovered CFCs per fridge for R11 and R12 needs to be used, which for 2003 in England and Wales are 186.13g and 50.5g respectively, and the average amount of CFCs contained in a refrigerator.</p>
	<p pid=".1767W.2/2">However, there is currently no agreed figure for an average amount of CFCs in a refrigerator across member states, primarily because of the variation in size and volume of units. Therefore it is not possible to assess and compare the percentage of CFCs with any confidence. It is for this reason that the performance standards set in the UK work on the basis of emissions lost in the process and those lost through attachment to residual metal, plastic, foam and oil.</p>

	<p pid=".1767W.5/1">In September 2001 the Environment Agency published its proposed decision on the future regulation of technetium-99 (Tc-99) discharges from Sellafield into the Irish sea. In December 2002, the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and for Health published their decision not to exercise their powers under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 to direct the Agency in respect to its proposed decision. The Agency's decision was, therefore, implemented in full. It contained a number of elements including a requirement to work towards the abatement of Tc-99 discharges through &quot;MAC Diversion&quot;. This technique came into operation in middle of last year. The Agency also required research to be carried out into the use of tetraphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP) to abate Tc-99 discharges still further. A plant-scale trial using TPP was carried out towards the end of last year. The results of the trial are currently being evaluated by the Agency and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. We look forward to hearing their conclusions, which are expected in April.</p>

	<p pid=".1768W.0/1">The Thames Barrier was originally constructed to accommodate an 8mm per year increase in sea level, which at the time of design was extrapolated from tidal records through the Estuary. This, in principle, provides protection against a one in a 1000 year tidal surge up to 2030. Current guidance from DEFRA suggests an increase in relative sea level of up to 6mm per year is built into plans for future flood defences.</p>
	<p pid=".1768W.0/2">The 6mm per year figure is intended to accommodate the impact of climate change on sea level; that is thermal expansion of the oceans and ice melt of coastal ice-sheets, as well as long-term regional land subsidence.</p>

	<p pid=".1771W.0/1">The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). It provides that waste means, &quot;. . . any substance or object . . . which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1771W.0/2">It rests in the first place with the producer of a substance to decide whether it is being discarded as waste.

	<p pid=".1771W.0/3">Whether or not substances, such as hazardous materials, are discarded as waste is a matter which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the Courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the interpretation of the definition of waste and the meaning of &quot;discard&quot;. ECJ judgments are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1771W.0/4">There are no specific limits on <i>(a)</i> volume and <i>(b)</i> duration of storage of hazardous materials to determine whether they have been discarded as waste. However, the long term storage of materials with little intention or certainty of future use, or that no use for the material other than disposal can be envisaged, may be an indication that the material has been discarded as waste.</p>
	<p pid=".1771W.0/5">Where hazardous materials have been discarded as waste, the Government have provided an exemption for the temporary storage of hazardous waste at the place of production in paragraph 41 of Schedule 3 of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994.

	<p pid=".1776W.10/1">The Department of Trade and Industry supplied the European Commission with information on the UK's national strategy on growth in the broadband and third-generation mobile sectors on 19 December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1776W.10/2">The UK was a late starter in relation to broadband, but with 3.2 million subscriptions to date and growing by some 40,000 per week the market is now exhibiting strong growth. Our target remains for the UK to have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005. We are already ahead of our European G7 neighbours in both the competitiveness and extensiveness of our broadband market.</p>

	<p pid=".1778W.2/1">Current price levels for domestic electricity supply by supplier are dependent on a number of factors, including the nature of the tariff which the customer has chosen; whether the customer is with their home supplier or has switched; how the customer chooses to make their payments (direct debit is usually cheaper than both standard credit and prepayment meter options); and on levels of consumption. Customers are able to make comparisons via the Energywatch website for tariffs in their own areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1778W.2/2">DTI conducts a survey of domestic electricity suppliers that collects data on their tariffs and customer numbers. This data is provided on the assurance that it will not be possible to identify individual companies from the results published. Therefore, average prices broken down by supplier cannot be provided, although regional averages can. These figures are used to produce average electricity comparisons for cities in the UK regions published in the Quarterly Energy Prices publication and on DTI's website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energyprices/index.shtml">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy prices/index.shtml</a>.

	<p pid=".1784W.9/3">The DDA will shortly be amended by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 (&quot;the 2003 Regulations&quot;) coming into force on 1 October 2004. These Regulations largely implement the requirements of the disability strand of the Employment Directive (Directive 2000/78/EC). Substantial amendments are made to Part 2 of the DDA and also in one area of Part 3, namely that of employment services. The 2003 Regulations do not, however, implement the Directive's requirements in relation to qualifications, vocational guidance and vocational training insofar as those requirements impact on areas covered by Part 4 of the DDA. Separate Regulations implementing the Directive in relation to Part 4 will be made by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in due course. Therefore, with regard to the 2003 Regulations, educational institutions, as providers of education, will not be affected by the changes which come into force on 1 October 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1784W.9/4">The DDA was amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (SENDA), which largely addresses the requirements of the Employment Directive in relation to vocational training in education institutions. The next amendment under SENDA, in relation to education, is not due for implementation until 2005 when a duty in further and higher education regarding 'premises' comes into force. At this point only the implementation of the DDA Part 3 affecting premises of service providers (but excluding education institutions) will remain. DfES will consult on any proposed changes needed to bring the Employment Directive fully into effect, but will not bring those amendments in before the final SENDA provisions are implemented in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1785W.2/1">Participation rates at constituency level are not held centrally. The available information on participation rates by Local Education Authority (LEA) is taken from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) and covers 18-year-old applicants who were accepted to full time undergraduate courses in the UK. Figures for the latest year are in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.2/2">Non-completion rates by student domicile are not calculated by the Department. The available information on non-completion rates by institution of study is published annually by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in the publication 'Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK', a copy of which is in the House Library.</p>

However, any migration, for whatever reason, at age 17 will affect the rates shown here, particularly between authorities that are geographically close, for example in the London area.Accepted applicants with unknown English domiciles are excluded from the figures.Population figures relate to persons aged 17 as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase> in the year prior to entry, counts taken at the following <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January</phrase>; accepted applicants are aged 18 at <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> in the year of entry.</p>

	<p pid=".1791W.3/1">The following table gives readily available details of items which have been 'gifted' under the strategies of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) since it was set up. To undertake further research would involve disproportionate costs. Gifting is taken as referring to items which have been donated by HMG to another Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1791W.3/2">The GCPP is intended to support the prevention, management and resolution of conflict, and post conflict reconstruction to help avoid the re-ignition of conflict at a later date. A range of activities are covered, for example: development of new governance and justice systems; disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of fighters into society and development of alternative livelihoods for them; training for police, armed forces and other parts of the security sector in democratic and accountable systems which respect human rights. Most GCPP funding is spent on consultancy and other non-capital support to these objectives. Related technical and other equipment is however sometimes supplied under Ministerially approved guidelines, where this supports an agreed conflict prevention strategy.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed many subjects with the Indian Government during his visit to India in February although the opportunity to raise this issue did not arise on this occasion. He has however raised it on many previous occasions and will continue to do so. But the Indians can be in no doubt of our commitment to human rights, including the right to freedom of religion. Most recently, on my visit to India in January this year I was able to raise human rights concerns with the Indian authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".1798W.6/32">1. The Weekly Benefit Savings (WBS) scheme recorded estimated savings from fraud detection. It is not possible to measure actual savings from fraud detection because it is not possible to know how long the overpayment would have continued for had if not been detected at that point in time. Estimated savings from the WBS scheme are therefore based on the assumption that the overpayment would have continued for 32 weeks had it not been detected.</p>

	<p pid=".1798W.6/34">3. Local Authority WBS rules were tightened during this period, and the fall in recorded savings may not reflect a fall in actual amounts detected.</p>
	<p pid=".1798W.6/35">4. For local authorities, the WBS scheme was replaced by the Security against Fraud and Error (SAFE) scheme in April 2002, with some local authorities joining in April 2001; therefore figures for WBS savings are not available for 2001&ndash;02 onwards. Like WBS, the SAFE scheme provides rewards for detected overpayments. However, it provides rewards for the detection of both fraud and claimant error overpayments.</p>

	<p pid=".1799W.2/1">In the event of employer insolvency, assistance is available to pension scheme members under the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Pension Schemes Act 1993. Under these Acts, insolvency payments are made from the National Insurance Fund (NIF) to qualifying former employees. Claims for unpaid employees' National Insurance contributions are limited to the actual amount deducted from wages during the twelve months prior to the date of insolvency. Unpaid employers' National Insurance contributions for the twelve-month period prior to the insolvency date are also payable, but are subject to monetary limits depending on the type of pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1799W.2/2">Assistance is also available under 'deemed buyback' provisions, introduced as part of the Pensions Act 1995. Under these provisions members of contracted-out occupational pension schemes can, in certain circumstances, have some, or all of their state scheme rights restored for the period that they were contracted-out.</p>
	<p pid=".1799W.2/3">Other statutory measures are in place to help safeguard the pensions that people have built up. The employer debt provisions ensure that any shortfall is treated as a debt due from the employer to the trustees of the scheme. Changes to the statutory priority order on wind-up, announced on 24 February, will help ensure a fairer distribution of the pension scheme assets between non-pensioner and pensioner scheme members.</p>
	<p pid=".1799W.2/4">We are also taking additional steps to protect members of defined benefit schemes. We are introducing the Pension Protection Fund, which will protect scheme members by paying compensation if their employer becomes insolvent and the pension scheme is underfunded. The Pension Protection Fund will significantly improve both protection for pension scheme members and confidence in pensions more generally. For the first time ever, individuals with defined-benefit with rights pension schemes can be assured that they will receive a meaningful level of compensation if their employer becomes insolvent and there are insufficient assets in the pension scheme to pay out the pensions promised.</p>
	<p pid=".1799W.2/5">We are also introducing a new Pensions Regulator with the flexibility and powers to take a targeted and proportionate approach to protecting the funds held in pension schemes.</p>

This means that a range of outcomes may be considered a success, from making contact with individuals or employers, linking individuals to the local Jobcentre and the benefits and services they provide; providing work focused training or other activity; as well as helping people into work.</p>

	<p pid=".1801W.2/1">Ethnic Minority Outreach has been designed and implemented to test new ways of engaging with communities and individuals who have had little or no contact with Jobcentre Plus and disproportionately high levels of unemployment. It is delivered by organisations that have demonstrated their knowledge of, and ability to work effectively with, ethnic minority communities, and uses new, innovative and community-based ways to help ethnic minority people overcome the barriers they face in the labour market. To January 2004, 9,268 people had started on the Ethnic Minority Outreach programme, with 1,664 starting work. The majority of those who joined the programme but have not yet found work are still participating, with some having joined mainstream Jobcentre Plus provision.</p>

	<p pid=".1809W.2/1">The application process for Pension Credit has been designed to be straightforward for pensioners and their family and friends, who may apply on their behalf. The Pension Credit application line (freephone 0800 99 1234), which is the main method of applying, is working well and has taken over 2.3 million calls (to the end of January) since it became operational on 7 April 2003. The Pension Service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances. Recent independent research, a summary of which is available in the Library, found high levels of customer satisfaction with the application line and with the application process overall. We continue to review and improve the application process in the light of experience, including improvements to make it easier for people with savings to provide the required information and documentary evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".1812W.12/2">To mark International Women's Day, I took part in the annual International Women's Day debate &quot;Women, Equality and Human Rights&quot; in the House of Commons on 4 March 2004. I attended and made the keynote speech at the &quot;LeicestHERday&quot; Annual Conference &quot;Women, Moving Forward&quot; (3 to 5 March 2004) which included discussion groups, seminars and workshops for women in business and the community. I also spoke at the International Women's Day reception at the Trade Union Council on 8 March 2004 and lent my support to the &quot;Funny Women&quot; comedy event held at Caf&eacute; de Paris on 8 March 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1813W.3/1">Since September 2001, the Starter Home Initiative (SHI) has been helping key workers into home ownership in areas where the high cost of housing serves to undermine recruitment and retention of skilled staff in our key public services. The SHI has been available in London and the South East region and in some housing hotspots in the East, South West and West Midlands regions. It has not been available to key workers in the North West region.</p>
	<p pid=".1813W.3/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not aware of an Abandoned Homes Initiative. However, our Market Renewal Pathfinders are a comprehensive programme to tackle low demand and abandonment in nine English areas, including Merseyside. The boundaries of the Merseyside scheme, which covers the southern part of the Sefton council district, but not Crosby, were drawn up following an analysis of local housing markets to identify those areas most acutely affected by low demand and abandonment. The integrated approach to spatial and economic issues being adopted by the pathfinders should bring substantial benefits to the wider sub-region.</p>

	<p pid=".1815W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has overall responsibility for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), one of the key Structural Funds&mdash;which deliver EU regional policy. Under the current round of programmes (until the end of 2006), the responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Structural Funds is delegated to the Government Offices in the regions.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.6/2">The Government's 2002 White Paper Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions (Cm.5511) set out our proposal that where elected regional assemblies are established they would take over the role currently performed by Government Offices for any Structural Fund expenditure for future programming periods.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.6/3">It is not possible at this stage to say which regions will have elected assemblies in 2007, nor what the outcome of Structural Fund reform will be. But as the White Paper made clear, the general approach for England&mdash;regional delivery within a clear national framework&mdash;will continue. This means that the management of replacement programmes, whether they involve European or domestic funds, will be devolved to regional or local level.</p>

Research commissioned by the English Tourism Council in 2001 suggested that the total amount of UK trips in the family tourism market would be unlikely to change significantly as a result of a six-year term, but that the tourism season would be more constant over an extended period. Spreading the benefit of domestic tourism more evenly through the year in this way would encourage the development of more sustainable tourism.</p>

	<p pid=".1827W.2/1">The National Clinical Assessment Authority (NCAA) was established to help the National Health Service manage performance concerns about doctors and dentists. For the majority of the NCAA's casework (about 75 per cent.), the average direct cost is estimated at around &pound;330 per case. A smaller proportion of cases (about 15 per cent.) require more detailed expert support of local case management, at an estimated average cost of between &pound;7,500 to &pound;8,500 per case. The estimated average cost of full clinical performance assessment is between &pound;22,400 and &pound;24,300 per case, depending on whether it is an hospital and community care or primary care case; full clinical performance assessment occurs in about only 10 per cent. of referrals made to the NCAA.</p>

Indications from other countries that have removed donor anonymity are that the initial drop is followed by a climb in donor numbers. To help increase public awareness we will support a public campaign and fund a national helpline for people who are interested in donating. The helpline will give information about donation and provide callers with a list of clinics so that they can decide which clinic is most convenient for them. Although the support we will provide will not do the actual recruitment for clinics, our intention is that it will raise awareness, create interest and provide essential information among those who may be eligible to donate.</p>
