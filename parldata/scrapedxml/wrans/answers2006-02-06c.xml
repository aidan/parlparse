	<p pid="c.763W.12/1">The Government assesses that the negative influence of warlords&quot; in Afghanistan's political process is gradually diminishing. Those who chose to embrace the new democratic process were required to cut all links with militia groups before putting themselves forward as candidates at the September 2005 parliamentary and provincial elections. Those who still remain outside the democratic process are finding their influence reduced by nation-wide disarmament programmes and the growing control exercised by centrally-appointed Provincial Governors and Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police forces. But this is a long process&mdash;democratic institutions, although now established, are fragile and the political process of resolving violent conflict will take time to have effect, though the Government of Afghanistan is determined to see it through.</p>

There is no right of abode on Ascension Island. Employees whose contracts end, and are not renewed, are required by law to leave the Island. We have no plans to change this. Those working on the Island are aware of these conditions when they are recruited. There is, therefore, no question of compensation. Almost all the individuals operating the approximately 15 small businesses on the Island are already employed by the main organisations based on Ascension, or the Ascension Island Administration, or are the spouses of these employees. They may therefore continue to remain on the Island as long as the relevant contracts last.</p>

My noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, wrote to Ascension Island Councillors on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase> to set out the Government's policy. There is no right of abode on Ascension Island. Employees whose contracts end, and are not renewed, are required by law to leave the Island. Those working on the Island are aware of these conditions when they are recruited. There is, therefore, no question of compensation.</p>

All UK reconstruction programmes are monitored continuously, and where we have had any financial or management concerns we have taken action to address them.</p>

	<p pid="c.774W.9/2">Freedom of expression is a fundamental right and recognised under international law. It is also vital to the development of a modern society. Both bilaterally and alongside our EU partners we reminded the Kazakh Government throughout 2005 that the credibility of their bid for the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 2009 rests on the soundness of their commitment to continue political reforms and comply fully with all OSCE undertakings and standards, which include those on freedom of expression. On 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November 2005</phrase> the UK as presidency of the EU, issued statements expressing deep concern about reported harassment of opposition parties and restrictions on freedom of the media, particularly with regard to printing and distribution and circulation seizures of independent newspapers during the presidential election campaign. These concerns were reflected again in the EU presidency statement which the UK issued immediately following the presidential elections in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.9/3">Kazakhstan's ratification of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in December 2005 and the release of opposition leader Galymzhan Zhakianov in January 2006 are two recent positive steps taken by the Kazakh authorities in relation to due process and freedom of expression. The EU OSCE statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase> welcoming his release reiterated calls for Kazakhstan to respect its international commitments on ensuring freedom of expression.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.9/4">When he met Foreign Minister Tokayev following the presentation of his credentials on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January</phrase>, our newly accredited ambassador to Kazakhstan, Paul Brummell, assured the Foreign Minister of the readiness of the British Government to work with Kazakhstan to promote the human rights agenda across its whole spectrum. In the current financial year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has invested approximately &pound;20,000 in projects relating to freedom of expression, including legal support for independent media, the introduction of jury trials and training of judges.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.9/5">We will continue to raise, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, the importance of freedom of expression in Kazakhstan and look for opportunities to provide suitable assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.2/1">The UK has made repeated statements deploring human rights violations by both the Nepalese security forces and the Maoists. We have been deeply troubled by the Maoists' decision to end their ceasefire and by their return to violence. In January 2006 the Maoists carried out over 40 bomb attacks, 350 kidnappings, and engaged in 70 clashes with security forces. This has resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries amongst the royal Nepalese Army, the police and civilians. We have also been gravely concerned by human rights abuses carried out by the security forces and by the Government's infringements of civil liberties and democratic freedoms, and by the arrest of a large number of political party leaders and activists.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/2">In response to events in January, the UK has joined the EU in issuing a statement available at:</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/3" class="indent">http://www.eu2006.at/en/News/CFSP_Statements/January/2701Nepal.html</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/4">in which we said:</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/5" class="indent">The EU strongly condemns the use of force to suppress the Nepalese people's exercise of fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The EU calls upon the King, the Government of Nepal and the Security Forces to immediately restore all political and civil liberties in accordance with Nepal's international obligations, immediately release all political prisoners and human rights defenders, and ensure that political and civil rights, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, can be exercised peacefully. The EU strongly condemns the resumption of Maoist violence, including the recent murder of an election candidate. The EU underlines the obligation of all parties to fully respect international humanitarian law, including by way of protecting civilians and facilitating the access of humanitarian organisations seeking to aid affected persons.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.5/1">The UK does not support or plan to support any Nepalese human rights agencies or aid organisations in India or the UK to assist the restoration of constitutional democracy in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/2">However, the UK has supported a number of civil society and human rights organisations in Nepal on a wide range of issues for several years. As part of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) Nepal strategy, the UK has funded several local and international organisations since 2002. These have included the Nepalese National Human Rights Commission and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The largest single contribution to any such organisation has been to the UN human rights monitoring operation under the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to which we have contributed over &pound;800,000. The GCPP also funds the Nepalese human rights non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Advocacy Forum. The Embassy's Small Grants Scheme also funds a number of small indigenous NGO groups. Our assessment is that we will continue to need to strengthen civil society and human rights organisations for the foreseeable future and we are intending to maintain our support under the GCPP.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not fund any aid organisations but the Department for International Development runs a bilateral aid programme to Nepal worth &pound;36 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="c.778W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.778W.8/2">Funding for infrastructure development features prominently in both DFID and EU programmes to support the Overseas Territories. We have worked closely with the EU on a number of projects. Notable recent examples include new airports on Montserrat, Anguilla and Grand Turk and road infrastructure on Providenciales. DFID is also providing funding for an airport on St Helena to maintain access after the island's passenger and supply ship reaches the end of her working life in 2010. On Pitcairn, work to pave the Hill of Difficulty, the only access road from the harbour to the main settlement of Adamstown, and make essential repairs to the jetty and slipway was completed during 2005. In addition we are planning to fund jointly with the EU repairs to the harbour wall on Tristan da Cunha and the construction of a breakwater on Pitcairn.</p>
	<p pid="c.778W.8/3">DFID's programmes focus on those countries which still need development assistance along the path to self-sufficiency. We would normally look to the wealthier Overseas Territories to finance their priorities for capital expenditure from their own resources, including under normal commercial borrowing terms. The EU also largely focuses its development programmes on those Overseas Countries and Territories (OTC)s whose economic development is least advanced. Similarly, we would not expect EU grant funding for infrastructure to be available for those OCTs with ready access to commercial borrowing.</p>

	<p pid="c.779W.2/1">A Department for International Development (DFID) commissioned report by the Tyndall Centre called the Impacts of Global Climate Change on the UK Overseas Territories (OTs) found that long-term weather characteristics are likely to change. It concluded that regional warming in the Caribbean could be as much as 6 degrees by 2100, and slightly less in the South Atlantic and Pitcairn.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/2">The report identified common areas of concern as many OTs share similar characteristics. In particular, many are islands with populations reliant on a fragile natural resource base. The effects of climate change include severe tropical storms and hurricanes in the Caribbean and likely increases in the severity and frequency of low rainfall events and droughts in all areas. Global sea level rise is now projected to be as much as 0.9 meters by 2100 and in the medium-term raised sea levels will exacerbate the effects of more severe storms, directly affecting coastal infrastructure and tourism.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published the book 'Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'. Although not specifically directed at the impacts of climate change on OTs, the book discusses many of the potential impacts that OTs can expect to see in the future, such as degradation of marine ecosystems and increases in global sea levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/4">As the international community makes efforts to tackle this global problem, the UK is keen to raise awareness in OTs of the impacts of climate change on their societies. For this reason the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and DEFRA have been working together to encourage OTs to be part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The UK will build on this and share its knowledge and experiences through the UN's Inter-Governmental Panel Working Group looking at impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.</p>

	<p pid="c.780W.5/1">The precise constitutional arrangements for policing and internal security differ from Territory to Territory. But a common thread is that law and order is, rightly, a matter of concern for the whole community. Governors routinely discuss matters relating to internal security, including policing, with their Territory's Government. It is the Territories' Government that apportions resources for the staffing and operations of the range of government activities, including policing. The Overseas Territories Law Enforcement Adviser, based in Miami, and other experts as appropriate, provide professional advice to Overseas Territories Governments and law enforcement agencies when necessary.</p>

	<p pid="c.784W.2/1">The Government's efforts to counter the threat of international terrorism must, by their nature, involve a degree of confidentiality. If we are successfully to detect and disrupt terrorist plans and activity, we must protect our sources and methods. We must also protect our counter-terrorism, and wider intelligence, relationships with key allies, including the United States, which are essential to the security of our citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/2">At the same time, any Government in a democratic society should be as open as it can be without jeopardising security. This principle guides our counter-terrorism policy. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office Human Rights Report of 2005 made clear our view that respect for human rights is vital, not least for long-term success in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/3">Over the last few weeks, the Government have been as open as possible with the House. Ministers have given a number of oral and written answers to hon. and right hon. Members in connection with extraordinary rendition&quot;. I have also responded to letters from hon. and right hon. Members, and issued two written ministerial statements. I have informed and updated the House as far as possible within the constraints described above, I shall continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/4">There is a great deal of information on the work of the intelligence and security agencies which cannot be divulged publicly. Because of this, and other special circumstances relating to the work of the agencies, Parliament established the Intelligence and Security Committee; much information is provided to this committee in confidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/5">We have no evidence that the United States Government has rendered any detainee through UK territory or airspace (including the overseas territories) during the present United States Administration (i.e. since January 2001), and we are clear that it would not do so without our permission.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/6">US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's statement of <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase> made clear that the US Government has for decades rendered terrorist suspects from one country to another, and set out the basis on which it does so. Except in so far as UK responsibilities or obligations are engaged by such renditions (for example, because a detainee passes through UK territory), this is not a matter for the UK Government. Like any other country, the UK can only be responsible for compliance with its own legal obligations and responsibilities. My written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-20">20 January</phrase> summarised what we know of renditions through UK territory or airspace since May 1997. It is a matter of public record that a number of UK citizens, and non-UK citizens formerly resident in the UK, have been transferred to Guantanamo Bay (whence all the UK citizens have since been returned to the UK). We are not aware that any other UK citizens have been the subject of an international rendition since 1995. Given the open nature of our society, however, with huge flows of foreigners into and out of the UK, we cannot be sure whether any other non-UK citizens formerly resident in the UK have subsequently been the subject of international rendition.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/7">It is also a matter of public record that the US Government has operated facilities in which terrorist suspects may be detained and questioned in Afghanistan since 2001, at Guantanamo Bay since 2002 and in Iraq since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/8">I have today placed in the Library of the House a copy of my reply to a letter from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.788W.2/1">DFID Kenya supported the World Bank's Reform and Capacity Building Project loan which is focused on public financial management reform and public sector reform. DFID has been closely involved in the design and development of the programme and are supporting complementary public financial management and public sector reform work.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.2/2">High-level corruption has long been a feature of Kenyan life and the World Bank and DFID remain very concerned, particularly about the recent corruption allegations by the exiled former anti-corruption official, John Githongo. President Kibaki's Government was elected in 2002 on a zero-tolerance of corruption ticket. It is for Kenyans to decide whether they have lived up to this promise. It is for us to decide whether our assistance can be effective in bringing this about.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.2/3">Mr. Githongo's report is serious and credible. The Kenyan Government now have a unique opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to implement the recently announced ethical code for Ministers. Swift and determined actions by Ministers and others named in the report would send an important signal of commitment to fighting corruption to the people of Kenya, private investors, and the international community. For example, the unprecedented resignation of the Minister of Finance on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase>, will allow the allegations against him and his Ministry to be fully investigated.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.2/4">Mr. Wolfowitz has made it very clear to me that he has raised the bar for project approval in corrupt environments. The World Bank has an integrity team looking at their entire portfolio in Kenya. Like us, the World Bank will not go ahead with any project until they are satisfied that the environment is acceptable and that they can account for the funds. Consequently they have decided to delay their support to projects planned in HIV/AIDS, roads, education, and the financial sector, where some concerns are still to be resolved. Clearly the environment is not yet right for their direct budget support either.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.2/5">At the same time, the international community cannot just call for the highest standards from the sidelines. We have a duty to help the Government of Kenya and the Kenyan people to improve accounting systems to reduce the opportunities for misuse and corruption. The World Bank loan aims specifically to strengthen the very systems that underpin clean and efficient government; transparent, accountable, and responsive budgetary systems and effective public service. Supporting Government systems that reduce the opportunities for corruption is the only way to ensure that all Government of Kenya spending through this and future administrations delivers for its people.</p>

Other forms of DFID assistance to the Palestinian people are channelled through organisations whose accounts are independently audited. All trust fund donors, including the UK, decided in December 2005 to hold back budget support payments due to the Palestinian Authority following the failure of the Palestinian administration at the time to meet agreed benchmarks, notably on pension reforms, the wage bill and external audit.</p>

	<p pid="c.790W.0/1">The UK uses every opportunity to promote the scaling up of comprehensive and evidence based HIV programming. We know that unprotected sex is the most common cause of infection, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide less than one in five people have access to basic HIV prevention services (including sexual and reproductive health services). This prevention gap&quot; is fuelling the spread of HIV. Improving access to a comprehensive range of effective HIV prevention information, services and supplies including sex education for young people and condoms for all those who are sexually active, is therefore important and this is what our programmes supports.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/2">The UK led the support for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) prevention policy Intensifying HIV prevention&quot; at its June 2005 Programme Coordination Board, which I attended. This policy clearly emphasises the importance of evidence-informed prevention and we took the opportunity in negotiating and agreeing this policy to engage in dialogue with UN partners, European Governments, the US Administration and other donor Governments on the importance of comprehensive sexuality education, linking sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and HIV programmes and access to SRH supplies including female condoms.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/3">Building on this, as EU president, we steered and secured agreement on the first EU wide policy Statement on HIV Prevention launched on World AIDS day 2005. This affirms the commitment of all 25 European member states to comprehensive and evidence based HIV prevention programming including:</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/4" class="indent">Universal access to SRH health information and services</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/5" class="indent">Reliable access to essential SRH supplies including condoms</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/6" class="indent">Universal access to education and life skills and sexuality education</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/7" class="indent">Action to confront and address gender-based violence</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/8">We are co-chairing the Universal Access steering group with UNAIDS. This group is helping to ensure that the commitments made at Gleneagles and at the World Summit to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care with the aim of as close as possible to universal access to treatment for all those who need it by 2010 are turned into action. Within this process we continue to emphasise the importance of integrating comprehensive SRH information, services and supplies, including female and male condoms, and sex and sexuality education&mdash;into HIV programming.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/9">We believe that SRH services should play a more effective role in efforts to prevent HIV, but recognise that more resources are needed to do this. DFID has recently commissioned some work to explore how the way we work helps or hinders the linkages between HIV and SRH policy, programming and funding arrangements. The forthcoming United Nations Special Session (UNGASS) in June 2006 will be an important opportunity to highlight the importance of SRH to HIV programming.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.0/10">The US does have different policies from the UK in a number of areas related to international development. This is particularly so in HIV prevention and SRH. We have, for example, different positions on issues promoting sexual abstinence and ensuring availability of safe abortion services as well as access to clean needles and syringes as harm reduction measures. There has been discussion of these differences in global and bilateral meetings. We will continue our dialogue with the UN, European Governments, the US Administration and other donors; but we will, as we always have, continue to work with US colleagues to promote country-led evidence-based and effective approaches to tackling the HIV epidemic and we will continue to promote the importance of access to a full range of sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies.</p>

	<p pid="c.791W.2/1">In 2004&ndash;05, DFID's bilateral expenditure on projects which were targeting effective reproductive health services was &pound;194 million. This figure is reported in the document entitled 'Statistics on International Development' (SID) 2005 (Table 20), (which is available in the Libraries of the House) and reflects all projects that were recorded as having a primary or significant focus on effective reproductive health services. It should be noted that some of these projects will also have had a primary or significant focus on other areas such as education or health systems development.</p>
	<p pid="c.791W.2/2">DFID's overall bilateral spend on reproductive health services is likely to be in excess of &pound;194 million, as further money has been spent on reproductive health by multilateral agencies supported by the UK such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organisation, and by partner governments receiving Poverty Reduction Budget Support&quot; (PRBS) from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.791W.2/3">The expenditure figure for all projects that were shown against the tackling HIV and AIDS marker as having a primary or significant focus is also given in SID (Table 20). However, this does not represent DFID's total bilateral expenditure on HIV and AIDS. A methodology for calculating total expenditure on HIV and AIDS related projects has been developed. Figures for HIV and AIDS expenditure in 2004&ndash;05 using this methodology will be available soon.</p>
	<p pid="c.791W.2/4">When referring to SID table 20 on DFID expenditure it is important to note that data for different markers cannot be added together. This is to avoid double counting of expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="c.792W.2/1">A study by the National Audit Office of DFID's provision of humanitarian assistance following the tsunami is due to report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.2/2">The initial report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition found that the relief phase was effective in meeting the immediate survival needs of those affected by the disaster. It also found that the speed with which money was donated and the unprecedented scale of funding allowed an early shift from immediate relief assistance to longer-term recovery. The report highlighted the need for better co-ordination of assistance and improved needs assessment in future disaster response.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.2/3">An independent evaluation, commissioned by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) on behalf its member agencies showed that there was rapid and extensive provision of appropriate relief and sensitivity to marginalised groups. Beneficiary surveys show a high level of satisfaction with initial relief work. The report concluded that overall the DEC agencies did a good job. However, there was a need for better co-ordination and greater accountability to beneficiaries.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.2/4">The World Disasters Report also highlighted weak co-ordination between humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the response. The Indian Ocean disaster was exceptional in that large numbers of international NGOs were deployed to affected countries and with greater funding than previously experienced.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.2/5">DFID has also been monitoring its response to the Indian Ocean Disaster. A report will be placed in the Library and published on the DFID website in February 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.792W.8/1">There are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance in Darfur. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.8/2">Recent assessments indicate a major improvement in nutrition in Darfur with malnutrition rates almost half what they were in the previous year. Likewise the recent WHO Darfur survey showed mortality rates have, in cases, reduced by two-thirds since August 2004. These improvements are due to the massive scale of the humanitarian effort.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.8/3">The UK is the second largest bilateral humanitarian donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since September 2003. These funds have meant that hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care.</p>
	<p pid="c.792W.8/4">However, the situation still remains extremely fragile. We are particularly concerned about the impact that deteriorating security is having on humanitarian operations, especially in South and West Darfur. If aid were reduced because of conflict, insecurity or funding shortages, the humanitarian situation would deteriorate very quickly. We are taking every opportunity to call for an improvement in security and to press for a negotiated political agreement in Abuja.</p>

In the whole of the London borough of Wandsworth, 36,000 people aged 60 or older were eligible. However, the take-up of concessionary travel in the constituency or the borough is not known. In London as a whole, the take-up rate of concessionary travel permits was 85 per cent. in 2004, the most recent year's data available.</p>

Registration is compulsory after certain specific events, for example, a sale of land or a transfer on death. Land Registry cannot otherwise compel registration but has a long term strategy of working towards a comprehensive register by persuading landowners of the benefits of voluntarily registering their holdings.</p>

	<p pid="c.815W.8/19">A complaint may be made by any party in a criminal case or by a member of the public with no direct involvement in proceedings. Complaints may relate to a range of issues including the performance of one or more of the agencies involved or to matters of general policy. Therefore, it is not possible for the CPS to divide complaints into those upheld, those rejected, and those where redress was offered.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.8/20">When responding to complainants, the CPS seeks to explain its role in criminal proceedings, the principles on which its decisions are based and, where there has been an admitted error, what steps it will take to ensure that the error will not happen again. However, it may not be appropriate to enter into a discussion of the evidence in particular cases, particularly with complainants who are not directly involved in a case.</p>

	<p pid="c.824W.2/2">Subsequently, we also announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January</phrase>, that we will be co-operating with France during the CVF demonstration phase to produce a common baseline design that both countries can further use to develop their own carriers. This will bring savings in design costs, without slowing the tempo of the project and offers the potential of savings on shared procurements. France will make a financial contribution in recognition of the investment UK has already made in the design (comprising &pound;30 million now and &pound;25 million in July with a further &pound;45 million at the end of the demonstration phase if France decides to commit to manufacture) and will contribute one third of the demonstration phase costs of the common baseline design. France's role has been mutually agreed as one of influence rather than control, and as such they will not be able to direct changes to the design or programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.825W.3/1">In 2001 a review of the capability provided by the HELEN laser identified a requirement to replace it in order to attain, under laboratory conditions, previously inaccessible temperature and pressure regimes akin to those actually obtained in a nuclear weapon. This was deemed essential to underwrite the continued safety and reliability of the Trident nuclear warhead stockpile in the nuclear test ban era.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.3/2">Accordingly, we shall be replacing HELEN&mdash;which has given 25 years of useful service&mdash;with the ORION laser, whose primary role will be to enable the safety and reliability of the Trident stockpile to be underwritten through the remainder of its service life. Until its planned decommissioning in 2008, HELEN will continue to be used for worthwhile experiments both in support of Trident and as a test bed for some of the technologies and equipment to be used on the ORION laser.</p>

	<p pid="c.832W.5/1">Rest and Recuperation (R and R) provides service personnel, on mentally and challenging deployments, a respite from a stressful operational environment in order to sustain their operational effectiveness. R and R should not, therefore, be considered as compensation for separation from family and friends. Post Operational Leave (POL) exists to meet this requirement (the entitlement to POL does begin on the day that service personnel leave their permanent duty station). Depending on the exigencies of service, the operational chain of command will authorise the time, location and duration of any period of R and R, basing their decisions on published guidelines. We have recently carried out a review of all leave and absence types in the light of the advent of the new tri-service joint personnel administration (JPA) system, which will roll out on a single-service basis throughout 2006. It was not considered appropriate for the qualifying period of deployment for R and R to begin before personnel arrive in theatre.</p>

A force element represents a fully capable aircraft available for immediate operational tasking. The actual number of aircraft that would be deployed at any one time would, however, be greater than the figures in Table B in order to provide a margin to take into account reliability and serviceability requirements and operational factors.</p>

	<p pid="c.833W.8/1">No Royal Navy vessels were using military sonar in the vicinity of the Thames estuary or the mouth of the Thames on either 19 or 20 of January.</p>
	<p pid="c.833W.8/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes its responsibilities for the environment very seriously. However, there continues to be a vital requirement for the United Kingdom to maintain a maritime capability to protect crucial lines of communication, to participate in operational activities and to be able to address potential mine and submarine threats, now and in the future. To ensure that our military capabilities in these areas are fully maintained, it is imperative that we continue to use active sonar, both now and in the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="c.833W.8/3">Furthermore, sonar is essential to protect UK waters and ensure safe navigation. That said, this certainly does not imply that our sonar activities are undertaken without the fullest possible respect for the environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.833W.8/4">Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are undertaken for a wide range of our activities in the marine environment, including sonar. Such EIAs cover the marine habitat of the operating area concerned and the species likely to be encountered. The EIAs are used to better tailor the activity and ensure that potentially damaging effects are identified during the planning stage of the exercise and reduced their impact to an absolute minimum. With the same aim in view, we have also issued instructions to all our ships' Commanding Officers for the operational use of sonar in the marine environment. This guidance employs the precautionary principle of 'Plan, Look, Listen and Act'.</p>
	<p pid="c.833W.8/5">While we believe that our operating procedures reflect the best scientific advice and provide a sustainable balance between the need for effective military training and the need to protect our marine environment, we are certainly not complacent. The MOD continues to be closely involved in research, in the UK, with the US and NATO authorities, and in other international forums into the possible effects of sonar noise on marine life. Should any new research provide evidence of a link between our method of using sonar and a detrimental effect on marine life, we would, of course, consider what further mitigation measures might be possible. In the meantime, the current measures reflect the best scientific advice available.</p>

	<p pid="c.842W.2/1">The definition of regulated entertainment, and exemptions to it, are set out in schedule 1 of the Licensing Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.2/2">We currently have no plans to introduce any further exemptions. The fact that an event is being held for charity does not make it inherently less of a risk to the licensing objectives. Exemptions for charitable events were debated at length during the passage of the Licensing Bill. The temporary event notice regime is very light touch in order to reflect the reduced risk at such small, time limited events and requires no more than a temporary event notice to be submitted to the licensing authority and the police at least 10 working days before the event is due to take place. The fee for giving a notice is set at &pound;21, a level which is sufficient to recover the costs of the regime to licensing authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.843W.8/1">A report entitled 'Implications for noise disturbance arising from liberalisation of Licensing Laws' was produced for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by MCM Research Ltd. and published in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.843W.8/2">The principal aim of the study was to assess the potential impacts of the reform of the licensing laws on noise disturbance related, directly or indirectly, to the operation of licensed premises.

	<p pid="c.843W.8/3">It is too early to assess the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on noise, and so the Government have not conducted or commissioned any formal research. However, any issues around noise are likely to emerge from the Scrutiny Council process. We are working closely with a sample of local authorities to monitor delivery of the 2003 Act and assess the extent to which strategic aims are being achieved. This in turn is part of a wider monitoring and evaluation exercise to assess the practical implementation of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="c.850W.0/1">The Government Communication Group (GCG) and the Government Communication Network (GCN) were set up in 2005 as part of implementing the recommendations of the independent Phillis Review of government communications.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.0/2">The GCG is a small strategic team within the Cabinet Office, headed by the Permanent Secretary Government Communication.

In April 2005 the GNN was transferred back to COI to enable the delivery of a more strategic and coordinated communications function in the regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.0/5">Apart from these GNN moves, COI created a Client Account Team on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> to provide a more focused approach to overall client needs and policy themes and to facilitate cross-departmental communication activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.0/6">Some specialist publishing activities were transferred to COI from the Home Office (September 2004), the Department of Health (October 2004) and NHS Estates (September 2005) in order to reduce duplication across government, in line with the Gershon agenda.</p>

	<p pid="c.858W.5/1">Our strategy for tackling benefit fraud was published in Reducing Fraud in the Benefit System: Achievements and Ambitions&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-13">13 October 2005</phrase>. Copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.858W.5/2">Since 1997, we have reduced fraud in income support and jobseeker's allowance by nearly two thirds. We now estimate that we lose around &pound;0.9 billion to fraud each year&mdash;under 1 per cent. of total benefit expenditure, and the lowest estimated levels ever recorded. However, we realise that there is more to do and will continue to drive this down further.</p>

	<p pid="c.858W.8/4" class="indent">When a customer calls a Jobcentre Plus contact centre to make a claim for benefit, their call is either answered immediately or is placed in a queue until either their call is answered or they choose to abandon the call.

We do know however that customers make the choice to abandon their call and that Jobcentre Plus does not terminate calls. I suspect that customers may abandon calls because of domestic interruptions or simply that they do not wait for even a short time to speak to an adviser.</p>

	<p pid="c.860W.2/1">The Pension Service International Pension Centre applies the normal departmental security rules and law to prevent both external and internal fraud and abuse. It has recently upgraded its telephony systems to improve the level of service to customers overseas. Work in the centre has now been organised by country. This is to ensure there are specialist areas covering the European Union, countries with which the Department has Reciprocal Agreements and countries where non-uprated pensions are paid.</p>
	<p pid="c.860W.2/2">In addition The Pension Service has a team of specialists who determine if marriages and divorces that take place under foreign legislation meet the requirements of UK Social Security legislation and we carry out a programme of certification to ensure that benefit payments continue to be appropriate. There is also technology in place that allows us to authenticate foreign documents.</p>
	<p pid="c.860W.2/3">The Pension Service has achieved direct payment into bank accounts for over 97 per cent. of residents where it is possible to pay benefits via the BACS system.</p>
	<p pid="c.860W.2/4">Following a comparison with the Dutch System The Pension Service is implementing a new approach to programme protection work based on the amount of expenditure, the number of residents and age of residents by country.</p>
	<p pid="c.860W.2/5">Other benefits administered by the Department for Work and Pensions, for non United Kingdom residents are entirely dependant on the entitlement conditions for each individual benefit. These conditions may be modified for EU nationals moving within the EU by the EU Regulations on Social Security for Migrant Workers and in other cases by reciprocal social security agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.862W.3/5">In the quarter to December 2005, the latest period for which figures are available, just over 400,000 cases were in receipt of maintenance via the Agency's collection service or had a Maintenance Direct arrangement in place. This equates to over half a million children.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.3/6">The table attached breaks down this figure with respect to cases under the old and new schemes across both the old and new child support IT systems according to whether or not a case is on the collection service, or has a maintenance direct arrangement in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.862W.3/20">1. Numbers above exclude old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment in place, as well as new scheme cases being progressed clerically.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.3/21">2. Old scheme child supports cases a largely processed on the old IT system, but are also processed on the new IT system where they have been migrated due to links with new scheme applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.3/22">3. Maintenance Direct cases are those in which the Agency has carried out a maintenance calculation or assessment, and the non resident parent has subsequently agreed to pay the parent with care directly. There will then be no further involvement from the Agency unless requested by either party (for example in the event of a change of circumstances requiring recalculation or non compliance by the non resident parent). The existence of such an arrangement does not guarantee that payment of maintenance occurs, as it could cease upon mutual agreement of both parties without the Agency being informed.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.3/23">4. A case is counted as having been compliant on the Agency collection service if it is open at the end of December, and any money has been both requested and received via the Agency's collection service in the preceding three months.</p>

	<p pid="c.863W.5/5" class="indent">The legislation to disqualify non-resident parents from holding or obtaining a driving licence came into effect in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.863W.5/6" class="indent">The Child Support Agency does not have the power to withdraw the driving licences of non-compliant non-resident parents, this is a decision which may be made by the courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.863W.5/7" class="indent">Once all possible means of civil recovery of the debt have been exhausted the Secretary of State will make application to the courts for non-resident parents to be committed to prison or disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence. If the non-resident parent is found guilty of wilful refusal or culpable neglect, it is the court who will decide which of the sanctions available is the most appropriate. The table below therefore details the number of non-resident parents who have had their driving licences withdrawn by the courts and the number of non-resident parents who have received a suspended withdrawal sentence and additionally those who have received suspended and actual committal sentences.</p>

	<p pid="c.863W.5/21">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.863W.5/22">1. The fact that the number of suspensions and actual penalties is less than half the number of referrals is explained by the number of debtors who enter into agreements to pay rather than attend court. Similarly, only a very small number of debtors actually go to prison or lose their driving licences, in our experience, because the courts normally seek to suspend a sentence on condition that the defendant commits to pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.863W.5/23">2. We do not have accurate data for the number of cases referred to court for the periods 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03.</p>

Call Manager improved the telephony system by routing customer calls more quickly and effectively.

It concluded that although most studies estimate that disability living allowance and attendance allowance are not sufficient to meet all the extra costs of disability, they have produced no clear and robust evidence on the actual size of those costs in relation to benefit levels. All of the different approaches so far adopted by researchers are methodologically and conceptually difficult and have produced widely differing results. Some have also tended not to take account of the full range of statutory services and benefits available to help meet the needs and costs associated with disability, amongst which disability living allowance and attendance allowance make a non-income-related and tax-free contribution of around &pound;12.5 billion a year towards the disability related extra costs of over 4 million disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="c.870W.0/1">I have asked officials to carry out a review of our Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme. As the scheme was introduced in 1948, we need to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of our modern society. While I expect officials to look at all aspects of the scheme, we have not yet looked in any detail at any particular component and have not made any assessment of the costs and benefits of transferring responsibility for industrial injury compensation to employers. We will, however, be looking at all options for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.870W.0/2">We intend to publish a discussion document later this year when we will engage fully with stakeholders and other interested parties.</p>

	<p pid="c.872W.2/13" class="indent">People for whom English is a second language (ESOL) also have access to work focused provision through our Work Based Learning for Adults programme and the New Deal. These ESOL programmes provide full-time help for up to 26 weeks, 780 learning hours (26 weeks at 30 hours a week). Participants follow a varied and innovative approach to learning and are encouraged to take part in project work and work placements to consolidate their learning, which is designed to improve skills by at least one level.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/14" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus also has a range of support and labour market advice for those customers receiving Incapacity benefits. This is available to a range of customers with health conditions and disabilities including those with learning difficulties and chronic physical and mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/15" class="indent">A key, new, element of our service are the Pathways to Work Pilots, which are currently operating in 11 Jobcentre Plus Districts. Specialist advisers are given enhanced interviewing skills to enable them to deal specifically with this customer group. Pathways to Work have also introduced a more intensive mandatory regime of work-focused interviews for all new Incapacity benefit customers, with access to a wider range of support. IB customers with the most severe conditions are not expected to take part in the full Pathways regime but can volunteer to participate. The support includes a Choices Package, which includes the Condition Management Programme (CMP) delivered through a partnership between Jobcentre Plus and the NHS. The CMP is delivered by health professionals and has been designed to help people better understand and cope with their health condition. Through these pilots we are engaging significantly greater numbers of customers and substantially improving their prospects for work.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/16" class="indent">Incapacity Benefit Personal Advisers (IBPAs) have been introduced into all Jobcentre Plus offices. The aim of the IBPA is to provide support to customers in receipt of Incapacity Benefit move closer to the labour market and into sustainable employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/17" class="indent">Additionally, more specialist support is available via the Disability Employment Adviser (DEA) who works closely with employers, employees and customers with a health condition or disability, offering advice and practical support to enable the person find and sustain employment. DEAs are also a route for obtaining support through the specialist programmes provided by Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/18" class="indent">There are a number of programmes that are specifically designed to help people with a disability or health condition return to work:</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/19" class="indent">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme, which provides practical advice and support to help disabled people enter or stay in paid employment;</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/20" class="indent">Work Preparation is an individually tailored, work-focused programme that enables disabled people to address barriers associated with their disability and prepare for working with the confidence necessary to achieve and sustain their job goal;</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.2/21" class="indent">WORKSTEP provides support in jobs for disabled people who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping work but who, with the right support, can work effectively and develop in their job.

	<p pid="c.872W.2/22" class="indent">people with a disability or health condition may also receive help through the New Deal for Disabled People programme. NDDP is a voluntary programme which gives customers on qualifying disability or health-related benefits in England, Scotland and Wales access to a network of Job Brokers.

We are, however, presently introducing a new centralised computerised appointments booking process in order to reduce the time it takes for customers to receive a National Insurance number. We are implementing this new process on a phased timetable. This means that at the moment two systems are in operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.8/5" class="indent">The new process introduces the use of a national contact centre with a single 0845 number for customers wishing to book an interview to apply for a National Insurance number. Appointments for interviews are made and confirmation of the appointment is sent to the customer immediately. Evaluation in those regions where this new process has been implemented has shown that 97% of all calls are answered, of which 92% of calls are answered within 20 seconds. The average speed of answer is 8 seconds.</p>
	<p pid="c.875W.8/6" class="indent">This new system will be introduced shortly in your constituency. In the meantime, customers in Shropshire needing a National Insurance number should contact the Jobcentre Plus office at Telford, using the dedicated telephone number.</p>

	<p pid="c.877W.2/1">The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) that accompanied the Pensions Bill 2004 addressed the effect of the pension protection levy on businesses, and was agreed by Parliament when the Bill was passed.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.2/2">The RIA specifically considered the impact on businesses with fewer than 50 employees. It identified that impact on small businesses (i.e. those with fewer than 50 employees) will be limited overall by the fact that few such businesses run defined benefit pension schemes, and so are unlikely to be affected by the pension protection levy. The RIA estimates that less than 2.2 per cent. of the total cost of the Pension Protection Fund would be met by small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.877W.2/3">Responsibility for consulting on and setting the level of the pension protection levy rests with the board of the Pension Protection Fund. Following 17 weeks of consultation two consultation documents were produced plus one update. The aim was to strike a balance between affordability and security. Representatives from small business were consulted as part of the process. This all resulted in a report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase>, including an estimate of the pension protection levy amount. This is available on the Pension Protection Fund's website.</p>

	<p pid="c.878W.2/19">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/20">1. A winding up scheme is one which has notified the Pensions Regulator (or its predecessor the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority) that it has commenced winding up procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/21">2. A wound up scheme is one which has notified the Pensions Regulator (or its predecessor the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority) that it has completed winding up procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/22">3. Schemes are required to notify the Pensions Regulator of changes in scheme status as soon as is reasonably practical. This means that the data for the year ended <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> is provisional.</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/23">4. The figures are based on information held on the register as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-11">11 January 2006</phrase>. The effective date for the scheme status is based on the last scheme status change date.</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/24">5. Figures for 1997&ndash;98 commence on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-02">2 April 1997</phrase> because, where a scheme commenced or completed winding up procedures prior to <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> but the exact date cannot be ascertained, a default value of <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> is used as the date on which the scheme commenced or completed winding up procedures. As a result a very large number of schemes are recorded as having commenced or completed winding up procedures with a scheme status change date of <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase>, even if they had commenced or completed winding up procedures at some earlier date. Including schemes with this default date in the table would significantly overstate the number of schemes that commenced or completed winding up procedures during 1997, so a start date of <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April</phrase> has been used for 1997&ndash;98.</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/25">6. Total membership includes active, deferred and pensioner members. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of these numbers.</p>
	<p pid="c.878W.2/26">7. During 2005&ndash;06 the Pensions Regulator will continue with its plans to issue all occupational pension schemes that are registered in the UK a scheme return form. This will provide the Pension Regulator with access to enhanced data in future years.</p>

	<p pid="c.879W.3/2">New welfare in transport rules take effect in January 2007 under EC Regulation 1/2005. The UK supported the new Regulation as it does much to help improve animal welfare in transport, such as better enforcement of the rules, and new training and authorisation procedures. We regret that it did not lower the maximum journey times to slaughter. But there will be an opportunity for a review of journey times in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.879W.3/3">The new rules also contain welfare measures designed to further protect horse welfare. Unbroken horses (not trained to halter) may only be transported up to eight hours and in groups of no more than four. Horses travelling more than eight hours must be in single stalls, as must horses travelling by sea. The hon. Member may also wish to note that there is no evidence of a slaughter trade from this country or any demand for one.</p>

	<p pid="c.880W.9/1">When used as a routine screening test, the single intradermal comparative cervical test (SICCT) is designed to maximise specificity (identification of uninfected animals), while retaining good sensitivity (identification of infected animals). The sensitivity of the SICCT is between 77 per cent. and 95 per cent. Its specificity is above 99 per cent. It is designed to detect an immune response at a relatively early stage in the infection process. Therefore, in most cases, cattle that react to the skin test are considered to have bovine TB.</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.9/2">Failure to confirm bovine tuberculosis by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing Mycobacterium bovis in the laboratory, does not mean that the disease was not present in the animal. In the early stages of the disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye, and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture from samples in every case.</p>

	<p pid="c.882W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/2">The main environmental consequences of concern relate to possible contamination of surface and ground waters, safety of drinking water supplies and gaseous and particulate emissions to the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/3">Efforts to contain contaminated water and fuel were largely successful; firewater on the site has now been removed and is stored in secure off-site storage tanks. The site is still under the control of the Health and Safety Executive and Police and a detailed site investigation is under way. Drinking water sources in the surrounding area continue to be monitored and to date have shown no impacts attributable to the Buncefield incident.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/4">Recent investigations have revealed that a road drain immediately to the north of the site contains a borehole extending into the underlying strata that contains a black liquid, which is currently being analysed. The Environment Agency will continue to monitor the situation and work with the Drinking Water Inspectorate, local water companies, the Health Protection Agency, the site operators and other relevant bodies to carry out these investigations and develop any remedial action necessary. Three Valleys Water have been informed of these findings, but the company is not currently abstracting from the nearby boreholes. More information, results from analysis and further sampling will be needed before the EA can clarify the extent of any groundwater pollution.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/5">Regarding emissions to air, the main air pollutants of concern from hydrocarbon fuel fires are emitted as particulate matter especially those particles of respirable size (referred to as PM10), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, measured as benzo<i>(a)</i> pyrene. In the very high temperatures of the fire (3000oC) however all organic chemicals will be completely destroyed. There is the possibility that in the cooler margins of the fire and during the relatively short period at the end of the fire, some of the products of incomplete combustion at the lower temperatures may be hazardous.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/6">Monitoring undertaken close to the fire when the fire brigade began to attack the blaze did pick up elevated areas of particulates and of hydrocarbon solvents for a short period but this was foreseen and, provided that the warnings given beforehand were complied with, no public health effects are envisaged. None of the data from later air monitoring indicated any values that were outside the normal range of ambient air levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/7">There is no ongoing risk to air quality from the Buncefield fire as the pollutants have been widely dispersed through the atmosphere and, in general, have had no discernable impact on background levels of pollution. The following exceptions were consistent with the footprint of the plume and may have been associated with its descent to ground level. On the evening of Sunday 11 and early in the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 12 December</phrase>, monitoring sites in parts of east Surrey and Sussex detected PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> particulate concentrations reaching 'moderate' levels in Horsham and Lewes. Monitoring sites in north London and St. Albans also showed slightly elevated concentrations, but remained in the 'low' air pollution band.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/8">On the evening of Tuesday 13, PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> particulate was detected at the Barnet 2 background sites and on the morning of Wednesday 14, PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> particulate was detected at the Watford 1 site. In both cases concentrations remained 'low'.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/9">Throughout the period of the fire 'moderate' PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> particulate was measured at several roadside sites in London. This was due to road transport sources and was not directly related to the smoke from the oil depot fire. 'Moderate' PM <sub>1</sub> <sub>0</sub> concentrations at the Chichester 1 site were due to nearby road resurfacing.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/10">Levels of pollution in the UK during the course of the fire were therefore within the normal range of ambient air levels at each location, and are not considered exceptional.</p>
	<p pid="c.882W.6/11">A report of the supplementary air quality monitoring carried out by Defra at the time of the fire is currently in preparation and is planned for publication in March 2006. The Health Protection Agency is currently carrying out an assessment of the impacts on human health of the Buncefield fire. There have been no substantive immediate health effects reported from the areas affected by the fire and plume. A multi-agency surveillance steering group, chaired by the Health Protection Agency, is working on projects to assess whether any long-term effects (physical, psychological and toxic) might occur and work-streams are proceeding.</p>

This gives access to the 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy to which these facilities are now entitled. Applications for five heat treatment companies were incomplete. We expect to be able to sign these agreements this week.</p>

	<p pid="c.885W.11/1">The Government recognise that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases depend on the amounts emitted, so emissions reduction pathways are as important as the targets themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.885W.11/2">The Energy White Paper said we would put ourselves on a path to cut the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050, with real progress by 2020. To achieve the 2050 target we would need to reduce emissions by, on average, about 2 MtC a year. However, some annual fluctuation in emissions is inevitable due to uncontrollable factors such as the weather. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, for example, is for five years rather than a single target year to smooth out annual fluctuations in emissions.</p>

	<p pid="c.888W.0/2">The UK Government regularly impresses upon the Irish Government the need to take steps to reduce and eventually eliminate the impact of the Irish salmon drift net fishery on UK salmon stocks and I have raised the issue directly with my Irish counterparts on several occasions. The issue has also been raised regularly at informal meetings between UK and Irish officials and in discussions with the European Commission and with other EU member states in the context of the EU's commitments to the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO). The Commission is understood to be considering what proposals it might make to the Fisheries Council on the regulation of salmon fishing in EU waters. To that end it commissioned a report (to which scientists from the UK and Ireland contributed) on the impact of coastal salmon fisheries on the conservation of in-river stocks.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.0/3">We understand that the European Commission has issued a letter of formal complaint to the Irish Government about the effects of drift netting on the conservation status of salmon. This is the first step towards a possible Action in the European Court of Justice against Ireland in respect of its failure to meet obligations towards salmon under the EC Habitats Directive. Unless and until such time as the Commission formally institutes such action, its case against the Irish Government is not a matter of public record, nor is the UK Government given the opportunity to comment.</p>

	<p pid="c.888W.6/1">In order to meet the requirements of Directive 2005/94/EC, the Great Britain Poultry Register was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December 2005</phrase>. Commercial premises of 50 birds or more have until <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase> to register with the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.6/2">The definitions for poultry and commercial poultry premises are those used in the Avian Influenza (Preventive Measures)(No. 2) Regulations 2005. For the purpose of the Register, poultry&quot; means all birds that are reared or kept in captivity for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game or for the purposes of any breeding programme for the production of these categories of birds. Commercial poultry premises&quot; means premises where poultry are kept for commercial purposes and does not include premises where all poultry (and their eggs) are kept by their owners for their own consumption or as pets.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.6/3">No formal legal definition exists of the term commercial&quot;. Ultimately it would be for the courts to define, but in principle, the word should be given its ordinary meaning. Having said that, commercial activities typically involve the exchange of money, goods or services. Using an example from the game world, we think that premises rearing and/or releasing gamebirds are likely to be commercial poultry premises, as activities on these premises would involve some level of commercial transaction. The supply of birds/carcases to third parties for services rendered would count as commercial&quot;. It is possible, however, that small private syndicates communally owning, shooting and consuming all their birds would classify as non-commercial premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.888W.6/4">If there is any uncertainty about premises with more than 50 poultry being commercial, we recommend that the premises are registered.

Food security is about ensuring that consumers have access to a stable and adequate supply of food, whether domestically produced or imported.

	<p pid="c.891W.6/1">The latest published figures for 2004 show the UK was <i>(a)</i> 74.2 per cent. self-sufficient in indigenous food and <i>(b)</i> 63.4 per cent. self-sufficient in all food. This compares with figures for 2000 of 80.3 per cent. and 66.8 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.6/2">The Government naturally takes the issue of food security very seriously. Food security is about ensuring that consumers have access to a stable and adequate supply of food, whether domestically produced or imported. The UK has long been a net importer of food and national and international food security is best facilitated through improved trading relationships based on more open international markets and reductions in trade distorting subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="c.891W.6/3">Food supply is robust and resilient because of the high degree of demand and supply-side substitutability of foodstuffs. DEFRA works closely with all parts of the industry to ensure that appropriate support is provided to maintain supply throughout the chain in the event of significant disruption.</p>

	<p pid="c.892W.2/1">All local authorities in England with responsibility for waste collection (except for the Council of the Isles of Scilly) operate some form of kerbside collection service for recyclable materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.892W.2/2">Local authorities have provided information in the Defra Municipal Waste Management Survey. The data for 2003&ndash;04 on the materials that are collected separately for recycling is shown in the table&mdash;a copy has been placed in the Library of the House. These have been coded as:</p>

	<p pid="c.892W.2/5">Some authorities have been listed with no separate materials recycled. These authorities will normally provide a form of kerbside waste collection service which will include at least some of the materials listed, but collected in a co-mingled format.</p>

	<p pid="c.892W.5/1">Customer debt is primarily the responsibility of water companies to manage. Companies still have a range of means to recover payments, including through the courts. The previous power of water companies to disconnect household customers for non-payment of water bills was ended, by the Water Industry Act 1999, without any qualification concerning extreme circumstances. Water companies, in their discussions with Ministers and officials, are not pressing for the power to disconnect to be restored. I am prepared to consider any suggestions for how Government should help companies to tackle customer debt. The industry itself needs to identify and apply best practice in debt management, and I welcome companies' efforts to do so.</p>

This includes wheat milled to produce bread, biscuits, other food ingredients and starch, where production of flour for bread making was typically around 60 per cent. of the total flour produced. Assuming typical utilisation and production levels, it is estimated that UK millers have held approximately 15&ndash;25 days supply and on average 20 days supply of all types of wheat for milling in the last four years. The wheat stocks include both UK and imported wheat grain.</p>

	<p pid="c.907W.5/1">I asked the employing authorities (that is, the Education and Library Boards, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and voluntary grammar, Irish medium, grant-maintained integrated and independent schools which employ their staff directly) to check their records and inform me whether there is any person currently in employment in any capacity in a grant-aided school who is required to notify their details to the Police Service as a sex offender, or who has a history of sex offending. They have confirmed that there are three persons, none of them teaching staff, with a conviction for a sexual offence who are currently working in schools; none of these persons is on a sex offenders register as all the offences were committed over 15 years ago. In one case the offence was against a minor and involved a girl who was just under age; in the other two cases the offence was against an adult female. In each case the employing authority knew of the conviction through the pre-employment check and took professional advice. The advice was, in each case, that the person was not a risk to children, and so employment was offered. The employing authorities remain satisfied that these persons do not pose a risk to children.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.5/2">In Northern Ireland vetting against all sources is done by a single agency, the PSNI Criminal Records Office (CRO). The CRO checks individuals who apply to work with children, either as employees or those engaged as volunteers, against both List 99 and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety's list of people who are disqualified from working with children, as well as carrying out a foil criminal background check. Employers are informed of all convictions, including cautions and bind-over orders, no matter when the offence was committed, and non-conviction information which CRO considers to be reliable. The CRO has also confirmed that their pre-employment checks on persons applying to work in schools have not identified any individual on a sex offenders register since the introduction of registration in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.5/3">I have been advised by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South, that not all posts in hospitals are vetted or would involve working with children or access to children. It is impossible to say definitively whether or not sex offenders have ever been employed in one of our hospitals over the past five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.5/4">However, since September 2001, when a person is convicted of a sexual offence, he/she is subject to assessment of their individual level of risk under the Multi Agency Risk Assessment Process.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.5/5">When that individual is employed in a range of specified occupations e.g. medical, health etc, the agencies (including PSNI) will consider carefully the relevance of the offence in relation to the occupation/employment and decide whether to bring this to the attention of the relevant employer as part of the risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.5/6">My hon. Friend would not tolerate any decision by a HSS Trust or other employer within the statutory sector to ignore this multi-agency advice and DHSSPS cannot identify any instance where this has happened.</p>

	<p pid="c.909W.2/1">New Targeting Social Need (TSN) is Government's current high level policy aimed at tackling poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland by targeting effort and available resources at people, groups and areas in greatest objective need.</p>
	<p pid="c.909W.2/2">Promoting Social Inclusion (PSI) is a key component of New TSN policy, and involves Departments working together and with partners outside Government to develop strategies aimed at tackling a range of issues impacting on vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities. Future policy and priorities will continue to focus on preventing social exclusion, and it is hoped to make an announcement on these shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.909W.2/3">As well as initiatives targeting groups at risk of social exclusion, many government programmes are focused on the issues impacting on areas and communities. Currently the Rural Development Programme is aimed at tackling rural disadvantage throughout the region, and the Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy, targets the worst areas of urban disadvantage in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.909W.2/4">Government's programme of equality legislation also contains provisions which contribute to reducing social exclusion of vulnerable groups and plays an important role in supporting policies. In October 2006 legislation will be introduced to prohibit unjustified age discrimination in employment and vocational training. This will give individuals new rights not to be discriminated because of their age and will place new responsibilities on all employers of vocational training.</p>

	<p pid="c.914W.8/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not expect there to be any negative impact on the performance of the two pilot tri-service control centres as a result of the merger of fire and rescue service control rooms into regional controls. There are no plans to regionalise the fire and rescue service.</p>
	<p pid="c.914W.8/2">The tri-service pilots are not combined emergency service control rooms, but three separate controls located in the same building. This is because the different business needs of the three services are a key implementation barrier to delivering fully integrated tri-service centres. In terms of performance, the fire and rescue service accounts for fewer than 10 per cent. of calls in the tri-service centres, so combined centres will still be able to function much as they do now as bi-service controls without fire. The valuable lessons that have been learnt from the pilots, especially in terms of closer working between emergency services, can still be built on after the introduction of regional fire control centres.</p>

	<p pid="c.915W.3/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not routinely assess the costs falling on Hillingdon council from Heathrow airport. To make such an assessment on a one-off basis would require extensive research which would incur disproportionate cost. The economic effects arising from Heathrow were considered as part of the Inquiry into the Terminal 5 proposal, and findings are set out in Topic Report 2, which supplements the main Inspector's Report, but the findings are not reported in a way that is specific to Hillingdon.</p>

	<p pid="c.915W.6/1">Home information packs will bring together at the start of the home buying and selling process documents and information that are already an established part of the existing system but which currently become available later in the sale. There will be no legal requirement for persons performing the role of collecting documents together to compile packs to have negligence or indemnity insurance. This will be a matter for consideration by estate agents and others who may commission packs on behalf of sellers. The only new component in home information packs will be the home condition report. Only home inspectors who are members of an approved certification scheme will be able to provide home condition reports. Before approving a certification scheme the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister must be satisfied that the scheme contains appropriate provision for ensuring that its members have suitable indemnity insurance.</p>

	<p pid="c.919W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that health funding takes account of planned housing growth. The discussions have been at a strategic level and have not touched upon the specific plans for Kettering General Hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.919W.5/2">Significant extra resources are being provided for health services in the growth areas. Already an extra &pound;20 million of revenue funding per annum has been provided for primary care trusts in the growth areas (2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06) and an extra &pound;20 million of capital resources allocated to strategic health authorities in the growth areas (2005&ndash;06).</p>
	<p pid="c.919W.5/3">Kettering General Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Trust has benefited from extra resources. In May 2005 the trust was granted some &pound;7.4 million (&pound;5 million from the primary care trust and &pound;2.4 million in capital from the strategic health authority) to tackle the growth in demand for services. This has enabled the trust to employ 164 extra nurses and 32 extra doctors. The trust has invested &pound;2 million in a 40-bed ward and five-bed Accident and Emergency observation ward. The trust is building a &pound;16.5 million treatment centre and an ambulatory care centre is currently in development.</p>
	<p pid="c.919W.5/4">Future health funding will also take into account planned housing growth. The Department of Health's announcement on primary care trust revenue funding on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February 2005</phrase> included a growth area adjustment. Amongst other factors, this will lead to the primary care trusts in the growth areas receiving funding increases of &pound;860 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;970 million in 2007&ndash;08 (increases over the two years of 20.8 per cent. compared to a national average of 19.5 per cent.). Government is also giving priority to growth areas for future LIFT (local improvement finance trust) schemes. This private finance initiative programme will create long-term public/private partnerships to secure continued investment in health care in local areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.920W.0/1">Living Spaces was set up as an innovative approach to helping communities make tangible and lasting changes to their local environment. Living Spaces is a three-year programme with funding due to end in 2005&ndash;06. Due to the large demand from community groups for support from Living Spaces, funding for the programme has been exhausted and, therefore, there are currently no plans to re-open the scheme for fresh applications or extend the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.920W.0/2">The lessons learnt from the success of Living Spaces will help to inform future policies and programmes that seek to involve local people in improving the quality of their local communities. For example, a priority of the Big Lottery Fund's Changing Spaces programme will be to increase the capacity of communities to plan, develop and run projects that improve their local environments.</p>

	<p pid="c.925W.0/1">Planning Policy Guidance note (PPG) 13 Transport&quot; advises that, in preparing plans and determining planning applications, local planning authorities should, where possible, locate developments generating substantial freight movements such as distribution and warehousing away from congested central areas and residential areas and ensure adequate access to trunk roads. It goes on to say planning authorities should promote opportunities for freight generating development to be served by rail or waterways. The Government have no plans to amend this policy guidance nor to make any regulations.</p>

	<p pid="c.926W.5/1">The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 introduced special measures for witnesses in proceedings for antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs). These measures were introduced to address concerns about the protection of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The measures include screening witnesses from the defendants, giving evidence through video link or in private, and the use of video recorded evidence. This makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in the Crown and magistrates court during an ASBO hearing. Antisocial behaviour response courts have been established in magistrates courts sitting in their civil capacity to ensure that witness issues are addressed and the respect action plan announced plans to establish similar arrangements for county courts. There are also plans to introduce the same measures for ASBO victims in civil hearings as for victims in criminal cases. The Home Office has issued a good practice guide to practitioners on how best to support a witness.</p>

	<p pid="c.927W.6/1">In the period prior to 1999, the Chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) did not put any firm recommendations to the Secretary of State for the Home Department that cannabis be reclassified to a class C drug. However, in December 1978 the ACMD produced a report on a review of the classification of controlled drugs and of penalties under schedule two and four of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. This covered a number of recommendations on classifications and penalties, including one that cannabis and cannabis resin should be transferred to class C.</p>
	<p pid="c.927W.6/2">However, in the then chair's covering letter to the Home Secretary he points out that there was a division of opinion within the council and no endorsement, or otherwise, of the recommendation was offered. In November 1981 the ACMD's Report of the Expert Group on the effects of Cannabis Use maintained that the recommendations of the 1978 Report, including that on cannabis classification, remained valid. But again, the chair's covering letter to the Secretary of State did not offer a clear recommendation on cannabis classification.</p>

	<p pid="c.928W.8/1">The notification requirements of Part two of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (which are known as the sex offenders register) automatically apply to all offenders who have received a conviction, caution or finding for a relevant sexual offence from <phrase class="date" code="1997-09-01">1 September 1997</phrase>. The Act also includes a partially retrospective operation so that for convictions for relevant offences received before <phrase class="date" code="1997-09-01">1 September 1997</phrase> an offender will become subject to the notification requirements if he was awaiting sentence or serving his sentence on that date. The 2003 Act also introduced sexual offences prevention orders (SOPOs) which are made by a court in respect of any offender who poses a risk of serious sexual harm and who has received a conviction or caution for a sexual or violent offence (listed in Schedule three or five to the Act). SOPOs are used to impose prohibitions on an offender but also make him subject to the notification requirements for the duration of the order. SOPOs can be made regardless of when the conviction or caution for the qualifying offence was received. It is the case that Schedule three does not include those offences which pre-date the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and this means that if an individual's most recent sexual offence was committed 50 years ago and he has not since committed a violent offence, then it would not be possible to make him subject to a SOPO and therefore subject to the notification requirements. However, if such an individual posed a risk of harm to children, then it would still be possible for a court to make a risk of sexual harm order (RSHO) and if an offender breaches the prohibitions in a RSHO, then he automatically becomes subject to the notification requirements for the duration of the order.</p>

	<p pid="c.936W.2/2">Home Office Circular 25/2001 issued to chief constables in June 2001 states that when an individual is cleared of an offence, samples taken during an investigation may be retained, but that they may only be used for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution. Since April 2005, they may also be used for the purposes of identifying a deceased person. There is no distinction between the retention of DNA profiles of an adult or a juvenile.</p>
	<p pid="c.936W.2/3">Guidance has also been issued in The Codes of Practice (Code D) made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which give advice on the taking, use and retention of samples. The Codes of Practice (Code C) also give advice on interviewing juveniles.</p>
	<p pid="c.936W.2/4">The decision whether or not to retain a DNA sample is an operational one for the chief constable of the force which took the sample, and the Association of Chief Police Officers has for some time been developing guidelines to assist them in the exercise of their discretion. It is expected that a decision not to retain a DNA sample will be made in exceptional circumstances only. These guidelines will be issued shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.937W.5/1">Since its introduction in April 2003, over 33,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP). Waiting times for treatment in the 'intensive' DIP areas have fallen to their lowest levels ever. Acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug related crime makes a substantial contribution&mdash;fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.5/2">Its success has been achieved through a combination of additional resources, new legislation, revised working practices and a stronger focus on partnership working.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.5/3">We are on track to achieve the overall target of 1,000 offenders a week into treatment by 2008 and we exceeded the interim (March 2005) target by 54 per cent. Over 2,000 offenders entered treatment in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.5/4">The programme continues to be developed and strengthened. For example, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> new provisions contained in the Drugs Act 2005 have been implemented in three police force areas: Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Nottingham. These give police powers to test for specified Class A drugs on arrest and to require persons who have tested positive for a specified Class A drug to attend an assessment of their drug use (an initial assessment). These powers are improving access to offenders including those who have previously not been in treatment. They will be extended to other intensive areas by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> on which date restriction on bail provisions will also be available across the whole of England.</p>

	<p pid="c.938W.0/2">However, the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) has published provisional figures showing that in 2003&ndash;04 about two thirds (67.3 per cent.) of drug treatment clients in England used heroin as their main drug. This may not provide an entirely accurate reflection of the percentage of problematic drug users who are addicted to heroin as the numbers will be influenced by the types of services that are available (reflecting historical patterns of drug use), the availability of effective treatments, and the type of clients who present to drug treatment services.</p>

	<p pid="c.939W.2/1">While no final decisions have been taken with regard to the eventual locations of enrolment centres for the Identity Card Scheme, current analysis envisages that no person will have to travel more than an hour to get to an enrolment centre. Provision for mobile enrolment facilities is planned for those who would have to travel more than an hour from the location of a fixed enrolment centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.939W.2/2">With regard to the implementation of the enrolment centre network, this analysis has been built on existing and new research, operational experience and consultations with representatives of sparsely populated communities. In particular, the analysis will draw on extensive work carried out for the implementation of the expansion of the UK Passport Service's office network. Modelling is continuing using census, travel time and socio-economic data.</p>
	<p pid="c.939W.2/3">Planning for the provision of enrolment facilities for sparsely populated communities has been informed by the experience of other organisations such as the Driving Standards Agency, the Department of Work and Pensions, the Scottish Executive Environmental and Rural Affairs Department as well as services provided by the banking industry. Consultations are continuing with DEFRA through their Rural Services Divisions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Additionally, the results from consultations conducted for the UK Passport Service have also been integrated into this work. These included discussions with local authorities in Cornwall, Devon, North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Northumberland as well as the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Equality Commission, Scottish Borders Enterprise, Dumfries &amp; Galloway Enterprise and Highlands &amp; Island Enterprise. It is anticipated that once more detailed plans for enrolment in remote communities are ready, further consultation with relevant local bodies will take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.939W.2/4">With regard to continual monitoring of travel times, final plans on how this will be monitored on an ongoing basis are yet to be decided. However, it is anticipated that this will be monitored through customer feedback, consultations with local communities and further modelling in response to population changes.</p>

	<p pid="c.941W.8/1">The Commissioner for the police of the Metropolis informs me the criteria used in deciding to sponsor an event, organisation or activity is based on a business case approach to determine that the outcomes can provide clear benefits to the MPS and the communities it serves.</p>
	<p pid="c.941W.8/2">Following the bombings and attempted bombings in London in July the MPS has been conducting consultation with faith groups to learn about their concerns, particularly about the impact that the July events had on their communities. This conference was an opportunity to engage the Muslim community and in particular young people. 17 Police Officers and Police Staff attended and spoke to 2,000 people. They were also able to promote the MPS and provide recruitment advice to individuals interested in joining the MPS, to engage the Muslim community and provide reassurance, and to encourage individuals to sign up to the Police Message Broadcasting System and to receive the MRS community bulletin.</p>

	<p pid="c.942W.5/1">There will be a number of steps taken to ensure the reliability of information to be held on the National Identity Register. During the enrolment stage, these steps will include:</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/2" class="indent">1. The electronic verification of some information provided by the applicant against information held on other databases. Clause 30 of the Identity Cards Bill provides that a person is guilty of a criminal offence if they provide information which they know or believe to be false in order to place it on the register or are reckless as to whether this information is false;</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/3" class="indent">2. Relevant supporting documentation may also be examined in advance or at the enrolment centre to ensure that it is valid and corresponds with information provided on the application form and the results from biographical footprint check;</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/4" class="indent">3. Attendance in person to allow information to be clarified and checked with the applicant in person;</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/5" class="indent">4. The design of enrolment procedures will be informed by the experience of the UK Passport Service's introduction of personal visits for all first time passport applicants;</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/6" class="indent">5. Security policies and appropriate working procedures are being designed to prevent and detect fraud originating from either applicants or staff members;</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/7" class="indent">6. The recording and matching of biometric information which will make a much stronger link between the information recorded on the register and the individual associated with it. This will make it much easier to detect people trying to enrol more than once to establish false, multiple identities.</p>
	<p pid="c.942W.5/8">There will be continuing actions to ensure that the information on the register remains reliable. Biometric verification or secure remote authentication technology will be used to link an individual to the correct record if he should wish to update it. The information provided may also be verified through electronic record checks. There will also be an online facility where, subject to secure remote authentication, an individual will be able to review their record and thus, ensure that it is accurate. In addition, a person will be entitled to request a full subject data access request under the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. To encourage individuals to keep their information up to date, the Identity Cards Bill provides for a civil penalty regime. Its operation will be subject to a Code of Practice under Clause 36 of the Identity Cards Bill and this code will ensure that sufficient prior notification of this requirement will be made.</p>

	<p pid="c.943W.2/1">The central UK national fingerprint database (NAFIS/IDENT1) has been unavailable to the police service on 96 unplanned occasions in the last 12 months. On only 36 occasions the central system was unavailable for more than two hours and for the remainder the system was unavailable for periods as short as 15 minutes. During these periods the police service were able to continue to carry out some of the identification business processes but this can also prevent users from carrying out all or part of the processes. There are currently no national figures available that reflect periods of local disruption directly connected to IDENT1 development and maintenance work. Presently Police Information Technology Organisation together with the supplier are migrating the fingerprint identification service from the National Automated Fingerprint System (NAFIS) to the new IDENT1 identification platform which will have additional capability. There has been disruption and problems to the IDENT1 service during the migration process in the last few months. These problems are being addressed by the Police Information and Technology Organisation (PITO) and should result in a robust and reliable service to the police forces being resumed as soon as possible. In order to ensure the Home Office investment in the IDENT1 service is developed and maintained to provide maximum benefit to the police fingerprint community I have asked my Home Office colleagues to review and report progress to me at regular intervals.</p>

	<p pid="c.948W.8/1">Further to my written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase>, I would like to state that based upon feedback given on <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase> to forces and authorities, they are further developing their options for change. For the Yorkshire and Humber region, two options of those submitted were assessed as meeting the criteria and these are, (1) a single regional strategic force option and (2) two strategic forces, North Yorkshire merging with West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire merging with Humberside. I made it clear that police authorities including North Yorkshire, are free to submit options other than ones we have commented on if they wish to, making a compelling case for these by <phrase class="date" code="">23 December</phrase>. No decisions will be made until after the consultation process has run its course.</p>

The size of the neighbourhood which is served by this team will vary from area to area: a neighbourhood&quot; to an inner-city resident will be very different from what it means to someone living in a predominantly rural area. Typically though, it is likely that a neighbourhood will cover one or two council wards. What is really important is that residents will know the names of their local officers see them on the street and have their phone numbers and email addresses.</p>

	<p pid="c.949W.6/1">The Police Service continues to make steady progress towards the 2009 Race Equality Employment Targets. In 2003, BME representation was 2.9 per cent. In 2004 it was 3.3 per cent. and in 2005 it was 3.5 per cent. Although the number of minority ethnic police officers narrowly missed the 2004 milestone of 4 per cent., further measures are being put in place to ensure that numbers continue to rise steadily and that the Police Service meets the 2009 target of 7 per cent. The retention rate for minority ethnic officers compared with white officers is very similar over comparable length of service periods after the first two years point. In the first six months of service however, minority ethnic officers are leaving at a greater rate than white officers (12.6 per cent. of BME officers compared to 7.6 per cent. of white officers) although the wastage rate is lower than in previous years. The wastage rate for officers with six months to two years' service has increased for both groups. No targets have been set for the recruitment and retention of women.</p>

	<p pid="c.951W.3/1">The Government's Spending Review 2004 Public Service Agreements set a target to reduce crime by 15 per cent., and further in high crime areas, by 2007&ndash;08. We remain committed to delivering those reductions in crime and any objectives beyond this period will arise out of the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007. Force restructuring is intended to improve the capacity and capability of forces in England and Wales to provide an effective service, to ensure that every force is well equipped to deliver effective protective services, as well as effective policing at the neighbourhood level.</p>

	<p pid="c.956W.3/1">Overcrowding alone does not explain why there are self-inflicted deaths in prisons. In 2005, despite rises in the prison population, the number of apparent self-inflicted deaths fell by 18 per cent. in comparison to 2004. Most importantly, a high proportion of prisoners arrive in prison having experienced negative life events that we know increase the risk of an individual harming themselves. We also know that cell-sharing is a protective factor against suicide.</p>
	<p pid="c.956W.3/2">That said, managing high numbers of prisoners can lead to an increase in transfers between prisons, itself a time of heightened risk. More people being received into custody may mean that some prisoners are located further from home, which, in turn, may mean that their access to familial or social support is affected. Sometimes overcrowding will reduce the time staff can spend with individual prisoners on care and risk assessment, and it sometimes leads to an increase in the length of time prisoners are locked in their cells, rather than engaged in regime activities, association and other purposeful activity. These factors together increase distress which we know from research by the University of Cambridge is related to suicide rates.</p>

	<p pid="c.957W.5/1">There are currently no plans to introduce a statutory duty requiring public authorities to disclose personalised data related to incidents of violence in this way, and neither I nor my officials have met with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) about this specific matter. My officials did meet with the Deputy Chief Constable of Surrey Police at his request in March last year, on the more general subject of information sharing on violent crime. I understand that officials are due to meet again with him this month, in response to his specific proposals on this issue as outlined in the question.</p>
	<p pid="c.957W.5/2">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 gives those responsible authorities which make up Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships a power to share aggregate, depersonalised data between themselves in the interest of preventing crime, disorder, substance misuse or antisocial behaviour. In the context of work being done in the Home Office to improve partnership arrangements, the potential for strengthening these provisions has been included in a review of the Crime and Disorder Act, which was completed this month.</p>

The Rape Action Plan 2002 led to a number of changes to the legal system and to the way in which the police and Crown Prosecution Service operate. These were intended to increase the likelihood of cases getting to trial and securing convictions. We have recently undertaken a stock take of the Rape Action Plan which will be followed up by an inspection into the investigation and prosecution of allegations of rape, due to report in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.962W.11/1">The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 introduced special measures for witnesses in proceedings for antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs). These measures were introduced to address concerns about the protection of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The measures include screening witnesses from the defendants, giving evidence through video link or in private, and the use of video recorded evidence. This makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in the Crown and magistrates court during an ASBO hearing. antisocial behaviour response courts have been established in magistrates courts sitting in their civil capacity to ensure that witness issues are addressed, and the Respect Action Plan announced plans to establish similar arrangements for county courts. There are also plans to introduce the same measures for ASBO victims in civil hearings as for victims in criminal cases. The Home Office has issued a good practice guide to practitioners on how best to support a witness.</p>

	<p pid="c.967W.2/16">1. Strategic capital is allocated for prioritisation by the SHA across the health economy. Strategic capital is allocated to NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) for larger capital projects facilitating strategic change. 2.

The access fund is allocated to the SHA to reward progress against access targets within the patch.</p>

This funding is to cover the day-to-day operational management and running of the SHA to allow it to carry out its responsibilities and functions.</p>
	<p pid="c.967W.2/18">In addition, revenue allocations are made to PCTs to enable them to commission health care for their local populations. The funding covers hospital and community health services, prescribing and primary medical services.

	<p pid="c.971W.3/1">Since 2003&ndash;04, the Department has invested an additional &pound;250 million in national health service dentistry and has supported the NHS in recruiting the equivalent of an extra 1,459 dentists to improve patient access. The Government are also funding an additional 170 training places per year from 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.971W.3/2">From April 2006, the NHS will be implementing major reforms to dentistry to build upon this success. New contracts for dentists will abolish the fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a greater focus on preventative care. Evidence from personal dental services pilot schemes is that these new ways of working free up significant capacity that dentists can then use in part to see a greater range of patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.971W.3/3">From April 2006, primary care trusts (PCTs) will also have devolved responsibility and ring-fenced budgets for commissioning primary dental services. This means that, if a dentist leaves the NHS or reduces their NHS commitment, the resources stay with the PCT to be re-invested in local dental services.</p>

Head lice infestations depend upon head-to-head contact, which is relatively common among younger school-age children while working together, or playing at school. Our policy, which is shared by the Department for Education and Skills, is to encourage a whole school approach&quot;. This entails encouraging parents to check their children and other family members for head lice as the need arises, and arranging treatment where necessary, with advice and support from the local primary health care team (general practitioner, health visitor, school nurse or local pharmacist).</p>

This promotes the benefits of identifying and arranging treatment, where needed, on a day which schools may determine.

	<p pid="c.977W.5/2">In November 2001, the Government set a target to reduce the number of drug-related deaths by 20 per cent. by 2004 in England and Wales as part of an action plan to reduce drug-related deaths. Progress against the target is calculated against a 1999 Office for National Statistics (ONS) baseline. The latest ONS data available are for 2003, which show that drug-related deaths have declined for three consecutive years.</p>
	<p pid="c.977W.5/3">Since the action plan was published, the Department has focused efforts on improving the surveillance and monitoring of drug use; improving access to and consistency of prescribing treatment; and guidance to commissioners and providers of treatment and to users on limiting the risk of overdose.</p>
	<p pid="c.977W.5/4">Accessible information and support is available to young people and their families on the risks associated with drug misuse through the innovative Frank&quot; campaign. We are also getting more people in to drug treatment than ever before and this will be boosted by the increase of funding for drug action teams, which will continue to take forward the positive progress we are already making.</p>

This is good for their development. Positional plagiocephaly is caused by consistent pressure applied to one part of a baby's skull over a period of time, typically while sleeping in one position. This is commonly remedied by encouraging the baby to adopt different postures while awake.</p>

The Gosforth area will remain 3 tier.

However, understanding the origins and implications of the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom is an important part of Citizenship curriculum which became statutory for 11 to 16-year-olds in September 2002. In this context pupils have the opportunity to explore the unique qualities that are part of the shared identities of the countries of the United Kingdom. They may consider the political, religious, social and constitutional systems that affect their lives and communities and that may include learning about the flags, patron saints and the national anthem.

It aims to introduce excellent teaching and learning practices into every classroom through CPD, teaching materials and consultancy support.

	<p pid="c.1010W.3/1">The information requested is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.3/2">All four-year-olds have been entitled to a free early education place since 1998 and from April 2004 this entitlement was extended to all three-year-olds. The free entitlement consists of a minimum of five two and a half hour sessions per week for 33 weeks of the year for six terms before statutory school age, which is the term following their fifth birthday.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.3/3">Some local authorities may additionally offer subsidised child care places but this information is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.3/4">Figures for January 2005 show that all four-year-old children are benefiting from some free provision. The figure for three-years-olds is 96 per cent. This covers all maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers and represents 535,100 three-year-olds and 568,300 four-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.3/5">The available information on the number of three and four-year-old children taking up nursery education places in England is shown in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.1010W.3/6">The latest figures on nursery education places for three and four-year-olds in England were published in Statistical First Release 43/2005 Provision for children under five years of age in England&mdash;January 2005 (final)&quot; in September, which is available on my Department's website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/">www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/</a></p>

Four consecutive national evaluation studies have shown that PfS is highly effective in meeting its objectives of improving the literacy, numeracy and ICT skills of pupils at key stages 2 and 3, as well as boosting their motivation and self esteem. Hartlepool's Centre was not open at the time of the last evaluation. However, the local authority's annual report of the Centre's work in 2004&mdash;05 echoes the national findings.</p>

	<p pid="c.1019W.2/2">For Agnes Stewart support has included a collaborative arrangement with Garforth High School and Braimwood High School in Leeds. Agnes Stewart had serious weaknesses and on re-inspection in November 2005 was judged to still require significant improvement. Agnes Stewart and Braimwood are to close this year and be replaced by a new Academy in September.</p>
	<p pid="c.1019W.2/3">For John Smeaton School support measures have included the appointment of an additional part-time Vice Principal, seconded from the David Young Academy, to ensure the school's assessment procedures are improved; targeted support from Secondary National Strategy consultants, who are working with the school's numeracy assistants; extra assistance from school improvement advisers from Education Leeds; and continued support from other schools within the local Leadership Incentive Grant collaborative partnership.</p>

	<p pid="c.1020W.2/1">The two schools that had objections to proposals to interview parents and pupils were The London Oratory School (in 2004 and 2005) and Gunnersbury Catholic School (in 2005).</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.2/2" class="indent">In April 2004, the Schools Adjudicator determined part of the objection to the London Oratory School's admission arrangements for 2005 on the issue of the practice of interviewing prospective parents in a general sense.

	<p pid="c.1020W.2/3" class="indent">In 2004, the Secretary of State decided on the second part of the above objection to the lack of clarity, fairness and objectivity of the admission arrangements relating in part to a person's religion.

	<p pid="c.1020W.2/4" class="indent">In 2005, two objections were made to the proposed admission arrangements to Gunnersbury Catholic School and The London Oratory School and were referred to the Secretary of State as both cases involved interviewing to determine religious affiliation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.2/5" class="indent">The objection to interviewing at Gunnersbury School was upheld as the school proposed to interview only to verify that an applicant was a practising Catholic and this information could be verified by documentary evidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.2/6" class="indent">The objection to interviewing at the London Oratory was not upheld as the school was able to provide thorough and sufficient proof that its interviewing arrangements were the only appropriate way of assessing the degree of an applicant's religious commitment as set out in their admission arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.1022W.0/1">The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust is a non profit-making educational charity. It is the lead advisory body on the specialist school initiative for the DfES, providing advice and support for schools in England seeking to achieve or maintain specialist school status. Its work includes the promotion, development and support of specialist schools, conference and seminar activities and a publications programme. The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust also plays an important role in raising sponsorship and introducing potential sponsors to suitable candidate schools. We expect that the trust will continue to perform these roles.</p>

	<p pid="c.1027W.2/1">Ufi (initially called the University for Industry&quot;), the organisation responsible for learndirect, has successfully pushed the boundaries of learning methods, by making innovative use of technology to make learning more flexible. It is the largest Government supported e-learning initiative in the world, and provides high quality learning for the post-16 learning and skills sector. It particularly reaches those with few or no skills and qualifications who are unlikely to participate in more traditional forms of learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.2/2">In eight years Ufi has grown from an idea to an organisation providing 500,000 learners a year with the opportunity to improve their skills at either a learndirect centre, or from work, or from their home computer. Through its national advice line it has dealt with over seven million calls. Almost 200,000 small and medium sized employers have also used learndirect services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1031W.5/1">The proposed abolition of the corporation tax starting rate means that this benefit will no longer be available to small businesses, including most sports clubs. The change is due to take effect from April 2006. This is in line with our stated intention to improve fairness between organisations, whatever their legal structure.</p>
	<p pid="c.1031W.5/2">Sports clubs that are registered as charities would however be exempt from corporation tax on rental income, most investment income and their primary purpose trading income. Sports clubs that are registered with HM Revenue &amp; Customs as Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCS) benefit from a range of tax reliefs similar to those enjoyed by charities. This includes exemption from corporation tax on bank and building society interest, on any trading profits where turnover is no more than &pound;30,000, and on income from property where total receipts are no more than &pound;20,000. Only those clubs with significant taxable income are likely to be affected.</p>

	<p pid="c.1037W.5/1">The legislation governing the powers of Valuation Office Agency (VOA) staff to inspect properties for the purposes specified is longstanding&mdash; it is for <i>(a)</i> capital gains tax, section 111 Taxes Management Act 1970, <i>(b)</i> inheritance tax, section 220 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 and <i>(c)</i> business rates, Schedule 9 paragraph 7 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. The way the Valuation Office exercises these powers, and similar powers in earlier legislation, is well established. Permission to inspect is always sought from the occupier, owner or taxpayer (as appropriate) usually in advance in writing. All VOA inspectors carry photographic identity, but if the occupier, owner or taxpayer is in any doubt they are able to contact the local Valuation Office to establish the authenticity. Under no circumstances would a VOA inspector forcibly enter a property without the person's permission. Nor would an inspector enter the property if, despite having made a prior appointment, it was discovered that only a minor was present.</p>
	<p pid="c.1037W.5/2">The Valuation Office Agency recognises the importance of not only carrying out its duties responsibly but also being clearly seen to do so. Thus the majority of its Groups already hold the independently awarded Charter Mark award for customer service, and applications from the remaining Groups are in train. As part of its commitment to improve its service, the agency now specifically surveys taxpayers about how inspections have been undertaken.</p>
