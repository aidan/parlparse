The work is being funded by Defra's BREW (Business Resource Efficiency and Waste) programme with just under &pound;600,000 spent in 2005.

	<p pid="b.2W.5/1">The most common process for converting vegetable oil into biodiesel is trans-esterification. This process is well known from years of use in the oleochemical sector. However, the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership will be looking at the specific environmental impacts of biodiesel processing as part of their work on developing draft environmental standards for biofuels. The impacts in terms of pollution to air, land and water are controlled by the Environment Agency. A pollution prevention control permit is required where biodiesel is being produced for own-use by six or more people or for commercial operations producing more than 5,000 litres a year. The processing of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and tallow is also subject to waste management controls. Various studies have assessed the greenhouse gas impact across the whole production process from raw material to finished biodiesel. UK-produced biodiesel typically gives greenhouse gas savings of around 55 per cent. compared to fossil diesel.</p>

	<p pid="b.3W.0/1">The current skin test for bovine tuberculosis is an effective test. It is the accepted standard laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of the disease in a cattle herd. Under EU law, the gamma-interferon diagnostic blood test may be used to supplement the skin test. It is considered marginally more sensitive than the skin test, but less specific. This means that it results in a higher probability of false positives. EU legislation allows for the gamma-interferon test to be used to pick up cases missed by the skin test, but not to overrule it.</p>

	<p pid="b.6W.6/1">Defra funds most of the Environment Agency's flood related work and grant aids individual capital improvement projects undertaken by local authorities and, in low-lying areas, internal drainage boards.

	<p pid="b.6W.6/2">Prior to April 2004 most of the Environment Agency's flood defence funding came from levies paid by local authorities. These levies have now largely been replaced by direct funding from Defra. Local authorities still pay some levies to the agency and also continue to fund other flood defence related work; such expenditure is supported by the local government funding mechanisms operated by what is now ODPM.</p>

This includes expenditure on flood defences, flood warning, research and development etc. but excludes expenditure on measures primarily to reduce risk of coastal erosion (which can also sometimes help reduce flood risk).</p>

	<p pid="b.7W.5/1">Landfills are a major source of emissions of methane&mdash;a powerful greenhouse gas&mdash;and also a potential pollution hazard requiring careful management. For this reason landfill lies at the bottom of the waste hierarchy, and thus represents the least favourable management route for most wastes. The Government has targets under the EU Landfill Directive to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill to 75 per cent. of 1995 figures by 2010 and to 35 per cent. by 2020. The Government seeks to discourage all landfill&mdash;including that of commercial waste&mdash;through the landfill tax escalator. Landfill remains, however, the best management route for certain wastes in certain circumstances and, indeed, the only available option for some others (such as heavy sludges from industrial processes).</p>

	<p pid="b.14W.0/1">Between 1997 and 2003 DFID supported some 60 projects in Zimbabwe which involved the Government and public sector organisations, with a total spend of &pound;145 million. These projects ranged from a substantial sexual health project with a commitment of &pound;9 million to initiatives on anti-corruption involving grants as little as &pound;10,000. Sectors included health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture, forestry, livestock, wildlife and tourism, infrastructure, private sector development, civil society, justice, public reform, local government and public finance.</p>
	<p pid="b.14W.0/2">DFID suspended development assistance to the Government of Zimbabwe in 2002, in protest of the continuing disregard for democratic principles and mismanagement of the economy by the Government of Zimbabwe. Since that time, DFID has supported the international response to the humanitarian and HIV/AIDS crisis in Zimbabwe, through funding to United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations, but has provided no funding to the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="b.15W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.15W.8/2">A discussion paper published jointly by HM Treasury and the Department for Transport in March 2003, entitled 'Aviation and the Environment: using economic instruments', considered the role of economic instruments and the environmental costs of aviation. This was also considered in 'Air Transport White Paper, The Future of Air Transport', published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-16">16 December 2003</phrase> and in chapter 5 of 'Aviation and Global Warming', published by the Department for Transport on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-10">10 February 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.15W.8/3">The Air Transport White Paper set out the conclusions of the Government's analysis, including our view that aviation should be brought within the ED emissions trading scheme by 2008, as the most effective way of tackling the climate change impact. Along with other measures to tackle local environmental impacts, this will help to ensure that the air transport sector meets its environmental costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.15W.8/4">Under the terms of the Chicago convention, it is illegal to tax fuel for international flights, and so the Government have not undertaken an analysis of the potential revenue implications that would result from taxation of fuel used on international flights. Also, figures for aviation turbine fuel consumption for specific flight services are not collected. It is therefore not possible to estimate the potential revenue effect of applying the same tax treatment to the domestic aviation industry as to public transport bus companies. The Government anyway does not accept such direct comparisons as valid as they assume no change in demand or to the working practices of the aviation industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.18W.0/1">The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology did an investigation, which reported in November 2000 and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The absence of confirmed cases of tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) poisoning from cabin air and the very low levels of TOCP that would be found in even in the highly unlikely worst case of contamination from oil leaking into the air supply lead us to conclude that the concerns about significant risk to the health of airline passengers and crew are not substantiated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.0/3">In 2004 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) published research into fume events by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Porton Down and the (then) Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. That concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.0/4" class="indent">'no single component or set of components can be identified which at conceivable concentrations would definitely cause the symptoms reported in cabin air quality incidents'.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.0/5">But acids were found which could act as irritants, and as a result CAA brought in specific troubleshooting and maintenance actions to minimise the potential for fume events.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.0/6">The inter-departmental Aviation Health Working Group has recently arranged for the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to review further evidence which the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) has collected. This process is under way and should help us to specify any further research needs in an area where public funds have already been invested without finding a link between cabin air and long-term health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.0/7">Meanwhile, some research is starting in the USA funded by the Federal Aviation Administration. Government officials are in touch with the research team to monitor progress. In principle, we are interested to join in international research when we have a clearer idea of the needs, and we shall review our position on the American project after the COT has held a formal meeting in public in the spring.</p>

The campaign consisted of a new website, posters and a supporting TV filler film. A new campaign is planned for summer 2006. Aimed at younger children, the 'Cycle Smart' campaign for seven to 10-year-olds is a series of posters and a comic that use Disney characters to communicate simple cycle safety messages, including helmet wearing. The latest edition was released in summer 2003 and we launched a new website, in partnership with Disney, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase>. A new campaign is also planned for later this year.</p>

We have also established a new national standard for cycle training with more than 20 road safety bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.23W.6/2">It should be recognised that at any individual location there is some element of chance variation in the number of serious accidents between one year and the next, so it would be wrong to conclude automatically that a camera is not effective. However, the Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera Programme for England and Wales for 2005&ndash;06 published in November 2004, requires partnerships to, at least annually, review the effectiveness of existing camera sites and to specifically consider sites where there appears to be a continuing problem of high numbers of collisions, notwithstanding the use of cameras, to assess whether further or different action should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.23W.6/3">In these instances partnerships should consider what alternative cost-effective engineering or other solutions should be implemented to tackle the problem instead of, or in addition to, the cameras. Solutions might include greater speed enforcement, road improvements, traffic calming or road safety education and information measures. Operational cases for 2005&ndash;06 indicated that as a result some 104 camera sites were being stood down.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.5/1">Where there is a new development such as a housing estate or a business park which provides for public access the responsibility for road and public safety matters principally lies with the owner of the site. This will usually be the developer until the properties are sold after which the owners of the properties fronting the road will become responsible for maintaining it until it is adopted as a publicly maintainable highway by the relevant highway authority. While the road remains unadopted, the relevant street works authority can serve a notice requiring the owners of premises fronting the street to execute such works to obviate danger to traffic using it as may be specified in the notice within a prescribed time. Should the works not be carried out in the required timescale the street works authority may carry out the works itself and recover the costs from the owners of the relevant properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/2">In addition, the local traffic authority has a duty to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicular and other traffic, including pedestrians. This applies to all highways and roads to which the public has access, irrespective of whether or not the road has been adopted as a public highway.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/3">The relevant police authority will also have a responsibility for safety matters in its area.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/4">Where the new development is a new highway intended for use by the public and does not impinge on an existing highway the highway authority promoting the new highway and which makes the orders in relation to the construction of the new highway is the authority responsible for road and public safety matters during the construction stage as well as after adoption of the road as a public highway.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/5">When the new development is an improvement to an existing highway, depending upon the circumstances, either the highway authority promoting the improvement to the highway or the traffic authority which regulates the use of the existing highway is the authority responsible for road and public safety matters. Usually the relevant highway authority and the relevant traffic authority are the same authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/6">Who the relevant highway authority or the relevant traffic authority is will depend upon the location of the highway development, the classification of the highway (i.e. local road, trunk road or special road) and the nature of the development.</p>

	<p pid="b.33W.5/1">When the scheme was first announced in November 2000, it was intended that payments would be made only to those British civilian internees who could demonstrate a close link with the United Kingdom at the time of internment. In March 2001, this close link was defined in terms of the individual or one of his or her parents or grandparents having been born in the UK. This definition was made public in July 2001 and has become known as the birthlink criterion. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the scheme to establish what criteria were used for claims from British civilian internees that were decided before the introduction of the birthlink definition. I will report the outcome to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.35W.6/1">The Defence Training Review (DTR) programme is currently evaluating the bidding consortia's proposals. The impact on further and higher education sectors and manufacturing companies depends on bidders' training and estates solutions, the extent to which the education and manufacturing sectors are drawn into training design, delivery and support and the exploitation of third party opportunities and revenue. Until the evaluation phase is complete and a decision has been taken to select a preferred training partner, I am not in a position to make any detailed comment on the wider impact of the DTR solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.41W.2/1">Physiological trauma may arise as a result of any physical injury or illness, including environmental injury, and its treatment is an integral part of the medical care and support given to injured armed forces personnel by members of the Defence Medical Services.</p>
	<p pid="b.41W.2/2">When deployed on operations, United Kingdom forces are supported by a range of in-theatre medical facilities, staffed by fully-qualified military medical personnel. These are capable of providing immediate treatment in theatre, and are backed up by fast and efficient medevac procedures to return personnel to the UK for further treatment as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.41W.2/3">On return to the UK, injured personnel will be given the treatment they need, usually through one of the MOD's Ministry of Defence hospital units attached to NHS hospitals. When necessary, follow-up treatment is provided through specialist units such as the 15 regional rehabilitation units (RRUs) in the UK and Germany, and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court, which provides world-class medical care, rehabilitation, prosthetics and adaptations for service personnel. Where there are psychological consequences, further treatment is provided through one of 15 MOD Departments of community mental health located in the UK (plus other satellite centres overseas), or if necessary through in-patient care at Priory Group facilities, with whom there is close liaison.</p>

	<p pid="b.45W.3/1">In 2003&ndash;04 the Library carried out a review of periodicals. Such reviews are carried out at regular intervals with the aim of ensuring that the Library's holdings continue to reflect Members' needs in the most cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.3/2">During the review use of periodicals was recorded over a 12-month period. As a result many periodicals that were no longer being used widely were cancelled, titles taken in duplicate were reduced where practicable, with copies held in the place of greatest use, and a number of closed runs were disposed of. &pound;29,000 of savings have been redeployed to meet new needs, including subscriptions to electronic sources. Out of 1,400 titles 419 current subscriptions were cancelled and a further 319 closed runs of older titles agreed for disposal. Some cancellations were made during the summer of 2004, and the majority came into effect in January 2005, when existing annual subscriptions ended. The large majority of cancelled titles were not kept on display in the Members Library as they were of marginal interest and not in demand. The Library has subsequently received a small number of queries from Members with regard to specific titles, as a result of which two titles have been relocated to the Members Library and five titles reinstated. Single articles from titles not held in the Library can be obtained for Members through Inter Library Loan.</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.9/1">While we believe that the Act will benefit sports clubs in the long term by removing the need to obtain a number of different permissions for different activities, I recognise that some concerns have been expressed about how sports clubs will adapt to the new licensing regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.9/2">I have therefore asked the Central Council for Physical Recreation to provide any information about how sports clubs are adapting to the new licensing regime and, in particular, to feed in any evidence about the impact of the fees into the Independent Fees Review Panel.</p>

	<p pid="b.48W.2/1">Preparation and holding camps are an important element of the Games, potentially bringing benefits to the whole of the UK, both in economic terms and in galvanising the participation and engagement of local communities who will play host to elite athletes from around the globe. The responsibility for co-ordinating preparation and holding camps lies with the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) in conjunction with the British Olympic Association who are developing a pre-training guide and application process to assist the Devolved Administrations and the English Regions in securing these training camps. The 2012 Nations and Regions Group, chaired by Charles Allen, will also be working with the Regions to develop plans for maximising the benefits of hosting the Games and regional working groups will be fully engaged on this issue as work goes forward.</p>

All film projects are selected according to an assessment of their cultural and creative merits. Funding will generally be given only to projects that are wholly or substantially capable of certification as a 'British' film. However, the UK Film Council is able to exercise discretion and may still elect to finance a film if there are other strong cultural reasons for doing so.

Some 15,000 individuals' experiences are now represented in the archive, of which close to half cover service in the Second World War, and the collection is continuing to grow.

Beyond that, the Department is currently trialling apprenticeships for adult entry in three sectors: engineering, construction and health and social care, and discussions are taking place to include the IT sector. These trials are due to complete in March 2006, although some programmes may take longer depending upon their starting date. We will decide in the light of these trials how the apprenticeship model can be adapted to the needs of older entrants to an occupation; and what&mdash;if any&mdash;extra public funding should be made available to support the costs of the learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.70W.2/1">The Government's expectation is that most local authority areas will have a children's trust by April 2006, and all will by 2008. There is progress in all areas towards having children's trusts arrangements in place by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/2">There is no target for the use of home childcarers. In April 2003, we introduced the Home Childcarers Scheme allowing Ofsted to approve registered childminders to provide care in parents' homes. 300 carers were approved under that scheme. A subsequent PSA target required us to introduce, by April 2005, a light-touch Childcare Approval Scheme. This new scheme was launched in December 2004 and became effective in April 2005. 1,339 carers have been approved under it. Our target for the Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative was the creation of 45,000 new full-time daycare places for children under 5 in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas by 2004. This was achieved. There are no plans to expand the programme. Our focus now is on the development of Sure Start children's centres, building on neighbourhood nurseries and other early years provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/3">107 early excellence centres (EECs) were established and there are no plans to expand the programme. There were no targets for the development of EECs. We expect all EECs to develop into children's centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/4">We expect all schools to be making a core offer of extended services including child care, 8am-6pm, all year round, by 2010, with a third of secondary schools, and half of primary schools, doing so by 2008. The vast majority of schools are currently providing some extended services, and all local authorities have received funding in the current financial year, 2005&ndash;06, to support the development of extended schools in their areas. The National Remodelling Team is monitoring progress through its work with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/5">There has been an evaluation of children's trusts in place since April 2004. It will be completed by the end of March 2007. Two interim reports have already been published and available at: <a href="http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/strategy/childrenstrustpathfinders/nationalevaluation/">www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/strategy/childrenstrustpathfinders/national evaluation/</a> whilst three practitioner focused reports will be published in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/6">The Childcare Approval Scheme is being run by Nestor Primecare Services Ltd., the approval body, under contract to the DfES. The scheme is being closely monitored as part of the contract management process, overseen by an Inter-departmental Implementation Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/7">A comprehensive national evaluation of the neighbourhood nursery initiative began in August 2002, and will run until August 2006. The final evaluation report is due to be published towards the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/8">The 29 pilot EECs were the subject of an evaluation study between 1997 and 2002. The final report of this study was published in November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.70W.2/9">The Department is implementing a comprehensive research and evaluation strategy for extended schools, including an evaluation of the impacts of full service extended schools. The findings of the evaluation of the first year of the full service extended schools, and a baseline survey of extended services in maintained schools were published in September 2005. We are collecting annual data from schools to show progress towards the extended school core offer targets published in the Ten Year Childcare Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.72W.3/2">The calculation of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 takes authorities' 2005&ndash;06 level of spending as the baseline, rather than their Schools Formula Spending Share (SPSS); it gives all authorities a minimum increase of 5 per cent. per pupil over the baseline in each of the next two years; and then distributes the remaining grant to reflect the Government's key priorities for education.</p>
	<p pid="b.72W.3/3">The Wirral's baseline spending in 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;3,279 per pupil, which reflects its spending of 2 per cent. below SPSS. Given the 5 per cent. per pupil increase, in 2006&ndash;07 Wirral is receiving an additional &pound;2.78 million to reflect the Government's key priorities for education, plus an additional &pound;0.687 to help move its per pupil funding towards the level indicated by the funding formula. Its average guaranteed unit of funding in 2006&ndash;07 is therefore &pound;3,514 per pupil. That gives the Wirral an indicative allocation of DSG in 2006&ndash;07 of &pound;171.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.72W.3/4">In the City of London's case, its baseline spending in 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;6,286 per pupil which reflects its spending of more than 75 per cent. in excess of SPSS in 2005- 06. Given the 5 per cent. per pupil increase, plus an additional &pound;27,000 to reflect the Government's key priorities for education, the City of London's average guaranteed unit of funding in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;6,708 per pupil. Its indicative allocation of DSG in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;1.7 million. Given that the City of London only has about 250 pupils, it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between its unit costs and those of other authorities.</p>

Schools and LAs have greater flexibility to award recruitment and retention incentives and they can set a head teacher's salary above the top of the pay spine.

Since 2001, over 14,000 candidates have completed the National Professional Qualification for Headship, which prepares aspiring heads to take up headship posts in schools.</p>

A survey undertaken in 2000 by Philip Baker for the School of Oriental and African Studies <sup>1</sup> indicated that there are over 300 languages spoken in London and that the 20 most common first languages are, in descending order of number of speakers, English, Bengali/Silheti, Panjabi, Gujerati, Hindi/Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, English based Creoles, Yoruba, Somali, Cantonese, Greek, Akan (Ashanti), Portuguese, French, Spanish, Tamil, Farsi, Italian and Vietnamese.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/2">The medium of instruction in maintained schools is English and all pupils learning English as an additional language (EAL) should be supported to acquire English.

For example, supplementary schools in Croydon provide teaching in 23 languages and supplementary schools in Islington provide teaching in 30 languages. These schools are usually run by local communities and respond directly to local demand.</p>

	<p pid="b.85W.0/1">The LSC is currently undergoing a radical restructuring exercise which will enable it to work even more effectively with local partners and stakeholders in identifying and responding to London's learning and skill needs. The existing local office structure will be replaced by a number of specialist local Partnership and Economic Development teams made up of experienced education and training professionals. They will work closely with local partners and stakeholders to ensure that properly funded education and training is available that meets the needs of learners and employers in the London area. These changes are in keeping with the Government's wider public sector reform agenda, which seeks to move responsibility for local delivery closer to the frontline. Each of the local LSC councils in London continue to include representatives from a wide range of local interests, including employers, local authorities and the voluntary and community sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.87W.2/1">The level of funding per pupil received through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) reflects the characteristics of children in each authority: authorities receive more funding if they have higher numbers of children living in deprived circumstances. That is because pupils from more deprived backgrounds are likely to have additional educational needs, and to require additional help if they are to have an equal chance to succeed. North Somerset's average level of funding per pupil mainly reflects the authority's lower than average level of deprivation. The Government will review the operation of a number of aspects of the new school funding arrangements, including the DSG distribution, but in doing so it will continue to aim to give all pupils an equal opportunity in life.</p>

	<p pid="b.88W.0/1">A research review commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2003 found some indication that there is a relationship between overcrowding and children's educational attainment, and between overcrowding and children's social and emotional development. However, the research evidence on the effects of overcrowding on attainment is limited. It is also hard to separate any direct effect of overcrowding from the effect of other associated factors, such as poverty and degree of parental involvement in education. Current evidence suggests that any direct effect of overcrowding on attainment is likely to be small.</p>

Therefore a migrant teacher with the relevant qualification is given automatic recognition under the directive and they are awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) following an application to the GTC. Again, once they have gained QTS they will have to register with the GTC to teach in a maintained school.</p>

We have also appointed the National Remodelling Team to provide support to schools and local authorities in developing extended services. Good progress is being made with 4,400 schools, thus far, indicating their willingness to work on developing extended services.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.2/2">Total education spending by Newcastle-Upon-Tyne local authority in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;185 million, including spending on provision outside schools. The Department is currently working on figures for spending on school provision for 2004&ndash;05 that are comparable with the Dedicated Schools Grant, on both a cash and per pupil basis, and will place them in the Library as soon as they are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.2/3">The Dedicated Schools Grant 2005&ndash;06 baseline per pupil for Newcastle-Upon-Tyne is &pound;3,390. In 2006&ndash;07 the guaranteed per pupil unit of funding is &pound;3,640, an increase of 7.3 per cent. The total DSG allocation will not be finalised until May 2006 when the January 2006 pupil figures are finalised. In addition, while authorities must apply the whole of their allocation of DSG to their Schools Budget, they are free to add to it from their own resources. Final figures for total budgeted expenditure per pupil for 2006&ndash;07 may therefore be higher than the authority's allocation of DSG per pupil for that year.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills pays dedicated schools grant (DSG) to local authorities, to provide for those items that are included in each local authority's schools budget, which consists of the delegated budgets allocated to individual schools, and a budget for other provision for pupils which local authorities fund centrally. Each local authority then decides, in consultation with its Schools Forum, on the distribution of funding between its schools. The national formula for distribution of DSG does not take account of the level of deficit at an authority's schools and, normally, local authority formulae for distributing funding do not do so either. However, it is open to an authority to distribute additional funding to a school which is in financial difficulties. Where a school is in deficit, it should agree a plan with its local authority to eliminate the deficit over a three-year period.</p>

	<p pid="b.99W.2/1">The great majority of schools are safe and orderly places, but we are determined to reduce the risk of violence to an absolute minimum. To achieve that we are:</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/2" class="indent">legislating to give heads, teachers and other school staff a clear statutory power to discipline pupils, to reaffirm their statutory right to use reasonable force in certain circumstances and to give them a new power to search pupils for weapons;</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/3" class="indent">developing specific violence reduction advice and training, in co-operation with associations representing heads and other school staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/4">In addition we have:</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/5" class="indent">given every secondary school access to high-quality behaviour management training materials and expert advice from behaviour management consultants;</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/6" class="indent">funded extra support for schools facing the greatest challenges through our Excellence in Cities and Behaviour Improvement Programmes;</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/7" class="indent">provided &pound;120 million for school security improvements since 1997;</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/8" class="indent">given schools a legal toolkit on how to ban aggressive parents from the site and have them removed and prosecuted if they flout the ban; and</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/9" class="indent">helped to establish over 400 Safer Schools Partnerships that base police officers in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/10">Also, we are:</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/11" class="indent">giving every primary school access to high-quality training and curriculum materials for developing pupils' social, emotional and behavioural skills and developing similar materials for secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.2/12">The Department has confirmed that it is committed to backing head teachers' authority when pupils' behaviour warrants exclusion. We have made clear that heads can permanently exclude pupils who are very disruptive or violent even where this is a first or 'one off' offence. Guidance for exclusion appeal panels makes clear that an exclusion should not normally be overturned in a range of circumstances, including where there has been violence or the threat of violence. For less extreme offences head teachers may exclude pupils for a fixed period or may impose detention.</p>

	<p pid="b.101W.5/1">Latest figures published by Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that accepted applicants from England to full-time undergraduate courses rose by 9 per cent. in 2005/06. This was a larger than usual increase. We might therefore expect a slight fall in application numbers for the 2006 entry and then a return to a long-term upward trend, as experienced in 1997 and 1998 when the last major change to student support arrangements was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.5/2">Latest figures for 2006/07, covering students who applied by mid-October to Oxbridge or to medical and dentistry courses, show that applicants from the UK were down by 2 per cent. However, these are early figures and only give a partial picture. The first major milestone in the application cycle is mid-January, which is the advisory closing date for applications from UK domiciled students. Figures for the number of students who had applied by this point will be published by UCAS in mid-February, and these will give a more reliable indication of trends.</p>

	<p pid="b.106W.8/2">Defra provides a wide range of support for small businesses in the food sector, including food retail. For example, in 2004&ndash;05, the Department provided an additional &pound;2 million to the Business Link Network to support projects designed to look at different approaches to increase the uptake of advice to small businesses in economically underperforming rural areas. The Department supports the retention of shops in small settlements. In line with this, the Government have assisted local services by extending mandatory rate relief at 50 per cent. to include sole village public houses, petrol stations and village food shops under the village shop scheme. Planning guidance has also been provided to local authorities to adopt a positive approach to planning proposals designed to improve the viability, accessibility or community value of existing services and facilities such as village shops. The Department also provides a range of trade development, consumer awareness and business competitiveness initiatives, as well as funding under various grant schemes, to regional and local food businesses, including assisting small producers to gain access to markets. The Department also currently devotes just under &pound;4 million per year on schemes to encourages innovation in the food sector and pays particular attention to dissemination of research and development results to small and medium sized food and drink companies through, for example, a network of Regional Technology Transfer Centres.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.12/2">The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) was launched in April 2001 as a cross-departmental Initiative. It is designed to stimulate and increase the demand for research and development (R and D) from high tech small firms and give them the opportunity to demonstrate that they have the ability to undertake and deliver high quality R and D to the public sector. The participating government departments agreed to a target of purchasing at least 2.5 per cent. of their extramural R and D from SMEs by 2004&ndash;05. The Research Councils are also participating in their own arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.12/3">The Chancellor mandated departments with extramural R and D budgets to take part in the Initiative in his Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase>, at which time the implementation process commenced.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.12/4">Compliance with the mandatory requirement is monitored by the DTI's Small Business Service. The present focus is on making a success of the relatively newly introduced mandatory option. To this end, in order to improve access for small firms, departments will be required to use the Supplier Route to Government (CSRG29) website to offer Government R and D contract opportunities, when it is launched shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.12/5">Until the <phrase class="date" code="">16 March</phrase> Budget participation was voluntary. We aim to publish the voluntary phase performance figures for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 under SBRI as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.12/6">In future, we will publish performance figures on an annual basis. Apparent poor performance by individual departments will be investigated initially by the Small Business Service and Ministers will decide what action to take in order to bring about an improvement.</p>

While we acknowledge that there has been a reduction in recent years in some human rights abuses, there is still a lot that needs to be done to improve the situation. During the visit to the UK by Vice-President Santos in late November 2005, my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Lord Triesman of Tottenham, raised human rights issues. We have made it plain to the Government of Colombia that we are willing to work with them to help bring an improvement to the situation in the country, either as a bilateral partner or through our EU membership. We will continue to look for ways to bring about change, working with other partners such as the UN and civil society, to achieve this goal.</p>

FCO officials will meet the delegation to discuss human rights and hear their views on how the Government can best support civil society in Colombia to improve the human rights situation.</p>

This included their eligibility to leave the FCO on compulsory early retirement (CER) terms. In order to help achieve the FCO's efficiency targets, in particular the decision to reduce substantially the number of staff in the senior management structure, these provisions were extended to a wider range of senior officers in September 2004, using funding from the Treasury's Efficiency Challenge Fund. This exercise enabled some officers not eligible for CER (i.e. those aged under 50) to leave on compulsory early severance (CES) terms.

The Government will participate constructively in these discussions, but it would not be sensible to pre-empt now where the discussions might end up.

	<p pid="b.122W.6/2">I apologise for the delay in providing a substantive answer to the hon. Member's questions on this matter. This is because the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), to whom the Special Rapporteur's letter was addressed, was dissolved at the end of June 2004. An additional difficulty is that the incident to which it refers is alleged to have happened in February 2004, when there was a great deal of militia activity of this type in Iraq. We are working with the United States Government, via whom the letter was passed to the CPA, to ascertain whether they have any record of what happened to the letter and what action was taken on it. They are still researching the archives.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.6/3">Given the delay in providing a substantive reply, we will continue to pursue with the US authorities and, exceptionally, I will write to the hon. Member when we have more information, and will place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.124W.11/2">The risks posed by former Yugoslav army material is predominantly from undiscovered caches, and as such is difficult to quantify. UK troops are trained to respond appropriately to abandoned material: when ordnance is found, appropriate measures are taken to destroy it safely. UK troops also participate in Operation Harvest carried out by the EU Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, to discover and collect illegal ordnance. In a typical three month period, EUFOR collect some 500 small arms, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,500 hand grenades and over 250kg of explosives. The UK is also currently contributing over &pound;500,000 to destroy surplus stockpiles of small arms, light weaponry and ammunition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This project includes an initial target of 250,000 small arms and an additional overall aim of 10,000 tonnes of ammunition.</p>

	<p pid="b.125W.2/1">The grave situation in Zimbabwe is a direct consequence of the policies pursued by the Mugabe regime. We have been active in securing international scrutiny for Zimbabwe's actions, including by the UN Security Council. The report of the United Nations Secretary General's Special Envoy, Anna Tibaijuka, on the recent clearance of housing in Zimbabwe noted that these human rights violations could come under the remit of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, we judge that there is most unlikely to be agreement in the UN Security Council to refer Zimbabwe to the ICC at present and that failure to secure agreement would constitute a reverse.</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.2/1">The standard guidance issued to the Northern Ireland departments is detailed in the Cabinet Office publication 'non-departmental public bodies: A Guide for Departments.' That guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/2" class="indent">'A non-departmental public body's ability to employ and manage staff is an important element of its relative independence from Ministers. While the sponsor department must be careful not to detract from a non-departmental public body's independence, it does have a responsibility to assist a new non-departmental public body in making a sound start in its management policies. The sponsor department should encourage non-departmental public bodies to adopt Human Resource management practices which meet at least the minimum standards expected of public service employers.'</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/3">The Department of Finance and Personnel also issued 'Guidance on Codes of Practice for Board Members of Public Bodies' in March 1997. That stated that departments should ensure that executive non-departmental public bodies adopt new or revised codes based on the new guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/4">The guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/5" class="indent">'The board should ensure that the body's rules for the recruitment and management of staff provide for appointment and advancement on merit on the basis of equal opportunity for all applicants and staff. In filling senior staff appointments, the board should satisfy itself that an adequate field of qualified candidates is considered, and should always consider the merits of full and open competition. In recruiting external candidates, this should normally be used'.</p>

	<p pid="b.139W.0/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics for the United Kingdom of public sector employment from a quarterly survey of public sector organisations. However, estimates at local area level are not available.</p>

However, in this source the categorisation of employment in the public or private sector depends upon the responses from the individuals interviewed. As reported by ONS in October 2005 in the publication &quot;Public Sector Employment Trends&quot;, some individuals tend to misreport private sector employment as being in the public sector hence leading to overestimates of the share of public sector employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.139W.0/6" class="indent">With this reservation about the data quality, Table 1 shows the number of persons in private sector employment, by the specified splits, and for the public sector for people resident in the Denbighshire Unitary Authority as shown by the annual local area LFS for the 12 month periods ending February 1999 to February 2004. Table 2 shows similar data for persons resident in the Vale of Clwyd Parliamentary Constituency. Data for earlier years are not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.149W.0/1">The Government are committed to supporting positive contact arrangements following parental separation where it is in the best interests of, and is safe for, the child.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.0/2">Under the Children Act 1989, when making any decision pertinent to a child's upbringing, his or her welfare must be the court's paramount consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.0/3">Furthermore, with the introduction in January 2005 of &quot;Gateway&quot; forms, it is now easier for those suffering from domestic violence to bring it to the courts' attention at the start of contact and residence proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.0/4">The courts are required by the Children Act to consider any harm that a child may suffer before making a contact order. The definition of &quot;harm&quot; was expressly clarified by Section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, commenced <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, to include harm caused to a child by seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another person.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.0/5">In addition, the Children and Adoption Bill, currently before this House, would place a duty on CAFCASS to conduct a risk assessment in any private law proceedings where they are involved. This duty applies not only in cases where issues of harm are raised, but also in cases where the CAFCASS officer suspects that harm may be an issue. The CAFCASS officer is required to inform the court of the results of the risk assessment. That Bill would also allow courts to direct parties in contact proceedings to attend a domestic violence perpetrator programme to address violent behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.0/6">These measures, taken together, will ensure that the family courts are in a position to make decisions on what contact arrangements may be safe, based on all the facts, as early as possible in the proceedings.</p>

However, the Department also provides a wide variety of other arrangements which allow staff to work flexibly, and thereby help to promote diversity and the achievement of a better work-life balance, while still ensuring its business is conducted effectively. These include initiatives such as a flexitime scheme, part-time working, job sharing, part-year appointments, which are particularly suitable for people wishing to work only during school term time, compressed hours, fitting the working week into less that five full days, and special leave arrangements to cope with a variety of circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.166W.0/1">The Government body responsible for the regulation and licensing of medicines, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) operates a comprehensive anti-counterfeiting strategy, working with partners and stakeholders to ensure that the current safeguards work effectively and that vigilance against counterfeit medicines entering the legitimate United Kingdom supply chain is maintained. The key elements of this strategy include:</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.0/2" class="indent">the operation of Europe's largest medicines surveillance scheme to spot-check medicines on the UK market and then undertake laboratory analysis to test for authentication;</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.0/3" class="indent">increased checks by MHRA inspectors for counterfeits when inspecting pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors;</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.0/4" class="indent">collaborative international enforcement action and a training and education/awareness raising program amongst law enforcement agencies and pharmaceutical stakeholders, conducted domestically, at European level, and internationally between respective national medicines regulators.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.0/5">This is a long-term strategy which is backed by investment and a significant commitment of resources to minimise the risk of counterfeit medicines reaching patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.0/6">The supply and distribution of medicines is tightly controlled within the European community. All licensed wholesalers must comply with the community's agreed standards of good distribution practice and there exist strict licensing and regulatory requirements enshrined in UK domestic legislation to safeguard patients against potential hazards arising from poor distribution practices, for example, purchasing suspect or counterfeit products, poor storage, failing to establish the bona fides of suppliers and purchasers, inadequate record keeping, avoiding deterioration of the medicinal product, etc. The MHRA will take regulatory action where breaches are identified, which may take the form of revoking licenses or the instigation of criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.0/7">The MHRA is unaware of any fatalities within the UK directly attributable to counterfeit medicines, and does not conduct research into this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.167W.5/1">Genetic testing is one component of specialised medical genetics services. These are commissioned by specialised commissioning groups, funded by their constituent primary care trusts (PCTs) from PCTs' normal allocations to provide services for their local populations.</p>

	<p pid="b.168W.2/1">The UK Genetic Testing Network (UKGTN) is a network of the main national health service molecular genetic laboratories in the United Kingdom.

As many tests are rare and volumes are often low no laboratory offers all the tests listed but tests are sent to other laboratories as necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.169W.2/2">Birmingham and The Black Country strategic health authority reports that the board of Good Hope Hospital National Health Service Trust reviewed its strategic objectives in conjunction with its franchise partner, Tribal Secta, and decided that the best way to achieve foundation trust status by 2008 was to seek a local NHS partner to work with. As a result, the board has accepted interim management support from Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust and has given the new management team a specific remit to assess whether Good Hope Hospital NHS Trust can stand alone or should seek a merger partner. The contract with Tribal Secta, which was scheduled to run until August 2006, was therefore terminated by mutual agreement eight months early to facilitate the trust's new strategic objective of achieving foundation trust status.</p>

However, the South East London Strategic Health Authority has advised that the methodology used in the calculation of profit of sale of the former Greenwich District Hospital site did not change. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Trust made a net &pound;1.1 million surplus from the disposal of this site in 2004&ndash;05 arising from the difference between the net sale proceeds and the value of the asset in the trust's audited accounts.

	<p pid="b.170W.5/2">The new arrangements offer patients a wider range of modern equipment that will support them in the better management of their symptoms at home and help avoid the need for emergency admission to hospital, wherever possible. The new service contract also sets out specific delivery times for home oxygen, including where ordered on an emergency basis and where ordered to support a patient's discharge from hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.5/3">The new arrangements will continue to ensure that patients receive a safe and efficient home oxygen service. A detailed service specification emphasises the importance of arrangements to assess risks to patients using equipment and the contract makes provision for potential risks to supply. The new service is available on a 24 hours, seven days a week basis. A free phone service allows clinical staff to order the required service and seek advice at any time. Patients also have access to this service to provide support on any problems in using equipment or disruption to supply.</p>

	<p pid="b.175W.2/1">As part of the Department's commitment to reducing administrative burdens on the national health service, statistical information relating to medicines management in hospitals is not collected routinely. However, in 2003 NHS trusts were invited to self-assess their medicines management performance against developmental good practice standards contained in the Department's medicines management framework. Responses were considered by strategic health authorities (SHAs) and, where appropriate, action plans to address areas of weakness would be developed and implemented by the individual trusts. The information collected by SHAs suggested that by the end of 2004 some 67 per cent. of respondents expected to have systems in place to utilise patients' own drugs and enable self-administration, where appropriate. The Department does not hold results centrally for the medicines management framework. In line with &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, SHAs performance manage this process.</p>

	<p pid="b.184W.8/1">This information is not collected centrally in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.8/2">Several estimates have been made of the number of patient safety incidents that occur each year, and the number of people who die as a result. For example, estimates that have been widely quoted are of 850,000 incidents per year and 40,000 deaths in England. The accuracy of these estimates, and of similar estimates from other countries, has been widely debated. Such estimates are likely to depend on a number of factors including the source of the original data and the definitions used in the original studies from which the estimates were derived.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.8/3">Many patients, particularly those in acute care settings, are critically ill, and so grading the degree of harm caused by an incident is not straightforward. For example, some deaths following incidents may have occurred as a result of the underlying illness rather than as a result of the incident.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.8/4">The Government is concerned about assuring and improving the safety of care for NHS patients. As part of our national health service patient safety programme, we established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) in July 2001 to improve the safety of NHS patient care. The NPSA has introduced a national reporting and learning system for patient safety incidents and issued a number of patient safety solutions to the NHS to improve the safety of care for areas of known risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.8/5">The reporting and learning system will, in time, enable us to understand the nature and extent of adverse events in the NHS more fully, and take action to prevent them being repeated. All NHS organisations in England and Wales are now reporting patient safety incidents to the national system.</p>

	<p pid="b.185W.2/1">Health care provided for national health service patients by establishments outside the NHS is covered by the provisions of the Care Standards Act 2000 and the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/2">Those private healthcare establishments, including independent hospitals or clinics, or medical agencies providing services to NHS patients, that are subject to registration with, and inspection by, the Healthcare Commission under the Care Standards Act are required to comply with the Private and Voluntary Healthcare (England) Regulations 2001 and the National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Independent Health Care published in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/3">Within this framework, the Healthcare Commission uses three essential suitability criteria to determine whether persons, organisations and services are suitable to operate:</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/4" class="indent">fitness of premises&mdash;that premises are fit for the purpose of the service;</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/5" class="indent">fitness of persons&mdash;that the persons running and managing the service, any person nominated as the responsible individual on behalf of an organisation, and any staff or other persons working for the service are fit to do so; and</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/6" class="indent">fitness of services and facilities&mdash;that the treatment, services and facilities (including policies and procedures) meet the requirements of the Private and Voluntary Healthcare Regulations, are suitable and safe and meet the needs of the service users as interpreted through the NMS for the service concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/7">The registration process has been designed to assess each application against these criteria. The process includes interviews with the applicants, checks on their character and an inspection or pre-registration visit to the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/8">The registered provider is responsible for providing a safe and effective service. This includes having a health and safety policy and risk assessments in place and audit systems to assess the quality of care.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/9">The Healthcare Commission currently inspects all registered establishments annually. Establishments are inspected against the requirements of the 2001 regulations and the NMS. Inspections focus on perceived areas of risk in each establishment. Assessment managers prepare written reports setting out requirements, recommendations, and areas of concern identified during inspections. These reports, which are published and available on the Commission's website, include timetables for compliance with any specific requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/10">In addition, health care provided for NHS patients, be it by the NHS or for the NHS by a non-NHS establishment, is reviewed by the Healthcare Commission under the 2003 Act, against the NHS standards&mdash;&quot;Standards for Better Health&quot;&mdash;published by the Secretary of State in July 2004. As part of its review process, the Healthcare Commission ensures that services for NHS patients delivered from outside the NHS are commissioned against these standards, including those covering patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/11">Those services contracted directly by the Department from non-NHS organisations are commissioned using the framework of the &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot; and where appropriate are reviewed against the Private and Voluntary Healthcare Regulations and NMS.</p>

	<p pid="b.186W.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Issuing an application to be granted permission to apply for judicial review is not a step the RCN took lightly.

	<p pid="b.186W.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The RCN looks forward to working closely with the Government to ensure that nurses, and other health care workers, are involved in any decisions made about the future of the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.186W.2/9">The RCN have been fully involved in discussions around the White Paper, which is due to be published at the end of January, and will set out a vision for the future of local health and care services that will address questions about how, when and in what settings primary care services are delivered.</p>

This shows that it is operating at costs 3 per cent. above the national average. An organisation with costs equal to the national average for this activity will score 100. Private finance initiative costs are apportioned to activity by the trusts themselves and not separately identified in reference costs submissions.</p>

The South East London Strategic Health Authority (SHA) has advised that following the HM Treasury's discount rate for the provisions for 3.5 per cent. and 2.2 per cent., the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Trust has applied this directive to the deferred asset created to transfer ownership of the private finance initiative hospital back to the national health service over the term of the contract.

	<p pid="b.189W.8/1">As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with advice from independent experts. The United Kingdom's Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on vaccine safety have thoroughly reviewed the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines, including alleged links with neurodevelopmental disorders, and kept this under close review.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.8/2">In 2001, the CSM, now the Commission for Human Medicines, conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data on a number of occasions as it has emerged. Following concerns in the United States of America (USA) about the possible toxicity of thiomersal-containing vaccines, the Department funded a study using the UK's general practice research database to investigate whether there is a relationship between the amount of thiomersal that an infant receives through vaccination at a young age and subsequent neurological disorders. Data from a study involving over a 100,000 UK children were considered by CSM in 2003. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children and a study from the USA have also specifically investigated the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence of a causal association with subsequent neurodevelopment disorders, including autism.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.8/3">The advice of CSM stands that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible allergic reactions, typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the USA's Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency. The balance of benefits and risks of thiomersal-containing vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.8/4">None of the vaccines that are currently part of the recommended childhood immunisation programme contain mercury.</p>

	<p pid="b.191W.8/1">The Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) recommends that breastfed infants under six months do not need vitamin supplements provided the mother had an adequate vitamin status during pregnancy. From age six months, infants receiving breast milk as their main drink should be given supplements of vitamins A and D. Between the ages of one to five years, vitamins A and D supplements should be given unless adequate vitamin status can be assured from a diverse diet containing vitamins A and D rich foods and from moderate exposure to sunlight.</p>
	<p pid="b.191W.8/2">The Department provides free vitamin supplements to children aged under five under the welfare food scheme, and this supplement provides seven micrograms of vitamin D3 per day. COMA also recommends a supplement for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers of 10 meg per day which we expect to provide under the healthy start scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.191W.8/3">The levels of vitamin D in various foods for infants are controlled by the Processed Cereal-based Foods and Baby Food for Infants and Young Children (England) Regulations 2004. These regulations set minimum and maximum levels for the vitamin D content of processed cereal-based foods for infants (0.25 to 0.75 per 100 kilojoules or 1 to 3 per 100 kilocalories).</p>
