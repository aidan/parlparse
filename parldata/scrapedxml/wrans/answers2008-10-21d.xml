	<p pid="d.153W.6/1">I have no current plans to introduce sea angling-only areas. However, DEFRA is funding research to explore whether closing specific coastal areas to commercial fishing with nets and lines (alongside limits on angling such as catch and release requirements or bag limits) would improve sea bass survival. The project is also assessing whether such restricted-catch areas could provide benefits to anglers. Emerging results from this project will be published shortly and discussed with stakeholders, although the final report is not due until 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.153W.6/2">In inland waters, the vast majority of fishing is by angling and in many lakes and rivers the only form of fishing allowed is angling. The Environment Agency has responsibility for regulating salmon and freshwater fisheries in England and Wales. It has a statutory duty to maintain, improve and develop these fisheries. The Environment Agency's approach is to seek to ensure first that target stocks of fish are maintained at satisfactory levels and that fishing is undertaken in a sustainable way. In some places only angling is permitted. Where different fishing methods are allowed, the level of fishing is regulated by controls on effort and the restrictions on exploitation are balanced between the types of fishing allowed, for example, between nets and rods.</p>

	<p pid="d.159W.2/1">A range of proposals for altering the table valuation system were presented to DEFRA by members of the Cattle Compensation Advisory Group (a stakeholder group set up in spring 2006 to monitor the roll-out of the table valuation system). We identified problems with these proposals&mdash;which focused on premium and organic cattle&mdash;and so did not take them forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.159W.2/2">The issue of whether a different approach is required when compensating for 'high value' cattle is at the heart of an ongoing legal challenge against DEFRA's table valuation based compensation system. DEFRA have lodged an appeal against the court's finding that it is unlawful to use table valuations for 'high value' stock. Any changes to the table valuation system will need to take into account the judgment of the Appeals Court, which is due to hear this case in March next year.</p>

	<p pid="d.159W.5/1">We are continuously monitoring the impacts of pre-movement testing and key statistics are published on the DEFRA website each month. Evidence to date is encouraging and shows that new TB incidents are being prevented by pre-movement tests as well as Government-funded routine surveillance tests. The policy is also picking up infection earlier in high risk herds. Latest published data show that pre-movement testing led to the detection of 834 reactors in 458 herds in England between March 2006 and the end of July 2008.</p>

Therefore, as part of the UK research programme we are developing what is known as a differential diagnostic test to allow vaccinated animals to be differentiated from infected animals (DIVA).

	<p pid="d.164W.5/2">The subsequent Review of Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Legislative Project identified that proposals to address obstructions to the free passage of fish in inland waters could be introduced through powers to implement the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). A consultation on these proposals will be issued shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.164W.5/3">Those recommendations, accepted by Government and identified as needing change to primary legislation and subsequently identified as critical by the Review of Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Legislative Project 2006 informed chapter 3, part 7 of the draft Marine Bill, published in April this year. These remain an integral part of the Marine Bill, which will be introduced subject to the availability of parliamentary time.</p>
	<p pid="d.164W.5/4">Most of the recommendations which the Government accepted, and which do not require new primary legislation have been completed: for example, the introduction of wider range of payment methods for rod licences, and elver/eel catch returns. Others, while being addressed, will take longer to complete, such as addressing the problem of siltation arising from agriculture. A copy of the complete table will be made available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.164W.5/5">The Government are committed to ensuring that salmon, trout, eels and freshwater fish should be managed in a modern way; to protect stocks for sustainable fishing, to protect habitats and reflects the importance of angling to the rural economy in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="d.165W.2/1">Native stocks of migratory and freshwater fish are subject to extensive annual monitoring by the Environment Agency through the collection of catch statistics, programmes of river surveys, and other scientific sampling. These data are used to assess significant changes in stocks at the river catchment (or individual stillwater) level so that appropriate management interventions can be made. 'Stock' estimates are only collated at a national level for salmon (table 1).</p>
	<p pid="d.165W.2/2">The Environment Agency recently published a snapshot review of the status of the migratory and freshwater fisheries of England and Wales &quot;Our Nations' Fisheries&quot;. This report concluded that numbers of coarse fish (which includes 21 species) are increasing in many of our rivers, and sea trout are also generally doing very well. However, stocks of salmon and eel are depleted and this is thought to be due, in part at least, to environmental changes affecting the fish during the marine phases of their life cycles.</p>
	<p pid="d.165W.2/3">For salmon, detailed stock monitoring data are published annually in a report on the status of stocks and fisheries in England and Wales. Catch data for salmon and migratory trout, for both net and rod fisheries, are also published annually (totals provided in table 1). Such data are not systematically recorded and collated for other migratory and freshwater fish species. The aforementioned reports are available on the Environment Agency website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.166W.2/2">At the next level, the EA is implementing the National Trout and Grayling Fisheries Strategy published in 2003 and, earlier this year, the Agency initiated its new strategy (2008 to 2021) for 'better sea trout and salmon fisheries'. The EA has in place salmon action plans for 64 principal salmon rivers.</p>

	<p pid="d.166W.2/4">The Water Framework Directive requires the production of river basin management plans to tackle the major impacts on the whole water environment and to work towards achievement of good ecological status. The measures within these plans will be important in supporting improved fish stocks. The plans are now being drafted and must be finally approved by Ministers in December 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.170W.0/1">In December 2007, the European Commission issued an open call for tenders in relation to Studies and pilot projects for carrying out the Common Fisheries Policy (Call No. FISH/2007/07). These studies included one which was intended to form the basis of the long-planned EU Discard Atlas. The study, which was lot four of the call for tenders, was required to provide a review of the current knowledge about discards in EU fisheries, and a feasibility study on a fisheries information system for these. Specifically, the aim of the project was given as:</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.0/2" class="indent">To compile and analyse all the information collected so far by the discard sampling programmes under the Data Control Regulation (DCR) on both the discarded and the retained fractions of the catch, in order to reply to questions such as how much, what, where and why discards occur. The study shall cover all main fishing regions of the EU: (i) the Baltic, (ii) the North Sea, (iii) the North Western Atlantic Waters, (iv) the Southern Western Atlantic Waters and (v) the Mediterranean.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.0/3" class="indent">At the same time, to assess the feasibility of an information system offering easy and interactive access to fisheries data including information on fishing effort and catches. This feasibility study should consider, in addition to the geographical areas mentioned above, the Black Sea once data from that area is available through the DCR.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.0/4">The study would have required extensive work and co-operation between all European marine fisheries research institutes, in order to achieve these aims. However, the finances on offer to perform the study were relatively limited, and as far as we are aware, no bids to do the work were submitted before the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-25">25 February 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.170W.6/1">Quantities of discards are estimated quarterly using data collected by scientific observers aboard commercial fishing vessels. They are required to record the quantity landed and discarded, and the species and size composition of the discards each time the fishing gear is hauled. Deploying scientific observers in this manner is expensive and time consuming, with the result that it is usually only possible to sample a small proportion of the overall fishing trips in a given area. As a result, it is necessary to extrapolate from the limited sampling to provide estimates for the entire fleet. Although the sampling is intended to cover a representative sample of the fleet, this does mean that the estimates of total discards are subject to uncertainty.</p>

Legislation was introduced in April 2007 which brought in for the first time domestic controls of koi herpesvirus (KHV) and made it a notifiable disease in the UK. We will be bringing in shortly broad legislation to implement Council Directive 2006/88 and to provide further protective measures against spread of disease. These notably will include the requirement for fish farms and importers of ornamental fish to be authorised and for angling clubs to be registered. Prior to KHV disease becoming notifiable in April 2007, outbreak numbers were not officially recorded and so are unreliable. Since April 2007 there have been 22 confirmed outbreaks, 10 cases in 2007 and 12 new outbreaks confirmed so far this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.175W.5/1">Novel alien species continue to appear in UK waters. Pathways include entry via commercial shipping (e.g. hull fouling, ballast water transfers) and the pet trade (aquarium and garden pond plants and animals released by the general public to open waters). The complexity of the aquatic environment means the impact of non-native fish introductions on our freshwater fisheries is often difficult to detect.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.5/2">It has long been recognised that the spread of non-native species can have far-reaching and undesirable ecological consequences for animal and plant communities in the marine environment and freshwater fisheries. Introduced non-native fish can have direct effects on native species, for example by predation, competition (for space and food) hybridisation (inter-breeding), or can upset the natural balance that operates between native species. Non-native species can also introduce and spread novel diseases and parasites to which our native species may have little or no resistance.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.5/3">Once established it can be extremely difficult and costly, and in some cases impossible, to control or eradicate an invasive species. While not all introduced non-native species will become invasive, they can still have adverse impacts. Given this, and the fact that their precise impact can be unpredictable, a precautionary approach is appropriate for managing the keeping and release of such species.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.5/4">My Department recognises the threats that non-native species can pose to marine and freshwater environments and has supported the development of risk analysis protocols to identify introduced species of potentially high risk, and where possible to assess in advance the impacts posed by these species. Following on from the DEFRA review of non-native species policy, a body has now been established, the GB Non-native Species Mechanism, to review the problems posed by non-native species and, as appropriate, to co-ordinate control and eradication measures by the appropriate agencies.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.5/5">The key measure in controlling the spread of non-native fish has been the Import of Live Fish Act (ILFA). Under the ILFA Orders it is illegal to keep or release any of the listed species in any water (including tanks and ponds) without a licence. Any person wishing to hold, keep or release any of the listed species is required to be in possession of a licence before obtaining the fish. Some introductions of species already present in England and Wales are allowed, where there is demonstrable benefits and there is no risk to the wider environment. But, there is a presumption against approving consents for the introduction of new non-native populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.5/6">In Wales the Welsh Assembly Government are looking into reintroducing consents under the Molluscan Shellfish (Control of Deposit) Order 1974 to attempt to prevent accidental introductions and the countryside council for Wales along with the main mussel producers in the Menai Straits have produced a code of good practice to avoid introductions. The countryside council for Wales have also distributed 'wanted cards' to help identify 8 marine non-native invasive species.</p>

	<p pid="d.176W.2/1">DEFRA and the devolved administrations operate regimes which aim to prevent the entry of certain non-native species into the UK, such as inspections under plant health legislation. In the course of their work DEFRA's plant health and seeds inspectors and their equivalents in the devolved administrations inspect consignments of plants and plant products to ensure that they are free of non-native plant pests and diseases of concern.</p>
	<p pid="d.176W.2/2">However some non-native species legitimately used, for example in horticulture, as pets or in research can also have the potential to become invasive. It is important therefore to prevent their introduction into the wild. In May, jointly with the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government, my Department published the Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain. This sets out our proposals for more effective and better co-ordinated action to tackle invasive non-native species. Prevention of the introduction of such species into the wild is one of the key themes to which other parts of the strategy will also contribute. In addition to existing measures such as legislative controls under wildlife and fisheries legislation we plan to implement a structured programme of work on raising awareness and education both generally and in a targeted way, developing effective risk analysis capacity, implementing online reporting with improved surveillance and monitoring, and to develop capacity to respond quickly to future threats.</p>
	<p pid="d.176W.2/3">Management of invasive species already established in the UK must be considered on a case by case approach which will take into account the feasibility and scale at which action could effectively be taken. The Strategy offers a framework for such decision-making at a national scale. Control options will vary from national, regional or local eradication to management or containment.</p>

	<p pid="d.182W.8/1">Each water company is required to maintain its assets so that it can provide services to consumers over the long-term, while protecting the environment. In its role as the independent economic regulator for the water industry, Ofwat monitors how well each company is maintaining its assets in its annual serviceability assessments. Serviceability is the capability of a system of assets to deliver the right level of service to consumers now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.8/2">During price reviews, Ofwat assesses each company's outputs and its plans for future maintenance. Price limits are set at a level that allows for sufficient maintenance of the asset systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.8/3">Companies that have had a deteriorating assessment have been required to produce action plans to deliver stable serviceability.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.8/4">In February 2006, Ofwat wrote to all water and sewerage companies (MD212, 'Asset Management Planning to Maintain Serviceability'). This signalled Ofwat's intention that if a company cannot demonstrate stable serviceability at the price review in 2009 it will treat this as a shortfall in delivery. Shortfalls are where a company fails to deliver outputs, targets or service levels specified in price limits. Ofwat recovers the money set aside for these, on behalf of customers, when it next sets price limits.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.8/5">A further letter (PR09/06, 'Setting Price Limits&mdash;Logging Down and Shortfalling' in November 2007) sets out how shortfalls would be applied in respect of failure to deliver serviceability outputs (section 2.1). This has focused the attention of the water and sewerage companies on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.8/6">Ofwat's work over the last few years has culminated in its ability to report a marked improvement in serviceability for 2007-08.

On the advice of the inspectorate, the drinking water regulations were amended in 2007.

	<p pid="d.188W.2/1">Since World War 1, the nature and amount of awards under the War Pension Scheme has depended on the assessed degree of disablement due to service.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.2/2">Assessment of the degree of disablement is by comparing the condition of the individual as disabled by service with the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex. From this time a distinction has always been drawn between assessments of under 20 per cent. and those of 20 per cent. or more. The reason why the threshold was originally set at 20 per cent. is not known.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.2/3">Before <phrase class="date" code="1962-04-01">1 April 1962</phrase>, awards to &quot;other ranks&quot; with an assessment of less than 20 per cent. were in the form of a weekly allowance for a prescribed period followed in some cases by a terminal lump sum gratuity. For officers only gratuities were paid. A change in 1962 aligned the treatment of all members of the armed forces, so that since that date, all awards for disablement assessed at less than 20 per cent. have been in the form of a one off gratuity, regardless of rank.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.2/4">Assessments of 20 per cent. or more have always given rise to a continuing pension for all ranks. As part of a periodic review of the War Pension Scheme one of the options under consideration is to raise the 20 per cent. assessment level at which a pension becomes payable for new claims.</p>

	<p pid="d.192W.8/1">Ministers from the Departments responsible for countering piracy have recently agreed that HMG should take a more proactive stance on dealing with this issue, recognising that this will be best achieved with international partners including NATO, the EU and coalition forces already in the Gulf of Aden.</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.8/2">We continue to work with our EU partners on measures to implement UNSCRs 1816 and 1838. In September we supported the establishment of an EU cell that aims to co-ordinate military escorts to World Food Programme shipping. We have also supported EU planning for a counter-piracy naval operation off the coast of Somalia, and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October</phrase> the EU Political and Security Committee decided to accept the offer made by the UK to provide the Operation Commander (Rear Admiral Phil Jones) and the Operation HQ (the Multinational Headquarters at Northwood).</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.8/3">A formal decision from the EU member states to allow planning for the operation to proceed to the next stage is expected in the next ten days. We have made it clear that the UK offer is conditional on sufficient forces being generated for the mission to be effective. Current estimates are for the operation to be launched towards the end of 2008, probably in December, once force generation and detailed planning is complete.</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.8/4">The key task of the operation will be to ensure the safe delivery of World Food Programme and other vital humanitarian deliveries to Somalia, but also to deter attacks on European and other shipping. EU partners are agreed that the ESDP operation is closely co-ordinated with other actors in the region, including Combined Task Force150 and NATO.</p>
	<p pid="d.192W.8/5">The ESDP operation will not solve the long-term problems of Somalia which are the root causes of piracy, and we will continue working with our international partners to restore governance.</p>

	<p pid="d.198W.5/1">The Scottish Parliament and local government elections in 2007 shared a wide range of facilities and services and as a consequence, were jointly funded by the Scotland Office and local authorities. All parties therefore benefited from such an arrangement. An arrangement whereby both elections were held on different days would significantly add to the aggregate costs. A final figure for the costs of the Scottish Parliament election in 2007 is not yet available as accounts from returning officers are still being assessed; the initial estimate of cost was &pound;19 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.198W.9/2">However, recognising that e-crime is one of the most rapidly expanding forms of criminality, during that event the Attorney-General announced the establishment of the Global Prosecutors' E-Crime Network (GPEN). This is an initiative developed by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in conjunction with the IAP which recognises the fact that prosecutors play a very significant role in combating all forms of e-crime, including hate crime on the internet, and that their knowledge and advice at an early stage of police investigations can be fundamental to success. The GPEN will comprise: a secure database for e-crime prosecution specialists from across the world; a channel for exchanging advice, queries and best practice between prosecutors; and host e-crime material including training packages and legal guidance that will constitute a virtual college for those who need access to training, and support. It will become fully operational early next year and will help keep prosecutors on top of the latest trends and developments in terms of technology, the law in other jurisdictions, and emerging forms of criminality&mdash;thereby raising standards of knowledge and improving prospects for successful prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.0/1">The associated cost to the Department for International Development (DFID) in contributing to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Humanitarian Pooled Fund is difficult to accurately disaggregate from the overall administrative costs of DFID in DRC. Administration costs for DFID DRC in 2007-08 are 4.4 per cent., with expenditure of just over &pound;72 million. However, now the Pooled Fund is up and running, the costs of our oversight, monitoring and evaluation and lobbying for humanitarian reforms will be much less than 4.4 per cent. of our &pound;30 million contribution to the pooled fund.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.0/2">The DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund (about &pound;58 million in 2007) is managed by the United Nations (UN), with technical humanitarian expertise provided by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and financial management provided by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The management costs associated with the pooled fund are:</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.0/3" class="indent">In 2008, OCHA/UNDP will require approximately &pound;500,000 to provide the technical and managerial expertise, amounting to 0.5 per cent. of the fund.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.0/4" class="indent">UNDP charges 1 per cent. for the overall financial management of the fund, (about &pound;580,000 in 2007).</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.0/5" class="indent">UNDP also manages grants made directly to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and charges a further 5 per cent. to administer these (about &pound;1 million in 2007).</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.0/6" class="indent">Thus a total of about &pound;2.08 million (about 3.5 per cent.) is spent to administer the Pooled Fund. As per standard practice, each UN agency and NGO receiving Pooled Funds can charge an overhead fee of up to 7 per cent. for each grant received.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.0/7" class="indent">In 2007 the Pooled Fund contributed to over 200 projects. A complete analysis of the results achieved by the fund is available in the 2007 Annual Report. The report can be downloaded on-line from:</p>

	<p pid="d.205W.0/2">The communications sector is subject to regulation under the Communications Act 2003 which implements the overarching European legislation in this area. That European legislation was amended in 2007 by a regulation to address the problem of the high cost of voice roaming while abroad. The regulation acknowledged that the costs of SMS and data roaming would need to be reviewed with a view to further regulation if the relevant charges did not decline through market forces.</p>
	<p pid="d.205W.0/3">In the light of their review of that regulation, the Commission has proposed an amending regulation to extend the present regulation of voice calls, establish a ceiling for the costs of text messages sent while abroad, and a ceiling on the wholesale charges that apply to data roaming (this largely relates to mobile internet access through laptops and phones). While the detail of the regulation has still to be negotiated, the proposal offers the prospect of real gains to UK consumers over and above the competitive packages already on offer in the UK, and the UK Government will be working with European partners to achieve that result.</p>

	<p pid="d.208W.0/1">We rely on United Nations' agencies to provide us with information on cross-border violence between the Central African Republic (CAR) and Darfur. They advise that bandit and poacher groups routinely carry out cross-border raids. They have reports of one cross-border attack on the town of Am Dafok in the CAR at the end of September by a group that retreated to a base in Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.0/2">We cannot assess the number of those displaced because of such cross-border violence. However, the number of people internally displaced in CAR has fallen this year, and now stands at 108,000. The number displaced has also fallen in the Vakaga prefecture, which borders southern Darfur. According to the UN, security in the region has improved in recent months, partially as a result of the deployment of EUFOR, the EU Force in eastern Chad and north-eastern CAR.</p>

	<p pid="d.208W.3/1">We remain concerned about the human rights situation in China and continue to devote considerable attention to encouraging respect for international standards. In certain areas, China's hosting of the Olympics has led to improvements. For example, we welcomed the media regulations put in place for foreign journalists prior to the games and are encouraged by indications that China will maintain a more flexible reporting regime for foreign media. We also welcome the higher profile given to the rights of disabled persons following the Paralympics and China's ratification of the International Covenant on the Rights of Disabled People earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.3/2">None the less, we were disappointed that greater improvements in human rights did not take place in the run-up to the Olympic Games, and are concerned that in certain areas reports of human rights violations have increased. We remain particularly concerned about the situation in Tibet, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has raised recently with Premier Wen and President Hu, and continue to urge transparency and substantive dialogue as the way to address the underlying human rights issues. We were also disappointed that the areas designated for authorised protests set up during the Olympic Games were not utilised.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.3/3">We continue to believe that the extension of personal freedoms would be in China's own interest, and we will continue to encourage China to meet its commitments to international human rights standards, including through ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Human rights will continue to be an area of major focus in our engagement with China in the years ahead.</p>

All Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff serving in Afghanistan and Iraq undergo a range of health checks, both physical and psychological, before, during and after their deployments. We review this process regularly to ensure that it complies with clinical best practice.

	<p pid="d.220W.14/1">It is not possible to identify those crimes in which a gun or a knife was used as these will be charged according to the generic offence, for example, murder, manslaughter, wounding, etc. The only statistics available are those for specific weapons related offences, which are largely for possession. The following table shows the number of persons sentenced to immediate custody for indictable offences relating to weapons.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.14/2">All offenders sentenced to custody serve their full sentence as prescribed by law. A custodial sentence comprises two parts. The first part is spent in custody and the second part is served on licence in the community. In addition, some offenders subject to determinate sentences may benefit from the home detention curfew (HDC), early removal scheme (ERS) or end of custody licence (ECL) scheme, which provide for release earlier than the statutory release date of the sentence under certain circumstances. Certain violent offenders are presumed unsuitable for HDC unless there are exceptional circumstances and are ineligible for ECL. In addition, certain categories of prisoner are currently excluded from ERS, for example, extended sentence prisoners and those subject to sex offender registration. None of these schemes apply to prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence. These sentences do not have a statutory release date and release is determined by the Parole Board.</p>

A number of foreign national prisoners subject to deportation would also have been removed early under the early removal scheme but figures on this for 2006 are not available.

	<p pid="d.233W.5/1">The Secretary of State's policy on planning obligations is set out in Government Circular 05/05, which is available in the Library of the House. The Secretary of State's policy says that planning obligations (also known as section 106 agreements) can be attached to a planning permission to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. Such obligations can prescribe the nature of development, compensate for loss or damage created by a development, or mitigate a development's impact. Planning obligations must be directly relevant to the proposed development. However, the impacts of a proposed development may extend beyond the immediate development site and therefore, developer contributions can be used to mitigate these off-site.</p>
	<p pid="d.233W.5/2">Contributions may either be in kind or in the form of a financial contribution. Policies on types of payment, including pooling and maintenance payments, should be set out in local development frameworks. There should be a clear audit trail between the contribution made and the infrastructure provided. The use of developer contributions under section 106 agreements should reflect the purpose for which they were collected and be directly relevant to the proposed development. Therefore, monies collected under section 106 agreements should not be used to pay for infrastructure which was not intended by the original agreement. Planning obligations should never be used purely as a means of securing for the local community a share in the profits of development. The policy indicates that in the event that contributions are made towards specific infrastructure provision but the infrastructure is not provided within an agreed timeframe, arrangements should be made for contributions to be returned to developers. Local planning authorities must take the Secretary of State's policy into account and have reasons for departing from it.</p>

	<p pid="d.236W.5/1">As my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey) stated when the Planning Bill was in Commons Committee, our principal starting point is that almost all developments will have some imposition and impact on the need for infrastructure, and some call on local services or amenities&mdash;including those developments that promote public health, physical activity and sport. For instance, a new swimming pool or sports centre will have impacts upon the local road network. In addition, exemptions to, or reductions from, CIL may cause complexity and distortion and reduce fairness. Therefore, the Government envisage that most types of development will be liable to pay CIL.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.5/2">The Government will however consider the case for exemptions when consulting on the regulations to implement CIL, and will set out the exemptions available in the final regulations. Any exemptions we create must be legally robust and based on coherent criteria, such as those set out at page 60 of the CIL policy document published in August.</p>

	<p pid="d.236W.11/1">This summer's consultation on the Government's Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) has looked at how the UK is to achieve its share of the target that 20 per cent. of the EU's energy consumption must come from renewable sources by 2020. The RES explains that the substantial switch to renewables in the timescale required cannot be achieved without the right response from the planning system. National planning policies already expect regional and local planners to actively plan for and support renewable energy generation. The RES acknowledges however that it may not always be clear to local planning authorities, applicants and other users how elements of this framework come together in any given case. We have therefore said we will ensure our planning policies for renewable energy are updated quickly to reflect the new RES when in place next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.11/2">Planning Policy Statement 22 on renewable energy already makes it clear that the very special circumstances required to justify the grant of planning permission for inappropriate development in a green belt may include the wider environmental benefits associated with increased production of energy from renewable sources. Planning authorities have also been advised not to reject planning applications simply because the level of output is small.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.11/3">Separately, we are also freeing up from the need to apply for planning permission those small-scale renewable energy projects that can be supported as permitted development. In April 2008 amendments were made to the General Permitted Development Order which enable small-scale domestic microgeneration development including solar ground and water-source heat pumps, biomass heating and combined heat and power systems to proceed without the need for a specific planning application. Further amendments are planned for micro wind turbines and air source heat pumps once the issue of potential nuisance to neighbours from noise has been resolved. We are also considering the scope for extending permitted development rights to non-domestic small-scale renewables.</p>

	<p pid="d.248W.11/2">Government funding was never committed to the 2009 Deaflympics. Funding has previously consisted of a single supplementary payment of &pound;75,000 from UK Sport to the British Deaflympic team in 2005. UK Sport have since developed a new strategy focused on delivering success in the Paralympics and Olympics&mdash;through which deaf athletes are eligible for funding. From April 2005 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, UK Sport also provided &pound;42,000 a year for a development post in UK Deaf Sport. This funding has now ceased, bringing UK Deaf Sport in line with other national disability sports organisations. The English Federation of Disability Sport, funded by Sport England, provides these organisations with support at the grass-roots level. The Government remain hopeful that a British team will go to Taipei and that consequently deaf athletes will not be affected.</p>

	<p pid="d.274W.4/1">Aimhigher is an important part of our policies to widen participation in higher education. Evidence from Excellence Challenge (a predecessor initiative which provided activities similar to those of Aimhigher) showed that, after just 18 months of the programme, it was having a significant effect on the aspirations of young people, and their attainment levels. The budget for Aimhigher for 2008-09 is &pound;85.5 million, including contributions from the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Department of Health. &pound;3 million is for the new Aimhigher Associates initiative, which links undergraduates with young people at school or college to help them through educational transitions and into university.</p>
	<p pid="d.274W.4/2">Our policies are succeeding: the proportion of UK domiciled, young, full-time, first degree entrants to English higher education institutions who were from lower socio-economic groups rose from 27.9 per cent. in 2002/03 to 29.8 per cent. in 2006/07.</p>

That is why we have asked the UK Commission for Employment and Skills to produce an annual employment and skills assessment. The UK Commission will also continue the series of skill projections, that was established by government some years ago. In addition each of the 25 Sector Skills Councils has completed a Sector Skills Agreement, which map out exactly what skills employers need their work force to have and how these skills will be supplied.</p>

	<p pid="d.280W.5/1">This Government introduced the statutory minimum bus concession in 2001 and subsequently improved the original half-fare minimum to free local travel in 2006. The successful introduction of the England-wide concessionary travel in April this year was a major achievement, but it represented a further significant change for both local authorities and the bus industry. As such, our current focus is very much on ensuring the continued success of the new concession.</p>
	<p pid="d.280W.5/2">We are currently considering possible improvements to the administration of concessionary travel and are likely to consult on some possible changes later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="d.280W.5/3">In July this year it was announced that by <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>, the statutory bus concession in England will be extended to include service personnel and veterans under the age of 60, who were seriously injured in service and are resident in England. Aside from this there are no further plans at present to extend the statutory minimum to different times, other modes, community transport or additional groups of people.</p>

	<p pid="d.280W.8/1">Most of the funding for concessionary travel is part of a block within the Revenue Support Grant (RSG), so it is not possible to disaggregate information for concessionary fares. The latest available figures show that local authorities spent, in total, &pound;735.2 million on concessionary travel in 2006-07. We would expect a slightly higher figure for 2007-08 and a more significant increase for 2008-09 with the advent of all-England travel but it is too early to fully establish the impact of the new concession.</p>
	<p pid="d.280W.8/2">The Government are paying a special grant directly to Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs) to meet the extra cost of the England-wide bus concession from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. Unlike RSG funding this is identifiable at &pound;212 million in 2008-09, rising to &pound;217m in 2009-10. The new funding is in addition to existing concessionary fares funding through RSG. The Government remain confident that funding for statutory concessionary fares is sufficient to meet the cost to TCAs.</p>

	<p pid="d.282W.11/1">Our latest estimate (2005) for uninsured driving is based on a comparison of the vehicle register, maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the motor insurance database. The estimate is about 2.1 million licensed vehicles (about 6.5 per cent. of the UK total) are being driven by uninsured drivers. Measures introduced to tackle uninsured driving include police powers to seize vehicles used on the road uninsured, and improved police powers to access information contained in the insurance industry's database. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced a new offence of being a registered keeper for which there is no valid motor insurance. Further regulations are required to bring the provisions into force and the detail of this scheme for continuous insurance enforcement will be subject to consultation later this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.11/2">The most recent results of the &quot;on the road&quot; compliance survey, published in 2006, showed that around 4.2 per cent. of vehicles in use on the road did not have a valid MoT. When applied to the whole vehicle fleet this would amount to around 1.2 million vehicles. The exercise was repeated this year but the results are not yet available. To improve compliance with these requirements the police have access to the computerised record of MoT test results so that officers can identify vehicles without a valid MoT, when using for example ANPR cameras, and then take action. The 'newstyle' MoT certificates come with a peel off and display sticker setting out the MoT expiry date as an aid to motorists.</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.11/3">The most recent estimate of the number of drivers using a vehicle on the road without a valid driving licence is 1.6 per cent. Full details are available in the report on the National Driver and Vehicle Compliance Check 2006. The report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-08">8 September 2006</phrase>, and placed in the House of Commons Library. It is also available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.282W.11/5">Provision to the Police of 24 hour access to accurate and up to date driver licensing information (including a photograph where appropriate) at the roadside has assisted detection and enforcement. There are also good IT links between the DVLA and the courts to assist in effective prosecution of offenders.</p>

The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&mdash;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br/> <i> Key</i>:<br/> Coefficient of Statistical Robustness Variation (CV) (percentage)<br/> * 0 &lt; CV &lt; 5 Estimates are considered precise.<br/> ** 5 &lt; CV &lt; 10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br/> *** 10 &lt; CV &lt; 20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br/> **** CV &gt; 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Model Based Estimates.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.303W.8/1">The Dental Services Division of the NHS Business Services Authority (DSD) sends out regular management information on contract activity to the national health service. This year the information includes recall intervals.</p>
	<p pid="d.303W.8/2">Historically dentists have tended to recall patients every six months. However guidance issued in 2004 by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence stated that dentists should have more flexible recall intervals, based on each patient's clinical needs, and that orally healthy adults might not need a check-up more than once every two years. Recalling healthy patients at shorter intervals than is clinically needed does not benefit these patients, and potentially blocks access to the NHS for others.</p>
	<p pid="d.303W.8/3">The source of the information is the activity returns, known as FP17s, which dental providers send to the DSD for every course of treatment delivered. These returns show significant variations among dental providers in the proportion of patients recalled at short intervals. The information will allow primary care trusts, who commission local dental services, to work with dentists to identify the causes of the variations and agree appropriate action to support best clinical practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.306W.8/1">The Department does not routinely collect this information and no single definitive cost figure exists. However, a study by the Public Health Laboratory Service<sup>(1)</sup> (PHLS) in 1999 estimated that hospital-acquired infections (HCAIs) cost the national health service &pound;1 billion a year. This remains the best available estimate of NHS costs, although based on data from 1994-95.</p>
	<p pid="d.306W.8/2">There were 11.4 million in-patient episodes in 1994-95. This suggests the cost per in-patient episode in 1994-95 is equivalent to &pound;87. A cost of &pound;87 in 1994-95 would be equivalent to &pound;137 in 2006-07 prices. It is not possible to provide a more up to date figure because calculations are based on standard pay and price deflators published by the Personal Social Services Research Unit in agreement with the Department. Deflators for 2007-08 are not yet available.</p>

This analysis was based primarily on the PHLS report and figures were uprated using standard deflators. However, this figure was attributed to the wrong year, as the figure of &pound;4,300 is appropriate for 2004-05 rather than 2003-04. The equivalent figure for 2006-07 is around &pound;4,600.</p>

Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br/> 2. Quality of care: Data derived from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the quality of care provided by NHS trusts. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of treatment and it is beyond the scope of HES to adequately record and present all of these.<br/> 3. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 4. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 5. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. The ICD-10 codes used to identify Pleural plaques are:<br/> J92.0&mdash;Pleural plaque with presence of asbestos.<br/> J92.9&mdash;Pleural plaque without asbestos.<br/> 6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br/> 7. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 8. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.315W.2/1">The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) works to ensure that the national health service in England makes the most effective use of its resources by getting the best possible value for money when purchasing goods and services. The prime target is to release money that could be better spent on patient care by achieving purchasing savings and improving supply performance across the NHS. It provides strategic direction and oversees the development of category strategies and seeks to ensure that NHS procurement is delivered through consistent processes. Where sourcing issues require a national lead they will provide that focus on behalf of the Department. A wide range of guidance is published for the use of those involved in NHS procurement and is available on NHS PASA's website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.315W.2/3">NHS PASA works with trust pharmacists to deliver the procurement of medicines for secondary care via a nationally agreed sourcing strategy. The focus of this work will be to ensure security of supply, delivery of savings and enabling the NHS to realise improvements in the supply chain. Detailed guidance on the procurement of individual medicines is provided where necessary on a case by case basis.</p>

Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br/> 2. Quality of care: Data derived from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the quality of care provided by NHS trusts. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of treatment and it is beyond the scope of HES to adequately record and present all of these.<br/> 3. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 4. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 5. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. The ICD-10 codes used to identify pleural plaques are:<br/> J92.0&mdash;Pleural plaque with presence of asbestos.<br/> J92.9&mdash;Pleural plaque without asbestos.<br/> 6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br/> 7. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 8. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.</td> </tr>

The Act includes a range of provisions. In this instance, use of the power had no relation to the counter-terrorism provisions elsewhere in the Act. The power allows HMG to make a freezing order where action to the detriment of the United Kingdom's economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken by a foreign Government or other person. This was the basis on which the power was used. The Treasury will keep the freezing order under review.</p>

	<p pid="d.340W.9/1">The Government's policy is to encourage all offshore financial centres to meet the highest standards of regulation and supervision, and to comply with international initiatives to eliminate unfair tax practices. To this end the Government have been working with international organisations such as the Financial Stability Forum, the Financial Action Task Force, the OECD, and also with EU partners.</p>

	<p pid="d.342W.0/1">The Memorandum of Understanding with Jersey and Guernsey is currently under review. The MoU establishes an administrative arrangement for import VAT to be collected at the point of sale by the Guernsey postal authorities rather than at import into the UK.</p>

	<p pid="d.342W.0/4">This provides relief from import VAT on consignments of goods not exceeding &pound;18 in value. No customs duty is due on goods imported into the UK from the Channel Islands because, although the Islands are outside the EU for fiscal purposes, they are members of the EU Customs Union.</p>
	<p pid="d.342W.0/5">All imports from the Channel Islands are subject to the standard Customs checks for illegal goods, irrespective of whether they have been imported under the low value consignment relief and/or pre-payment of VAT arrangements.</p>
