Those that did not wish to continue to accept waste had no need to submit a plan, so it is not possible to know exactly how many fell into this latter category. However, the Agency had expected around 1,100 plans to be submitted, and in the event just under 1,000 actually were. What this constitutes in terms of diversion of waste is impossible to say, but all waste generated has to be either re-used, recycled, recovered or disposed of regardless of the number of landfill sites available.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.2/1">The Environment Agency has carried out a review of Integrated Pollution Control authorisations for power stations not fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant. If such installations were unable to present a good 'Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost' justification for not using the abatement plant then they were authorised to operate at no more than a 40 per cent. load factor in 2001 and 2002. The next principal review of these authorisations is likely to be carried out in 2003&ndash;04. The objective of this review will be to secure a further reduction in the emissions of sulphur dioxide from coal fired power stations in 2004&ndash;05. One way to achieve this is to ensure the fullest use of Flue Gas Desulphurisation-equipped power stations. In addition, the review will consider how to avoid commercially disadvantaging power stations that are fitted with flue gas desulphurisation plant, and benefiting those without.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.5/1">It is necessary to separate out two issues in responding to this question. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CROW Act) sets out how maps of open country and registered common land are to be prepared for the purposes of the statutory right of access. This work is being carried out in England by the Countryside Agency. The law dealing with the registration and other aspects of common land pre-dates the CROW Act and is generally very complex.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.5/2">As far as the CROW Act is concerned, there is a statutory right of appeal against the showing of common land on the Countryside Agency's maps of open country and registered common land on the ground that the land is not registered common land. However, there is no appeal against the showing of such land on the ground that it has been wrongly registered as common land.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.5/3">As far as the law on common land more generally is concerned, I announced proposals for future legislation on common land last July that would include provision for wrongly registered land to be removed from local authority registers. Although we hope to bring forward measures as soon as parliamentary time permits, I can give no guarantee at this stage, either about the timing of legislation, or its scope.</p>

In the course of this dialogue, there has been no specific discussion of either the development of biofuels or reduction in the use of petrol. However, the US sees potential for hydrogen as a transport fuel that would displace petrol and thereby reduce consumption. The hydrogen economy and fuel cells are the subject of ongoing discussions between both sides. There have also been detailed bilateral discussions on biomass technologies, including a joint workshop on advanced conversion technologies for biomass which was held in London in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.2/4">The distribution of funds allocated in the 1994&ndash;99 period continued in 2000 and 2001. The distribution of funds allocated for the 2000&ndash;06 period is still at an early stage. For these current programmes there is a requirement that each annual allocation is spent by the end of the second year following the year of allocation (the N+2 rule). This rule was tested for the first time for Objective 1 regions at the end of 2002, when all but a very small part of the 2000 allocations was fully spent. For the Objective 2 regions, 2003 will be the first year in which the rule applies and it is too early to say what levels of expenditure will be achieved.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.3/1">Under UK competition law, it is the responsibility of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour or possible abuses of a dominant position. The OFT published its latest report on the funeral industry on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-27">27 July 2001</phrase> and recommended that consumers be given better information about prices and choices. The OFT has also named the industry as one of its priority sectors under its Consumer Codes Approval Scheme. The OFT is currently holding discussions regarding this scheme with a number of industry bodies. Under the Competition Act 1998, the OFT can act if pricing levels appear to be the result of anti-competitive practices. Anyone with evidence of such behaviour should forward that information to the OFT.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.3/2">The funeral services industry has a system of self regulation. The National Association of Funeral Directors, the Funeral Standards Council and the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors all have codes of practice that require funeral directors to provide a professional service and not to exploit consumers. The codes require members to make a basic funeral available with its price clearly indicated. Funeral directors have a duty to treat consumers fairly at what is a time of considerable emotional stress. Adherence to the Code is monitored by each of the respective trade associations.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.6/1">We expect UK companies to make a significant contribution to the redevelopment of Iraq's essential infrastructure. At my request British Trade International have set up a working group of companies representing the main industrial sectors, chaired by a senior businessman, to advise on this. It is clearly important that there is a level playing field for all companies who are interested in contracts in Iraq. I have discussed this with the US authorities and have received positive feedback. When conditions allow, the working group will hope to visit Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".20W.12/1">The gender pay gap is derived from mean hourly earnings (excluding overtime) for men and women. Women's hourly pay expressed as a percentage of men's hourly pay is what is generally referred to as the pay gap. ONS publish earnings figures from the New Earnings Survey (NES) annually which are the basis of government's gender pay gap figures.</p>
	<p pid=".20W.12/2">The following table gives figures for the mean full-time and part-time pay gap, and the median full-time pay gap for April 2002.</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".20W.12/5"> <th></th> <th>Men's hourly earnings (&pound;)</th> <th>Women's hourly earnings (&pound;)</th> <th>Women's earnings as a percentage of men's full-time earnings</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".20W.12/8"> <td>Full-time earnings (mean)</td> <td>12.59</td> <td>10.22</td> <td>81.1</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".20W.12/9"> <td>Part-time (mean)</td> <td>(11.98)</td> <td>7.42</td> <td>58.9</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".20W.12/10"> <td>Full-time (median)</td> <td>10.08</td> <td>8.60</td> <td>85.3</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".20W.12/13">When median earnings are used to construct the gender pay gap, instead of the mean, it shows that in fact the full-time pay gap has narrowed over the last year, from 15.4 per cent. in April 2001 to 14.7 per cent. in April 2002&mdash;a fall of 0.7 percentage points.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.2/6" class="indent">In the past year, NWML has had two (2) work experience placements for students. We normally offer two per year. One person during summer vacation, which is a regular arrangement and for which we often advertise if we have not had any expressions of interest. The summer vacation placement receives a small salary. Plus another one at some other time of the year&mdash;this year it was January 2003&mdash;for a short 2-week unpaid (except for expenses) placement. These may not necessarily be university students as we sometimes take school students or those about to start university or college.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.2/7" class="indent">This is currently the only sponsorship we offer at present, as we are a small Agency of only 57 staff and we do not have the capacity to support many work placements. For the same reasons, we do not currently offer to pay any university fees.</p>

	<p pid=".23W.9/1">Within the enhanced HIPC initiative it is essential to have clear and transparent rules for the provision of debt relief, and the debt to export ratio is a useful indicator of debt sustainability. However, looking forward, after the provision of debt relief, such a broad measure may not always be appropriate in assessing country plans to finance their Poverty Reduction Strategies, and the associated level of borrowing. In particular the UK is concerned that enforcing the debt to export ratio could constrain the ability of some developing countries to access their allocation of concessional finance. The UK is working closely with the IMF and the World Bank to develop a more integrated approach to debt sustainability for financing poverty reduction. The Government acknowledges that debt relief is not a panacea for broader economic development challenges problems; even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over $50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.0/1">At the 2002 summit in Kananaskis the UK helped secure agreement from the G7 to fund the shortfall in the enhanced HIPC initiative, recognising that it could be up to US $1 billion. Ahead of the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in September 2002, the UK pledged its share of the $1 billion shortfall, $120million, to encourage other donors to make firm pledges.

	<p pid=".24W.3/1">Should the UK decide to join the euro, the cost to the public sector of conversion to the euro would depend on the detailed approach that the UK took to the changeover and the extent to which organisations are able to build in euro compatibility where IT systems are being upgraded or purchased for other reasons. The outline National Changeover Plans provide a planning framework. All stakeholders acknowledge that costs can be minimised through careful and early planning.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.9/1">The Government is committed to developing the evidence base to help evaluate the effect of measures and inform future policies. Policy advice and development on tax measures are informed by in-house research and analysis, and in some cases, research commissioned externally. In addition to this, international comparisons allow the Government to identify areas where UK businesses lag behind their main competitors. This has prompted the development of targeted policies, often based on economic and statistical analysis of reforms in other countries.</p>

This research is wide ranging, looking at all aspects of the schemes, including their effects on the productivity and competitiveness of the relevant businesses.</p>

UK Athletics in conjunction with its home country partners has developed a number of grass roots initiatives that support and encourage individuals to become involved in athletics. The schemes take place within schools, communities, and athletics club environments. Such schemes include the Norwich Union 'star:track', 'sports:hall', and 'shine:awards', which are designed for young people aged three upwards. UK Athletics also supports athletics clubs through its 'clubs:future' programme.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.14/1">All personnel returning from Operation TELIC, whether Regulars or Reservists, will be provided with appropriate support measures acknowledging that each individual's experience of the conflict will be different. The procedures will vary slightly between each Service according to need, but are essentially similar and delivered in three stages: recovery, normalisation and after care. Each stage has support services ranging from medical screening and de-briefings to post-operational tour leave. For example, building on lessons from earlier conflicts, personnel from 3 Commando Brigade will have a period of two weeks in their barracks, with night leave, to allow additional time to 'decompress' and normalise while fulfilling equipment maintenance tasks. At all stages of the process, personnel have access to Sendee welfare specialists when required including medical officers, chaplains and also representatives from external bodies such as SSAFA-Forces Help.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.14/2">Procedures are in place to ensure that personnel do not miss end-of-deployment medical briefings given in theatre enabling data to be extracted for clinical audit and post-deployment health surveillance purposes. Measures are also in place to raise awareness of PTSD and other stress-related disorders which may occur among Service personnel.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.14/3">Commanders have been made aware of such vital issues as combat stress indicators, the difficulties surrounding the return of personnel and re-union with their loved ones, and the effect that the deployment may have had on their children. Two Leaflets&mdash;&quot;Coming Home&quot; and &quot;Dealing with Traumatic Experiences&quot;&mdash;are handed to all personnel leaving the operational area. In addition, leaflets are sent to families to alert them to the possible after-effects of the operational deployment including special booklets and advice for children.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.14/4">Each person will have the opportunity to be properly de-briefed by personnel within the command chain. This commitment to after care is enduring, recognising that the needs of individuals change in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid=".36W.2/1">There is a robust system in place to ensure that appropriate training is undertaken by the Army, and that relevant lessons are learned from exercises. Ultimately the responsibility for the planning and execution of Army exercises lies with Headquarters Land Command. The exercise programme is disseminated through the Land Command Collective Training Programme, which is designed to ensure that the right number of troops achieve the right level of readiness, in line with the Formation Readiness Cycle.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/2">Individual exercises are planned against the 'Mission Essential Tasks List' (METL) that each unit is asked to undertake. The specific manner in which these METLs are met is a decision for the Chain of Command to take, at the appropriate level dependent on the size of the exercise. Headquarters Land Command undertakes the formulation of the METL, through a consultation process with the relevant Chain of Command. The procedure for assessing the individual performances of the personnel involved in the planning and execution of exercises, and that of their subordinates, is through the annual appraisal system, which is informed by an &quot;After Action Review&quot; conducted immediately at the end of each exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/3">Following soon after the completion of each exercise a Post Exercise Report is produced examining the success of the exercise against its aims. This not only enables the Chain of Command to assess the Collective Performance of the units/formations involved, but also provides an avenue for feedback, which allows the Army to learn appropriate lessons. The Land Warfare Centre's Mission Support Group, which is part of Land Command, is responsible for the effective collation and dissemination of lessons learned from past Army exercises.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/4">Throughout the year, all collective training establishments systematically analyse the performance of all unit, battlegroup and brigade level exercises. These observations are then used to inform Land Command's lines of development, such as concepts and doctrine, sustainability, structures, training development, equipment and technology and people.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/5">In addition, the Mission Support Group issues 'Observations from Training' (OFT), a collation of the lessons learnt from the exercises undertaken in the preceding year. The OFT seek to identify trends and general observations from training. It is the responsibility of the Chain of Command to ensure that the OFT receives widespread distribution, and that the lessons learned inform future training and operations.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.11/1">The Ministry of Defence welcomes the &quot;Desk Study on Iraq&quot; from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In support of the UNEP work, MOD agrees that information should be released on how much depleted uranium (DU) has been used in the Iraq conflict and where. NATO provided information following use of DU in the Balkans conflict and the United Kingdom will do so for DU it has fired in its area of operations in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.11/2">The MOD has already issued appropriate safety instructions to those UK troops who have been deployed to the Gulf. These safety instructions make clear that the risks from DU are far lower than those from other hazards arising from military operations and that combat and life-saving activities should never be delayed on account of concern over DU. The emphasis is on avoiding situations where DU dust may be encountered and on wearing appropriate respiratory protective equipment and protective clothing when it is necessary to enter potentially contaminated areas.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.11/3">DU particulate remains highly localised to the points of impact where DU munitions have struck hard targets: only in these small areas would DU levels be significant enough to necessitate precautions to prevent or reduce possible intakes. Increasing amounts of independent research by eminent scientists within groups such as the Royal Society DU Working Group and the United Nations Environment Programme support this view. As many defeated tanks as possible within the British area of operations are being cordoned off and kept undisturbed, until it is possible to send scientists to examine them.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.2/2" class="italic">Future Aircraft Carrier CVF</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/3">Design activity on the Future Aircraft Carrier programme is continuing in parallel with our discussions with BAE Systems and Thales to determine the structure of the alliance for the programme. We expect to be in a position to formally commence the next phase of the assessment work shortly. Subject to the normal internal approvals we remain on course to award the main design and build contract for the carriers in spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/4">The capability required for the carriers will not be formally approved until the award of the design and build contract. Up to that point the CVF user requirements are performance targets to focus the assessment phase work of the contractors.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/5" class="italic">Type 45</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/6">The Type 45 Destroyer programme remains on track to meet the approved in service date of November 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/7">The baseline capability of the Type 45 has not changed since the main investment decision was made in July 2000. However, work continues on an Incremental Acquisition Plan (IAP) which will increase class capability as funding becomes available, technology develops and the requirement emerges. The first example of the successful implementation of the IAP is the inclusion of the Ultra MFS 7000 Sonar in the First of Class onward. At the time of the original approval it was envisaged that sonar would be fitted at build to Batch 2 (Hull 04 onwards) and that this capability would be retrofitted in the earlier vessels.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/8" class="italic">Amphibious assault vessels</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/9">Landing Ships Dock (Auxiliary)&mdash;construction of the first of the Bay Class Landing Ships Dock (Auxiliary), RFA Largs Bay is progressing satisfactorily, with the vessel programmed to complete in March 2004 although the shipyard have expectations to deliver earlier. She will then undergo a series of sea trials prior to acceptance into service in autumn 2004. Construction of the remaining three vessels is planned to complete during 2004 and 2005, followed by sea trials and acceptance into service. All four vessels are expected to meet their planned in service dates and there have been no changes to their planned capabilities.</p>

HMS Albion is nearing completion and is expected to achieve her currently planned in service date (ISD) of My 2003. Discussions continue with the prime contractor, BAE Systems, on agreeing a revised programme for HMS Bulwark. The ISDs originally planned were March 2002 for HMS Albion and March 2003 for HMS Bulwark. There have been no changes to their capability. <i>Heavy Sealift ships</i></p>

	<p pid=".41W.2/1">The Met Office has carried out all the upgrades that were announced in its Scientific and Technical review 2001&ndash;02. These have been implemented throughout the United Kingdom radar network sites and are already delivering the expected benefits in terms of operational reliability and efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/2">In addition, the Met Office now has plans for some further improvements to follow on from the upgrades mentioned above. These include improving the data retrieval techniques and improved data handling. This will result in increased accuracy and reduction in false alarms. Multiple beam operations will be introduced, which will allow the Met Office to more reliably detect weather systems, despite the interruption caused by, for example, mountains blocking the path of the radar beam.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/3">The Met Office are also working closely with the Environment Agency to determine the technology that might be employed for the next generation of weather radars. There are opportunities to employ new techniques that can potentially identify both the quantity and the type of precipitation, which will lead to further improvements in accuracy in forecasting potential floods and other consequences of severe weather.</p>

Participating schools and authorities have used the funding to provide a range of additional staff including professionals working as part of school-based multi-agency teams, and dedicated staff to mentor and support pupils with problems.

	<p pid=".55W.0/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-17">17 April 2002</phrase>, the Department for Education and Skills has implemented one Directive:</p>
	<p pid=".55W.0/2" class="indent">Directive 2001/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-14">14 May 2001</phrase> amending Council Directives 89/48/EEC and 92/51/EEC on the second general system for the recognition of professional qualifications and Council Directives 77/452/EEC, 77/453/EEC, 78/686/EEC, 78/687/EEC, 78/1026/EEC, 78/1027/EEC, 80/154/EEC, 80/155/EEC, 85/384/EEC, 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 93/16/EEC concerning the professions of nurse responsible for general care, dental practitioner, veterinary surgeon, midwife, architect, pharmacist and doctor.</p>
	<p pid=".55W.0/3">EC Regulations are, in general, directly applicable in the member states, without the need for further incorporation into national law. However, some Regulations require UK measures to make them workable and enforceable. Some Regulations enact small or technical amendments. As far as we have been able to verify, the Department for Education and Skills has had no Regulation for implementation since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-17">17 April 2002</phrase>.</p>

In 2003&ndash;04 the cash increase in Education Formula Spending and School Standards Direct Grant is 11.6 per cent; this is &pound;250 million greater than the 10.5 per cent. pressures due to pay, pensions, inflation and ending grants. It is not possible to identify these costs at the level of the individual local education authority since we do not collect information on the distribution of staff salaries by individual LEA. However, we appreciate that for some authorities, such as Essex that received low education formula funding increases coupled with reductions in grant through the Standards Fund, low budget increases for schools may result. In the light of representations, we have announced an additional &pound;28 million in grant to ensure that the effective increase for all LEAs between 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 was no less than 3.2 per cent. per pupil for all authorities, taking account of specific grants as well as EFS. Essex's share is &pound;1.164 million. As far as threshold payments are concerned, the full cost including on-costs is covered by 100 per cent. grant on a demand-led basis.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.5/1">Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national school teachers' pay and conditions. Further Education (FE) colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. It is for each FE college to agree pay scales and conditions of employment with its staff in the context of the overall resources available to it. There are no plans to change these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.5/2">We have invested a significant amount of funding in the FE sector. Assumed total funding for FE colleges allocated to the LSC will increase by &pound;1.2 billion in the three years to 2005&ndash;06, a 19 per cent. real terms increase. This funding provides the framework to allow FE colleges to make real progress on pay and pay structures and to narrow substantially the pay gap between general FE colleges and schools. We continue to work to deliver the Government's Manifesto commitment to bring up the level of funding for FE colleges towards that of school sixth forms.</p>

We are not aware of any evidence which suggests that women are generally treated inequitably in the admissions process. Women are well represented in higher education. The participation rate for women aged under 21 in 2000 was 37 per cent., compared with 30 per cent. for men aged under 21. Although the bottom three social groups are under-represented in higher education, women of all age groups account for 53 per cent. of acceptances into higher education from these groups.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.10/1">Under provisions of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-07">7 November 2002</phrase>, a claimant whose asylum or human rights claim has been refused and also certified as &quot;clearly unfounded&quot; may not appeal that refusal until they are outside the United Kingdom.

	<p pid=".62W.2/1">I regret that the information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.2/2">Some asylum seekers leave the United Kingdom voluntarily; others may remain in the UK illegally. Applicants do not always inform the Immigration Service prior to leaving the UK. We are making substantial improvements in the area of contact management as detailed in the White Paper: Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain, paragraph 4.42. A robust new reporting regime is now being put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.2/3">There is currently no official estimate of the number of people illegally present in the UK. Estimating the numbers of those illegally present is difficult because by definition, they fall outside of official statistics and are motivated to remain hidden. However, I have commissioned research into the feasibility of producing a reliable estimate.</p>

	<p pid=".65W.5/1">A model was developed by the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate as part of the review of sentencing policy conducted by John Halliday (&quot;Making Punishments Work&quot;, published in July 2001). This model was then adapted for use in assessing the impact of the Criminal Justice Bill, focussing on those aspects of the review's proposals that have been taken forward in the Bill, as well as additional proposals that have been developed following the publication of the review. The model considers the cost-benefits of the proposals, as well as the impacts on prison and probation workload. It uses published prison and probation statistics, and research evidence on the effectiveness of programmes in reducing re-offending. It is based on sentencing behaviour in 2000. The assumptions within the model were agreed with the relevant stakeholders such as the Prison Service, Probation Service and others. The projected net effect of implementation of the sentencing provisions in the Bill, of a small increase of about 1,000 in the prison population by 2009, was arrived at using the model. The impact is estimated to be about 500 once all the changes have been implemented and sufficient time has passed for their full effects to be seen.</p>

	<p pid=".65W.8/2">Recorded crime figures do not record whether an offence has been committed as a consequence of an offender's drug habits. Therefore it is not possible to make a direct assessment of the cost of crimes committed as a result of drug addiction.</p>
	<p pid=".65W.8/3">However, a recent study published by the Home Office provides estimates of the total economic costs of Class A drug use in 2000 in the range of &pound;2.9 and &pound;5.3 billion. These costs include those to the health service, courts, prisons and other parts of the criminal justice system. When social costs, such as the costs to the victims of drug-related crime, are added, the total rises to between &pound;10.1 and &pound;17.4 billion, with problematic drug users responsible for 99 per cent. of these costs.</p>

	<p pid=".66W.5/1">It is difficult to quantify the number of false passports circulating within the United Kingdom, given the nature of the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/2">Forgery detection which is carried out by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's National Forgery Section (NFS). As part of a comprehensive brief addressing passport forgery, NFS conducts forgery detection training for all Immigration Service staff, ranging from basic training for new entrants, through intermediate to expert level. As a direct result of this training, a provisional total of 9,665 fraudulent documents were detected at UK ports of entry in 2002 (an increase of 46 per cent. over the 2001 figure). NFS also delivers training to the police, Customs and Excise, the DVLA and the Department for Work and Pensions. This in turn leads to substantial numbers of falsified documents being discovered within the United Kingdom and inhibits the adoption of false identities.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/3">Since October 2001, NFS has had a permanent presence at the main offices of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) in Croydon, following a pilot exercise which revealed large numbers of fraudulent documents being submitted in support of applications for leave to remain. As well as examining suspect documents on behalf of their colleagues in Croydon, NFS has also established a comprehensive training programme for caseworkers, resulting in the discovery of many more forged documents. Provisional figures for 2002 indicate that a total of 461 fraudulent documents was detected there, an increase of 28 per cent. over the figure for 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.5/4">Work is now under way to ensure that the best use is made of biometric technology in travel documents, to combat identity fraud and facilitate the operation of border controls. Managers from NFS represent the United Kingdom at relevant international working groups, with the aim of securing an agreement on global interoperability of the appropriate technology.</p>

	<p pid=".68W.6/1">In Table 2 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 05/03, recorded crime figures have been adjusted to take into account the impact of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which was adopted across all forces from April 2002. The NCRS has been implemented to help police forces adopt a more consistent and victim-focused approach to recording crime.</p>
	<p pid=".68W.6/2">It is important to note that the NCRS-adjusted figures for offence groups are estimates. These estimates have been calculated based on changes to the ratio of police recorded crimes and crime-related incidents brought to the attention of the police, before and after the introduction of the NCRS.</p>
	<p pid=".68W.6/3">The adjusted total recorded crime figure, published in Table 2 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 05/03, is a total for all recorded crime offences. (It therefore includes all the categories for which no adjusted figure is available, i.e. sexual offences, other thefts and handling, fraud and forgery, drug offences and other offences). NCRS adjustments made to the total recorded crime figure have been calculated using exactly the same methodology as the adjustments for the other offence groups in Table 2. The data used to calculate the adjusted total recorded crime figure are therefore not a sum of all the figures for the offence groups, it is a separate calculation. The adjustment for the total recorded crime figure is based on a return from forces asking separately (from the other offence categories), for total recorded crime and total crime-related incident data.</p>
	<p pid=".68W.6/4">The impact of the NCRS varies considerably across crime types. Currently, it is not possible to adjust the national data for the impact of the NCRS for certain crime types where police forces are unable to differentiate incidents, where numbers are too small, or where the nature of incident recording means that this measure is particularly unreliable as an indicator of underlying trends. However, these constraints do not apply when considering recorded crime as a whole.</p>

The Home Office Family Support Grant provides &pound;5.8 million a year to a range of voluntary organisations for parenting support, including parenting classes. Since 1999&ndash;2000 it has funded 108 organisations to deliver 182 different projects across England plus grants to the National Family and Parenting Institute, Parentline Plus, Home Start UK and the Parenting Education and Support Forum (which provides a range of services and support to other organisations that deliver parenting classes).</p>

A number of forces in the south east made out a case to have schemes covering up to 40 per cent. of force strength due to the particularly acute difficulties they were experiencing in retaining officers.

	<p pid=".71W.5/1">The Government are working on a number of measures to reduce the numbers of spontaneous arrivals of people seeking asylum in Europe and to address the problem of secondary movements of asylum seekers within the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/2">Domestically, the measures in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 will deter and prevent people who do not need international protection but lodge asylum applications in order to circumvent immigration controls, from entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/3">Together with our European partners, the Government is active in numerous joint projects and operations to strengthen the EU's external borders. Stronger EU borders will have a significant impact on the numbers of illegal immigrants arriving in the UK. The first round of operations is currently being evaluated in order to set priorities for future action.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/4">The Government has also worked to secure a more effective mechanism to replace the Dublin Convention, determining which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States of the EU. The Dublin II Regulation will enter into force in September this year. The Eurodac fingerprint database is now operational, and will provide much better evidence to support the determination of responsibility. Together, the Dublin II regulation and the Eurodac system will enable the UK to effect the return of a greater number of asylum seekers to the Member State most responsible for their presence on EU territory.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/5">The UK has been active in negotiations to put in place minimum standards for reception conditions for asylum seekers, for asylum procedures and for qualification as a refugee across the EU. The proposed Qualification Directive, for example, will result in a more consistent interpretation of the definition of a refugee and ensure that each Member State accords refugees comparable rights and benefits. This should discourage those in genuine need of international protection from &quot;asylum shopping&quot;. The reduction of both the real and the perceived advantages of applying in certain Member States over others should deter secondary movements of asylum applicants within the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/6">In the longer term, we believe that our proposals for 'zones of protection' will make a significant contribution to better international management of refugees and asylum-seekers. These ideas are now being discussed with other Member States, the European Commission and United Nation High Commission for Refugees and we are encouraged by the support we have received to date. These 'zones' are designed to improve the quality and availability of protection for refugees who need it, while ensuring we strengthen the management of our borders and can have proper control of who comes into the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".72W.2/2">In cases involving serious road traffic incidents, local senior police officers have discretion to waive charges where, for example, payment would bring hardship or cause distress. The decision can also depend on the timing of the request and whether it comes from a third party. In some cases, the full circumstances of an incident may lead to a charge being levied.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.0/1">Prior to 2001 lost property numbers, rather than crime numbers, were issued by the police to members of the public who perceived themselves to be victims of theft but where there was insufficient evidence to show that a crime had been committed. The lost property numbers were issued primarily for insurance purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/2">Since 2001 everyone who reports a theft to the police, whether real or perceived, should be issued with a crime number not a lost property number. This change occurred following a report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in July 2000 that set out the extent and causes of variations in police recording practices. One of the conclusions reached was that there was a need for all forces to have in place an accurate and ethical crime recording system.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/3">Whilst allegations which clearly have no basis in fact are now weeded out of the published recorded crime statistics, they all require initial recording as a crime, and a written justification if the matter is not pursued.</p>

Disability is one of the areas covered by our Ministerial Steering Group on Diversity, which is driving forward the FCO's diversity agenda. We also regularly fund a bursary under the Cabinet Office's Leadership Development programme for Disabled Civil Servants, which is worth &pound;10,000, and supports a disabled member of staff with the potential to progress to senior levels.</p>

Many countries have put in place or strengthened measures to reduce demand for illicit drugs and to provide treatment for those affected. Improvements have also been made in national and international co-operation on supply reduction and law enforcement. But serious problems remain. The UK will continue to devote effort and resources to tackling the drugs problem at home and internationally, particularly in Afghanistan, where the creation of alternative economic activities is vital to the success of the fight against the international drug problem and to the stability of the region.</p>

The Head of the UK Delegation publicly reaffirmed this commitment to states party to the NPT on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-29">29 April</phrase>. We have also reaffirmed our commitment to the Decisions and Resolution of the 1995 Review Conference and the Final Document agreed at the 2000 Review Conference.

Our current systems are not able to disaggregate expenditure to reflect the individual spend on accountancy services and a manual sift of the expenditure data could not be undertaken without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.12/7">Correspondence with the applicant subsequent to the apology has indicated, implicitly, that his application would be considered, but this seems to have generated more confusion.

The fourth annual 'Opportunity for all' report published in September 2002 (Cm 5598) sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.8/2">In April 2002 we published 'Measuring child poverty: a consultation document' to gather views on an appropriate measure of child poverty for the long term. This consultation was very well received and we plan to publish initial conclusions in May 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.8/3">There is a shared Department for Work and Pensions/HM Treasury PSA target to reduce the number of children in low-income households by at least a quarter by 2004. Data for this is published in 'Households Below Average Income 1994&ndash;95 to 2001&ndash;02'. On this measure the number of children in low income fell by around half a million between 1996&ndash;97 and 2001&ndash;02. The baseline for the PSA target is 1998&ndash;99. We are making steady progress towards the target.</p>

Of this expenditure, &pound;38 million has been recovered from other Government Departments for work undertaken on their behalf. The Department for Work and Pensions was created in June 2001 by merging elements of the former Department of Social Security and the former Department for Education and Employment.

	<p pid=".96W.8/1">There is no proposal in the Green Paper &quot;Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement&quot;, (Cm 5677), to introduce compulsory employer contributions to stakeholder pensions. However, the Government is keen to encourage employers to make pension contributions. As we pointed out in the Green Paper, employer contributions are a major factor in encouraging take up of stakeholder pensions by employees. The generous tax relief available on employers pension contributions supports this.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.8/2">The Government believe that the long-standing voluntarist pension system in this country, based on a partnership with employees, employers, pension providers and government all working together, is the way forward. The Green Paper put forward radical proposals to simplify the tax rules, provide better information about pension choices, help people to work for longer and provide more protection for employees whilst simplifying administration for those who run pension schemes. These proposals will renew the pensions partnership and make the voluntarist system work better.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.8/3">The Green Paper also announced the setting up of a pensions commission, chaired by Adair Turner, to provide an independent check on the progress of the voluntarist pension system and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on whether there is a case for moving beyond the current voluntarist approach.</p>

Prevention of CHD in the population and in high-risk patients by promoting physical activity, promoting healthy eating, reducing overweight and obesity and reducing smoking can make a significant contribution to this target.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.8/2">The responsibility for the enforcement of food labelling Regulations and associated food sampling under the Food Safety Act 1990 rests with local authorities. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has raised its concerns about the decline in local authority food sampling activity and is taking forward a number of initiatives with local authorities to reverse the trend.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.8/3">There appears to be no single cause for the fall in sampling. The FSA has carried out a focussed audit programme to examine local authority sampling and make recommendations. A report will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.8/4">The FSA is already taking action to help to ensure that effective food sampling arrangements are in place in all local authorities. The FSA is working with local authorities co-ordinators of regulatory services (LACORS) to develop better co-ordination and targeting of food and feed standards sampling throughout the United Kingdom. Local authorities and public analysts are also being involved more closely in the FSA's own food surveillance activities.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.8/5">The FSA is also working with LACORS and with the association of public analysts to develop a UK samples database, which will help local authorities to target their sampling programmes more effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.8/6">More emphasis has also been placed on sampling in the revised statutory code of practice, which is currently out for consultation. Under the code, local authorities are required to prepare and publish a food sampling policy and programme and make these available to food businesses and consumers. The FSA will also be providing more practical guidance on sampling for local authority enforcement officers.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.8/1">The total funds identified amounted to a small proportion of the combined turnover of the three organisations and cover a number of projects across the spectrum of their activity, both for revenue and capital expenditure. The reasons for the slippages are similarly varied, for example, delays in advertising new posts or in ensuring that capital investment projects had proper justification and approval. An example of the former is the creation of a travel health advice service, which comprised a consortium of the Public Health Laboratory Service, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University College, London and the University of Liverpool. Here, the development of advertisements for new staff took longer than expected. An example of the latter is the upgrading of the communications facilities at the Colindale site. Both of these projects are now moving forward.</p>

	<p pid=".108W.0/1">Getting children and young people to be more active through increased participation in physical activity and sport, together with a healthy, balanced diet is key for the prevention of obesity. Increasing levels of physical activity across the whole population is a top priority across government. The Cadbury initiative, &quot;Get Active&quot;, is not a Government initiative and the Department of Health was not, therefore, consulted.</p>
	<p pid=".108W.0/2">To prevent and manage obesity, consumption of food high in fat and/or added sugar, such as chocolate, should be kept to a minimum, accompanied by increased levels of physical activity. Food consumption by children is assessed by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS). The NDNS published in 2000 showed that the average consumption of chocolate confectionery in males aged four to 18 years was 138 grams per week and in females aged four to 18 years 115 grams per week. Further assessments will be carried out in future surveys.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.0/1">At the request of the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Scientific Committee on Nutrition has reviewed the evidence on the public health implications of dietary salt intakes of the United Kingdom population. It is expected that the committee will publish its report on this shortly. Papers relating to the Committee's work on this matter are available on its website at <a href="http://www.SACN.gov.uk">www.SACN.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/2">It is likely that the committee will support previous expert advice that significant public health gains would be achieved if consumers, including children, reduced their salt intake. In anticipation of this the FSA, working in conjunction with the Department of Health, has been in discussion with food industry organisations about reducing salt levels in processed food which contributes most to current salt intakes in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.0/1">English Partnerships (EP) took over full responsibility for the Dome in July 2001, and will continue to fund its management and maintenance until the commercial deal between EP and Meridian Delta Ltd (MDL) becomes unconditional.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/2">EP meets the costs associated with the Dome from resources made available to it by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The average monthly cost incurred by EP for management, maintenance and security, including associated staff costs, for the period July 2001 to February 2003, was around &pound;250,000, or &pound;5 million for the whole period.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/3">In addition to the management, maintenance and security of the Dome, EP has also incurred Dome-related costs, up until the end of February 2003, comprising: &pound;6.5 million for decommissioning the contents of the Dome and its site in preparation for the future long-term use; &pound;6.3 million in connection with the current sale process; and &pound;6.7 million for the previous competition to find a long-term use for the Dome.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/4">All of the above costs amount to a total figure of &pound;24.5 million, to the end of February 2003. These costs will be recovered from sale proceeds.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.5/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Mr. Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. Jonathan Shaw, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-07">7 May 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/3" class="indent">The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding the amount of compensation that has been given, and on what dates, by the Highways Agency to Buckmore Park Scout Centre as a consequence of the M2 widening.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/4" class="indent">You will know from your previous involvement with the M2 Widening scheme that the Buckmore Park Scout Centre was accepted as a Rule 5 Case under the Land Compensation Act. This provides for compensation to meet the costs of reasonable equivalent reinstatement. Exceptionally, to enable work to be undertaken to organise the replacement facilities and get them built ahead of the M2 widening construction, it was agreed that compensation would be released in stages ahead of the normal &quot;land entry&quot; requirement. The payment of compensation was therefore spread over a period of time commencing in October 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/5" class="indent">I set out in the attached annex the full schedule of payments made and dates of release. All these payments included the payment of VAT. You will note that the last entry is for statutory interest, providing for the interest on the difference between the sum released at the time of entry and the latest estimate of compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/6" class="indent">You raise the issue of outstanding claims. At the end of 2001, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), the independent valuer acting for the Highways Agency, had discussed with the scouts' valuer, all the heads of claim and had reached a point where a full and final offer could be made. However, because there was some question as to whether the VAT element could be recovered by the scouts, and therefore not form part of the &quot;cost&quot; of reinstatement, the full and final offer made was presented &quot;without prejudice&quot; to the outcome of the VAT enquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/7" class="indent">The full and final offer, in the sum of &pound;10,100,000 (including VAT) was made on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-04">4 December 2001</phrase> and apparently accepted by the valuer for the scouts but his recommendation to accept was rejected by his client.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/8" class="indent">The dispute over the VAT element eventually led to the scouts making a reference to the Lands Tribunal on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-15">15 April 2002</phrase>. At that time the solicitor for the scouts raised a claim for compensation on a number of additional items. These were not specified in any way and to date the scouts have not responded to our request for this to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/9" class="indent">The Highways Agency has therefore paid in full all the compensation recommended by the VOA up to the full and final offer that was rejected. Subject to the scouts justifying their claim for additional items there are no outstanding sums.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.5/10" class="indent">I hope that this answers your queries. The Project Sponsor for the M2 scheme is Colin Chadwick. He would be happy to discuss this issue in greater detail if you wish. He can be contacted at Room C8, 5 Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham, B15 1BL&mdash;telephone 0121 6788281.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.2/1">I have had no discussions of the sort described concerning marine environmental high risk areas (MEHRAs). MEHRAs are a domestic UK initiative. However, there is an international designation entitled 'Particularly Sensitive Sea Area' (PSSA), which represents the very highest level of environmental protection available through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). A proposal for a PSSA in western European waters was discussed at the Transport Council in March, and my Department has played an active role in developing that proposal in co-operation with French, Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and Belgian colleagues. The six countries' joint proposal for a PSSA stretching from the Shetland Islands in the north to the coast of Portugal in the south, and including the English Channel, was submitted to the IMO last month and will be considered by the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee in July.</p>

However, journey times for similar services are usually close because of the way the timetable is constructed.</p>

This regulation has been amended to require the fitting and use of digital tachographs in vehicles put into service after August 2004. This new instrument will address the common misuses associated with the current analogue tachograph. The working time of drivers is not currently subject to limits except to the extent that drivers subject to the drivers' hours rules must meet minimum requirements for daily and weekly rest&mdash;in addition to limits on driving time. A minimum level for checks on compliance with the EU drivers' hours rules is set in an EU Directive.</p>

In 2001&ndash;02, we introduced an additional HGV enforcement package, funded by the Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. The package includes projects to increase the number of examiners available for roadside checks, provide equipment to increase the scope and mobility of roadside inspections, augment advice and education initiatives to prevent offending, enhance data collection and analysis for targeting purposes, and improve roadside inspection facilities.</p>

The four driving test centres involved were at Telford, Shrewsbury, Whitchurch and Oswestry. The preferred option would have involved co-locating the Shrewsbury and Telford test centres at Telford and closing the Shrewsbury centre. However, as a result of an upsurge in demand for practical tests, the review has now been shelved indefinitely and the consultation exercise suspended.

	<p pid=".132W.5/1">Starting in 2000&ndash;01, a number of steps have been taken to improve the quality of the published traffic estimates. These include an improvement in the database used to represent the road network, using a Geographic Information System and use of new data from the Highways Agency. Preliminary revisions to estimated traffic levels in 1999, 2000 and 2001, along with a note explaining the revisions, were published in the Transport Statistics Bulletin &quot;Road Traffic Statistics: 2001&quot;, issued in August 2002, a copy of which is in the Library.
