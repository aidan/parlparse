	<p pid="b.1057W.7/1">Prosecutors have a general duty to assist the court when sentence is being considered, which may include advising the court of any aggravating factors, the appropriate sentencing range and, where applicable, relevant sentencing guidelines or guideline cases.

	<p pid="b.1057W.7/5">Specifically on prosecuting cases of bad driving, including cases that result in serious injury or death, the Crown Prosecution Service published its Public Policy Statement on Prosecuting Cases of Bad Driving in December 2007.

	<p pid="b.1059W.3/2">Globally, the trend of both sea surface temperatures (SST) and near-surface air temperatures is still upward. 2005 was the second warmest year (after 1998) in the air temperature record, which began in 1850. 11 of the 12 warmest years in the record have occurred in the last 12 years&mdash;the exception was 1996. Since 2005, some cooling has occurred because of natural climate variations, including the current Pacific La Ni&ntilde;a (1998 was especially warm because of a strong El Ni&ntilde;o in that year).</p>

	<p pid="b.1059W.3/4">The most recent Met Office Hadley Centre HadSST2 analysis shows that global average SST has risen by 0.09&deg; C per decade since 2000.</p>

This compares to a rising trend of just over 0.15&deg; C per decade since the mid-1970s and 0.1&deg; C per decade between 1998 and 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1060W.2/1">The rebuild of the Lion House Building at Alnwick will be the first carbon neutral building on the DEFRA estate. It will deliver specific sustainability targets in relation to management, energy, internal environment, transport, water, materials, land use, ecology and pollution and has integrated initiatives such as wind turbines, photovoltaic solar electric and solar thermal panels and biomass heating. The project will set the standard for all future DEFRA network estate projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.2/2">DEFRA is currently installing advanced metering reading (AMR) on approximately 100 of its sites. The meters will capture over 90 per cent. of the DEFRA network estates utility use from electricity, gas, oil and water by the end of summer 2008. The Carbon Trust indicates that savings of up to 10 to 15 per cent. can be achieved through the implementation of initiatives realised through the analysis of AMR data, through reducing the base load, optimising the use of equipment and reducing peak usage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.2/3">DEFRA is implementing the Carbon Trust's Carbon management programme (CMP). The programme has enabled the department to develop a systematic approach to carbon management and take a strategic approach to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions through operational improvements, reduced energy costs, staff awareness and monitoring initiatives. The CMP is integrated with DEFRA's energy efficiency programme and the numerous renewable energy projects being rolled out across the estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.2/4">DEFRA is the first Government Department to access Salix Funding&mdash;a revolving ring fenced fund, which has been allocated to the CMP. Financial savings from CMP projects will be fed back into the fund for further projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.2/5">DEFRA has installed 17 powerPerfector units across its estate to optimise voltage, therefore reducing electricity consumption.</p>

	<p pid="b.1068W.10/1">The Cultural Leadership Programme (CLP) is formed from the Partnership of Arts Council, England; Museums Libraries and Archives Council and Creative and Cultural Skills. Funding has been channelled through Arts Council, England who have assessed the programme as part of the ongoing review of their work and priorities. A mix of formal and informal learning opportunities have been created and are supported by the programme, including: placements; courses; online information; advice and guidance; as well as work-based support including coaching and mentoring opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1068W.10/2">The Programme is having a good impact on leadership development, both in terms of the new opportunities offered to emerging, mid-career and established leaders, and in increasing awareness of the benefits of targeted leadership development for these important areas of the UK life and economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1068W.10/3">The Programme has been delivered by a very small team, ensuring that an investment of over 85 per cent. of the &pound;12 million made available has been spent directly on activities that will support leaders, keeping administration and support costs to a minimum. The Programme was launched just two years ago in June 2006 and the first phase ends in June 2008. The Department expects to receive a formal evaluation of the CLP soon after the end of this first phase.</p>

	<p pid="b.1072W.9/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-08">8 May 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how long an individual must claim unemployment benefits before they are eligible to go on a training course offered by Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/4" class="indent">Most people who claim Jobseeker's Allowance find work very quickly and only need general information, advice and guidance on how best to look for work. However, for those who need additional help, training courses are available at different stages, depending upon the needs of the individual:</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/5" class="indent">People with an obvious literacy, numeracy or language need are identified at the new claims stage and encouraged to take immediate steps to address those needs through the Learning and Skills Council's Employment Skills Programme or other provision available locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/6" class="indent">People who need additional help with jobsearch skills, confidence and motivation and 'soft' skills associated with the world of work can access help through Programme Centres after 26 weeks unemployment, although earlier access is available where such help is clearly needed to have a realistic chance of finding work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/7" class="indent">At 26 weeks, a fast-track assessment tool is used to screen people for any basic skills need not previously identified, and where appropriate, people are referred for help through the Employment and Skills Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/8" class="indent">Full-time education and training is available through the New Deal, participation in which is mandatory for young people after six months unemployment; and for people aged 25 and over when they have been unemployed for 18 out of the previous 21 months. That said, immediate/early access is available where it is clear the customer is particularly disadvantaged in the labour market and the prospect of finding work is much less likely without additional help.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/9" class="indent">Pre-employment training may also be available through Local Employment Partnerships through which participating employers have committed to provide more job opportunities for people who are finding it particularly difficult to find work, such as longer-term unemployed people or people living in areas of high unemployment. In return, Jobcentre Plus and other partners, for example the Learning and Skills Council prepare people for work through a range of measures, which may include pre-employment training to prepare people for the sort of jobs available locally. Once in work, ongoing development of skills is encouraged through skills advice and support, e.g. through Train to Gain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.9/10" class="indent">Building upon the success of New Deal and Local Employment Partnerships, there are plans to develop and implement an integrated employment and skills service as announced in &quot;Ready for work: full employment in our generation&quot; and &quot;Ready to Work, Skilled for Work: Unlocking Britain's Talent&quot;. A key part of this will be better and earlier screening to identify jobseekers with a skills need that is a major barrier to employment and referring them to a full skills heath-check and then appropriate remedial provision.</p>

	<p pid="b.1082W.2/1">The Government intend to bring into force amendments to householder permitted development rights, including those for roof extensions, in October this year. The proposed regime will keep the current approach that allows householders roof extensions of up to no more than 40 cubic metres for terraced houses and 50 cubic metres for detached and semi-detached properties. An extension will not be permitted on a roof that fronts the house and is visible from the highway. Rear loft extensions will have to be set back at least 20 centimetres from the eaves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.2/2">A key change for all types of household extension is that the overall household volume restriction will be removed. This means that householders will no longer have to apply for planning permission for loft extensions if they have already extended at ground level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1083W.2/1">The Code for Sustainable Homes does not make any assumptions on the amount of waste and recycling produced by family homes. The Code's Technical Guidance published in April 2008 contains mandatory minimum standards for the waste and recycling component for all levels of the Code. It states that space allocated for waste storage should be able to hold containers, the volume of which must be at least the minimum recommended by British Standard BS 5906 (British Standards, 2005) i.e. 100 litres volume for a single bedroom dwelling, with a further 70 litres volume for each additional bedroom.</p>

	<p pid="b.1087W.3/1">The code of practice on work force matters in local authority service contracts (ODPM, 2003) is guidance based on the Secretary of State's view that a 'two-tier work force' does not achieve 'best value'. Local authorities should have regard to the code when considering individual contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1087W.3/2">The alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedure was developed by the TUC, CBI, the LGA and the Employers' Association for Local Government. Use of the ADR is not monitored centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1087W.3/3">Communities and Local Government is carrying out a programme of ongoing research that will evaluate the impact of the local government procurement agenda as a whole. A specific strand has been to attempt to isolate the impact of the code of practice. Initial results were published in the 'Evaluation of the Local Government Procurement Agenda&mdash;Baseline Survey Report' (ODPM, August 2005). Just over two-thirds of authorities had included work force matters as a standard issue in contracts for services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1087W.3/4">Currently, local authorities are required to certify in their best value performance plans (BVPPs) that individual contracts comply with best value requirements, including the work force requirements in the two-tier code. As part of the package of de-regulatory measures, announced in the Local Government White Paper 2006, the Department signalled the intention to remove the requirement for authorities to prepare BVPPs; provisions to do so were secured in the 'Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007'. We will be consulting on proposed arrangements for monitoring compliance with the code in future.</p>

These include the level of the non-domestic rating multipliers before and at the time the supplement is levied and whether the property is in receipt of any rate relief. In addition, as announced in &quot;Business rate supplements: a White Paper&quot;, all properties with a rateable value of &pound;50,000 or less will not have to pay the supplement, thus excluding the vast majority of business properties in England. Those authorities levying supplements will also be able to decide whether there should be an offset for ratepayers contributing to BIDs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1093W.12/2">The Government take the issue of crime and antisocial behaviour committed by individuals when drunk very seriously. The Government have taken a number of actions in order to combat this, including introducing the Tackling Violent Crime Programme (TVCP) which was launched in November 2004. Additionally, local areas are now required to address alcohol-related issues within their Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRP) strategies. The Government have produced guidance to assist local areas in producing their strategies, and the Government offices for the regions are coordinating this requirement within their specific region. The Government have also recently published 'A practical guide for dealing with alcohol related problems' which is aimed at local alcohol practitioners and gives advice about the tools and powers available to tackle alcohol related crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1093W.12/3">The Government are working to improve the way alcohol related offenders are dealt with in custody and in the community. The National Offender Management Service is taking this work forward which includes; the publication of an alcohol pack for offenders under probation supervision, disseminating across the National Probation Service learning points from alcohol best practice projects, as well as work to develop two alcohol treatment programmes for prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1093W.12/4">Additionally, the Government have funded four alcohol arrest referral pilots. These schemes aim to offer custody based interventions from a trained worker in order to reduce re-offending. These pilots will be rolled out to 10 new areas, which will ensure that the under 18's will also benefit from these interventions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1100W.8/5">The Association of Chief Police Officers have conducted a survey of local police forces' response to enforcement of the Hunting Act which will inform best-practice guidance. The Government are also working with ACPO on ways to raise awareness of issues surrounding enforcement of the Hunting Act across the police service, and to communicate the importance of visible enforcement to community policing in rural areas and to the maintenance of public order.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.8/6">We are also working closely with the Attorney-General about what more can be done to secure prosecutions where evidence has been presented of Hunting Act offences being committed. The Attorney-General in turn has agreed to raise the issue of the burden of proof in hunting cases with the Director of Public Prosecutions, and to engage with local Crown Prosecution Service leads to better understand and then communicate, the evidence needed to bring forward successful prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.8/7">26 individuals have now been convicted of offences under the Hunting Act 2004 which does show that the legislation is enforceable when the evidence presents itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.1102W.5/1">We regularly raise our concerns with the Chinese government about the implementation of China's population and family planning law. The Chinese government acknowledges that there have been problems with administration of the policy, but insists this would be down to individuals rather than malign intent. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials discussed the One Child Policy during the recent round of the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in Beijing in January. We do not dispute China's right or need to implement family planning policies, but we do believe they should be based on the principles of consent and not coercion. We will continue to encourage the Chinese to meet international human rights standards at every appropriate opportunity, both bilaterally and through the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.1110W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/2">The overall position is that the Government are delivering a multi-agency response to the threat posed by so-called boiler room frauds. These typically involve the use of high-pressure sales techniques by groups operating abroad to sell worthless or non-existent investments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/3">There has been a coordinated approach as law enforcement agencies, Government Departments and regulators have worked together on several initiatives. These have included:</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/4" class="indent">1. Strengthening prevention through greater education and advice to the public, with recent campaigns delivered by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the city of London police;</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/5" class="indent">2. A major enforcement-led initiative to target the key organisers of boiler room networks. This involved significant joint working between UK enforcement agencies and partners overseas;</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/6" class="indent">3. Creating a more hostile environment for boiler room operations based in other EU member states by reinforcing the European framework for regulating the provision of investment advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/7">In the future, action against boiler rooms will be strengthened further by the creation of the National Fraud Strategic Authority, which will have an explicit mandate to lead and coordinate national counter-fraud efforts, to ensure maximum impact against serious threats of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/8">In parallel, the creation of a national fraud reporting centre will boost the ability of law enforcement agencies to take intelligence-led action against complex fraud networks, such as those responsible for boiler rooms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/9">The number of representations received from time to time by the various departments and agencies involved is low. These occasional representations are typically on behalf of individual constituents who have fallen victim to boiler room frauds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/10">No estimate of the losses incurred by consumers is available. However, a number of other reports seek to describe and quantify the problem. For example, a report published by the Office of Fair Trading in December 2006 on 'Research on impact of mass marketed scams' discussed the nature and size of the problem of high-risk investment scams. That category covered, but was not confined to, what is usually understood by &quot;boiler room&quot; frauds. The FSA published the results of a study of boiler room victims who had contacted their consumer centre in June 2006. Any estimate of the extent or cost of the problem is affected by the reluctance of some people to report that they have been the victim of a boiler room fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1110W.3/11">Prevention is an important part of any strategy to reduce the impact of boiler room frauds. That requires effective law enforcement action, and action to raise consumer awareness of the existence and nature of these frauds. Accordingly a number of agencies issue guidance and raise awareness about boiler room frauds. These include the FSA, the Home Office, the Metropolitan and city of London police forces, and the OFT. The FSA for example has recently engaged with radio features and news programmes, television, regional and local radio, and various written media. In addition following FSA agreement with registrars existing shareholders will receive warnings about the threat of boiler rooms.</p>

	<p pid="b.1112W.3/1">The Government are committed to up-skilling British workers to provide them with the skills required in a competitive labour market. Migrant workers from outside the European Union, not ordinarily resident in the UK for at least three years, are not eligible to Government funded training places such as apprenticeships. Apprenticeship starts have increased from 65,000 in 1996/97 to 180,000 in 2006/07. They are projected to grow to almost 210,000 by 2010/11. By 2013, we will ensure that an apprenticeship is available to all qualified young people. Train to Gain has engaged over 77,000 employers with more then 363,000 workers starting learning programmes. We have ambitious plans to expand Train to Gain with increased funding from around &pound;520 million this year to over &pound;1 billion in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.1116W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-07">7 May 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/2">Before 2006, loans were limited to students aged under 55, or under 50 for students not intending to enter employment upon graduating. During the passage of the Higher Education Act, concerns were raised about the upper age limits : the Government set up a working group which recommended that there should be no age limit applied to the fee loan when this was introduced in 2006, and a review of the existing age limits on maintenance loans with the intention of increasing this to match the state pension age for the 2006-07 academic year. Consequently, mature students are generally eligible for the same student support as other students, though maintenance loans are available only to those aged under 60. In 2006-07 the age limit for applying for a student loan was raised to 60 years of age and the additional requirement for the student to enter into an agreement to work after their studies was removed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/3">Students over 25 years of age ('mature students') are treated as independent, and are assessed on their own income (and the income of their spouse or partner where applicable) and not on the income of their parents. For full-time students, fee loans of up to &pound;3,070 (&pound;3,145 in 2008-09) ensure that no one has to pay their fees upfront students under the age of 60 are eligible for maintenance loans of up to &pound;6,315 (&pound;6,475 in 2008-09)<sup>(1)</sup>. Means-tested grants of up to &pound;2,765 (&pound;2,835 in 2008-09) are available to new students. From 2008-09, we are increasing the income thresholds for the means tested maintenance grant so many more full-time students, including mature students, will receive grant support. This will mean that one third of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008-09 are expected to be entitled to a full non-repayable grant worth &pound;2,835 and another one third are expected to be entitled to a partial grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/4"><sup>(1)</sup> This is the maximum amount available to students studying in London. Students studying elsewhere can receive up to &pound;4,510 (&pound;4,625 in 2008-09)</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/5">They can also access targeted support including the adult dependants grant, parents learning allowance, childcare grant and disabled students allowance. students may also qualify for a bursary from their higher education institution. Students may also apply for support from the access to learning fund, a university-administered fund for students experiencing financial hardship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.5/6">Student parents are eligible to receive child tax credit from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Mature students who do not qualify for undergraduate student support may be eligible for a career development loan which has an element of subsidy from public funds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1116W.8/1">Parliament determined the interest rate to be paid on student loans. The principle is that borrowers should repay the same amount, in real terms, as they borrowed. To achieve this, the rate of interest is the retail price index (RPI), although the method for determining the rate of interest varies depending on the type of loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.8/2">Older 'mortgage style' loans are credit agreements under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The interest rate is determined in accordance with the Education (Student Loans) Regulations 1998 which prescribe the rate of interest to be equal to the RPI so long as that index is published.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.8/3">Income contingent repayment loans are 'low interest loans' exempt under section 16(5) (b) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Interest is calculated in accordance with the Education (Student Support) Regulations 2007, as amended, and is the lower of the rate which the Secretary of State determines is appropriate to maintain the real value of the loans (RPI), or 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates published by the banks listed in Regulation 4 of the Consumer Credit (Exempt Agreements) Order 1989. Accordingly, there is potential for the interest rates for the two types of loans to differ but, to date, the RPI rate has consistently applied since 1990 to 'mortgage style' loans and since 1998 to income contingent loans.</p>

	<p pid="b.1122W.5/1">The Government are committed to developing a sustainable, innovative and productive economy that delivers a high level of employment, and a just society that promotes social inclusion, sustainable communities and personal well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/2">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for the commissioning and funding of post-16 education and training up to (but notincluding) higher education. Information on the number and type of courses is an operational matter for the LSC and I have asked Mark Haysom, the LSC chief executive, to write to the hon. Gentleman with further information. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-08">8 May 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/4" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Question that asked:</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/5" class="indent">What vocational training and course are available to provide the skills needed for the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors; and whether there are plans further to establish such courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/6" class="indent">The LSC holds data on vocational learning in England that is funded through the public purse. Through Colleges of Further Education and other training providers we support business and individuals to acquire the skills that they need to achieve personal and organisation aims.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/7" class="indent">However, the actual content of qualifications is largely decided by the Sector Skills Councils, who represent employers in different sectors, and Awarding Bodies who develop qualifications to meet market need. There are a range of Sector Skills Councils with responsibility for occupations that require skills in energy efficiency and renewable energy, and as such no one Sector Skills Council is accountable specifically for this area of skill. The SSCs with most interest in renewables and energy efficiency include Construction Skills, Energy and Utility Skills, Built Environment (Summit Skills), property and facilities (Asset Skills), energy production and polymers (Cogent) and a range of manufacturing SSCs. Combined, these sectors account for a significant proportion of funded provision in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/8" class="indent">The SSCs are already supporting changes to provision, and courses are already being updated in line with the newest developments for example the addition of condensing boilers into standard heating and plumbing provision. Within the Energy and Utility Skills Sector Skills Council footprint there are 342 learning aims available to the sector, which represent 287 different qualifications. Within 2006/2007 there were a total of 11,781 individuals who enrolled on these qualifications which shows an increase of 17% on the previous year. In addition to these qualifications there are four apprenticeship frameworks specifically developed for the sector. The SSC will work with Awarding Bodies to ensure that the latest skills are taught within these programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/9" class="indent">The courses available in the future will be largely developed in response to the requirements set out by Sector Skills Councils. Each SSC is currently producing a Sector Qualification Strategy (SQS) covering all skills and qualifications required by their sector, and this must be fully implemented by 2010 at the latest, supported by appropriate National Occupational Standards and robust Labour Market Intelligence. The SQS will set out the need for accredited qualifications and other learning provision in each sector, as part of the SQS, each SSC will produce an action plan with more detail about qualifications which they view as no longer fit for purpose or supported by employers (and which therefore should be removed) and those qualifications which need to be reformed or where new qualifications need to be developed. This process will provide the mechanism for updating skills in line with new technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.5/10" class="indent">In England, from August 2009 the LSC will align public funding with those qualifications highlighted in SQS and Action Plans which LSC identify as a priority for public funding (mediated by LSC and government targets and priorities). Where the LSC deems a qualification as not fit for purpose, the qualification will be made ineligible for continued public funding. This will ensure that up to date qualifications receive funding and out of date skills are no longer supported.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124W.3/1">The current fuel duty payable on a litre of petrol is 50.35p and is the total amount of tax paid by businesses that can reclaim VAT. For households and businesses that cannot reclaim VAT, it is charged as 17.5 per cent. on the sum of the pre-tax price of petrol and fuel duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.3/2">In estimating the impact on receipts of spending on fuel it is necessary to take into account a broad and complex range of reclaims and displacement factor, over a reasonable period of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.3/3">The forecast revenue for 2008-09 from fuel duty is published in table C.6 of the 2008 Financial Statement and Budget Report. This can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_08/report/bud_bud08_repindex.cfm">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_08/report/bud_bud08_repindex.cfm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.3/5">Road fuel duties are charged at a fixed amount per litre and higher road fuel prices generally reduce revenues from fuel duties as they result in lower fuel consumption. The impact of higher oil prices on overall tax revenues and the public finances is complex, and will depend on their wider impact on the economy in general, including the effect on factors such as profitability and retail prices. Reliable estimates of the impact of changes in prices are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.3/6">The petrol price incorporated into the Budget 2008 forecast for fuel duties was consistent with the NAO audited assumption on oil prices. This assumed that oil prices would average $83.8 a barrel in 2008, the average of independent forecasts.</p>

We plan to invest over &pound;38 million to deliver some 670 new en-suite bed-spaces by 2012 after which around 70 per cent. of the SLA at Brize Norton will be at Grade 1 or 2. There will be no occupied Grade 4 accommodation at Brize Norton after 2008-09.</p>

Programme CATARA (the Centralisation of Air Transport and Air to Air Refuelling assets and Associated Units), is taking forward the development and reconfiguration of the station's infrastructure to ensure RAF Brize Norton's future contribution to the Defence output can be delivered effectively and efficiently. In connection with this project, we will provide an additional 200 SFA.</p>

	<p pid="b.1135W.0/18">Although we do not collect figures on the number of children looked after who were entered for a GCSE, we do have information on the number who sat at least one GCSE/GNVQ. This is shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1135W.0/19">We do not collect information about the number of looked-after children who achieve GCSE grades in individual subjects. However, these data are available at a local level enabling local authorities to set targets for the attainment of looked-after children at key stage 4 which include English and mathematics. These targets are negotiated with the National Strategies and Government offices and form a statutory part of a local authority's local area agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1135W.0/20">Since 1997, there has been an unprecedented focus at national and local level on improving outcomes for looked-after children. Over a five-year period from 1998, the Government invested &pound;885 million through the Quality Protects initiative and a further &pound;113 million through their Choice Protects funding. Looked-after children often have highly complex needs and improving their outcomes is a top Government priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1135W.0/21">In-spite of improvements, outcomes are nowhere near good enough. That is why we are now building on the Care Standards Act 2002, which introduced National Minimum Standards for children's services, and the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, which for the first time provided a legislative framework to support care leavers make the transition to adulthood. We have made nearly &pound;300 million extra available to deliver &quot;Care Matters: Time for Change&quot; and the implementation plan &quot;Care Matters: Time to deliver for children in care&quot;, including the introduction of a personal education allowance for all looked-after children who are at risk of not reaching the expected national standards of attainment. Through the Children and Young Persons Bill, currently before Parliament, we intend to require all schools to have a designated teacher to champion the needs of looked-after children and to ensure that local authorities do everything possible to avoid disrupting their education and training.</p>

From the information provided by local authorities to our delivery partner, Together for Children (TfC), our current estimate is that around two-thirds of designated centres predominantly serve children and families living in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged SOAs. The remaining centres predominantly serve children and families living outside of the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged SOAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.5/2">Local authorities, supported by TfC, are currently planning the final phase of delivery of the children's centre programme, so that by 2010 there will be 3,500 centres nationally, one for every community. As part of the planning process local authorities are reviewing the reach areas of existing centres to ensure that by 2010 all under fives and their families have access to a children's centre; that the range and intensity of services in each centre reflects the needs of the local community; and that resources continue to be focused on the most disadvantaged areas.</p>

The 'road distance to primary school' indicators used in the calculation of the 2004 and 2007 Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) were calculated on behalf of colleagues in Communities and Local Government by the Social Disadvantage Research Centre, Department of Social Policy and Social Work, University of Oxford. The indicator used in the calculation of the 2004 Indices, based on information for the academic year 2001/02, is available on the Neighbourhood Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/neighbourhood-statistics.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/neighbourhood-statistics.asp</a>. I understand that colleagues in Communities and Local Government are seeking the relevant permissions to enable them to publish the underlying indicators of the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 at lower super output area level, including those in the geographical barriers sub-domain.

BB100 is quoted as the compliance document for schools in Approved Document B (Fire Safety) 2006 edition, in support of the Building Regulations.

Between April 1997 and March 2006, the average gross salary increase for full-time regular qualified teachers in the local authority maintained sector in England and Wales, who were recorded as being in continuous service during the period, was 73.2 per cent. in cash terms.

In a small number of cases, some of this service may have been completed outside of the local authority maintained sector. Only salaries paid inside the sector have been used in the calculation of the average salary increase.</p>

Under the Land Registration Act 2002 (Transitional Provisions)(No2) Order 2003, a right in respect of the repair of a church chancel operates as an overriding interest in the case of both first registrations and registerable dispositions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149W.6/2">Land Registry does not keep specific records of the number of successful applications made for an entry in respect of this particular liability. It is able to obtain some information by a search of its computerised register database but this information is not conclusive because of the different ways in which the liability is disclosed and consequently either noted in the register or protected by way of a caution against first registration. Information that is held by Land Registry identifies the registered title of one property in Wales that contains an entry in respect of the liability. However, there may be others that could not be identified without a detailed search of each register of title to land in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.11/1">To provide information for the last five years would be at disproportionate cost. However, in reports published since January 2007, Her Majesties Inspectorate of Prisons has identified five young offenders institutions which have been using health care beds for behaviour management purposes&mdash;HMP and YOI Brinsford, HMYOI Hindley, HMYOI Lancaster Farms, HMP and YOI Lewes and HMP and YOI Parc.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.11/2">Action plans produced in response to the recommendations made in the Brinsford and Hindley reports have confirmed that young people at these prisons are no longer placed in the health care unit for behaviour management reasons. A health care needs analysis is being undertaken at Lancaster Farms and will consider this issue. Action plans have yet to be produced in respect of the Lewes and Parc reports.</p>

This requirement is incorporated into the Offenders Learning Journey (Juvenile) which sets out the delivery of learning and skills services to young offenders in custody in England. The Learning and Skills Council is also currently undertaking a review process which will ascertain the level and range of educational need for offenders in each custodial and community setting, thus informing the range and types of provision to be commissioned. We expect the reviews to include an analysis of the level of need for learners with learning difficulties and disability. The Welsh Assembly government lead on education provision in the two YOIs in Wales and this is guided by the YJB's National Specification for Learning and Skills which advocates the use of SENCOs.</p>

A release from custody could be from a secure training centre, a secure children's home or a young offender institution, with most releases being from young offender institutions. Data are not broken down by type of release establishment. The following table shows the number and proportion of juvenile offenders who re-offended within one year of release from custody for the 2000, 2004 and 2005 cohorts. Data for the 2002 and 2003 cohorts are not available.</p>

As part of this review, the FSA sought the advice of the United Kingdom's independent Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which examined the most recent evidence on the health implications of trans fats. The FSA recommended that mandatory restrictions on trans fats were unnecessary as voluntary measures undertaken by the industry, including the restaurant sector, had reduced average population intakes of trans fats to very low levels that are around half the maximum recommended average intake.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169W.8/2">The national health service will maintain the high standards of cleanliness that the current programme has provided.

Specialist Healthcare Commission inspections began this month, inspecting against the &quot;Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections&quot;. Copies of this publication are available in the Library. All acute trusts will be inspected annually on the cleanliness of their environment. We will also publish best practice guidance on deep cleaning later this year to help hospitals continue to achieve the best possible environment for patient care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.8/3">Information on trusts which had completed the deep cleans as part of the national programme is detailed in the written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-21">21 April 2008</phrase>. Details of each trust's cleaning plan are not held centrally as this is a matter for local discretion. Each strategic health authority was responsible for ensuring that appropriate deep cleaning programmes (that complemented existing cleaning regimes) were agreed in their areas and also that the plans were funded appropriately by commissioners.</p>
