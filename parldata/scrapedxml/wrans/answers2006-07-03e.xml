	<p pid="e.664W.6/2">The Building Schools for the Future programme adopts an area approach to transforming secondary provision. For each phase of the programme, local authorities are required to develop an educational vision in line with our guidance, which takes into account a range of policy areas, including PE and sport facilities, and community use. Our Building Schools for the Future guidance to local authorities covers the preparation of educational visions, joining up all potential sources of funding and the design of school buildings and facilities. All of our guidance documents make clear that schools and local authorities should consider the extent to which any proposed new or refurbished facilities will enable all pupils to take part in at least two hours each week of high quality PE and sport, and if they want to, up to four hours including out of normal school hours. Authorities' plans are subject to rigorous challenge before projects can proceed to procurement.</p>
	<p pid="e.664W.6/3">Ministers from this Department meet regularly with our Culture, Media and Sport counterparts to discuss our joint schools' PE and sports strategy, including curriculum matters and the community use of facilities.</p>
	<p pid="e.664W.6/4">Schools which have received investment through other sources of funding such as the Big Lottery Fund (formerly the New Opportunities Fund) are still eligible for Building Schools for the Future investment. We encourage local authorities and schools in Building Schools for the Future to seek other sources of funding to join up with their projects. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Big Lottery Fund contribute to our guidance, which also seeks to ensure that investment from various sources remains complementary.</p>

	<p pid="e.666W.3/1">40 per cent. of apprentices are female but we recognise there are some major imbalances in different occupations. One of the ways we are addressing this is working with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and sector bodies to improve information, broaden choice and explore more flexible Apprenticeship learning opportunities. These include new entry arrangements into Apprenticeships to help young people develop skills before they find an employer. We are also trialling Apprenticeships for more mature workers.</p>
	<p pid="e.666W.3/2">The LSC maintain a website detailing starts, leavers and completions of individual frameworks <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/">http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/</a> However, published figures are not broken down to the level of detail requested. For this reason Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="e.666W.3/4" class="indent">I am responding on behalf of Mark Haysom, due to him currently being on annual leave, to your Parliamentary Question that asked the number of completed Heavy Vehicle Fitter Apprenticeships in England and Greater Merseyside, broken down by gender in each of the last 5 years.</p>
	<p pid="e.666W.3/5" class="indent">The Vehicle Fitting Apprenticeship framework was implemented on 1<sup>(st)</sup> September 2005. This is in effect its first year for apprentices to enrol onto and as yet there is no usable framework completion data at any geographical level.</p>
	<p pid="e.666W.3/6" class="indent">Prior to 1<sup>(st)</sup> September 2005 there were more generic Apprenticeship frameworks in operation for the Retail Motor Industry.

	<p pid="e.673W.2/1">Promoting cultural identity is an integral and important part of the way languages are taught and studied in England. Intercultural understanding is promoted at each key stage. For example, at Key Stage 2 intercultural understanding is one of the five key strands of the Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages. At Key Stage 3 the programme of study, produced by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), states that pupils should make progress in developing cultural awareness, and in QCA's Key Stage 4 document, &quot;Modern foreign languages in the Key Stage 4 curriculum&quot;, it states that studying languages develops students' understanding and appreciation of different countries, cultures and communities, making students aware that they are citizens of the world as well as of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="e.673W.2/2">Citizenship teaching is compulsory at Key Stages 3 and 4. Pupils are taught about the world as a global community, and the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, and the role of the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations and about the United Kingdom's relations in Europe, including the European Union, and relations with the Commonwealth and the United Nations. Through the citizenship curriculum, pupils are also taught to think about political and cultural issues which could include a discussion about cultural identity. It is also possible for European cultural identity to be taught through the non-statutory framework for PSHE, which covers teaching about and developing a sense of their own identity.</p>
	<p pid="e.673W.2/3">Following on from the recommendations of the Adrian Smith report on mathematics, published in 2004, and our 14-19 White Paper, we have appointed a chief adviser for mathematics to be the champion of mathematics and lead in developing the mathematics strategy. We are establishing a National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics that will support the professional development of teachers of mathematics at every stage of their career. We are adopting a range of measures at GCSE and A-level to promote a positive attitude amongst pupils, teachers and employers to mathematics. For example, we will be targeting our support to ensure that the teaching of 'functional mathematics' is available to all; from this September, attainment of at least a 'C' grade in both Maths and English will be a key component of our understanding of the 5 good GCSEs benchmark; in the longer term, the curriculum and qualifications in mathematics for 14 to 19-year-olds will be revised as part of the wider reform programme; and finally, improvements planned for A-level as part of our 14-19 reforms will benefit all those embarking on A-level programmes.</p>
	<p pid="e.673W.2/4">Our national languages strategy 'Languages for All; Languages for Life&mdash;a strategy for England' outlines our positive approach to language learning and stresses the importance for society and the global economy for learners of all ages to acquire &quot;the ability to understand and communicate in other languages&quot;. Our commitment to language learning is backed by considerable investment, and by the end of the financial year 2007-08 we will have invested &pound;137 million in the promotion of, and support given to, language learning programmes at all stages of education.</p>
	<p pid="e.673W.2/5">English is a core subject and statutory from Key Stages 1-4. The national curriculum programmes of study for English set out the importance of English. English is a vital way of communicating in schools, in public life and internationally. In studying English, pupils develop skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literature in English is rich and influential, reflecting the experience of people from many countries and times. It enables pupils to express themselves creatively and imaginatively and to communicate with others effectively. Pupils learn to become enthusiastic and critical readers of stories, poetry and drama as well as non-fiction and media texts. The study of English helps pupils understand how language works by looking at its patterns, structures and origins. Using this knowledge, pupils can choose and adapt what they say and write in different situations.</p>
	<p pid="e.673W.2/6">In addition, both primary and secondary national strategies, through their work with schools and local authorities, provide strong and varied support to teachers. This support enables teachers to provide effective and tailored teaching that engages all pupils across the range of subjects and enables them to fulfil their potential. The national strategies provide a range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure that their schools both provide high quality teaching and learning, and promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for reading and writing and helps them achieve their potential. Reading for pleasure is essential as it increases children's chances of success and the Department is taking action on several fronts to encourage children and young people to read more. Both strategies have a specific remit for raising attainment in mathematics and English. The secondary strategy extends this remit to modern foreign languages.</p>

	<p pid="e.675W.2/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for the regulation of awarding bodies in England. QCA expects awarding bodies to make sure that question papers do not contain any errors that might affect candidates. The regulator's code of practice for GCE and GCSE examinations requires awarding bodies to have procedures in place to ensure the suitability and accuracy of the papers. QCA monitors the awarding bodies to ensure they comply with the regulatory requirements.</p>
	<p pid="e.675W.2/2">QCA has set performance expectations for awarding bodies governing the quality and accuracy of the question papers they produce. These performance expectations allow QCA to monitor and report on awarding body performance each year. QCA has collected and reported the number of question papers containing errors or omissions since 2004 but does not hold data for previous years.</p>
	<p pid="e.675W.2/3">If a question paper does contain an error that requires correction, awarding bodies are expected to send an erratum notice to centres (schools and colleges) before the examination is sat to make sure candidates are aware of the errors.</p>
	<p pid="e.675W.2/4">Data on the number of question papers issued without errors in June 2006 will be finalised after the examination series and published by QCA in March 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.676W.2/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) collects data each year from awarding bodies regarding the number of examination papers issued requiring correction including errors and omissions. These data are collected in the autumn following each examination series and are normally published in March the following year.

	<p pid="e.676W.5/2">In October 2005, 122,000 adults aged 19+ were studying on full level 2 programs in LSC-funded FE colleges&mdash;this is an increase of 3.4 per cent. on the previous year. Approximately 70 per cent. of these students received free tuition because of the level 2 entitlement or because of other reasons.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/3">The chief executive of the Learning and Skills Council, Mr. Mark Haysom, has written to the hon. Member with a detailed breakdown of level 2 entitlement recipients. A copy of his letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/4" class="italic"> Letter from Rob Wye, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-28">28 June 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/5" class="indent">I am write on behalf of Mark Haysom, due to him currently being out of the office on annual leave, in response to your Parliamentary Question that asked how many eligible adults have taken up the level 2 entitlement for free tuition, as announced in the White Paper, 21st Century Skills, broken down by race, gender and disability; and what proportions of participants have dropped out.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/6" class="indent">Early information shows that in 2005/06 approximately 118,000 adult learners enrolled on a full level 2 qualification. Of these approximately 28,000 adults were on a first<sup>(1)</sup> full level 2 qualification and in receipt of tuition fee remission. Of these approximately 12,000 were claiming tuition fee remission specifically through the level 2 entitlement. It is important to note that the level 2 entitlement was rolled out nationally in 2005/06 within existing college budgets and with no major marketing campaigns. A breakdown of these figures by race, gender and disability is shown in the attached annex. The proportions for ethnicity and gender are in line with the proportions of these groups in further education as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/7" class="indent">The proportion of learners recorded as being in receipt of the level 2 entitlement who left their current learning aims in 2004/05 before completion or achievement was 15%. This is the only full year data that we have for the level 2 entitlement and only refers to learners in the two trialling regions of the North East and South East.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/8" class="indent">In 2006/07 the level 2 entitlement is a key element of the recently launched Train to Gain service and I would be happy to provide you with further data when this becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/9" class="indent">I trust this letter provides the information you require.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.5/10" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Only for those adult learners where the prior qualifications information is known.</p>

	<p pid="e.678W.5/1">The process of setting funding allocations began last October when we announced our funding strategy, Priorities for Success. The strategy made clear that higher participation among young people must have the highest priority, alongside helping disadvantaged adults gain basic and Level 2 skills for employability. The allocations for 2006-07 are based on the principles that we outlined in Priorities for Success. The LSC have published a number of documents detailing how these principles would be applied in practice and the funding formula used to determine allocations is set out in the LSC's document &quot;Funding Guidance for Further Education in 2006/07&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="e.680W.2/2">The Department provides substantial support to schools and those who work with them in delivering an inclusive education that meets the needs of all children, through the funding it provides for schools and local authorities, the funds it provides for the Training and Development Agency for Schools and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the guidance it issues. The extent of the Government's commitment to supporting children in schools is illustrated by the fact that since 1997-98, total funding in England has increased nationally, by &pound;1,170 per pupil from &pound;2,940 in 1997-98 to &pound;4,110 per pupil in 2005-06. This represents a rise of nearly 40 per cent. per pupil.</p>

In addition, Switzerland and the countries of the Western Balkans will be able to participate once bilateral agreements are concluded.

	<p pid="e.682W.9/1">The Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning is legally binding on member states, as are all decisions. Article 1(3)(C) of the Decision states that a specific objective of the programme is to help improve the quality, attractiveness and accessibility of the opportunities for lifelong learning available within member states, which is in line with DfES policy. As Article 4 of the Decision makes clear, the Lifelong Learning Programme is aimed at supporting and supplementing action at member state level, and fully respects the responsibility of member states for the content of their education and training systems.</p>

	<p pid="e.683W.8/1">In England the priorities for public funding of adult learning are to help those adults without the skills for life and employability, regardless of age. Tuition in literacy and numeracy is free and there will be an entitlement to free tuition for a first full level 2 qualification across England from September this year for all adults irrespective of age. All adults can access a wide range of training courses offered by further education college and other FE providers where, currently, on average 72.5 per cent. of the tuition costs of courses are met by public funding through the Learning and Skills Council. In addition all those on income related benefits and their families are eligible for free tuition on further education courses.</p>
	<p pid="e.683W.8/2">There is also financial support to meet the costs of learning, such as books, equipment, child care and transport; it is discretionary, disbursed by colleges and targeted on the most disadvantaged and needy regardless of age. The Adult Learning Grant offers an entitlement of up to &pound;30 per week to individuals on low income undertaking a first full level 2 or level 3 qualification. From September 2006 this will be available to adults aged 19 plus in 24 of the 47 LSC areas, and nationally from September 2007.</p>

Ofsted inspection reports have found schools' compliance with the specific duties has improved since the introduction of the statutory duty which came into force for schools in 2002. In 2005 Ofsted published a thematic inspection report Race Equality in Education identifying good practice in schools and Local Authorities. The report found areas of strength in promoting racial harmony and raising ethnic minority achievement in schools but weakness in effectively handling racist incidents.</p>

	<p pid="e.690W.8/1">Changes to local school organisation, including school closures, are decided under local decision-making arrangements. Ministers have no role in the process. Individual proposals are determined by the local authority if they published the proposals and there are no objections. In all other cases the proposals are decided by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or the schools adjudicator, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision.</p>
	<p pid="e.690W.8/2">SOCs and schools adjudicators must have regard to Decision Makers' Guidance issued by the Secretary of State when deciding proposals. The guidance includes a presumption against the closure of rural schools and sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals. For rural school closures the factors include: whether the case is strong and in the best interests of educational provision in the area; the overall effect of the closure on the local community; the transport implications and whether the possibilities of federated or extended schools to increase viability have been considered.</p>
	<p pid="e.690W.8/3">Where a local authority or governing body plan to close a school they must first consult interested parties, allowing sufficient time for people to consider the proposal and respond. Then, after considering views, and if they wish to proceed, the proposer must publish statutory proposals. Following publication and a six- week representation period the proposal will be decided by the appropriate decision maker. Once statutory proposals have been approved there is a duty for them to be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="e.690W.8/4">Parents are able to register their views on a proposal during the consultation and representation periods. Any comments made during the representation period are taken into account when the final decision is taken on the proposal.

	<p pid="e.691W.2/1">Head teachers are responsible for curriculum planning and it is for them to decide how much time they devote to physical education and sport in the national curriculum. The Department for Education and Skills shares an ambitious PSA target with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who take part in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and on to 85 per cent. by 2008. The long term aim, by 2010, is for all children to be offered at least four hours of sport every week. This will comprise at least two hours high quality PE and sport at school and the opportunity for at least a further two to three hours beyond the school day, delivered by a range of school, community and club providers.</p>
	<p pid="e.691W.2/2">The annual National School Sport Survey is our prime tool for measuring progress towards these targets. The results of the 2004/05 survey showed that schools in school sport partnerships provided, on average, 15 different sports for their pupils. These ranged from football, which was provided by 97 per cent. of schools, to less traditional sports like rowing, bowls and squash. The results of the survey were published in September 2005 and copies were placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="e.691W.8/2">Sir John Egan was commissioned in April 2003 by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister to review the skills and training required to deliver sustainable communities. His &quot;Review of Skills for Sustainable Communities&quot; was published in April 2004. His key recommendation was the formation of a national centre to drive forward a new integrated approach to skills development.</p>
	<p pid="e.691W.8/3">The Government responded by establishing the Academy for Sustainable Communities (ASC) to improve the skills, knowledge and behaviours needed to deliver and maintain sustainable communities across the country. The ASC's aim is to challenge the tendency to adopt a silo approach by encouraging greater cross-profession and cross-organisation working. It focuses in particular on broader, generic skills such as project management, visioning, communication, partnership working and community engagement.</p>
	<p pid="e.691W.8/4">It is not a major training provider but rather looks to influence other providers and to lead the market where gaps exist. Through the establishment of a learning framework and resource hub, it will inform and spread best practice across the range of sustainable communities' issues and professions.</p>
	<p pid="e.691W.8/5">The ASC is also working with partners in the EU to identify generic skills gaps across Europe and share good practice between member states. It will host a European Skills Symposium in Leeds in November 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.693W.5/1">We withdrew our direct budget support because the Government of Ethiopia breached one of the three commitments underlying our aid partnership&mdash;respect for human rights. As set out in our 2005 conditionality policy, a violation of any one commitment could lead to aid being interrupted, withdrawn or delivered in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="e.693W.5/2">We have, therefore, not carried out a formal assessment of the impact of the withdrawal of British budget support on the human rights situation in Ethiopia; however, we are determined to see an improvement. We monitor the human rights situation closely, and many of those detained last November have now been released and an inquiry into the events of June and November 2005 has also been launched by the Government of Ethiopia. We await its conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="e.693W.5/3">All donors have agreed that the development partnership needs a greater focus on governance and human rights. This involves developing programmes to support governance reforms, but it also involves insisting on an open dialogue between government and donors on governance issues. This has begun.</p>
	<p pid="e.693W.5/4">In order to minimise the impact of withdrawing general budget support on the poor, we have developed with the World Bank a new Protection of Basic Services (PBS) grant. The aim is to protect and promote the delivery of basic services by local government in Ethiopia while making the administration of local services much more transparent and accountable to people at the local level.</p>

	<p pid="e.694W.2/1">The EU, that is the 25 member states and the European Commission, is the largest donor on water and sanitation in Africa, spending over &pound;1.4 billion in the sector in 2003-04. The EU Water Initiative was set up to co-ordinate these efforts, identify gaps and ensure that the money we spend is used more effectively to deliver services to the poor. The UK attaches great importance to more and better aid for water and sanitation, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa where the MDG targets for access to these basic services are so off track.</p>
	<p pid="e.694W.2/2">There has, however, been concern that political commitment to the EU Water Initiative has declined and that it is not delivering its objectives. A further problem is that with very limited monitoring and reporting mechanisms it has not been sufficiently accountable to its stakeholders. We have therefore raised these issues in the EU Water Initiative Steering Group and are now working with a number of other member states to reinvigorate the initiative, including developing proper indicators for monitoring and improving the focus of work in partner countries. We hope this will lead to renewed political commitment and better implementation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="e.694W.2/3">The EU Consensus on Development, agreed during the UK Presidency, referred to the EU Water Initiative and the importance of increased aid more broadly. In addition, the EU-Africa Strategy also included a reference to access to water supply and sanitation. In raising the political profile of water and sanitation through these policy documents, we hope that other member states will be encouraged to increase their support to the sector, particularly as their levels of development funding increase.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-03e.81830.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-03e.694W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="694W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060703/text/60703w0007.htm#06070318000146">
	<p pid="e.694W.5/1">International health worker migration is a complex issue and one that the UK takes seriously. Some low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have less than one health worker per 1,000 population. The proportion of African doctors who leave is very significant. Ghana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Zambia lose between a third and a half of the doctors they train to international migration. This rapid increase in health worker migration has been partly due to staff leaving their country for greener pastures. As a result the UK has been criticised for employing workers from developing countries. However, poor working conditions, poor salaries and a lack of training and opportunity for advancement have meant that many staff in developing countries leave the public health service. In addition to this, loss of staff through AIDS has depleted many health services.</p>
	<p pid="e.694W.5/2">The UK NHS has responded by putting in place policies to prevent active international recruitment of health care professionals. The UK is the only developed country to have a code of practice preventing its national health service from targeting health care professionals from developing countries. While the code on its own cannot address all the root causes of migration, it plays an important role in ensuring that recruitment is undertaken in an ethical, managed way. In addition to this, DFID supports efforts to strengthen health services in many countries, including to increase human resources. For example, DFID is providing &pound;100 million over six years to support the Government of Malawi's health sector programme, which includes doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors over the next six years.</p>

	<p pid="e.695W.2/1">Improving health care is a priority for Iraq's reconstruction and for the Iraqi people's quality of life. In the health sector, DFID has given funding directly to specialist organisations. Since 2003, we have provided:</p>

	<p pid="e.695W.5/1">Monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is the responsibility of the UN, and DFID uses their official assessments. The recently published United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report is a comprehensive account of progress to date on each of the goals worldwide, and how great an effort remains necessary to meet them.

	<p pid="e.695W.5/3">It is difficult to assess progress towards the MDGs in Iraq accurately, due to lack of official data. However, UNICEF is currently conducting a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in Iraq, which will collect data on the MDGs. The results of this survey, expected to issue by the end of 2006, will enable the Government of Iraq and the international community to take better stock of Iraq's progress towards the MDGs. DFID's most recent analysis of the available data on the MDGs in Iraq, conducted in February 2006, identifies the following:</p>
	<p pid="e.695W.5/4" class="indent">Child malnutrition rose from 12 per cent. in 1991 to 16 per cent. in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="e.695W.5/5" class="indent">Primary school completion rates fell from 62 per cent. in 1988 to 56 per cent. in 1999.</p>

	<p pid="e.695W.5/7" class="indent">Under-5 mortality rose from 50 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 125 deaths per 1,000 births in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="e.695W.5/8" class="indent">Numbers of children immunised against measles rose from 80 per cent. of children in 1990 to 90 per cent. of children in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="e.702W.5/1">Several faux fur manufacturers have made samples available to the Ministry of Defence. Between 1998 and 2004 the companies involved were:</p>
	<p pid="e.702W.5/2" class="indent">N&amp;MA Saville Associates</p>
	<p pid="e.702W.5/3" class="indent">Dawson Fabrics (also known as Fleece Fabrics Ltd.)</p>

	<p pid="e.702W.5/7" class="indent">Tyber.</p>
	<p pid="e.702W.5/8">After this date all samples were provided by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). PETA has not given the Department the names of the companies they have used. The trial process is on-going. The faux fur has been unsuccessful for a number of reasons: it could not replicate the movement of real fur when tested on parade; there were problems with increasing weight experienced under normal wet weather conditions; it did not retain its shape; and it reacted adversely to atmospheric static.</p>
	<p pid="e.702W.5/9">The Department has no current timescale to phase out the use of bearskins but alternatives will be considered if and when they are found to be suitable.</p>

	<p pid="e.711W.0/1">Due to the increased numbers of those leaving the RAF in April as a result of the recent redundancy exercise, coupled with the roll-out of JPA at the same time, it was not possible to process all terminal grant payments, special capital payments and pension payments within the normal five days target. During April and May some 1,830 awards were processed for those leaving the RAF, of which 1,395 were paid outside of the five-day target from being discharged. However, in all but six cases payments were made within 30 days, with the remainder paid shortly thereafter. There are now no outstanding payments.</p>
	<p pid="e.711W.0/2">The first JPA payroll in April successfully delivered pay, including allowances and charges to the vast majority of RAF personnel (42,104 out of 48,743). The 6,639 pay inaccuracies (over and underpayments) were caused by several factors: some were due to existing data errors transferred over from the legacy systems, some were input errors, and some were discrepancies in flying pay. The majority of flying pay was correctly paid by <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-02">2 May</phrase>; a small number of RAF personnel were paid their April entitlement in their May payments. The second (May) payroll has been much more successful with only some 1,175 personnel still affected by pay inaccuracies.</p>
	<p pid="e.711W.0/3">Some salary payments were late as a result of the simultaneous introduction of a new system of overseas bank payments. Overseas payments were achieved within a few days of the due date and alternative local cash payments were arranged. There have also been some difficulties with the automated payment of expenses for official journeys. In April these affected nearly 4,000 personnel and in May approximately 600.</p>
	<p pid="e.711W.0/4">The total number of personnel JPA will pay once it is fully rolled out is approximately 280,000. The Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency has received some 14 pieces of ministerial correspondence on behalf of constituents. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June 2006</phrase> there have been no formal grievances from individual users about JPA.</p>
	<p pid="e.711W.0/5">Full roll-out of JPA is dependent upon the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme. Alternative business processes are being developed for those who will not have self-service access when JPA goes live to their service.</p>

Under the fair deal for staff pensions, there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under public-private partnerships/public finance initiatives. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="e.715W.11/1">As a Ministry of Defence sponsored voluntary youth organisation that does not advertise it is extremely difficult to assess the number of individuals willing to support the combined cadet force scheme. Identification of suitable volunteers to operate a combined cadet force contingent is the responsibility of the school's head teacher. To date the Department is aware of nine state schools that have expressed an interest in forming combined cadet force contingents and have sufficient volunteers to support the contingents. This is in addition to the volunteers supporting the 52 state schools CCF already established.</p>

	<p pid="e.740W.6/1">The investigation was completed in April 2006. The investigating officer's report concluded that, despite procedural irregularities at the facility, the quarantine procedures for imported birds worked, and avian influenza was successfully detected. Following recommendations from the investigation, both the director and manager of Pegasus Birds received written cautions.</p>
	<p pid="e.740W.6/2">Both DEFRA and Essex Trading Standards learnt from the experience. DEFRA commissioned an independent review of avian quarantine for captive birds, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>. The Government response to the review is available on the DEFRA website:</p>

Recent research shows that at least half of English local authorities have run, or are running, some form of incentive scheme and some, such as Barnet, require householders to separate their recycling.</p>
	<p pid="e.748W.5/3">Many countries, including some in the European Union, have introduced successful household waste charging schemes, achieving reductions in waste arisings and increases in the separation of waste for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="e.749W.3/5" class="indent">The original system (CSCS) runs cases on the old scheme rules only. The new system (CS2) run cases on the new scheme rules; and also old scheme cases linked to a new scheme pulled through to the new system, although still operating on old scheme rules.</p>
	<p pid="e.749W.3/6" class="indent">Currently, the only way for cases to be transferred from the old system to the new system is through reactive migration, which happens where an old scheme case has a link to a new scheme application and is therefore transferred from one system to the other. There were 322,000 old scheme cases operating on the new computer system in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.749W.3/7" class="indent">An old scheme case that has been transferred from the old system to the new system is only converted to the new scheme where there is a relevant link with a new scheme application. Relevant links are ones where the new application will have a financial impact on the linked case. At the end of March 2006, around 41,000 previously old scheme cases had been converted into the new scheme, and were thus also operating on the new computer system.</p>
	<p pid="e.749W.3/8" class="indent">There is currently no policy for converting cases from the new rules and system back to the old scheme.</p>

	<p pid="e.754W.0/1">Current planning policy guidance on allotments and open space is set out in PPG17: Open Space, Sport and Recreation, published in 2002. This provides enhanced protection from development for all types of open space. In particular, PPG17 indicates that open space should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken that has clearly shown that the open space is surplus to requirements. It also includes specific policies to protect playing fields from development. These policies are supported by the Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields) (England) Direction 1998 which gives the Secretary of State for Communities and local government the power to call in planning applications affecting playing fields where local authorities have not resolved Sport England's objections.</p>
	<p pid="e.754W.0/2">Allotments are included in the typology of open spaces to which the policies in PPG17 to protect open space apply. In addition, statutory allotments are protected via section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925 which requires that local authorities seek the Secretary of State's consent for disposal or appropriation to another use. Consent cannot be given unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that certain criteria are met. Clarified criteria were issued to local authorities in February 2001.</p>
	<p pid="e.754W.0/3">The options for consolidating existing allotments legislation were considered following the DETR Select Committee Report, &quot;The Future of Allotments&quot;, in 1998, and it was decided that the best way to clarify the legislation was by promoting best practice. A good practice guide on the management of allotments and a guide for plot holders were published in 2001.</p>

The aim was to enhance compliance, reduce costs for firms, promote training and competence within the industry, tackle the problem of non-compliant builders and assist local authorities with enforcement of the Building Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="e.755W.0/2">The schemes were extended to cover electrical safety in 2005. In April 2006, in support of the new higher standards of energy efficiency required by Part L, further schemes were introduced to cover the installation of bathrooms and bathroom fittings, plumbing, heating systems and hot water service systems, ventilation and air conditioning, lighting systems, electric heating systems and associated controls, air pressure testing of buildings, carbon dioxide emission rate calculations and the installation of replacement windows and doors.</p>

	<p pid="e.755W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.755W.3/2">In the case of London borough of Barnet <i> v</i>. Abdi and Ismael, the applicants were both EEA nationals who were economically inactive and were not &quot;qualified persons&quot; for the purpose of regulation 5 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000. The status of &quot;qualified person&quot; under those regulations relates to whether or not a person has a right to reside in the United Kingdom under European Union law, for example as a worker. The Court of Appeal found that the applicants were subject to immigration control as they did not have a right to reside. This would have meant the applicants were eligible for homelessness assistance under the housing rules which then applied to persons subject to immigration control, in a way that was not intended.</p>
	<p pid="e.755W.3/3">To close this loophole, the Government have made regulations to narrow the classes of eligibility for social housing and homelessness assistance for persons subject to immigration control. The effect of this is to ensure that nationals from the European Economic Area (EEA) who are economically inactive and do not have a right to reside in the UK are not eligible for social housing and homelessness assistance in England (unless, exceptionally, they fall into one of the other classes of eligibility that relate to persons subject to immigration control). The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Amendment) Regulations 2006 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-20">20 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.755W.3/4">The new regulations reinforce the measures introduced in May 2004, and will help ensure that people cannot come to the United Kingdom simply to get access to the social welfare system.</p>

	<p pid="e.759W.2/1">The quality and accuracy of documents included in the HIP will be the responsibility of the provider of the document (as is the case under the current system). For example, the home inspector will be responsible for the home condition report, search providers for their reports and the seller for the forms they complete. The principle of caveat emptor will still apply, and the buyer's conveyancer should ensure they are satisfied with the information provided. Consumers will be able to get redress if they incur a loss due to inaccurate information.</p>

	<p pid="e.760W.5/1">In response to the Barker Review of Housing Supply, the Government announced, in December 2005, an ambition to increase new housing supply in England to 200,000 net additions per year over the next decade. This took account of factors including household growth, affordability, numbers of houses in plans and recent trends in housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="e.760W.5/2">The level of household growth over the past 10 years reflects in part the level of home building as where the number of new homes are restricted it can restrict household formation.

	<p pid="e.760W.8/1">The Design for Manufacture competition is being run by English Partnerships on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. It includes 10 sites across England which are currently in public sector ownership. Each of the 10 sites chosen for the competition is being sold to the successful developers in the usual way. It is anticipated that there will be mixed tenure on each site in order to ensure mixed communities, with some homes being available for affordable rent, some under shared equity and some for private sale. Around 50 per cent. of the homes will be affordable social renting or shared equity homes. For example, shared equity in two-bedroom homes on the first sites will be sold for between &pound;55,000 and &pound;70,000. The homes for full sales will need to take account of the land value as well as the construction costs, and their price will be set by the developers in accordance with the market conditions at the time. Therefore, the actual sales costs will be known once the homes are built on site and details finalised in accordance with market conditions at the time.</p>

	<p pid="e.766W.5/4">The duty owed to a person accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. As an alternative to the provision of temporary accommodation some authorities arrange for households to remain in their current accommodation (homeless at home), until a settled solution becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="e.766W.5/5">Our strategy, &quot;Sustainable Communities: Settled Homes, Changing Lives&quot;, sets out the challenging aim to halve the number of households in insecure temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="e.775W.2/2">There are two measures of overcrowding&mdash;the statutory definition and the bedroom standard.</p>
	<p pid="e.775W.2/3">Using the bedroom standard, the only recent estimate of the number of overcrowded households in Staffordshire is 3,000. This is from an ad hoc report based on combined data from both the Survey of English Housing and the Department for Work and Pension's Family Resources Survey for the three years 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="e.775W.2/4">Reliable estimates for the number of children living in overcrowded accommodation in Staffordshire are not available. Separate data for Tamworth are also not available.</p>
	<p pid="e.775W.2/5">Estimates based on the statutory standard are not available because the underlying data are not collected systematically. A one-off estimate was made in the autumn of 2001 that there were approximately 25,000 households across the whole of England that were in conditions of overcrowding that breached the statutory standard. This estimate was based on data from the Survey of English Housing for the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and from the 1996 English House Condition Survey. Equivalent estimates for Staffordshire are not available.</p>

In the East Midlands, counties are fully engaged in preparing the Regional Spatial Strategy for submission to the Secretary of State in the autumn and are chairing three sub-area working groups which will set out proposals. In addition, county council staff chair the various topic-based advisory groups that inform the development of RSS policy. Northamptonshire county council was closely involved in preparing the sub regional strategy for Milton Keynes and South Midlands that is already part of the regional spatial strategy. Once the strategy is published, county councils will be expected to help monitor its implementation.</p>

For example, in the recent East of England Examination In Public, Anglian Water and Thames Water both made representations to the independent panel outlining their views on the impact on water supply as a result of house building. However, such representations by water companies can be made at different stages of the planning process, both formally and informally.

Where local authorities have not adopted a statement of community involvement, they are required to comply with the minimum requirements set out in the Town and Country Planning (Local Development)(England) Regulations 2004 in terms of engaging the local community and stakeholders in the preparation of local development documents.</p>

The proposed revised curriculum includes the theme of Citizenship in which pupils can learn about their own cultural traditions and heritage, as well as that of others. The Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment has been asked to ensure that, in the implementation of the revised curriculum, Ulster-Scots cultural heritage is appropriately reflected in exemplars or guidance materials for schools.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget statement made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase> that CSCI and the Healthcare Commission will merge to form a single inspectorate for health and social care. The planned merger reflects increasingly close collaboration on the ground between people working in these two fields. It also reflects shared objectives for the highest possible standards for everyone using these services. The merger is part of a wider policy to improve regulation and help reduce the burden that it can place on the front line across health and social care. The intention is that the merger will take place in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="e.811W.5/2">To assess the risk associated with such eggs, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is carrying out a survey of eggs sourced from outside the UK and on retail sale in Britain. We have also been monitoring the levels of Salmonella in eggs being used in the catering trade. When these surveys are completed the FSA will have a better understanding of the risk associated with the presence of Salmonella in layer flocks. A recent European Union survey of layer flocks has highlighted countries with high levels of Salmonella infection in flocks and of th0se only Spain is a significant exporter of eggs to the UK. Therefore, we are talking to the European Commission and with member states to see what further action can be taken, in the light of the results from the layer flock survey, that will further protect consumers.</p>

	<p pid="e.814W.5/1">National health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs) are independent public benefit corporations. The board of directors of each NHSFT is responsible for the performance and success of their organisation. They are subject to a rigorous and transparent regulatory regime operated by Monitor, whose statutory name is the independent regulator of NHSFTs.</p>
	<p pid="e.814W.5/2">I am informed by the chairman of Monitor that, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-31">31 May</phrase> of each year, NHSFTs are required to submit forward planning information to Monitor. Once it has completed its analysis of the annual plans for the 2006-07 financial year, Monitor will assign financial risk ratings that will guide the intensity of its in-year monitoring. The risk ratings, together with the 2006-07 annual plans for each of the 40 NHSFTs, are due to be published on Monitor's website in September 2006 at <a href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk">www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.814W.5/3">NHSFTs with poor financial risk ratings are required by Monitor to prepare and deliver effective plans for financial recovery. University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which had a deficit of &pound;35.9 million in the 2005-06 financial year, is implementing a financial recovery plan that will return it to break-even by the 2007-08 financial year.</p>

Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under public private partnerships/public finance initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service pension scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the public sector transfer club. The club is a network of public and private-sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="e.833W.0/1">Opium is a major source of credit for many households in Afghanistan. It is used to lease land, purchase agricultural inputs and meet the cost of education and health services. Household dependence on opium cultivation for accessing services, and the opium debt which results from using opium as credit, are a growing problem in Afghanistan. Micro-finance can make an important contribution to addressing this problem and helping to promote alternative livelihoods to opium in Afghanistan. In 2005 the Department for International Development provided &pound;5 million to Afghanistan's Micro-Finance and Investment Support Facility (MISFA) to introduce a special funding window to promote and enable the expansion of micro-finance in poppy-growing provinces. This financial support is helping Micro-Finance Institutions develop financial products that better meet the financing needs for alternative livelihoods and the problem of indebtedness. Moreover, the MISFA programme is providing a source of legal credit to the poor and people on low incomes to access services, thus reducing the demand for credit from opium and therefore reducing the risk of Afghan households losing assets or land due to opium indebtedness.</p>

	<p pid="e.833W.3/1">At present some 80 per cent. of the population of Helmand are engaged in farming and a significant number are engaged in opium cultivation. The main contributing factors to opium production in Helmand result from the devastating impact of three decades of war. The conflict led to increasing poverty; a severe decline in investment in essential infrastructure such as roads and the Helmand irrigation system; insecurity and the lack of the rule of law; and the absence of a credible Government providing basic services. As a result, the people of Helmand have become increasingly dependent on illegal opium cultivation for income to meet basic needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.833W.3/2">The Afghan Government are looking to improve the situation for farmers in Helmand, but progress has been hampered by problems delivering Government development programmes there. To help address this problem, the Department for International Development will be spending &pound;30 million over the next three years in Helmand through the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme. This programme will deliver assistance through the Afghan Government's National Programmes in the province. These aim to extend the Afghan Government's authority and demonstrate that they can be a credible provider of public services, such as the provision of safe drinking water, credit for investment in agricultural business and essential investment in much needed infrastructure, particularly irrigation. These are all essential elements for increasing the number of legal employment opportunities available to households and reducing the dependence on opium cultivation.</p>

However, we recognise that if a woman decides she cannot go through with a pregnancy, she needs to be able to access services that are safe, as well as family planning services. This is in line with the consensus agreed by the International Conference for Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994.</p>

	<p pid="e.845W.6/1">In November 2003, the Broadband Stakeholder Group (BSG) established terms of reference for reviewing the regime for property taxes in respect of cable/duct infrastructure. These were:</p>

	<p pid="e.845W.6/6">The BSG published an interim status report in late 2004. While the interim report proposed options for a way forward, the working group driving the report felt that there were insufficient hard data (as opposed to anecdotal material) to draw firm conclusions at that stage. It was planned that the review could be concluded by March 31 2005, three months on from the interim report.</p>
	<p pid="e.845W.6/7">However, the review could not be taken forward from that point as, at the start of 2005, the European Commission launched a state aids investigation, which directly involved two BSG members. A decision on this case is expected imminently, at which point the review can progress as planned.</p>

	<p pid="e.846W.2/33">In both England and Beverley and Holderness the stock of VAT registered businesses has increased or stayed constant each year since 1997, as registrations have matched or exceeded deregistrations in every year.</p>
	<p pid="e.846W.2/34">The number of VAT deregistrations in England has increased since 1997. However, business closures are part of the functioning of a dynamic economy and represent willingness among the business population to take risks or the displacement of less productive and innovative firms by more productive ones. Research indicates that improvements in productivity and economic growth are more likely to come from higher levels of both business entry and business exit.</p>
	<p pid="e.846W.2/35">Regional disparities in start-up and closure rates can have their root in the different economic histories and different opportunities available in each region. The Government's aim is for every region to achieve success and good economic growth, which is why increasing resources have been put at the disposal of each Regional Development Agency.</p>

There is no explicit requirement for companies to report on their relationships with suppliers. Where reporting on relationships with suppliers is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company's business, it will be for the directors to consider what type of information to include in their review. The purpose of the Business Review is to inform members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under clause 158 (duty to promote the success of the company). The statutory provisions therefore set out the framework of the Business Review, but it is for directors of each company to determine its content according to the circumstances of the particular company. These are matters for the directors' judgment and it is for the company's shareholders to hold the directors to account.</p>

	<p pid="e.852W.2/19">Business closures are part of the functioning of a dynamic economy and represent an increased willingness among the business population to take risks or the displacement of less productive and innovative firms by more productive ones. Research indicates that improvements in productivity and economic growth are more likely to come from higher levels of both business entry and business exit.</p>
	<p pid="e.852W.2/20">Regional disparities in start-up and closure rates can have their root in the different economic history and different opportunities available in each region. The Government's aim is for every region to achieve success and good economic growth, which is why increasing resources have been put at the disposal of each Regional Development Agency.</p>

	<p pid="e.853W.2/1">The main source of Government finance provided to the automotive industry in recent years has been regional selective assistance (RSA), which in England was supplanted by Selective Finance for Investment in England (SFIE) in 2004. Since 2000, around &pound;150 million has been paid in grants to a wide range of vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers, nearly &pound;100 million of which was paid to vehicle makers. Grants are only available to companies in assisted areas, but the scheme does not discriminate as to nationality of the parent company.</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/2">In 1998, Peugeot was offered a &pound;2 million RSA grant towards the cost of investment to add a third shift at a time of strong demand for its 206 model. This project created 900 jobs, and the grant has been paid in full. In November 2004, the company was offered a &pound;14.4 million grant in support of 207 manufacture, but the project did not proceed.</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/3">LTI has not been in receipt of RSA or SFI finance.</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/4">The Government also offer various forms of technology grant from which companies in the automotive sector have benefited. At various times, both Peugeot Citroen and LTI have participated in consortia which have received grants, but accurate figures on individual shares of consortium funding are not available to DTI. That said, supported projects have included the Efficient-C project (involving PSA Peugeot Citroen, QinetiQ and Ricardo) and the LTI 'e-Mercury' electric vehicle. The latter was subsequently spun out as a stand-alone project. The independent company Modec now runs this project, and production commences in Coventry later this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/5">The principal source of specific automotive industry-related funding is the Automotive Innovation and Growth Team (AIGT) suite of initiatives, including Supply Chain Groups, Automotive Academy and Centres of Excellence, against which a total commitment of &pound;45 million has been made. Again, these do not discriminate as to nationality of ownership, although direct funding is available only to UK-based companies and organisations.</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/6">Tax incentives such as</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/7" class="indent">R&amp;D tax credits, to encourage greater R&amp;D spending in order to promote investment in innovation,</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/8" class="indent">R&amp;D allowances for capital expenditure on research and development, and enhanced rates of Industrial Buildings Allowances for qualifying enterprise zone expenditure</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.2/9">are available to all companies in the UK irrespective of their ownership or the specific industrial sector in which they operate. The amounts by which individual companies have benefited from such measures are not a matter of public record and no breakdown would be available distinguishing between companies on the basis of their ownership.</p>

	<p pid="e.861W.6/1">The Renewables Obligation is the Government's key mechanism for encouraging new renewable generating capacity and will stay in place until 2027. The current Energy Review is looking at a wide range of issues including emerging renewable technologies such as offshore wind and will report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/2">The DTI has a 2010 Target Team to remove the barriers to development of renewable energy and achieve the Government's target of 10 per cent. of electricity by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/3">Many of the issues being tackled will assist the development of offshore wind beyond 2010. The higher cost of developing offshore wind remains an issue, and the costs of connection to the electricity grid are part of that. Grid connections are likely to form 10-15 per cent. of capital costs for the Round 2 wind farms, given the considerable cable lengths involved.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/4">Certainty about how the grid connection costs will be funded, and the regulation that controls them, is therefore a key factor that developers need in preparing their business models.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/5">In March this year the Government announced their decision to extend the existing onshore model of regulation of transmission links. Following a joint consultation with Ofgem the Government concluded that this approach has a number of clear advantages for offshore projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/6">First, extending the regulated price control approach offshore will ensure consistency with the regulatory arrangements onshore. Secondly, it will provide a financial benefit to offshore developers by spreading the costs they face to connect to the onshore electricity system over a number of years. Finally, it will mean that the responsibility for developing the offshore transmission network will be shared by the system operator and the transmission asset owners who can bring their existing expertise to bear.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/7">The DTI and Ofgem are now leading the project to put the new regime in place to connect a proportion of Round 2 projects in time to contribute to the 2010 target, and to ensure there is an enduring framework in place beyond 2010 for offshore wind and other forms of offshore renewables.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/8">The Government have provided capital grants of &pound;107 million to stimulate early development of a significant number of offshore wind farms under the Round 1 offshore wind programme. This will have a significant benefit in the development of offshore wind post-2010 by underpinning the development of the industry and equipment supply chains and will build skills, providing a learning experience which can improve confidence and help reduce future costs and enable future projects to proceed without the need for grant support.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/9">The DTI established the Research Advisory Group (RAG) to facilitate a co-ordinated approach among the regulatory and funding bodies to address the key impact issues of Round 2 wind farm proposals. The DTI has allocated an initial programme budget of up to &pound;2.5 million for offshore wind farm issues, and has collated a list of the potential environmental issues in relation to offshore wind farms and has taken forward and funded a number of these projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/10">The DTI, MOD and Civil Aviation Authorities are working to develop mitigation technologies for offshore and onshore radar issues.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/11">The Renewables Advisory Board is also working on the longer term economics of offshore wind to identify cost savings for Round 2 projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.861W.6/12">While Round 2 offshore wind projects will contribute to our targets for 2010 and beyond, there are also enormous economic benefits for the UK in offshore wind. The DTI's Business Development Team is working to ensure that UK companies maximise the opportunities for offshore wind projects.</p>

Compared with other plants which are used to make biofuels or energy, opium plants have a relatively low yield. In countries where they are grown for the unregulated drug trade, a better solution would therefore be for the growers to change to other crops.</p>

	<p pid="e.863W.2/1">The windfall tax to which the question refers is a tax of 68 per cent. on gold and copper, and was introduced by the Mongolian Parliament in May 2006. While I am not aware of any British investment in either of these sectors, this move will undoubtedly have negative implications for other foreign investors. British companies are however active in other sectors, albeit at an exploratory stage. In addition, a new minerals law is currently before the Mongolian Parliament, and as drafted, this law contains a number of provisions that in our view would discourage investment. Our embassy in Ulaanbaatar is monitoring the situation carefully, and we take every opportunity to impress upon the Government the need to provide a fair and transparent business environment in order to encourage the large-scale investment that the country badly needs.</p>

	<p pid="e.866W.9/1">International studies rate the UK as having one of the most favourable regulatory regimes for business in the world. In 2005 the OECD ranked the UK second only to Australia with regard to the quality of its product market regulation, while the World Bank placed the UK top among the major economies for regulatory quality.</p>
	<p pid="e.866W.9/2">An assessment of the UK's productivity and competitiveness is reported annually in the Productivity and Competitiveness Indicators. This reveals that the UK's light-touch product market regulation makes the UK an attractive place for foreign investors: it has the highest stock of inward investment of any G7 country, as a percentage of GDP. The UK Government recognise that these benefits stem from an effective regulatory framework, which is why better regulation is an important focus of current Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="e.866W.9/3">The UK's competition regime also forms an important part of its regulatory framework, and here again independent assessment by expert peer reviewers KPMG placed the UK's regime third in the world in 2004. Also, the Global Competition Review has praised the UK's Competition Commission as one of the best competition enforcement agencies in the world, coming joint first (with the US Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice). Encouraging a high level of competition acts as a catalyst for firms to invest and innovate in order to stay ahead of their competitors.</p>

	<p pid="e.870W.3/1">Government policy ensures that all wind farm applications made under Section 36 of the Electricity Act are accompanied by an environmental impact assessment which includes details of the likely impact on all parts of the environment, including birds. Application for smaller-scale windfarms are submitted to the relevant planning authority to determine under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and it would be for that authority to say whether an EIA was required.</p>
	<p pid="e.870W.3/2">When an application is considered, consultation will take place with a range of stakeholders, including statutory advisers on nature conservation and protection of the environment, as well as others who express an interest in the proposal. This ensures that decisions on whether to give approval for a wind farm are considered in the light of the best available information about its likely impacts.</p>
	<p pid="e.870W.3/3">In addition, should it be considered that there could be an impact on protected species or their habitats then an appropriate assessment must be undertaken pursuant to the Conservation (Natural Habitats,&amp;c.) Regulations 1994, irrespective of who the decision taker may be. In such circumstances the decision taker must consult the appropriate nature conservation body (English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales or Scottish Natural Heritage) and take its views into account before making any decision on whether to approve the application.</p>
	<p pid="e.870W.3/4">Furthermore, the DTI has established a Research Advisory Group to fund research into the impact of wind farms on the environment. This includes a joint study with wind farm developers and DEFRA to collect data on the distribution of sea birds in the three strategic offshore wind farm areas, the results of which will inform decisions on the grant of consent for wind farm projects in those areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.875W.5/1">Elliott House opened as a bail hostel in June 1993 and, from the outset, accommodated individuals on bail with mental disorders. In June 1994, it was re-designated as a probation and bail hostel. In August 2001, it was re-designated as an approved premises, this permits the site to be used for accommodating persons granted bail in criminal proceedings and persons convicted of offences in connection with their supervision or rehabilitation. Since Elliott House opened in June 1993, it has housed a range of individuals including those either charged with sex offences and on bail or, since August 2001, those on licence from custody having been convicted of sex offences.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.5/2">The Home Department has not collated any concerns that have been raised about the presence of sex offenders in Elliott House. There has been no recorded incident of sexual offending by any resident against the community.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.5/3">Certain sex and violent offenders are accommodated in approved premises in order to provide public protection. Offenders may be closely monitored and supervised in approved premises, in order to ensure compliance with their licence conditions and to ensure that swift enforcement action is taken, where offenders' behaviour presents a risk of harm to the public.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.5/4">It is important that the public feels secure. In order to maintain public confidence in our systems for managing the risks posed by such offenders, it was decided that child sex offenders should no longer be housed in approved premises that are immediately adjacent to schools and nurseries.</p>
	<p pid="e.875W.5/5">Offenders will be moved from Elliott House following a thorough risk assessment once suitable alternative accommodation has been found, where supervision and treatment may continue. The supervision and treatment are both necessary to address the offender's risk of re-offending.</p>

	<p pid="e.877W.11/2">We have introduced comprehensive legislation to criminalise trafficking in human beings. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force in May 2004, introduces new, wide-ranging offences covering trafficking into, within, and out of the UK for any form of sexual exploitation. A new offence of &quot;trafficking people for exploitation&quot; covering forced labour, removal of organs and the trafficking of vulnerable people, including children, is included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004 and came into force in December 2004. Prior to 2003, the Immigration Act 1971 was adopted for trafficking offences. There was one conviction in 2003 under that piece of legislation. In that case the defendant received a sentence of 10 years. This sentence was increased on appeal in 2004 to 23 years by the court of appeal on application by the Attorney-General as it was deemed unduly lenient.</p>
	<p pid="e.877W.11/3">In 2004 sentences for trafficking offences ranged from six to 18 years. In 2005 sentences for trafficking offences ranged from four to 21 years. In 2006 sentences for trafficking offences have so far ranged from four to seven years.</p>
	<p pid="e.877W.11/4">To date no convictions have been achieved for trafficking for labour exploitation.</p>

	<p pid="e.885W.5/1">Overcrowding, and its subsequent effects in terms of prisoners' distance from home, prisoner transfers and the time prisoners spend out of their cells, may be one factor in heightening the distress linked to suicide. However, the most important explanation of why prisoners harm and kill themselves is that a high proportion of prisoners arrive in prison with risk factors such as a history of abuse or drugs/alcohol problems. This is true for all parts of the prison estate.</p>

They received comprehensive induction training prior to deployment, and are issued with training notes and guidance templates.

My predecessor Paul Goggins met with the SIA on a number of occasions to discuss the impact of the implementation date of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>. The SIA put in place a system 14 months before the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase> to manage the transition to licensing. This date was agreed after consultation with the industry, who had undertaken to submit their applications in good time. While some did submit their applications in good time, other parts of the industry failed to do so. The SIA wants all of the security industry to be compliant with the law as soon as possible and has taken additional steps to speed up the processing of licence applications. These include temporarily doubling the capacity of the SIA's licensing system and working closely with companies to reduce applicant error rates. Enforcement action is a matter for the SIA and the police. ACPO and the SIA have issued joint Enforcement Guidelines in which they stated they intend to take a measured and proportionate approach to enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="e.894W.0/1">Following a public consultation exercise last year, a full regulatory impact assessment was completed, and placed in the Library along with the regulations. This included a small firms impact test which acknowledged that small organisations would probably not be able to satisfy the minimum threshold and would need to approach other organisations in order to obtain checks on their employees and incur the associated costs. However, in some cases it was concluded that the costs of using such an organisation would be lower than the administrative costs of running and maintaining a small volume registered body. No race related issues were identified during the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="e.894W.0/2">The changes arose from a key recommendation of the 2002 independent review of the CRB and were supported by the recent Bichard inquiry that recommended reducing the number of registered bodies from over 14,000 that existed at the time. It also follows the CRB's own research that revealed that up to a third of registered bodies were not fully complying with the guidance and the code of practice and explanatory guide issued by the CRB which is a condition of registration. One of the areas of weakness was in completing the requisite identity checks on applicants.</p>
	<p pid="e.894W.0/3">The intention is to make the registered body network more professional and more experienced in the disclosure process which will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is proficient in the security and policies of the CRB. Setting an annual threshold is a key part of the CRB's strategy to enhance the effectiveness of, and improve standards within the registered body network.</p>
	<p pid="e.894W.0/4">The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations on the options available to access the disclosure service before their registration is cancelled due to low volume.</p>
	<p pid="e.894W.0/5">The CRB has written to some 2,800 organisations to inform them that they are to become deregistered. These organisations have submitted 10 or fewer applications in the last 12 months.</p>
