	<p pid="b.735W.3/2">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 which will be implemented from autumn 2008 provides the legislative framework to help prevent unsuitable people from working with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.3/3">Child chaperones will be covered by the requirements of the Act if they are supervising, caring for or offering advice, guidance or instruction to the children and they do so frequently or intensively. This includes both paid employees and volunteers. The requirements of the Act do not extend to parents, so a parent chaperoning their own child taking part in a performance will not be affected by the new requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.3/4">An individual who is barred under the new scheme will commit an offence if they seek to engage in this activity and an employer will commit an offence if they seek to use such a person.</p>

As academy schools are charities, any sponsorship payment that could not be claimed as an allowable expense would normally qualify for tax relief as a charitable donation. Payments made to academy schools by educational charities would be treated as charitable expenditure by the sponsoring charity.</p>

	<p pid="b.743W.0/1">DFID has a core department of 21 staff working exclusively on European Union (EU) aid policy and implementation. This includes one post in the United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the EU (in Brussels). DFID also fields 18 seconded national experts, of which 17 work directly with the Commission in Brussels and one with the current presidency. A small number of additional DFID staff have been seconded to European Commission delegations in Africa. In addition, a variety of other departments in DFID deal with specific issues to which EU policy is relevant, including: trade, migration, aid effectiveness, climate change, and preparation of the EU-Africa Strategy. None of these other departments are exclusively EU focused. DFID does not have a mandate for enforcing compliance with EU decisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.743W.4/1">The figures provided are for 2005-06 and are taken from HM Prison Service Annual Report and the Office of Contracted Prisons Annual Report.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.4/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> The establishment costs per place are listed as shown.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.4/3" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> The average cost per place of the private prisons is &pound;33,722</p>

	<p pid="b.743W.4/5">The costs quoted for privately-run and public prisons are not directly comparable, because of different financing structures and differences in services funded by other Government Departments. The public prisons' costs quoted are the direct costs of each establishment and exclude Prison Service headquarters, depreciation and cost of capital charge on land and buildings, major maintenance and rates. The private prison costs are the direct cost of each establishment, including controllers and exclude depreciation, cost of capital charge/credit, repayment of capital, and rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.743W.4/6">There are also a number of factors which affect the costs of prisons and so comparisons must be made with caution. These factors include: the size of prison, its age, its design, the occupancy level, the prison security level, the type of prisoner and the activities carried on in the prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.752W.0/1">Recycling is strongly promoted by a range of Government policies. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is working to maximise the amount and quality of recyclate used in UK manufacturing operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.752W.0/2">The demand for recycled plastic is very strong, both from UK manufacturers and overseas markets. The UK currently recycles or recovers approximately 19 per cent. of all plastic consumed, and this is set to increase to over 25 per cent. by 2010. WRAP has a number of projects over the next two years which aim to switch manufacturing processes from virgin to recycled materials, including a target to support the recycling of an additional 16 kilo tonnes of plastic bottles&mdash;an increase of 30 per cent. from current levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.752W.0/3">The new Waste Strategy for England, which we published in May, focuses action on key waste materials for greater scope for improving environmental and economic outcomes, one of which is plastic. The Strategy recognises that recycling plastics shows significant potential for carbon and energy savings through displacing virgin materials. Actions set out in the Strategy include developing proposals (subject to further analysis) for higher packaging recycling targets beyond the 2008 EC Packaging Directive targets, and supporting WRAP in its work to increase recycling of plastics and the recycled content of certain plastic containers.</p>
	<p pid="b.752W.0/4">We have set demanding targets, both nationally and locally, for household waste recycling and composting and the Waste Strategy sets even higher national targets, to reach at least 40 per cent. by 2010, 45 per cent. by 2015 and 50 per cent. by 2020. These targets are not material-specific, but we expect the range of materials collected by local authorities, including plastics, to increase further as targets become more demanding and as collection and treatment capacity increases.</p>

Refugees on low incomes continue to be entitled to free English classes.

We will be offering them every possible support in managing the transition from the present arrangements.

	<p pid="b.792W.10/1">The air-bridge to Iraq and Afghanistan operates from RAF Brize Norton. Where possible, military personnel based at Scottish RAF bases are moved to RAF Brize Norton by RAF Air Transport for onward transport to operational theatres. However, in order to make the optimum use of available aircraft this is not always possible, particularly for moves of small numbers of personnel or individuals. Guaranteeing the overseas air programme has to remain the priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.800W.5/1">Following comments from Telic and Herrick in June 2006, alternative boots were provided and sizing advice was offered to units. In addition, a trial to select new commercially available desert boots is due to complete during 2007. This will allow a new boot to be issued to all troops deploying in the autumn and a second alternative boot to be available from early 2008&mdash;thus offering some degree of choice. The Department has also initiated a project to introduce a web-based application for the controlled supply of personal clothing to provide service personnel with the ability to order from an online catalogue, with item(s) despatched to an address of choice. This could eventually change the way that items such as boots are provided.</p>

As it is likely that this project will result in the review, re-issue or withdrawal of some of the considerable body of existing guidance, it is my view that placing all operational guidance in the Library now would not be a good use of resources. Recently issued Operational Guidance for the Fire and Rescue Service is available on the Communities and Local Government website, and a substantial proportion of older guidance such as Fire and Rescue Service Manuals is available from the Stationery Office. In the medium term, I would see guidance being made available electronically and, as this is of an operational nature, I have no plans to place this in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.815W.5/1">This is an operational matter for the Audit Commission and I have asked the Chief Executive to write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Steve Bundred, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-27">27 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/3" class="indent">Your parliamentary question on how many shire counties moved to a rating for excellent in the comprehensive performance assessment by the Audit Commission in the last 12 months and your request to list them has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/4" class="indent">Under section 99 of the Local Government Act 2003 the Audit Commission has a duty, from time to time, to report on its findings and categorise English local authorities according to their performance in exercising their functions. CPA is the tool that the Commission uses to fulfil this duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/5" class="indent">In 2005 the Audit Commission revised the CPA framework in response to changes in the operational and regulatory environment, rising public expectations, and the performance of local government itself. Because the framework from 2005 is both a harder and a different test the CPA categories were renamed to reflect this change. As a result single tier and county councils are no longer categorised as excellent, good, fair, weak or poor. The five new categories introduced from 2005 were 4 stars (reflecting the highest category of performance), 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star and 0 stars.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/6" class="indent">National CPA reporting for single tier and county councils last took place in February 2007. At the time of reporting there were eight county councils that improved their overall CPA category to 4 star. These councils were:</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/7" class="indent">(a) Cheshire</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/8" class="indent">(b) Dorset</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/9" class="indent">(c) Norfolk</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/10" class="indent">(d) North Yorkshire</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/11" class="indent">(e) Oxfordshire</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/12" class="indent">(f) Suffolk</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/13" class="indent">(g) West Sussex</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/14" class="indent">(h) Wiltshire</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/15" class="indent">Following national reporting in February 2007, Somerset County Council was re-categorised as 4 star as part of the Audit Commission's quarterly reporting arrangements in March 2007 following a corporate assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.5/16" class="indent">Further information about the CPA framework and scores is available at <a href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/cpa">www.audit-commission.gov.uk/cpa</a>.</p>

We have introduced tighter monitoring to identify prisoners waiting an unacceptably long period for transfer to hospital, and a protocol was issued to prisons and primary care trusts in October 2005 setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a hospital place for more than three months following acceptance by the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.5/7">These measures have helped bring about positive results. In 2006, 33 per cent. more prisoners, with mental illness too severe for prison, were transferred to hospital than in 2002&mdash;up to 961 from 723. There has been a significant decrease in the number of people waiting over 12 weeks for a transfer&mdash;in the quarter ending March 2007, 40 prisoners were waiting, down from 51 in the same quarter in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.824W.8/3">Immigrants arriving at Dover will already have passed through the juxtaposed border control in Continental Europe. If the arriving passengers are residents of a country where pre-entry screening is required then they will already have been screened for tuberculosis.</p>

If detained at an immigration removal centre they are required under the Detention Centre Rules 2001 to be given a medical examination within 24 hours of admission subject to their consent.</p>
