Latest business surveys such as the Bank of Scotland June Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) indicate that the Scottish economy has been growing in the first five months of the year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) continues to back the Government's consolidation plans and advise against changing course.</p>

Fixed penalty offences are kept under continuous review and additions are made as appropriate. The Government&#8217;s new Strategic Framework for Road Safety issued in May proposed that the offence of careless driving should be made a fixed penalty offence. Subject to impact assessment and regulatory clearance, we expect this to come into effect in 2012.</p>

The proposed additional offences will include minor disorder offences committed in Royal Parks for which PNDs are currently not available, as well as other low-level disorder offences that may be appropriate to be dealt with by a PND.</p>

	<p pid="a.894W.2/3">However, the basis on which groups can be banned in other countries is not necessarily the same as the basis on which groups can be proscribed in the UK. A group can only be proscribed in the UK if the Secretary of State believes it is &quot;concerned in terrorism&quot; within the meaning of the Terrorism Act 2000. Some countries ban all political groups; other countries ban groups that are considered to be seditious, extremist or otherwise unacceptable. Germany, for example, has banned HuT on grounds relating to holocaust denial and anti-Semitism.</p>

In the event of a supply disruption, obligations on individual oil companies are lowered so that they can make these stocks available to the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.5/2">In response to the International Energy Agency's call for collective release of 60 million barrels, the UK has lowered the compulsory stocking obligations on oil companies by two and a half days to release around 3 million barrels over an initial period of 30 days from <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-25">25 June 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.908W.8/1">On June 23 the UK joined its partners in the International Energy Agency (IEA) in releasing oil stocks to the market. A total of 60 million barrels of oil was made available to the market over 30 days, with the UK contributing some 3 million barrels.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.8/2">The IEA assessed that unrest in Libya has removed 132 million barrels of light, sweet crude from the market by the end of May, and that normal seasonal increase in refiner demand expected for this summer will exacerbate the shortfall further. Greater tightness in the oil market could threaten to undermine the global economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.8/3">The IEA collective action is intended to complement increases in output already announced by producer countries such as Saudi Arabia. It will help to bridge the gap until sufficient additional oil from them reaches global markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.8/4">In conjunction with the IEA, the UK will be participating in monitoring the volumes of stock released, both domestically and internationally. Oil stocks are expected to begin to be released to the market from early July.</p>

	<p pid="a.914W.9/2">Well-supplied oil and gas markets from a diverse range of suppliers are an important foundation for global growth and for the UK&#8217;s prosperity. It is the sovereign right of every nation to decide whether to produce resources within its jurisdiction, and we would not press for any agreement to limit this on a geographical basis. We would expect all oil and gas drilling, wherever carried out, to be properly regulated and licensed and carried out in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.2/1">It is for local authorities to determine the allocation of their resources and I am sure that in doing so they will be taking into account both their statutory responsibilities and the needs of the most vulnerable children and young people. The Department for Education has not made its own assessment, but I am aware of the research that has been carried out by other organisations. I am pleased that this research suggests that in making difficult decisions, most local authorities are taking steps to protect the most vulnerable children.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.5/2">In light of the proposed changes to the Vetting and Barring Scheme and Criminal Records regime, and subject to the passage of the Protection of Freedoms Bill, the Government will be revisiting the current guidance on recruitment in schools. This will include reviewing the guidance on use of agency and other temporary workers. My Department is giving careful consideration to the issues, including the suggestion that schools and colleagues should be provided with direct evidence that checks have been carried out. In our considerations, we will be mindful of the importance of avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy for schools and the recruitment industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.8/2">The organisations within the arts and culture sector are vital partners in achieving cultural education for all children. Our Schools White Paper, &#8220;The Importance of Teaching&#8221;, stated our commitment to ensuring that every child experiences a high quality cultural education. Following a well-received review of music education earlier this year, Darren Henley, Managing Director of Classic FM, is currently undertaking a review of cultural education and we expect to receive from him, later this year, recommendations on how best to achieve this.</p>

This guidance was strengthened in 2010 through the Secretary of State's four tests, which included the requirement that commissioners must demonstrate evidence of strengthened patient and public engagement.

	<p pid="a.930W.0/3">This document sets out the Department's view of the legal position in relation to interventions taken prior to death to facilitate non-heartbeating donation, now more commonly called donation after circulatory or cardiac death. Any action taken prior to death where the patient lacks capacity must be in their best interests in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Although it is therefore not possible to say categorically whether a specific action or decision will always be in every patient's best interests, anything that places the person at risk of serious harm or distress is unlikely ever to be in the person's best interests.</p>

I strongly support a national framework, although it is for each police force to decide whether to participate. I welcome the choice of the vast majority of English and Welsh police forces to take part and would encourage the few forces that are not yet participating to follow this approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.933W.3/1">There is no specific proposal to increase the fixed penalty of &#163;200 issued by the police for using an uninsured vehicle. However, as stated in the Strategic Framework for Road Safety we will consider the level of this along with other motoring offences and fixed penalties. At the same time we are keen to see the courts make full use of the range of penalties for this offence. We do recognise there is a strong case for better correspondence between penalties and the cost of purchasing insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.933W.3/2">A new offence of keeping a vehicle without insurance has recently been introduced. Under the Continuous Insurance Enforcement scheme, keepers of vehicles which appear to be uninsured, but have no Statutory Off Road Notification in force will be fined a fixed penalty of &#163;100 by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency with further enforcement action&#8212;wheel-clamping, impounding and ultimately prosecution by the courts. The scheme, including the penalty, will be reviewed as part of the post implementation review.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.9/1">As part of the Government's measures to address climate change, the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) ensures a growing proportion of UK road transport fuels are from sustainable renewable sources. The RTFO includes a certificate trading mechanism to increase the efficiency of compliance. The value of individual renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) is determined by the market and depends upon the relative cost of supplying biofuel and fossil fuels. RTFCs for the obligation period 2010-11 have sold at 15p to 24p at auction. We continue to monitor the market value of RTFCs and consider that to date the RTFO has met its objective of driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.945W.3/1">The Government encourage the European Patent Office's (EPO) work-sharing activities through its seat on the EPO's Administrative Council. The UK has encouraged the EPO to get involved in foundation project work-sharing schemes with the other four biggest Intellectual Property Offices (the United States, Japan, China and South Korea). In addition to these, the UK has encouraged the EPO's involvement in a number of schemes with USPTO and JPO exclusively:</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.3/2">JP First, launched April 2008, in which the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) examines early applications which have also been filed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the EPO, so that the other offices can make use of the work of the JPO when they examine cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.3/3">The Triway pilot program in which the USPTO shares its search results, and search history, with the EPO and the JPO at an early stage, so that they may use them in their own searches.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.3/4">Another important international work-sharing scheme is the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) which allows applicants at a first office to benefit from accelerated processing of their application at a second office in exchange for behaviour which makes processing easier for the second office. The Intellectual Property Office of the UK signed its first PPH agreement with Japan in July 2007, and encouraged the European Patent Office to do likewise. The EPO signed a trilateral PPH agreement with Japan and the US which came into effect in January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.3/5">While these initiatives are a positive step forward, there remains much work to be done, and we continue to encourage the EPO to engage in work-sharing.</p>
