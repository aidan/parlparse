	<p pid="e.8W.9/1">Neighbourhood Watch schemes are set up on a voluntary basis and are not subject to monitoring by the Government. It is therefore not possible to state how many schemes are currently active. The Government do not directly fund schemes or associations but provide support through the funding of public liability insurance, publications and literature, maintenance of a website and managing the Neighbourhood Watch logo.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.9/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>, 127,000 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in England and Wales had registered for public liability insurance via the Home Office Neighbourhood Watch website.</p>

	<p pid="e.13W.2/1">Market mechanisms, such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), play an extremely important role in tackling climate change by encouraging the cost of carbon to be included in production and consumption decisions.</p>
	<p pid="e.13W.2/2">However, as the Stern review highlighted, by itself carbon pricing will not be sufficient to tackle climate change cost effectively for the longer-term. The Stern review suggested that a three-pronged approach is necessary for tackling climate change: carbon pricing, technology policy, and the removal of other barriers, such as consumer inertia and misaligned incentives.</p>
	<p pid="e.13W.2/3">The Stern report highlighted that technology policy was an important requirement for bringing down the cost of carbon abatement over time and ensuring the necessary degree of technological development. Under the EU ETS the allocations for new entrants are based on best available technology benchmarks, which helps to ensure that new installations are developing clean and efficient processes.</p>
	<p pid="e.13W.2/4">The Government agree with Stern's assessment and regards initiatives to develop clean technologies as important complements to carbon pricing mechanisms such as the EU ETS.</p>

	<p pid="e.14W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> New planning policy published by the Department for Communities and Local Government&mdash;Planning Policy Statement 25&mdash;aims to avoid and manage the risk of flooding to new development from all sources. Planning authorities should direct development to areas at least risk of flooding and consider how land use planning can reduce the risk of surface water flooding through the development of Surface Water Management Plans and sustainable drainage systems.</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.2/3"><i> (b)</i> For existing development, the impacts of surface water flooding can be mitigated by providing safe overland routes for the discharge of excess flows or improvements to below ground drainage. Below ground drainage is largely the responsibility of the water and sewerage companies for the public sewerage system, but also highway authorities for road drainage and private owners for drains and culverts on their land. Local planning authorities can ensure that drainage arrangements for surface water from new development do not impact on other areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.2/4">For the future, DEFRA is currently funding 15 pilot projects to identify improvements to the integrated management of urban drainage. We also intend to give the Environment Agency a strategic overview of all forms of flood risk, including risk from surface water.</p>

	<p pid="e.25W.2/1">With respect to the sale of debts, Paris Club creditors have publicly stated their commitment not to sell their claims on HIPCs to creditors that might not be willing to implement the HIPC initiative. In their October statement, G7 Finance Ministers welcomed this step and urged all sovereign creditors not to sell claims on HIPCs. We will take forward discussions on this issue in international forums and with private-sector creditors.</p>
	<p pid="e.25W.2/2">So far as legal representation is concerned, we believe the right approach is to focus on creating a level playing field in which HIP countries have the resources and expertise to defend themselves. In this context, we are working with the African Development Bank to develop proposals for a legal assistance facility to ensure that countries have access to high quality legal advice to help them fight law suits.</p>

	<p pid="e.31W.7/1">Fire and rescue authorities are responsible for their own improvement. The Government set out performance expectations in the Fire and Rescue National Framework. The Audit Commission regularly assesses the performance of all fire and rescue authorities, and identifies areas of strengths and areas for improvement which fire and rescue authorities are expected to address. The Government fund the Audit Commission for conducting this work. In 2005, the Audit Commission assessed West Midlands fire and rescue authority as &quot;good&quot; in the comprehensive performance assessment for the fire and rescue service. Since then, the West Midlands has been judged as &quot;improving well&quot; by the Audit Commission in their 2006-07 performance assessment work and as &quot;performing well&quot; in their use of resources and delivery of value for money and in their front-line service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="e.31W.7/2">In addition to their performance assessment work, the Audit Commission has a local &quot;relationship manager&quot; for each fire and rescue authority who can provide ongoing advice to authorities on improvement issues. Fire and rescue authorities also have access to the joint Department for Communities and Local Government and Local Government Association capacity building programme through their Regional Improvement and Efficiency Partnership.</p>

The Department for Transport has commissioned the testing of equipment which may be capable of capturing substances released during fume events. Subject to the results of this testing, the Department hopes to begin a study later this year or early next year.</p>

	<p pid="e.45W.0/11">However, extensive research published by Professor Stephen Stradling, Napier university, Edinburgh in May 2006 on behalf of the Midlands Partnership Group, found that drivers who have been detected speeding by cameras are almost twice as likely to have had a collision as those who have not, regardless of age or mileage. Three quarters of drivers reporting four or more points on their licence also reported collision involvement, compared with 42 per cent. of drivers with a clean licence.</p>
	<p pid="e.45W.0/12">Furthermore, the four-year independent evaluation report of the National Safety Camera Programme, published in December 2005 and covering the period 2000 to 2004, confirms that there is an association between changes in speed and casualties. This found that there had been a reduction of 6 per cent. in average speeds, a 42 per cent. reduction in killed and serious injuries and a 22 per cent. reduction in personal injury collisions at camera sites.</p>

The establishment figures refer to the number of posts within a battalion that may be filled by Infantry personnel (officers and soldiers). Therefore, it excludes posts that are filled by attached personnel of other Arms and Services such as chefs, clerks, etc. Establishments will also vary depending on the particular role of a battalion; for example, Armoured Infantry battalions have larger establishments than light role Infantry battalions.  2. The Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) was established on 3 April 2006 to provide high end infantry in direct support of UKSF on operations. The Unit is located in St. Athan, near Cardiff, in Wales. It is based upon the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) and draws manpower from all three services, including a Strike Company from the Royal Marines (RM), a Strike Platoon from the Royal Air Force (RAF) Regiment and a detachment of RAF Regiment Forward Air Control and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Specialists. The above contains only the Army element of the SFSG.  3. Strength figures include members of the Regiment serving with the battalion only i.e. 2 Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) posted to 2 PARA, it does not include other Infantry serving with the 2 PARA or PARA personnel posted away from the regiment. Strength figures also exclude attached Arm/services.  4. The Guards Division strengths and establishments exclude the Public Duty Companies e.g. Nijmegan Coys.  5. Figures are for trained Infantry Officers and Soldiers and include Infantry Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) personnel serving with the battalions.  6. Royal Gurkha Regiment figures are for the Regular Army Officers (UK Personnel) only and do not include the Gurkhas.  7. Strength and Establishment figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. Totals are rounded separately and therefore may not equal the sum of their parts.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.53W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has not met any of his counterparts in Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR) or Sudan to discuss the forthcoming ESDP mission to Chad/CAR. However, the issues relating to force generation and funding for this mission were discussed at the recent EU Defence Ministers informal meeting in Portugal which he attended. He emphasised that the UK supported the mission as an important contribution to regional stability and a resolution of the Darfur crisis, but made it clear that the role of the UK armed forces would be very limited given the extent of our commitments elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="e.53W.2/2">There are no plans for RAF aircraft to be used in the mission, and the British personnel to be involved will be four staff officers provided under the standing EU headquarters augmentation procedures. Under these arrangements, each EU member state undertakes to provide specified numbers of personnel to augment the nominated operational headquarters and force headquarters for an EU mission once these have been activated.</p>
	<p pid="e.53W.2/3">For the Chad/CAR mission, the UK will contribute a Commander (Royal Navy) and a Lieutenant Commander (Royal Navy) who have already deployed to the French operation HQ at Mont Valerien in Paris, and a Commander (Royal Navy) and a Squadron Leader (Royal Air Force) who will deploy with the French force headquarters to Chad/CAR. The parent unit for all four staff officers is the permanent joint headquarters based at Northwood.</p>

The great majority of NHS funding is allocated to primary care trusts, who will decide spending in each area of health care in the light of both national and local priorities. The exact spend on reducing cancer waiting times in each year of the spending review period will therefore be determined locally by the NHS, and is not prescribed by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="e.62W.5/1">The Department of Trade and Industry commissioned the University of Surrey to research the effectiveness of the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988. The resulting report&mdash;'Effectiveness of the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988'&mdash;was published in June 2000 and copies were placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report's findings were very positive: at a conservative estimate, the Regulations had saved at least 710 lives (1,860 when additional factors are taken into consideration) and prevented at least 5,770 injuries from 1988 to 1997. Recent figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government show that the downward trend in deaths and injuries has continued. I am currently considering whether further public awareness of the requirements of the Regulations is necessary at this stage.</p>

We are carefully considering all the responses received before coming to a final decision on how the regulations should best be enforced in the interests of consumers.

	<p pid="e.65W.0/1">This is an operational matter for Royal Mail. The company introduced Sunday collections a few years ago to enhance their service, but there has been very little take-up from the public. Sunday postings are very low, but add a huge amount of cost to the business. Royal Mail have to have regard to their costs and are therefore looking to stop Sunday collections.</p>
	<p pid="e.65W.0/2">The Government consider the maintenance of a universal postal service throughout the UK to be of the highest importance. That is why the obligation is enshrined in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act 2000 and why Postcomm has the primary statutory duty to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff. Sunday and Bank Holiday collections are not part of the universal service obligation.</p>

Golf clubs and other private sports clubs which allow for payment of annual membership fees in more than four instalments may need a consumer credit licence. However, whether or not a licence is required will be dependent on the individual circumstances applicable to the operation of each individual club such as whether or not the club is classified as 'carrying on a business', if so whether this would be classified as 'occasional business' and whether the particular club's agreements might be subject to any exemptions.</p>

	<p pid="e.71W.8/1">Local authorities have estimated that during the period 2006-07 to 2007-08, over 4,300 settings would be supported through the Transformation Fund to take up the Quality Premium or Recruitment Incentive, and over 42,000 employees would be supported through the Fund to gain a full Level 3, 4 or 5 qualification. Levels of qualification in the work force are monitored through the annual Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey, which will next report in autumn 2008. In 2006, the survey showed that 73 per cent. of staff in full day care settings held a Level 3 qualification and that 3 per cent. of staff in full day care settings held a graduate level qualification.</p>

	<p pid="e.72W.2/1">In 2002 the Government's National Languages Strategy was published, with the overarching objective of improving the teaching and learning of languages across all phases of education, including delivering an entitlement that by 2010 all Key Stage 2 pupils (ages 7-11) will be able to learn a language at least in part in class time. Research commissioned by the Department shows that 70 per cent. of primary schools are already teaching foreign languages in class time.</p>
	<p pid="e.72W.2/2">In light of the continued decline in take-up of languages at GCSE following the decision in 2004 to lift the requirement on young people to be taught a language at Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16), we commissioned the Languages Review, chaired by Lord Dearing. This reported in March 2007 and made a number of recommendations that we are now taking forward. These include: making languages a compulsory part of the primary curriculum when it is next reviewed, backed by a teacher training programme in a primary languages specialism, increased funding for local authorities to support primary languages, and access to sources of support for classroom teaching; promoting a broader range of languages at Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14) by relaxing the requirement that schools first teach a working language of the European Union so that they can offer any major world or European language; and encouraging take-up of languages at GCSE level by including two new performance indicators in the Achievement and Attainment Tables to measure attainment and participation in languages and providing challenge and support to schools from School Improvement Partners and Ofsted.</p>
