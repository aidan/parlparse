	<p pid="b.1640W.11/2">Figures provided by DCMS indicate that an estimated 80 per cent. of applications made by pubs, nightclubs or bars, to vary licences resulted in the imposition of conditions (eg restriction of opening times, use of plastic glasses).

	<p pid="b.1641W.8/1">Following the recommendations of Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, last week my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary gave notice of his intention to merge the existing police forces in Wales, creating a single strategic force. In accordance with sections 32 and 33 of the Police Act 1996 these police authorities, local authorities and chief constables have until <phrase class="date" code="">2 July</phrase> to raise objections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1641W.8/2">It is imperative that there is full and open dialogue between the Government and key stakeholders. Negotiations on amalgamation will continue and I trust that the authorities will use this statutory period to agree the best deal possible for Wales. I will of course continue to discuss these issues with police authority members in Wales as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1643W.9/1">My Department engages with the Government of India at many levels on issues of caste and gender discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1643W.9/2">One example of this is DFID's support to the Government of India's Programme for achieving universal primary education; Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. One objective of this programme which was launched in September 2004, is to narrow the gaps that exist between the enrolment of girls and boys, and children from castes and tribes that have historically been excluded. These are known as scheduled castes and tribes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1643W.9/3">The recent Mid Term Review of this programme indicates that it has been very effective in increasing the enrolment of girls and scheduled caste children. Gender parity has improved by 3 per cent. and girls now represent 47 per cent. of the school population at primary level. The proportion of scheduled caste children has increased from 19 per cent. in 2003 to 21.3 per cent. in 2005. This exceeds the proportion of scheduled caste children in the general population. This success has been achieved through a range of strategies that have helped to tackle discrimination at all levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.1644W.2/2">The India Expert Advisory Group on polio eradication (IEAG) meeting in December 2005, attended by officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) reported that India has made its most important progress towards eradication to date in 2005. As a result of an intense eradication programme, polio cases in India fell by 50 per cent. in 2005 to 66; the lowest annual total ever, from 134 cases in 2004 (and 35,000 cases in 1995). Innovative immunisation, surveillance and community mobilisation approaches have reduced polio to its lowest geographical extent ever, with cases occurring mostly in western Uttar Pradesh and eastern Bihar. However, the recent onset of cases (seven confirmed so far in 2006) has demonstrated that progress is fragile and that strong political and financial commitment will be essential to finishing the job&quot;.</p>

However, the Government are aware that the proportion of transactions carried out through surcharging machines is only 4 per cent. and believes that it is unlikely to rise significantly in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1647W.12/1">The United Kingdom is signatory to the 1998 Convention on Driving Disqualifications <sup>1</sup> , which is intended to provide that a motorist, disqualified from driving abroad, should not escape the consequences of that disqualification when they return to their country of normal residence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.12/2">The 1998 Convention applies, as it stands, to the member states of the European Union as they were in June 1998. Once the Convention has entered into force (90 days after the last of the 15 original signatory states has notified the EU Council that it has adopted it), it will mean that any holder of a Great Britain or Northern Ireland driving licence disqualified from driving in another European Union member state in which the Convention applies will be required to surrender his licence to (or have his licence kept from him by) the United Kingdom authorities, whichever is applicable, until such time as the period of disqualification has been served. Under the Convention there would be reciprocal arrangements to deal with licence-holders of other states to which the Convention applied which had been disqualified in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, so that they would be disqualified in their state of residence for motoring offences committed here.</p>
	<p pid="b.1647W.12/3">The 1998 Convention will not come into force until all the original 15 signatory states have ratified it. So far only Spain of the original 15 has ratified; Slovenia has also done so. However, meanwhile signatory states may, if they choose to do so, cooperate on a bilateral basis within the framework established by the Convention. The United Kingdom passed the necessary primary legislation to enable it to ratify the Convention, or to apply it early under the process of notification provided by the Convention, as part of the Crime (International Cooperation) Act 2003, and I recently exchanged letters with my Irish colleague declaring our joint intention to cooperate bilaterally as soon as possible.</p>

Acetylene gas is a highly volatile substance that can explosively decompose if exposed to extreme heat.

	<p pid="b.1656W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.2/2">The Department and the Treasury have not discussed the matter of funding for the acquisition of the portrait of John Donne for the National Portrait Gallery. The sources of funding for the purchase available to the Gallery include grant-in-aid allocated by the Department, self-generated income, including bequests and donations, and contributions from grant-making bodies. Government has not ring-fenced any grant-in-aid to national museums and galleries for acquisitions since 1992&ndash;93. This allows the Trustees the freedom to decide how much of their grant-in-aid should be devoted to purchases for the collections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.2/3">The portrait of John Donne is on offer to the National Portrait Gallery by private treaty sale on the instructions of the Executors of the late Lord Lothian. This sale to a public gallery would be able to take advantage of the normal arrangements whereby a public institution can take advantage of the remission of any tax that would otherwise have been payable on the sale.</p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.2/4">Following tax remissions, the amount that the National Portrait Gallery must raise by the end of May is &pound;1,652,000. The Gallery has launched a public appeal, with a generous opening contribution from The Art Fund of &pound;200,000 and since then, some &pound;25,000 has been contributed by members of the public. The Gallery has also made an application to the National Heritage Memorial Fund for a contribution towards the costs of acquisition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.2/5">Both the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) and the Heritage Lottery fund have a good track record on funding acquisitions. Between them they have awarded almost &pound;200 million in grants for acquisitions over the past 10 years. The NHMF is topped up each year by a tranche of grant-in-aid which currently stands at &pound;5 million, but is set to rise to &pound;10 million in 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1657W.7/1">Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda. A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour. For example Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; DFES through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need; DEFRA and their work in tackling litter and fly tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and DCMS who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour. The Department for Constitutional Affairs also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of antisocial behaviour activity. In 2005&ndash;06, the Home Office has allocated &pound;75,000 to Swindon to tackle antisocial behaviour. &pound;40,000 has been used to fund Operation Graffiti&mdash;a multi-agency initiative to tackle environmental crime and specifically the issue of graffiti. &pound;10,000 has been used to implement the Its Your Call Anti Social Behaviour reporting line and ensure that it is resourced between 9 am and 5 pm during week days. &pound;25,000 has been used to work with the most anti social families. The Home Office has specifically allocated &pound;25,000 to every Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in both England and Wales to fund an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator. This amounts to &pound;9.4 million per annum. We have already provided guidance and support to local agencies including local authorities to help them to target resources and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated. The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 has been fundamental to our work which has changed the culture of public services and protected our communities. However, while attitudes are shifting, the public's concern is not yet adequately reflected in the priorities of all our services. The Respect Programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today. People need to see and feel thata difference can be made. Swindon received &pound;3,000 from the Police Standards Unit as part of the third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC). A number of local initiatives are underway to disperse people in antisocial behaviour hotspots in the town centre, including the proposed closure of John Street and patrols of licensed premises. The Government are determined to target those individuals whose abuse of alcohol results in causing disorder in our towns and cities. We have recently undertaken our third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign to crack down on such behaviour. We have also introduced a range of new powers through the Licensing Act 2003 to deal with the problems of alcohol misuse. In addition, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will introduce a new civil order&mdash;a Drinking Banning Order&mdash;which will allow for the exclusion from the area concerned of individuals aged 16 or over who are responsible for alcohol-related disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.1659W.8/2">The Circular which sets out guidance on the Cautioning of Adult Offenders emphasises the importance of accurately recording cautions in order to avoid multiple cautioning and to ensure consistency.

	<p pid="b.1659W.8/3">Under the current Association of Chief Police Officers General Rules for Criminal Weeding on Police Systems, a caution received for possession of indecent photographs of children should be removed after ten years provided there are no convictions on the record and no further cautions have been given. The Secretary of State for Education currently has the power (under s.142 of the Education Act 2002) to make a direction barring or restricting a person from working in the education sector, whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1659W.8/4">The list of people subject to such a direction is called List 99&quot;. The Secretary of State for Education recently announced that she would be introducing regulations to automatically enter on List 99 anyone who is convicted or cautioned for a sexual offence against a child. At present, convictions (but not cautions) relating to indecent photos of children under 16 constitute automatic barring offences for List 99. It has not yet been decided which offences will trigger automatic barring under the new Regulations, but the cautioning guidance will be changed as appropriate when the Regulations come into force.</p>

	<p pid="b.1660W.2/1">The Government's strategy is to bear down on all points in the drugs supply chain in order to disrupt criminal gangs, stifle drug supply and reduce the harm caused to communities in the UK. Increasing quantities of drugs are being seized and organised crime groups and dealers disrupted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.2/2">The latest figures published by HMRC for 2004&ndash;05, show that over 3,000 kg of heroin and 10,600 kg of cocaine were taken out, 299 trafficking groups were disrupted or dismantled and &pound;33.3 million of drug-related criminal assets were seized, depriving dealers of their financial lifeblood. The number of drug trafficking groups dismantled or disrupted rose from 193 in 2002&ndash;03 to 268 in 2003&ndash;04 and 299 in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.2/3">The numbers of seizures of Class A drugs have been rising over the last decade, and the total number of drug offenders brought before the courts has been rising continuously since 2000. The number of offenders convicted of producing or dealing cocaine, crack cocaine or heroin rose by 6 per cent. between 2003 and 2004 and over 80 per cent. of them received an immediate custodial sentence. In Swansea, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> to date the police report having charged 34 people with trafficking Class A drugs as part of their ongoing operations against supply. But we are not complacent. The Drugs Act 2005 increased the powers of police to bring drug dealers to justice. The Serious Organised Crime Agency, which comes into being in April, will further strengthen our ability to disrupt and convict organised criminals engaged in Class A drug supply. Police force restructuring will ensure that police forces have the capacity, capability and resilience to effectively deal with regional crime such as major and organised drugs supply.</p>

	<p pid="b.1661W.2/2">This included examples of best practice where the police were working with the local authority to make effective use of the powers available to the two agencies. The Home Office has also organised a number of action days with antisocial behaviour practitioners to share best practice around the topic of antisocial use of vehicles and has provided guidance through the TOGETHER website: <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk">www.together.gov.uk</a>.</p>

However, in light of the proposed provision in the Police and Justice Bill which will require BCUs to be co-terminous with local authority boundaries, many forces have reviewed their BCU boundaries. The 2006 boundary data are still being produced and will be available at the beginning of April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1670W.2/1">The Police and Justice Bill proposes to put the basic command units (BCUs) on a statutory footing and requires their boundaries to be aligned with those of local authorities. They will continue to cover a small geographical area within a force such as a town or district. In some two-tier areas, many district councils are too small to constitute a single BCU. It would therefore be possible to brigade two or more district councils to form one BCU. This would be a matter for chief constables following consultation with key partners, such as local authorities, in crime and disorder reduction partnerships and in local criminal justice boards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1672W.9/1">In the five year strategy for protecting the public and reducing re-offending, the Government sets out plans for a phased programme of contestability for prison and probation services&mdash;putting particular services out to tender. This will build on what we have already done in the prison estate and take into account our primary aims of protecting the public and reducing re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.1672W.9/2">Our programme will be published in a prospectus in the spring which will outline the time table and areas of service in which we will introduce contestability.

	<p pid="b.1673W.2/1">The Government are keen to improve the accountability between the police, local authorities and other service providers and the public. The Community Call for Action provisions contained in the Police and Justice Bill will give more power to local communities and provide a mechanism for local communities to demand a response from agencies to persistent local community safety or antisocial behaviour problems, via an approach to their ward councillor. The Respect programme will ensure effective dialogue between local people and services by introducing regular and systematic face the people&quot; briefing sessions, involving senior representation from the police and local authorities. These sessions will provide a further opportunity for communities to make clear their priorities and to hold those responsible for service delivery to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.2/2">They will also allow senior staff to engage the community in tackling local problems, raising issues where they can take action to help combat antisocial behaviour, including graffiti. In addition to this, the Home Office, in partnership with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, is developing a new three digit single non-emergency number to provide the public direct access to community safety advice, information and action to tackle antisocial behaviour, including graffiti. The Government's commitment towards neighbourhood policing will benefit every area by 2008, enabling graffiti to be tackled as a priority when local communities identify this as one of their key concerns.</p>

The order is in two parts, the first spent in custody and the second under supervision in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/2">It is intended that work begun during the first part&mdash;for example on education and training&mdash;should form the basis for continued development when the young person returns to the community. Youth offending teams (YOTs) are involved in sentence planning throughout the whole of the order and supervise the young person during the community part. The Youth Justice Board is committed to giving young people in custody the opportunity to turn away from offending and to acquire the learning and skills that will help them towards a more positive future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/3">The board, which has invested on a large scale in educational facilities for young people in custody, is working to the following targets for young people in custody: all young people entering secure facilities will have a training plan developed and subsequently reviewed in accordance with the National Standards for Youth Justice Services; all young people will be assessed by a clinician on reception for vulnerability and substance misuse; all young people entering secure facilities will be tested for literacy and numeracy, with 80 per cent. of young people on DTOs of six months or more improving by one skill level or more in literacy and/or numeracy, to the level of need set out in their individual learning plan; in 2005&ndash;06, 90 per cent. of young people will receive 30 hours a week of education, training, and personal development activity compliant with the National Specification for Learning and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/4">For young people in young offender institutions (YOIs), the expected performance will be 25 hours. Additionally, YOIs will ensure that attendance rates for timetabled education and training sessions do not fall below 90 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1679W.5/2">The UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia in 2002 that commits both countries to work together to tackle illegal logging and the associated trade.

	<p pid="b.1679W.5/3">The EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation was adopted by EU Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers in December 2005. This will allow the EU to enter into agreements with timber-producing countries and provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. This assistance will include a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU. The licensing scheme will be reinforced by powers for Customs to prevent the import of unlicensed timber.</p>
	<p pid="b.1679W.5/4">A FLEGT Partnership Agreement between Indonesia and the EU would help fulfil the commitments under the Indonesia-UK MoU on Illegal Logging. The UK is working with Indonesia, other EU Member States and the European Commission towards this.</p>

	<p pid="b.1680W.6/1">In order for a pesticide to gain approval in the United Kingdom an extensive range of toxicological tests must be performed. These tests incorporate an extensive group of rigorous study protocols to address the health issues that have been shown to be relevant to pesticide exposure such as issues of acute and chronic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive effects, developmental (foetal) toxicity and others. Reference doses for acceptable human exposures to pesticides are derived by applying assessment (safety) factors to the dose that produces no adverse effects in the most sensitive, relevant animal study. The factor is normally 100, made up of 10 fold for the assumption that humans are more sensitive than the most sensitive animal species tested, and 10 fold for sub-populations of humans (including the foetus) that may be more sensitive than the norm. There will always be a minimum 'safety' margin of 100 between a dose causing no effects on the foetus in animal studies and the acceptable human exposure to a pesticide. This approach is in line with risk assessment practices for chemicals both nationally and internationally.</p>

The EA uses the database, together with locally held information, to prioritise a risk based rolling programme of flood defence inspection, maintenance and renewals.

	<p pid="b.1683W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.8/2"><i>(a)</i> There are two targets in the household sector. The Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2004 included an aim to save 3.5 million tonnes of carbon from homes in England by 2010, set in accordance with the requirements of the Sustainable Energy Act 2003. The Housing Act 2004 added a further goal&mdash;to take reasonable steps to improve residential energy efficiency by at least 20 per cent. by 2010, from a year 2000 baseline. In the public sector, the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government estate 2004 states that Government Departments are to increase the energy efficiency of the buildings on their estate by 15 per cent. by 2010&ndash;11, relative to 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.8/3"><i>(b)</i> Since 1996, all water companies in England and Wales have had a duty to promote the efficient use of water by all their customers. The Office of Water Services (Ofwat) enforce this duty and report on water company progress in the annual 'Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water' report. In the public sector, the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government estate 2004 states that Government Departments should reduce water consumption in office buildings to an average of 7.7 m <sup>3</sup> per person per year by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> or 7m <sup>3</sup> per person per year for all new buildings and major refurbishments where design commences after 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.8/4"><i>(c)</i> There are a number of other environmental targets for the public sector set out in the Framework on the Government estate 2004. The Framework sets operational targets to be met by central Government Departments and their Executive agencies to encourage more sustainable management of the Government's land and buildings. The Framework has a largely environmental focus and comprises nine parts (including waste, water, energy and biodiversity). Specific targets for water usage and energy efficiency are mentioned above.</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.8/5">Since July 2003, specific targets have been set for biodiversity, procurement, estates management and construction and social impacts. Reports on progress against the Framework targets are published each year in the annual Sustainable Development in Government (SDiG) reports. The Framework is currently being reviewed in order to deliver a step change in the way the Government sustainably manages its land and buildings (further background on this is shown in the attached annex).</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.8/6">Outside the public sector Government have a range of other environmental targets. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has nine public service agreement (PSA) targets which have been agreed with the Treasury since 2003. The majority of these PSA targets relate to environmental issues and they all contribute to DEFRA's overarching aim of sustainable development. The PSA targets are published and reported on in DEFRA's current Autumn Performance Report which is available at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/deprep/default.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/deprep/default.htm</a>t#apr</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.8/7">Other targets relating to environmental issues are published in DEFRA's Five Year Strategy: Delivering the Essentials of Life, which is available at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/5year-strategy/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/5year-strategy/index.htm</a>, and in the UK Government's Sustainable Development Strategy: Securing the Future, which is available at: <a href="http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy/index.htm">http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy/index.htm</a></p>

In addition, our ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva now acts as our roving ambassador for the treaty initiative. Furthermore, a wide range of FCO and other Government Department staff are actively engaged in pursing the initiative. In 2005 we funded a number of events to promote the treaty. We plan more such events in 2006. Additional funds have been provided for these activities and for travel, by reprioritisation within our existing budgets. As decisions are taken on specific events as our campaign evolves, it is not possible at this stage to provide an overall figure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1687W.8/2">We will not issue an export licence if approval would be inconsistent with national embargoes observed by the UK.

We will not issue licences for the export to Iran of goods or technology on the Military or Nuclear List, except for goods essential for the safety of civil aircraft and air traffic control systems and certain radioactive substances for medical use. No licences will be approved for any equipment where there is knowledge or reason to suspect that it will go to a military end-user or be used for military purposes. On very rare occasions and with parliamentary agreement, exceptions are made where denying an export or gift would be against the spirit of the embargo.</p>
	<p pid="b.1687W.8/3">In 2005, we agreed to license a gift of 50 sets of body armour to the Iranian Counter-Narcotics border police who work with HM Revenue and Customs officers to fight the trafficking of heroin and opiates. Notice of our intention to do this was placed before Parliament for 14 sitting days in February 2005 and no objections were raised. Details of the gift were also recorded in a Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-03-15.13WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 13&ndash;14WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1687W.8/4">We assess that around 60 per cent. of all heroin entering the UK transits Iran. Iran is actively involved in the fight against drug trafficking and seizes far more opiates than any other country in the world. We have regular constructive co-operation with Iran on counter-narcotics.</p>

But the nature of Iran's nuclear programme, its history of concealment and inadequate co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the unexplained involvement of the Iranian military in the nuclear programme, and its failure to take confidence-building steps have all contributed to international concern that the intentions of the programme may not be exclusively peaceful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1693W.5/1">Supporting operations, including those in Iraq, is one of DSTL's principal roles: since its formation in 2001 the laboratory has continuously supported a wide range of operations both overseas and for homeland security. This capability is based on DSTL's ability to draw on the entire organisations S&amp;Tbase to provide the best advice and solutions. Supporting operations is afforded a high priority, and the short-notice and fluctuating nature of the demand means that it has to be managed in consultation with DSTL's MOD customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1693W.8/1">The Defence Vetting Agency operates within guidelines set by the Cabinet Office, and constantly seeks ways to improve the vetting process. The DVA is at the forefront of Government security vetting process and working practice improvements and is taking a strong lead in the development and introduction of e-vetting. The introduction, this year, of a suite of new scannable security application forms is a first step towards a solution to allow vetting subjects to complete and submit security clearance applications using the internet, leading to a much more efficient process.</p>

Because of this, a detailed assessment of affordability by rank and service cannot be made. However, we provide an excellent pay and pension package for service personnel, together with extensive advice on housing options and an interest-free loan scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1697W.2/1">The International Criminal Court (ICC) only has jurisdiction over the offences specified in Article 5 of its Statute. The ICC does not replace national courts, as is made clear in paragraph 10 of the Preamble to the ICC Statute. This expressly provides that the Court 'shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions'. The Statute makes clear that only if a state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out an investigation or prosecution will a case be admissible, and unless a case is admissible the Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction. The Statute (Article 17.2) requires the Court to determine 'unwillingness' in a particular case by considering,</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/2" class="indent">whether one or more of the following exists:</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/3" class="indent">the proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purposes of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; there has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/4" class="indent">the proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they are or were being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/5">The Statute (Article 17.3) requires the Court to determine 'inability' in a particular case by considering,</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/6" class="indent">whether, due to a total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the state is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry on its proceedings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/7">A decision to take no further action, whether in relation to investigation or proceedings, and whether taken by investigators, prosecutors or a court, does not in itself imply an unwillingness or inability genuinely to investigate or prosecute.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.2/8">The Government do not envisage that circumstances will ever arise in which the ICC would conclude that the UK is unable or unwilling genuinely to investigate or prosecute, and accordingly does not envisage that the ICC will ever exercise jurisdiction over any member of the British armed forces. The ICC prosecutor has also recently decided that there is no reasonable basis to initiate an investigation into UK military operations in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="b.1701W.8/2">The Royal Navy has two kinds of nuclear submarine berths: X-berths at Devonport, Faslane and Barrow in Furness, which are the only places where maintenance on nuclear propulsion systems may be carried out; and Z-berths which are used for operational recuperation, material re-supply and personnel changeovers. Z-berths support the Royal Navy's ability to operate flexibly throughout UK waters, which is key to its contribution to the security of the UK homeland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1701W.8/3">Until 2001, the Royal Navy could use Z-berths in Broadford Bay, Cardiff, RNAD Coulport, Hull, Liverpool, Loch Ewe, Loch Goil, Portland, Portsmouth and Southampton. With the introduction of the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations in 2001, responsibility for production of emergency planning arrangements transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the relevant local authority. The Royal Navy has therefore temporarily ceased use of Z-Berths in commercial ports to allow local authorities time to develop and test their own plans. The Ministry of Defence supports and pays for this work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1701W.8/4">The following Z-berths are now covered by the necessary plans and are available for use by the Royal Navy: Broadford Bay, RNAD Coulport, Loch Ewe, Loch Goil and Portsmouth. The MOD is currently working with Southampton city council to finalise the emergency planning arrangements necessary to re-establish full Z-berth status in Southampton, and is discussing the planning requirements for the berth at Portland with Dorset county council and Weymouth and Portland borough council. Preliminary discussions have also been held with Sefton metropolitan borough council in Liverpool.</p>

	<p pid="b.1703W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. My main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years. In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published 'Priorities for Success' ; a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1703W.2/2">Although more funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14&ndash;19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult workforce. This will mean that less provision outside these priority areas can be supported at previous levels, and that there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between government, employers and learners to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="b.1704W.3/1">All four-year-olds have been entitled to a free early education place since 1998 and from April 2004 this entitlement was extended to all three-year-olds. The free entitlement consists of a minimum of five two and a half hour sessions per week for 33 weeks of the year for six terms before statutory school age, which is the term following their fifth birthday. This will increase to 38 weeks from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> and to 15 hours a week by 2010. By that time, parents who wish to do so will also be able to access the free entitlement flexibly across a minimum of three days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.3/2">Some local authorities may additionally offer subsidised child care places but this information is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.3/3">Figures for January 2005 show that all four-year-old children receive some form of free entitlement. The figure for three-years-olds is 96 per cent. This covers all maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers and represents 535,100 three-year-olds and 568,300 four-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.3/4">The available information on the number of free nursery education places taken up by three and four-year-olds in Hendon parliamentary constituency area and Barnet local authority is shown in the tables.</p>

	<p pid="b.1705W.2/1">Employer Training pilots were introduced in September 2002 to encourage employers to train their low skilled employees. They tested a package of measures, including wage compensation for employers, to improve access to training and enable employees to attain basic skills (literacy, numeracy, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and/or their first, full Level 2 qualification). The number of pilot areas has been progressively increased and currently stands at 20 of the 47 LSC areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/2">Evaluation findings have been largely positive. The evaluations undertaken by the Institute for Employment Studies concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/3" class="indent">The pilots have been very successful in engaging employers and employees in training up to a first full Level 2. There are now over 236,027 learners and 28,281 employers signed up to ETPs and 123,687 have successfully completed their training. Employer and employee satisfaction levels are over 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/4" class="indent">Employers are attracted mainly by the free or heavily subsidised flexibly delivered training, and the services of the independent broker to help them identify the most suitable training and source it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/5" class="indent">Employers felt that important benefits to taking part in ETP included boosting employees self confidence, employees gaining job related skills/qualifications and improved the quality of the organisations services or products.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/6" class="indent">Learners are attracted by the opportunity to obtain skills to do their job better and to gain a qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/7">A separate evaluation by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which focused only on the first year of the pilots, identified that additionality was not as high as we would have hoped at that stage. The IFS report has pointed to the need to ensure better targeting of 'hard to reach' employers and be more rigorous in applying learner eligibility rules. We are confident that the position has improved since the first year of the pilots. We have also learnt important lessons from the pilots about the key factors motivating employers and learners to engage in training, and the best ways to adapt training provision to the needs and pressures of the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/8">The pilots have been effective in encouraging more colleges and other training providers to deliver training more flexibly, for example on employer's premises or at a time and in a manner suited to their shift patterns. Providers have also been encouraged to tailor training to focus on the skills gaps identified through initial training needs assessments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/9">The Employer Training Pilots have therefore been wholly successful in enabling us to evaluate what is effective in engaging employers in training their low skilled employees and have been invaluable in informing the development of policy for Train to Gain, the new national employer training programme that will roll out from April 2006. Train to Gain will reach full national coverage in August 2006 and is central to the delivery of the demand led approach to training that is at the heart of the Government's Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1705W.2/10">When fully operational Train to Gain will provide training to 350,000 learners from 50,000 employers per year. This should result in 175,000 first, full Level 2 qualifications each year. By 2009&ndash;10 it is expected that Train to Gain will have contributed over 500,000 first, full Level 2 achievements towards the Government's Level 2 targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1708W.3/5" class="indent">The UK National Reference Point for vocational qualifications was established in response to EU Council Recommendation 2001/613/EC. It provides information and advice to individuals, institutions and employers on matters relating to European vocational education and training systems, qualifications and certificates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1708W.3/6" class="italic">(iii) Europass</p>
	<p pid="b.1708W.3/7" class="indent">Council Decision 2241/2004/EC established a single Community framework for achieving the transparency of qualifications and competences by the creation of a personal, coordinated portfolio of documents to be known as Europass. Europass consists of the common European CV, the Diploma Supplement, Europass Mobility, the Certificate Supplement, and the European Language Portfolio. Each member state has designated a National Europass Centre (NEC) responsible for the setting up of an Internet site and information system; and providing an electronic link to the European Commission's website which contains the portfolio.</p>

	<p pid="b.1708W.3/11" class="indent">UK participates fully in the Bologna Process, which includes more countries than the 25 EU member states. One of the key objectives of the Bologna Process is to make degrees more easily comparable. Ministerial communique&quot;s have recognised the importance of learning outcomes in achieving comparability. The Bologna Process also recognises the important role that the NARIC networks have to play in recognition of degrees.</p>
	<p pid="b.1708W.3/12" class="italic">(vi) Commission consultation on a European Qualifications Network</p>
	<p pid="b.1708W.3/13" class="indent">The European Commission launched its Europe-wide consultation on a European Qualification Framework in July 2005. The European Qualifications Framework (EOF) is designed to act as a translation device to enable different qualification frameworks to be related to each other across national boundaries. The Department for Education and Skills launched a UK-wide consultation on this proposal on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-02">2 September 2005</phrase>. 153 organisations were alerted to the consultation, and responses were received from professional bodies and business organisations, trades unions, awarding/examination bodies, sector skills organisations, higher education institutions and a local authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1710W.5/1">The primary purpose of the Sure Start Plus pilots is to improve health and education outcomes for young mothers and their children. However, Sure Start Plus also has a role in reducing the incidence of repeat unplanned pregnancies and increasing the proportion of young mothers in education, employment and training, because these reduce their likelihood of long-term social exclusion, and act as protective factors against their children becoming teenage parents themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710W.5/2">There is a strong link between social deprivation and higher rates of teenage pregnancy. The following table compares the average under-18 conception rate in the 20 per cent. most deprived local authorities (LAs) and the 20 per cent. least deprived, for each year from 1997 to 2003 (the latest year for which data are available). The table shows that, on average, rates in the most deprived 20 per cent. local authorities are a third higher than the national average. Ward level conception statistics show even greater differences between the most deprived and least deprived areas.</p>

However, we need to accelerate progress to achieve the challenging PSA target to halve the under-18 conception rate by 2010. We will shortly be publishing a strategy document setting out our plans for improving performance during the next phase of the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1712W.6/5" class="indent">The first payment made following an award of attendance allowance will usually be a payment of arrears and this takes up to 7 days to reach the customer's account, if benefit is paid into a bank/ building society or Post Office account.

In the case of the Modification of Subsisting Rights Regulations, we have been working very closely with pension industry lawyers to ensure that the regulations provide the necessary flexibility that the industry itself has asked for. This means that we have had to strike a balance between ensuring that the regulations are effective and making sure that they are laid as early as possible.</p>

In addition in 2003 guarantees were issued for contracts relating to frigate refurbishment and boarder surveillance vehicles in Romania. One other cause was supported during this period but ECGD cannot provide information regarding it as disclosure would, or would be likely to prejudice the commercial position of BAE Systems or ECGD.</p>

It will also recognise in statute that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin: directors will be required to promote the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, having regard to wider factors such as the interests of employees, the community and the environment. This will help directors to understand that they need to look beyond the short-term financial bottom line, but company law is not the right vehicle for addressing employment, community or environmental issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1730W.8/1">Despite the energy price increases that have taken place since 2004, UK gas and electricity prices remain below the median price of the EU15 member states. Expenditure stood at an average level of around 3 per cent. of household income in 2004&ndash;05, the most recent date available. However, it is important that all consumers ensure that, while properly heating their homes, they minimise their energy expenditure. They can do this by choosing the most appropriate supplier and tariff, paying by the cheapest appropriate payment method (usually direct debit), and taking energy efficiency measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1730W.8/2">Rising energy prices have a disproportionately large effect on low-income customers. Analysis of overall effects of changes in fuel prices and incomes, excluding consideration of energy efficiency improvements, suggest that the total number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty is likely to rise by around 1 million households in England between 2003 and 2006. Our fuel poverty programmes help the most vulnerable in society to lower their energy bills by providing heating and insulation measures and Benefit Entitlement Checks. Government has made available an additional &pound;300 million over 2005&ndash;08 to supplement these programmes in the light of rising energy prices. The industry's Home Heat Helpline also provides advice and assistance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1742W.5/1">Under the Recreation and Youth Services Order (Northern Ireland) 1986 the Sports Council for Northern Ireland (SCNI) is statutorily responsible for the development of sport in Northern Ireland, including the distribution of public funding to sport. It receives both exchequer and lottery funding for this purpose. Among its programmes, it already has in place an Athlete Support programme which is designed to assist identified sportspeople to achieve greater success in targeted international competition, including the Olympic games. During 2005&ndash;06 the SCNI has so far committed &pound;248,150 to athletes on the elite level of the Athlete Support programme. At present two individuals involved in sailing and two elite hockey squads are in receipt of funding from the SCNI in relation to preparations with the ultimate aim of competition in the next Olympic games. The total budget for the Athlete Support programme for the years 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 is &pound;600,000 per annum.</p>

We are preparing a pension scheme for new entrants to the Fire and Rescue Service from April 2006. In the new scheme, which has been the subject of consultation, the minimum pension age will be age 55 and the normal pension age 60.</p>
	<p pid="b.1749W.3/2">Changes are being made to the existing scheme from April 2006 to ensure compliance with the new tax regime for pensions and to facilitate the new arrangements for financing firefighters' pensions which were announced through a written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</phrase>. We are also amending the basis on which ill-health pensions will be awarded: a firefighter who is permanently disabled from undertaking any of the duties of his role but is capable of other regular employment will be entitled to receive an unenhanced pension. The pension will be enhanced on the same basis as at present if the firefighter is unfit to undertake regular employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1749W.3/3">As part of the changes needed to ensure the pension scheme is compliant with the new tax regime, we are establishing a separate compensation scheme for firefighters which will provide injury awards for firefighters on the same basis as is currently available in the Firefighters' Pension Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1750W.5/2">The Government are keen to improve the accountability between the police, local authorities and other service providers and the public. The Community Call for Action provisions contained in the Police and Justice Bill will give more power to local communities and provide a mechanism for local communities to demand a response from agencies to persistent local community safety or antisocial behaviour problems, via an approach to their ward councillor. The Respect programme will ensure effective dialogue between local people and services by introducing regular and systematic face the people&quot; briefing sessions, involving senior representation from the police and local authorities. These sessions will provide a further opportunity for communities to make clear their priorities and to hold those responsible for service delivery to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.1750W.5/3">They will also allow senior staff to engage the community in tackling local problems, raising issues where they can take action to help combat antisocial behaviour, including graffiti. In addition to this, the Home Office, in partnership with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, is developing a new three digit single non-emergency number to provide the public direct access to community safety advice, information and action to tackle antisocial behaviour, including graffiti. The Government's commitment towards neighbourhood policing will benefit every area by 2008, enabling graffiti to be tackled as a priority when local communities identify this as one of their key concerns.</p>

The monitoring officer also gives advice to councillors about personal or prejudicial interests, conducts investigations into misconduct allegations and presents his or her findings to the local standards committee for its determination. Decisions on the designation, employment and management of monitoring officers are matters for local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1759W.9/1">The number of emergency calls to, and incidents attended by, national health service ambulance trusts has increased by around 6 to 7 per cent. a year since 2000&ndash;01. During this time the number of calls per incident has increased, one reason being that greater use of mobile phones mean that more calls are received per incident. The other reasons for increases in demand vary across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1759W.9/2">Further data on ambulance service activity can be found in the annual statistical bulletin, 'Ambulance Services, England'. Copies of this are available in the Library and on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1759W.9/3">Despite increases in the number of 999 calls and incidents attended, performance in the ambulance service is continuing to improve. In 2004&ndash;05, 76.2 per cent. of category A calls resulted in an emergency response arriving at the scene of the incident within eight minutes, compared to 75.7 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="b.1759W.9/4">The 2005 review of ambulance services, 'Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services', acknowledges that demand is rising, and the need to address both the way ambulance services are commissioned and organised, and the effectiveness and efficiency with which ambulance trusts use their resources. Therefore, the report makes a series of recommendations for action by the NHS and the Department. A copy of the full report is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/11/42/70/04114270.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/11/42/70/04114270.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid="b.1761W.8/1">Dentists' current national health service earnings will be protected for at least three years, with an annual uplift for pay and prices, and there will be a 5 per cent. reduction in the courses of treatment that general dental services practitioners are expected to carry out each year. Evidence from personal dental services pilots shows that removing the current fee per item remuneration system leads to simpler courses of treatment, with fewer individual interventions and more time available for preventative care. In the Department's view, this is likely to reduce practice expenses as a proportion of gross NHS income, and therefore increase net income, but the precise impact cannot be quantified.</p>
	<p pid="b.1761W.8/2">Patients will benefit from the new contracts in a number of ways. Dentists will have more time available to offer preventative care and advice. The new contracts also reflect clinical guidelines in patient recall intervals, as produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. This will increasingly mean that patients attend at intervals that better reflect their individual oral health needs. In the Department's view, this is likely to enable a greater range of patients to be seen, as patients with good oral health are likely to attend less frequently.</p>

	<p pid="b.1763W.0/2">The decision to establish a monitoring mechanism based on measuring weighted courses of treatment took into account evidence from personal dental services (PDS) pilots. This evidence showed that one of the main benefits of abolishing the fee-per-item remuneration system was that dentists were able to carry out simpler courses of treatment with more time for preventative work. The pilots also indicated that there were difficulties monitoring services solely on the basis of patient capitation or similar measures. The system of units of dental activity which are the same as weighted courses of treatment, is designed to promote the same benefits seen in PDS pilots whilst ensuring there is clarity about the level of service expected in a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1764W.3/1">It is not possible to aggregate and compare the cost to the national health service of providing routine and emergency supply of domiciliary oxygen by pharmacists and central suppliers because of differences in service provision and the basis for calculating costs. In the past, there was no explicit arrangement for pharmacists to provide oxygen to patients at home on an emergency basis. Pharmacists received payment for provision of an oxygen cylinder service, which included the cost of equipment listed in Part 10 of the drug tariff, together with locally negotiated fees for service delivery. The contract for the new service includes the provision of oxygen to patients on an emergency basis, with a delivery requirement of four hours. The cost of all oxygen services provided by new suppliers is on a per day basis. It takes into account the required flow rate for a patient and the hours per day a patient uses oxygen. The per diem rates include supply of oxygen, all associated equipment, delivery, collection and maintenance of equipment and the provision of training to patients and their families on its safe use.</p>

	<p pid="b.1765W.2/1">The Government will continue to support self-care and self-management. One of the ways it will do this is by expanding the expert patients programme (EPP). Using the investment pledged in the manifesto to increase the number of EPP course places from 12,000 a year to over 100,000 by 2012. It is likely that this will be taken forward through the establishment of a community interest company to deliver and market the EPP. Work is already under way with the British Medical Association and other organisations to encourage direct referrals to the EPP.</p>

	<p pid="b.1766W.3/1">The safety of all medicines and vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine, is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the commission on human medicines (CHM). The MHRA uses a variety of data sources for this purpose but an important source of information is spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions that are reported by health professionals, pharmaceutical companies and most recently by patients through the yellow card scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.3/2">Since 1988, the MHRA has received a total of 13 reports of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), 11 reports of rheumatoid arthritis and 16 reports of multiple sclerosis in people who have received hepatitis B vaccination. This is in the context of 16.2 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine sold in the United Kingdom. We are unable to state how many of these suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) occurred in national health service workers as this information is not captured on a yellow card.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.3/3">Since the yellow card scheme is entirely voluntary for health professionals, these data cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the frequency of suspected ADRs to vaccines or medicines as not all cases may be reported. In addition, an association of a patient's illness with a particular medicine or vaccine may not always be made, particularly for conditions that take some time to manifest. It is important to note that the reporting of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug or vaccine. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication, a previously undiagnosed underlying illness or a coincidental newly occurring illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.3/4">As with all licensed medicines the MHRA will continue to carefully examine any important new evidence as it emerges, seeking the advice of independent experts as necessary, and will communicate new safety information to health professionals and the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.1778W.0/2" class="italic">Out-patient waits should generally be less than:</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/3" class="indent">13 weeks by March 2006;</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/4" class="indent">11 weeks by March 2007; and</p>

	<p pid="b.1778W.0/6" class="italic">Diagnostic waits should generally be less than:</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/7" class="indent">26 weeks by March 2006, for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised topography (CT) scans;</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/8" class="indent">13 weeks for all diagnostic tests by March 2007; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/9" class="indent">six weeks for all diagnostics tests by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/10" class="italic">In-patient waits should generally be less than:</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/11" class="indent">26 weeks by March 2006;</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/12" class="indent">20 weeks by March 2007; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/13" class="indent">11 weeks by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.0/14">By December 2008, the patient pathway should be 18 weeks inclusive of out-patients, diagnostics, and in-patients waits. National health service organisations are developing local plans to achieve this pathway. The milestones themselves are not targets and as such there is discretion locally as to how best to progress towards 18 weeks overall.</p>

	<p pid="b.1778W.3/1">The responsibility for carrying out pre-employment checks, including Criminal Records Bureau, Protection of Children's Act and Protection of Vulnerable Adults checks where applicable, rests with the relevant employer whether an national health service organisation or social services department or other regulated provider of health or social care. The NHS is required to follow the guidance, Safer Recruitment&quot; issued in May 2005, which covers all the pre-and post-appointment checks that NHS employers are required to make before appointing anyone, including employees, volunteers, students, trainees, to a position in the NHS. In regulated social care, we expect providers to comply with regulations on pre-employment checks made under the Care Standards Act 2000, which came into force in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.3/2">Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 replaced Part1 of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 and Schedule 3 to the 2003 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. The act requires convicted sex offenders to report each year to their local police and inform the police if they change their name or address within three days instead of the previous 14days.</p>
