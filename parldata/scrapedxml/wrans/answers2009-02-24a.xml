Our first priority is to ensure the Gaza population receives humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials, and so we have made available &pound;26.8 million for the relief operation and are pressing Israel to open the crossings more fully. The Egyptian efforts to embed the ceasefire and to bridge the divide in Palestinian politics are at the heart of improving the political situation. We strongly support their efforts.

	<p pid="a.512W.12/1">The political situation is undoubtedly complex. Our first priority is to ensure the Gaza population receives humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials, and so we have made available &pound;26.8 million for the relief operation and are pressing Israel to open the crossings more fully. The Egyptian efforts to embed the ceasefire and to bridge the divide in Palestinian politics are at the heart of improving the political situation. We strongly support their efforts. I am travelling to Cairo today to discuss Gaza&mdash;and other issues&mdash;with Egypt.</p>
