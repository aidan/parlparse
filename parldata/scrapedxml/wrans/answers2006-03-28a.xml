	<p pid="a.839W.3/1">Desalination not been previously used as an option for water supply in the UK. Costs and emissions will be determined by the particulars of the operation concerned, for example, each will depend on whether brackish or sea water is involved; the source of energy used; and whether or not the plant is used continuously or to meet peak demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.839W.3/2">Projections from South East Water, who are constructing a small desalination plant on the South coast, point to an energy consumption around 4.5&ndash;4.7 kWh per cubic metre of water produced, using energy from a combined heat and power plant. The company has also estimated, in its business plan for the Periodic Review of water prices in 2004, that the cost will be around 47 pence per cubic metre.</p>

	<p pid="a.839W.6/2">Defra has policy responsibility for flood risk management in England, funds most of the Environment Agency's flood related work and grant aids individual projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards. The programme to manage risk is driven by the operating authorities; Defra does not build defences, nor direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.839W.6/3">Funding is allocated to different priorities within the full range of Departmental responsibilities from the overall allocation for the Department set in the Government's regular Spending Reviews. The 2004 Review set spending limits for 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. The Government's Comprehensive Spending Review in 2007 will set allocations for 2008&ndash;09 to 2010&ndash;11. The level of spending on flood risk management is being considered as part of this, as is the level of the Department's spend across all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.839W.6/4">We are committed to the effective management of flood and coastal erosion risk and have increased funding significantly in recent years. In cash terms funding from central and local government has doubled from &pound;307 million in 1996&ndash;97 to an estimated outturn of &pound;600 million in 2005&ndash;06, a real terms increase of 40 per cent. after inflation.</p>

	<p pid="a.840W.5/1">The Environment Agency's improvement programme for the Suffolk coast is shown as follows. The Agency considers some projects will be exempt from DEFRA's priority scoring requirement because of the Government's legal obligation to protect environmental sites of international importance. The need for such works has to be agreed with English Nature (Natural England) for individual cases. Felixstowe Ferry Sea Defences and Bawdsey Sea Defences are being promoted with levy funding from local authorities rather than DEFRA grant in aid and are not therefore subject to DEFRA's priority scoring requirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.842W.2/1">The UK expects to exceed by about 7 percentage points its Kyoto Protocol commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&ndash;12. Latest available figures indicate that in 2004 UK greenhouse gas emissions were 14.6 per cent. lower than base year levels. The additional policies and measures to be introduced from the current review of the UK's Climate Change Programme will achieve further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.844W.0/1">It is for the individual water companies concerned to consider the need for increasing provision of water in fulfilment of their statutory duties to maintain adequate supplies of water. They have 25 year water resource plans which seek to reconcile supply with anticipated demand. This forward planning framework exists to take account of factors such as the water supply and disposal infrastructure required to service significant new housing developments such as that proposed under the Sustainable Communities Plan. Water resources plans will become a statutory requirement under the provisions of the Water Act 2003.</p>

As part of the project a nine-region model was developed to examine the relationship between housing supply and various environmental impacts, including land take, waste production, water use and energy use. The research indicated that the reaching the Government's ambition of 200,000 additional new houses would result in an additional demand of 12 million litres per day in 2016 above the 12,728 million litres/day in the baseline.</p>

The Hall has been closed since the beginning of the year to allow the reconstruction of the steps at the south end of the Hall to take place. General enabling works took place beneath the steps (to remove asbestos and secure building services) out of sight of visitors. Work has now commenced inside the Hall including removal of the steps, flooring slabs and archaeological exploratory operations.

Any acquisitions involving changes in ownership of airports would be subject to the applicable merger control law.

In that consultation, we state that we will publish research into the harms caused by organised immigration crime, including trafficking.

The UK played a lead role formulating a politically binding UN instrument on the marking and tracing of SALW that was finally adopted in June 2005. We continue to work towards making this instrument legally binding. The UK is fully compliant with strict EU marking and tracing standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.862W.0/2">The Renewables Innovation Review (Feb 2004) recommended that the best way to support the installation of micro generation technologies would be through a technology blind low carbon buildings programme.

However, in 2004, the DTI in conjunction with Ofgem and National Grid established the Electricity Systems Technical Issues Steering Group to investigate the performance of the electricity networks given likely longer term changes in the UK generation portfolio and to ensure that any technical issues that might arise were recognised in good time. The group published an interim report, which can be found at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/renewables/publications_pdfs/estiginterimreportfinal.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/renewables/publications_pdfs/estiginterimreportfinal.pdf</a> and is currently working with National Grid to undertake more detailed studies that should be completed late summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.867W.9/1">The International Narcotics Control Board consider that the global supply of medicinal opiates, including diamorphine (heroin) is at levels well in excess of use. There are however constraints to demand which are related to countries' own policy restrictions in the use of such drugs. At present diamorphine is subject to tight restrictions on supply and use due to widespread abuse and the capacity to induce dependency. It is not on the WHO Essential Drug list although alternative drugs such as morphine, which are as effective, are included in the list and meet the need for a drug for alleviation of severe pain, particularly in palliative care. This does not preclude counties from procuring and using the drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.867W.9/2">Countries look to the World Health Organization for guidance on the use of such drugs. A number of WHO expert groups will meet in coming months to address issues around improving palliative care, dealing with drug dependency and to revise the essential drug list. The outcome of their deliberations may influence the availability and use of diamorphine for medicinal purposes in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.867W.9/3">DFID normally supports health programmes in developing countries through contributions to the health budget and decisions on which medicines to procure are the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.</p>

They must now begin to make progress through the initiative by the end of 2006 in order to continue to be eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/2">There are two requirements to be eligible for HIPC status:</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/3" class="indent">1. Countries must be eligible to receive assistance only from the most concessional lending arm of the World Bank and the International Development Association (IDA). IDA countries are defined as having a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $965 or less.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/4" class="indent">2. A country's debt burden must be considered unsustainable in comparison to its revenue and exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/5">Lesotho is an IDA only borrower, but does not meet the criteria defining unsustainable debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/6">Lesotho could however qualify for the UK's multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI) providing debt relief to both HIPC and low-income countries (LIC). Under this initiative, the UK pays its share (10 per cent.) of the debt service costs to the World Bank (IDA loans) and African Development Fund debt, of non-HIPC, low-income countries like Lesotho. To qualify for relief under this initiative, countries are required to demonstrate robust public financial management systems to ensure the savings are used for poverty reduction. We are using poverty reduction support credits (PRSC) as a proxy measure of this.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/7">Lesotho is discussing the possibility of a PRSC with the World Bank. DFID is also providing support to Lesotho to improve its financial management systems in order to help it qualify for MDRI.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/8">Lesotho will benefit indirectly from the G8 multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI). The G8 MDRI will result in HIPCs receiving full debt cancellation of remaining debts to the World Bank (IDA loans), the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Donor support for this will be allocated by these institutions to all poor countries (including non-HIPCs), and therefore Lesotho.</p>

	<p pid="a.869W.5/1">We have monitored the distribution of DFID aid to those affected by the December 2004 tsunami. We did learn of some problems in India, where there was some reluctance by the authorities to allow aid to reach certain castes. This was overcome through representations made to the authorities. More recently, however, we have seen the January 2006 report of a five-country study by a group of international charities reporting internal discrimination. Although we manage and monitor DFID humanitarian aid very closely and have found no evidence of discrimination in the distribution of DFID aid in tsunami-affected countries, we take such reporting seriously and are prepared both to discuss this with the international charities and to intervene again, if necessary, with the national authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.869W.5/2">DFID has provided &pound;1.5 million to the North East Provincial Council Secretariat (NEPC) in partnership with the Governments of Germany and Sri Lanka to improve its capacity to deliver aid and to help ensure that Tamil areas received improved access to development assistance. DFID also channelled &pound;3 million through the United Nations Development Programme for the 'UN Recovery Framework for Post-Tsunami Rehabilitation and Reconstruction' which is helping to ensure that the needs of socially-excluded groups are met during recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.869W.5/3">A group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), jointly funded by DFID and International NGOs, initiated a Social Equity Audit process in response to claims that some Dalits in India and other groups were being excluded from some post tsunami humanitarian efforts. A group of independent auditors have been trained by experts identified by the International NGOs. The International NGOs will submit their programmes to these auditors to assess how inclusive their post tsunami activities have been in order to improve their programmes and identify ways to make their humanitarian efforts more inclusive in the future. The United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children's Fund have signed up to the initiative and a Social Equity auditing manual is likely to be produced which DFID will disseminate to NGOs and agencies.</p>

The aim of the Defence Review is to make the Uganda People's Defence Force more professional and accountable within the resources available for defence expenditure.

To assist them, in 2001 the Department published guidance entitled 'Commercial activities in schools: Best Practice Principles'. This was aimed at parents, teachers, school governing bodies, LEAs and businesses. Its principal aim was not only to safeguard children from commercial marketing, but to identify best practice and to ensure that commercial objectives were consistent with genuine educational benefits.

	<p pid="a.880W.5/17">The Department ceased sending publications automatically to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004.

	<p pid="a.880W.5/18">The online ordering system enables schools to choose whether to download electronic copies or order the paper based publications they need at the right time for them and in the multiples they require.

	<p pid="a.881W.0/1">Information is not collected centrally on: how many children's centres have in place an accessibility plan; how many children as defined by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, aged under five years attending children's centres have a statement of special educational needs and are on early years action plans; or how many people employed in children's centres meet the Special Educational Needs Standard set by the Training and Development Agency for Schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/2">Guidance for early years providers setting out their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is already available and DfES is working with the Council for Disabled Children to produce additional resources for children's centres that will include information about the 2005 duty to promote disability equality. The resources will be available later this year. The DfES Code of Practice on the &quot;Provision of Nursery Education Places for Three- and Four-Year Olds&quot;, published in February, drew attention to the Disability Rights Commission's Codes of Practice, one of which gives guidance on the new duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/3">Children's centres do not have a duty to have an access plan, but Sure Start has published good practice and training materials on the internet for the early years sector on providing inclusive and accessible services.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/4">We expect children's centres to offer inclusive services for all young children and their families. Disabled children, alongside all other children under 5 will be able to access the range of services provided through their local centre according to their needs. We issued guidance in November 2005 (Sure Start Children's Centres: Practice Guidance) which describes effective ways of working with disabled children and their families and emphasises the importance of outreach services including Portage.</p>

	<p pid="a.886W.2/1">To encourage employers to participate in training, we have established an employer-led training infrastructure that puts their needs centre stage. This is reflected in the design and delivery arrangements of, for example, the new national employer training programme Train To Gain. In Further Education we will be looking at the recommendations of the Foster Report on FE Colleges' responsiveness to local and regional employer needs and will be announcing our plans for the next stage of reform in the spring. Responsibility for the planning and funding of post-16 learning outside Higher Education, however, is the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council and Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive has written to my hon. Friend with further detailed information and a copy of his letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Question about employers involved in post 16 education in Wakefield and Normanton.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/4" class="indent">Before going into detail may I say a word about the LSC's policy in relation to meeting the learning and skills needs of employers, and how we work on this in partnership with others.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/5" class="indent">At the end of 2005 we published the LSC's Statement of Priorities for 2006/07, a copy of which I enclose. As you will see one of our six priorities is to make learning truly demand-led so that it better meets the needs of employers, young people and adults. This lies at the very heart of your question.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/6" class="indent">As you will see from pages 12 and 13 of the booklet we have a number of initiatives designed to support employers and learners, and I would like to highlight two in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/7" class="indent">First, we are building on the success of the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) and from April 2006 we shall roll-out Train to Gain nationally to deliver a range of high quality training for employers with an emphasis on level 2 qualifications and skills for life. A key element of Train to Gain will be a network of skills brokers giving advice to companies on their training needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/8" class="indent">As you will know West Yorkshire is a pilot area for ETP and of the total number of employers engaged in ETP in West Yorkshire, 12.2% (180) are in Wakefield. This is slightly lower than its proportionate share of employers in West Yorkshire, but provides a good platform for a successful launch of Train to Gain. Unfortunately we do not have figures for Normanton.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/9" class="indent">The second initiative is agenda for change which will radically transform the post 16 learning and skills sector, especially in colleges which are key partners in meeting employer needs. Agenda for change is based on extensive consultation with college principals and involves a genuine partnership between the LSC and the further education sector. Again, full details are given in the booklet.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/10" class="indent">Turning to the information you have requested, I'm afraid we do not hold it in a way that enables me to answer your question precisely, but I hope the information on the chart I have enclosed is helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/11" class="indent">Finally, I know that Margaret Coleman, the LSC Regional Director for Yorkshire and the Humber would be very happy to discuss this in more detail, either in your constituency or at the House, for a meeting to be arranged please contact her office directly either via e-mail margaret.coleman@lsc.gov.uk or via telephone 01274 44 4100.</p>

	<p pid="a.887W.2/2">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) agrees plans with most further education (FE) colleges which they guarantee to fund. The guarantee that college plans will be fully funded has been widely welcomed by the sector as ensuring stability and providing confidence for colleges to make commitments for the year based on assured levels of funding. The guarantee means that colleges recruiting above agreed plans cannot expect to receive additional funding above the level agreed with the LSC. However, there is an expectation that where colleges have delivered higher volumes in priority areas then this should be reflected in their planning for the following year.</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.2/3">It is only possible to determine the amount of learning delivered above agreed planned levels following detailed analysis of the actual level of delivery in the academic year compared to the agreed planned levels. It is not possible to complete this analysis for 2005/06 until we have full academic year data on delivery, which will not be available until later this year. For 2004/05 the LSC estimate that colleges delivered 9,624 16 to19 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) learner numbers above the planned levels agreed with the LSC. Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.888W.8/1">The Schools Adjudicators already have the power to request the core information they need to consider objections to admission arrangements. In future, we will require admission authorities to provide information needed by the Adjudicators to fulfil their functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.8/2">Admission Forums play a key role in considering admission issues from a local perspective, monitoring how well they are working and advising admission authorities on where they need to be improved. The Bill will strengthen this role by giving Forums the power to object to the Schools Adjudicators about the admission arrangements of any maintained school in their area. It will also give them the power to publish an annual report for the Schools Commissioner about how well admission arrangements are working in their area.</p>

	<p pid="a.890W.3/2">It will not be open to any organisation to set up a school trust. It will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to form partnerships with trusts, following consultation with parents and other stakeholders. All such trusts will be charities and the consultation will need to set out who the members of the charity will be. In deciding whether to acquire a particular trust, governing bodies will need to take account of the impact of the trust on driving up standards and promoting the well-being of pupils and the wider community. The school would be inspected against the contribution it makes to the five outcomes, including &quot;being healthy&quot;. As part of this, inspectors would assess the school's success in promoting healthy eating. Where there are concerns about the nature of a proposed trust, the local authority will be able to refer the case to the schools adjudicator for determination.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.0/1">There are two student loans schemes. Mortgage-style loans were introduced in 1990. Income-contingent loans were introduced for new students from 1998, while continuing students remained eligible for mortgage-style loans.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.0/2">The first cohort of students on three year courses with income-contingent loans entered repayment status in April 2002. However, borrowers only make repayments when they are earning over &pound;15,000 and those earning less are not required to make any repayments. Most income-contingent loan repayments are collected by employers through the tax system and current policy ensures that deductions keep pace with earnings so borrowers do not become overdue on their accounts.</p>

	<p pid="a.902W.11/2">HMS Torbay is due to commence a routine pre-planned Revalidation and Assisted Maintenance Period (RAMP) in early 2007. Although such work is normally undertaken at a submarine's home port, which in Torbay's case is Devonport, the decision to move her RAMP to Faslane was made because of the heavy programme of work at Devonport and a relatively light loading at Faslane during the same time period. This is consistent with the Department's drive to improve submarine availability, reduce costs and improve co-operation between key suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.902W.11/3">Nuclear submarine refit and refuelling work will continue to be carried out at Devonport Dockyard, which has the only facilities in the UK capable of undertaking such work.</p>
