	<p pid="b.1545W.7/1">The two main assisted voluntary return (AVR) schemes operating during 2005-06 were the voluntary assisted return and reintegration programme (VARRP) and the assisted voluntary return for irregular migrants (AVRIM).</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.7/2">VARRP is operated by the International Organization Migration (IOM) on behalf of the Home Office. In the programme year <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase> the scheme cost &pound;8.65 million to run. &pound;3.45 million was funded by the European Refugee Fund (ERF) and &pound;5.19 million was funded by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.7/3">There were 5,002 returns under the programme with an average of 417 returns per month which is an increase of 192 per cent. compared to the previous VARRP year. VARRP returns accounted for approximately 25 per cent. of all failed asylum seeker removals between one August 2005 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase>. Returns are approximately 25 per cent of the cost of an enforced removal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.7/4">During the operating year <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">01 April 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> AVRIM cost &pound;555,453 and was fully funded by the Home Office. This was the first full year of the programme and there were 539 returns with approximately a third of these were to Brazil. Reintegration assistance is available to vulnerable individuals such as victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545W.7/5">AVR provides for a dignified and sustainable return. Voluntary returns are possible to a number of countries to which enforced removals, particularly of families, are challenging and there are savings to the public purse with savings in MASS support, detention costs and in the case of families, savings in NHS and local authority costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1553W.6/1">DFID is keeping in close touch with the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO), which has sent a humanitarian adviser to assess the effect of the cyclone damage in Madagascar. We are expecting that ECHO will provide assistance to those most directly affected by cyclone damage once a full assessment of immediate needs has been made. The UK has not as yet pledged any funds directly to Madagascar to address cyclone damage, but contributes 17 per cent. to the ECHO budget, which will be drawn upon for the EU's response. The appeal made by the Foreign Minster goes beyond these more immediate needs and is linked to a wider range of rehabilitation needs including agriculture and infrastructure repairs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1554W.2/1">DFID uses a range of funding instruments to improve health in developing countries. The preference is to provide budget support or pooled funds to support a country to implement its own health plan. DFID regards this as the best way to strengthen the overall health infrastructure&mdash;the clinics, trained staff, essential medicines, and running costs&mdash;to deliver a broad range of health services. DFID may also provide additional support to target specific diseases or new health challenges. In more difficult settings, such as fragile states, DFID is likely to initially support projects against specific diseases but will aim to move, where possible, to support broader health programmes. The two approaches are not exclusive and complement each other. For example DFID funding to the GAVI Alliance enables countries to provide the newer and underused vaccines; funding through the country budget will help train and employ the health workers who vaccinate children and to buy the basic vaccines such as polio and measles.</p>

A range of options was linked to service pattern changes to meet the franchise objectives, and these were amalgamated to determine the most appropriate specification.</p>

Technical Advisers supporting the SRA investigated an initial package of options that were informed by the general, franchise and service group objectives which were developed and agreed at the beginning of the process. Network Rail supported the process through timetabling analysis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1561W.0/1">The Department for Transport recognises the success of the rail industry in attracting new passengers. There are a number of activities currently under way to quantify future demand in the Yorkshire and Humber region and to deliver a level of service that meets this. The Department is currently producing a regional planning assessment for the region, which will identify the role that the railway needs to play over the next 20 years in supporting the economic growth of the region. At the same time, Network Rail is producing a route utilisation strategy for Yorkshire and Humber, which will focus on improvements that can be made to the existing railway to provide an optimal level of service and capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1561W.0/2">In addition to this, the Department is currently producing its high level output specification, which will set out the Department's objectives for the national rail network during the next industry funding period between 2009 and 2014. One of the key issues to be addressed in this period is the provision of sufficient capacity to meet future growth projections for rail travel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1561W.0/3">In addition to these longer term activities, the department works closely with current train operators and other local stakeholders to identify and secure value for money opportunities to provide additional capacity. The introduction by Transpennine Express of its new class 185 fleet has expanded a number of services to three car operation as well as providing local passengers with an improved environment on their services. The Department has also worked closely with Northern Rail and West Yorkshire passenger transport executive to secure an additional six class 158 trains for services in west Yorkshire to address passenger growth in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1562W.9/1">We are committed to working with the Welsh Assembly Government and other partners on the promotion and development of cross-border transport links. Improving connectivity to major employment centres in North East Wales and Cheshire is one of the rail options being evaluated in high level terms by the Wales Rail Planning Assessment. The consortium of north Wales transport authorities has been consulted during work on the Assessment, which is a joint planning study for the Welsh Assembly Government and the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562W.9/2">I recognise that there is considerable support in North West England and in Wales for improvements to the Wrexham-Bidston line. I welcome the co-operation that is taking place between Merseytravel passenger transport executive, English and Welsh transport authorities and the Welsh Assembly Government to examine potential improvements, including electrification. Merseytravel and the Welsh Assembly Government, working with partners, have jointly commissioned Network Rail to undertake a feasibility study of electrification of the line.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562W.9/3">I have regular discussions with ministerial colleagues and the Assembly Minister on transport matters affecting Wales. Department for Transport officials are keeping in close touch with officials from the Welsh Assembly Government and Merseytravel about the electrification study but it would be premature to speculate on any conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562W.9/4">Once the outcome of studies is known, and subject to available funding and discussions with interested parties, Merseytravel PTE will consider whether a scheme is suitable to promote for major scheme funding as part of the second Local Transport Plan for Merseyside covering the period 2006-11. The Department for Transport and the Government Office for the North West have regular meetings with Merseytravel and local authorities to discuss implementation of Local Transport Plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562W.9/5">A decision to proceed with electrification would be subject to producing a business case with Network Rail and the rail industry, and securing the necessary funding. It would be necessary to show that sufficient extra passenger numbers would be likely to use the electrified service to make it a value for money option. It would be for the authorities in the North West Region to justify such expenditure against other priorities and to secure this via their allocated regional funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1578W.2/2">I regret that in my previous answer the figure of &pound;228 million given for the cost to the BBC to support Digital UK for the period of digital switchover was incorrect. The correct figure is &pound;216 million. The full correct response to your questions is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.2/3">In addition to meeting its costs for the upgrade of the transmission network for digital switchover, the BBC will meet Digital UK's communication costs and a share of Digital UK's operational costs. The cost to the BBC to support Digital UK amounts to &pound;216 million for the period of digital switchover. In addition, the BBC will also fund the digital switchover help scheme for people 75 or over or who have a significant disability. Our best estimate at this stage is that the cost of the scheme will be at or around &pound;600 million over the period of switchover.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.2/4">There are no central estimates of the overall cost to Government of digital switchover. However, other than the costs of updating television equipment within the Government sector, the only costs will be those incurred for research, communications and other programme support costs for the Digital Switchover Programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1578W.5/1">When the People's Network was introduced, the intention was that access should be provided free universally at point of use.

The majority of the 149 library authorities did not charge for provision of access to the internet but the small number of local authorities which thought they might, reported that there would usually be free or concessionary access for groups including people with disabilities and the unemployed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1580W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">2 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1580W.6/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what assessment he has made of the possible effect of the centralising of Jobcentre Plus Benefit Delivery Centres on the time taken to process bereavement benefit claims; and what the average time taken was to process bereavement benefit claims in each month since January 2006, broken down by region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1580W.6/4" class="indent">Bereavement Benefit is currently processed in 9 of the 11 Jobcentre Plus regions. The South East region processes Bereavement Benefit on behalf of London and the West Midlands. Centralising this work has not caused any decline in the time taken to process Bereavement Benefit. I have provided the information you requested in the attached table which shows that across the board we are performing within the target clearance times of 35 days. The National average for the period from January 2006 is 14.8 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1580W.6/5" class="indent">Centralisation has improved our ability to meet our customers needs so we have decided to further centralise Bereavement Benefit over the next couple of years. This will enable us to introduce quality improvements, concentrate expertise, and standardise delivery as well as make efficiency savings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1582W.2/2">Former employees of insolvent employers can claim redundancy payments and other contractual debts such as unpaid wages, notice pay and outstanding holiday pay from the National Insurance Fund. The Insolvency Service's Edinburgh Redundancy Payments Office (RPO) is liaising with the Administrator of Bonne Bouche Frozen (UK) Ltd to establish what payments are due. Once the information is obtained to identify what payments are due they will be made without delay. The RPO aims to pay 78 per cent. of claims within three weeks of receipt and 92 per cent. within six weeks of receipt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1582W.2/3">The Jobcentre Plus offers access to a range of support schemes, from the new deal and the jobseeker's allowance through to more focused schemes designed to help those caught up in restructuring. It provides information on job searching; compiling CVs; further education and training for individuals who need to develop new skills; as well as benefits information. Jobcentre Plus works closely with other organisations to assess the scale of any redundancy situation so that that it can give people who are able to work, the best chance of getting a job. Its key partners include local authorities (LAs), the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), Education and Learning Wales (ELWa) and Scottish Enterprise, the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in England, the Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency and other Government Departments. The majority of the Bonne Bouche work force has made claims at Hartlepool Jobcentre Plus and every effort is being made to find them employment or retrain.</p>

	<p pid="b.1593W.2/1">The criteria used to determine the level of funding for a Territorial Army unit cover pay, tasking and overheads. The pay budget allotted to a unit is based on the anticipated strength of the unit (the number of Territorial Army personnel in the unit) and the tasking budget is based on both the current and future roles of the unit (training (man training days) and deployments). Overheads cover those costs associated with the estate and administrative matters. Funding will, therefore, vary according to a unit's strength and place in the operational cycle. However, all Territorial Army units receive the funding necessary to enable them to meet their task.</p>
	<p pid="b.1593W.2/2">In general terms, there is no maximum limit on the number of training days placed on any Territorial Army officer or soldier and, as such, no formula is used in determining the allocation of training days to a Territorial Army unit. A unit at full strength will secure more funding to ensure that all its personnel have the opportunity to achieve their minimum training requirement. Similarly, a unit that is preparing to send a formed sub-unit to an operational theatre is likely to use more funding training and preparing than a unit without a current operational commitment. It is important to note that, although there is no maximum limit, specific restrictions may be imposed upon units by the chain of command in order to avoid overspend and ensure that funding and training is focussed where most needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1593W.2/3">There is no set maximum amount of training days allowed in relation to the operations cycle. The tempo of current operations and the requirement for the Territorial Army to deliver military capability determine the levels of funded training&mdash;some Territorial Army personnel and units warrant and receive more than others because of an individual's particular role, capability or career progression or a unit's scale of commitment to current operations. There is funding for all Territorial Army personnel to achieve the minimum training requirement and so win their bounty and, if the circumstances warrant, individuals and units may attract additional funded training for role-specific or operation-specific reasons. All funded training opportunities and those personnel conducting them are carefully scrutinised to ensure propriety, efficacy and the timely delivery of operational capability.</p>

This made transmission direct from Hungary more likely and this is when our investigation began to focus on this possible link.</p>

	<p pid="b.1601W.0/1">The Holton site comprises a turkey finishing unit, a slaughterhouse, and two processing plants. There are numerous controls throughout the various stages of production and processing, with additional measures in place during an outbreak. These measures include the cleansing of equipment, transport and people, and separation of animal and meat products. Biosecurity measures in place at the Holton finishing unit included:</p>

We are, however, not aware of many other finishing units in the UK which have a processing factory located as near as at the Holton site. Other finishing units, therefore, may have a less complex biosecurity regime to protect the health of the birds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1604W.2/2">A European Food Safety Authority report on trends and sources of zoonotic agents in animals, feedingstuffs, food and man in the UK, which includes information on antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli, is produced annually and can be found on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1604W.2/3">Defra, jointly with the Department of Health, the Health Protection Agency and devolved Administrations, will be publishing, very shortly, the first report in the UK providing an overview on the usage and resistance to selected antimicrobials in humans, animals and food. The report covers antimicrobial resistance in a number of zoonotic bacteria.</p>

We have worked in the United Nations Security Council, with our EU partners and in our contacts with key partners in the region to keep up the pressure for peaceful transition to democracy. We have consistently maintained that it is for the people of Burma to decide on their most appropriate form of democratic government.</p>
