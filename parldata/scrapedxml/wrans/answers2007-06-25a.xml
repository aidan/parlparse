	<p pid="a.1W.3/1">The benefits of advertising posts as available for flexible working are to give employers access to a bigger pool of potential employees, including lone parents and carers. The Minister for Women Ruth Kelly opened a debate on how to take flexible working into account in the recruitment process in a speech to employers on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May 2007</phrase> at the Work Wise UK Summit 2007. Many employers already advertise posts as suitable for job share or flexible hours and there are specialist recruitment agencies which bring together people looking for flexible work and the jobs that can be done flexibly, but these are still the exception.</p>

However, Members of Parliament are entitled to claim a bicycle allowance of 20p per mile for official travel, a rate which provides an incentive to use an environmentally-friendly means of travel and is approved by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.</p>

	<p pid="a.16W.3/1">The fall in the numbers of prosecutions and convictions in relation to escape from lawful custody offences since 2005 may partly reflect a change in policy, whereby prisoners who were granted temporary leave but failed to return on the agreed date were no longer automatically charged with an offence. Only in cases where the prisoner had been unlawfully at large for longer than eight weeks was a prosecution sought.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.3/2">Under new proposals, however, PSNI will be notified as soon as a person has been unlawfully at large for seven days or more, with a view to prosecution. Notification may also be made for periods less than seven days, when the Governor in question considers this is justified by the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.3/3">In addition, the PSNI have recently agreed new reporting procedures with the Northern Ireland Prison Service to ensure that all such cases will now be investigated and reported to the PPS. This will increase the number of convictions being achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.3/4">The procedures surrounding the supervision of prisoners both within and outside of prison establishments are constantly reviewed to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness and to minimise the possibility of escapes.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.5/1">DFID supports the World Health Organisation (WHO), through its core funding, in its efforts to help developing countries strengthen their pharmaceutical legislation, good manufacturing practices, national drug regulatory capacity and performance. The WHO also promotes information exchange among drug regulatory authorities to help combat drug counterfeiters.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/2">DFID is working with a wide range of partners, including the WHO, developing country governments, pharmaceutical companies and non-governmental organisations, on the development of the Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA).</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/3">MeTA seeks to increase transparency over vital information on the price, quality and availability of essential medicines in developing countries to help tackle high prices, challenge corruption and counterfeiting, and address inefficiency. Up to a third of medicines on the market in developing countries are fakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/4">MeTA seeks to change this by securing high level political commitment to increase transparency and accountability over medicine procurement and supply in participating countries. MeTA also seeks to bring the right people around the table&mdash;Government Departments, civil society organisations, companies and others&mdash;to agree ways of disclosing information on the price, the quality and the availability of essential medicines into the public arena, with the aim of ultimately reducing the cost, improving the quality and increasing the availability of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/5">DFID has for example provided support to Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control which has taken an active lead in reducing counterfeit drugs throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.2/1">DFID is committed to helping countries that want to remove charges at the point of delivery. In the recent DFID White Paper we made a commitment to help partner governments abolish user fees for basic health services and help them tackle other barriers to access, including discrimination against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.2/2">In 2003, as part of transition arrangements, user fees for health services in Liberia were suspended. At the end of the transition period on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, the President accepted the Minister of Health's recommendation that healthcare should continue to be free. We support this policy, although it is essential that it is implemented in the context of wider health sector reform, including financing, human resources, institutions, and procurement/supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.2/3">DFID has agreed to extend its support to Save the Children UK in Liberia which is playing a leading role in assisting the Government with the development of pro poor policies and health financing. DFID will jointly fund the placement of an SCF-UK Technical Director for Health to work specifically on co-ordination, policy and advocacy, including on access to free healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.2/4">User fees are one of several constraints to access to health care in Ethiopia, others being distance to health facilities and availability of drugs. Since more than one in five Ethiopians lives more than 10 km (or two hours walk) from a health care facility, Ethiopia's Health Sector Development Plan focuses on expanding access to primary health care services, especially preventive services, most of which are provided free. DFID helps to fund the delivery of these services through its contributions to the Protection of Basic Services grant, which supports recurrent costs of health and other services at local level and procurement of essential commodities such as vaccines, malaria drugs, bednets and contraceptives.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.5/1">As outlined in the new DFID health strategy &quot;Working together for Better health&quot;, assisting countries to strengthen their health services is a UK priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.5/2">In Ethiopia, DFID provided direct budget support to the Government in support of its poverty reduction strategy from January 2003 to March 2005. This included &pound;2.9 million for strengthening of the national health system and delivery of health care. Between June 2006 and end March 2007, DFID provided a grant of &pound;8.7 million for the Protection of Basic Services, to help fund the recurrent costs of delivering basic health care services and the procurement of key commodities including vaccines, malaria drugs, bednets and contraceptives. Since 2005, DFID has committed a total of &pound;145,000 to a multi-donor fund to cover costs of technical assistance, studies, consultations and meetings that are crucial to the implementation of Ethiopia's Health Sector Development Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.5/3">In Liberia DFID has been providing humanitarian support for health services since 2003 through Save the Children, Merlin and other NGOs. They have focused on providing basic services, working closely with County Health Teams. These Teams will take on increasing responsibility for health service management and delivery through training and carrying out joint supervision of health facilities. DFID's support to NGOs in Liberia is structured around supporting public healthcare systems to be delivered free to the patient. As well as building capacity to strengthen systems, the support ensures payment of staff and provision of drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.5/4">DFID will provide up to &pound;8 million over the next two years for building and strengthening systems at the central level. This includes support to the Ministry of Health to establish strong financial management and contributing to a proposed multi-donor fund to support Liberia to strengthen its health systems under its National Health Plan. DFID will continue to support NGOs to cover critical gaps in the provision of healthcare with increasing focus on transfer of leadership to the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.2/1">Since March 2003, the UK Government have budgeted &pound;744 million for the reconstruction and development of Iraq. Our contribution will help the Iraqi Government, at provincial and national level, to plan and deliver investment in basic services (electricity, hospitals, etc.), improve oil production, generate jobs and manage its own resources more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.2/2">DFID has committed over &pound;100 million to infrastructure projects in Iraq, and disbursed over &pound;80 million so far. Our work on improving power and water supply has helped create employment for several thousand Iraqis in repairing some of southern Iraq's key infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.2/3">DFID power projects have added or secured 350 MW of electricity to the Iraqi national grid, and will be adding or securing a further 120 MW over the next six months. This has been achieved by repairing damaged electricity transmission and distribution networks, including transmission lines from Al-Hartha power station to Basra city (securing electricity supplies for 1.5 million residents), and the Al-Hartha power station chimney (securing electricity supplies for 340,000 people).</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.2/4">By late 2007 DF1D will have improved access to water for one million people. We have replaced 200 kilometres of water mains, repaired over 5,000 leaks, cleared out 7,000 septic tanks and cleared over 40 kilometres of drains. We have refurbished a reverse osmosis unit to supply potable water to about 500,000 people, improved water supply to 60,000 people in Al Amtahiyah, constructed a water training centre in Basra to increase the skills of Iraqi engineers in water treatment and leakage repair, and provided technical advice for a major sewage installation in Al Amarah, providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.2/1">DFID is in the process of preparing a new Country Assistance Plan for Pakistan for 2008 to 2012. As part of that preparation, we have commissioned an independent evaluation of DFID's impact on the three strategic outcome areas of the 2005 Country Assistance Plan: (1) increased incomes for the poor; (2) improved delivery of education, health and population services to the poor; and (3) greater accountability of the state to its citizens. We aim to publish this evaluation by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/2">We have also just completed consultations within Pakistan, and with the Pakistan Diaspora, on what our future priorities should be. The overwhelming sense from these consultations was that DFID's programme in Pakistan has been making an impact, and that we should look to increase our efforts in support of Pakistan's poverty reduction strategies and plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/3">DFID's work, especially in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake, has won the UK many friends in Pakistan and has contributed to strengthening the ties between our two countries. This was illustrated in November last year when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister signed a 10 year Development Partnership Arrangement (DPA) with Pakistan's Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz. The DPA is based on a shared commitment to pursuing poverty reduction objectives, respecting the human rights obligations entered into, and improving financial management and accountability in Pakistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.33W.6/1">Of those aid groups based in Thailand, DFID provides &pound;1.8 million (over three years&mdash;2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08) to the Thailand-Burma Border Consortium for the provision of food, shelter, cooking fuel and non-food items for the 166,000 refugees in the nine camps on the Thai-Burma border, and for their support to internally displaced people, particularly those in hiding in areas of ongoing conflict. We provide an approximately equivalent amount of funding to the Thailand-Burma Border Consortium's refugee work through our contributions to aid provided by the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.6/2">DFID acknowledges the importance and value of cross-border aid, especially in supporting many of the 100,000 internally displaced people living in conflict areas in eastern Burma. We also acknowledge the value and importance of work by community based groups inside the country, who are able to reach many of the 400,000 internally displaced people living in Government controlled areas, mixed administration areas (where both ethnic armed groups and the Burmese army are present) and cease-fire areas. We believe strongly that the two mechanisms should be seen as complementary to each other&mdash;not as competitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.6/3">We have removed the restriction on the use of UK funds provided to Thailand-based non-Governmental organisations for cross-border assistance. But while several Governments already fund cross-border work, the UK is the only bilateral donor currently supporting community-based groups reaching internally displaced people from inside Burma. Our judgment is that the best use for our additional money is to support community based organisations working inside Burma, which is why we also provide assistance to internally displaced people through community-based groups inside Burma (&pound;400,000 in 2007-08) to provide emergency relief, health and education programmes in eastern Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.2/1">In 2006, the UN Secretary-General set up a High Level Panel (HLP) on UN System-wide Coherence. The Panel, with the Chancellor's participation, reported in November 2006 with recommendations to improve the UN's position and response to new global development challenges, and to achieve greater efficiency and co-ordination. This included the establishment of 'One UN' pilots at country level. The pilots are testing an approach based on one integrated UN programme with one consolidated budget, managed by one UN leader (the Resident Co-ordinator), where appropriate housed in one UN location. The aim is to create a genuinely united nations at country level, operating in partnership with, and responding directly to the needs of developing countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.2/2">'One UN' is currently being piloted in eight countries: Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Pakistan, Vietnam (all priorities for the UK), Cape Verde, Uruguay and Albania. The HLP recommended that the programme expand to up to 40 countries by 2010. DFID is working closely with country offices, governments, and the UN system to ensure that 'One UN' is successful. Progress is already being made in aligning the UN with national priorities, in greater efficiency and in taking the necessary change management steps. DFID is working closely with partners and the UN system to ensure robust monitoring and evaluation processes are in place, so that lessons learned and best practice are fully utilised in future 'One UN' countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.35W.2/1">DFID is committed to helping countries that want to remove charges at the point of delivery. DFID made a commitment in the recent White Paper to help partner governments abolish user fees for basic health services and help them tackle other barriers to access, including discrimination against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.35W.2/2">In Rwanda, the Government and major aid donors are conscious that financial barriers are inhibiting poor people from accessing health services. DFID is therefore working closely with the Government to investigate how DFID aid and technical assistance can best be provided to reduce the level of out-of-pocket expenditures on health services. In particular, DFID is looking at various options to specifically address the needs of the very poor that are most adversely affected by present patient charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.35W.2/3">In Zimbabwe, access to health services is rapidly decreasing as the economy contracts, inflation surpasses 4500 per cent. government capacity to maintain services diminishes and travel for most people becomes harder. User fees are currently charged for most health services other than preventive care to children under five and HIV treatment services. Where commodities have been donated, the Ministry of Health policy is that these should not be sold through fees but passed on for free. We are all aware of the situation in Zimbabwe which prevents a development partnership between DFID and the Zimbabwean government. However, DFID engages whenever the opportunity arises to discuss the adverse effects of user fees. DFID provides technical assistance and financial support for research in order to strengthen the evidence base and support the policy process.</p>

	<p pid="a.36W.2/1">DFID bilateral aid to Zimbabwe in the fiscal year 2005-06 was &pound;34.1 million of which &pound;1.6 million was in the form of financial aid. The UK is one of the largest bilateral donors of humanitarian support to Zimbabwe, supporting over 1.5 million of the poorest people. Our funding prioritises HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and supporting orphans and vulnerable children. Our current programmes will help ensure that an additional 30,000 people receive anti-retroviral treatment, will provide health care for around 350,000 children, promote food security in both urban and rural areas and assist extremely vulnerable displaced people. The UK does not give direct funding to the Government of Zimbabwe. All DFID's bilateral funding is channelled through NGOs and UN agencies, much of it programmed jointly with other donors.</p>

The Creative Economy Programme is considering the broad framework of support for the creative industries and through that work there is a broad recognition that creativity itself is a vital component of sectors such as ceramics, where I am aware that there are many examples of companies achieving renewed success through their innovation and willingness to reinvent themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.63W.2/1">Before the recent change to rules on pet bird imports, there were more restrictions on movements of pet birds into the UK than on commercial birds of the same species. In respect of disease risk, there is no justification for imposing additional rules on individuals wishing to bring their pet birds into the UK. Pet birds are confined in a house or aviary, with minimal contact with wild birds or commercial poultry, and are closely observed, so disease is noticed promptly. Bird keepers are advised to be alert for signs of avian influenza or Newcastle disease at all times and to report any suspicion of disease to their nearest animal health office.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.2/2">Following a public consultation, including an animal health risk assessment, moving pet birds to the UK from other European countries does not require licences or quarantine subject to conditions: there must be five or fewer pet birds, the import must not be intended for a commercial purpose and the birds cannot be poultry.</p>

We have growing capacity for the treatment of TVs and monitors with cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and good treatment capacity for lamps and fluorescent tubes.

	<p pid="a.75W.3/1">DEFRA funds the Carbon Trust, who work closely with business to encourage sustainable use of energy, establish energy efficient practices and systems, and develop low carbon technologies. Under its Solutions programme the trust advises businesses on cutting carbon emissions through reducing energy use, including advice on switching off lighting and equipment during non-business times. The Carbon Trust holds free lighting workshops, and produces a number of publications specifically focused on lighting in the business sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.3/2">The Secretary of State has the power to enter in to climate change agreements (CCAs) with industry sectors and individual companies that meet certain eligibility conditions. CCAs give entitlement to claim an 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency or carbon emissions reductions targets. The targets apply regardless of when energy is used.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.3/3">In addition, as part of the Energy White Paper, the Government announced that it would be taking forward the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC). The CRC is a mandatory emissions trading scheme that will target energy use emissions from large non-energy intensive commercial and public sector organisations, such as supermarkets, banks, large local authorities and Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.3/4">This sector accounts for around 10 per cent. of the UK's carbon emissions and is rising. There is scope for significant abatement. The CRC will deliver emissions reductions of 1.1 MtC per year by 2020 from this sector. It would encourage organisations to minimise their energy use by placing a cap on their overall energy use emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.0/1">Flycapture, the national database of fly-tipping incidents, was set up in 2004 by DEFRA, the Environment Agency and the Local Government Association, to record fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the Environment Agency and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.0/2">Flycapture data shows that, in England, 926,534 incidents were reported in the period from April 2004 to March 2005. There were 2,509,976 incidents reported from April 2005 to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.0/3">A possible reason for the rise in fly-tipping offences recorded by Flycapture in its second year may simply be due to better reporting and a rise in the number of local authorities in England submitting regular returns. This number rose significantly, from 79.5 per cent. in April 2004 when the database was first launched, to 92 per cent. in 2005-06. Over time, the database will help us build up a more accurate picture of illegally dumped waste, as well as providing a useful management tool for local authorities in tackling the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.0/4">Data for 2006-07 are not yet available but will be published this summer. Flycapture does not record fly-tipping tonnages.</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.3/1">Foie gras is not produced in the UK and this Government have made their view very clear that the production of foie gras using force feeding gives rise to serious welfare concerns. If any production were to occur, Animal Health would be asked to investigate and advise on any contravention of UK animal welfare laws. The UK has the highest animal welfare standards we have ever had and they are among the highest in the world. This Government have been at the forefront of implementing higher standards domestically, and have been active on a European and international level in trying to improve standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/2">The free movement of goods is a well established principle in Community law and is enshrined in Part III, Title I of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (TEC). A unilateral ban by the UK on the import or sale of foie gras would contravene the provisions of the TEC and would be highly likely to result in proceedings being brought against the UK before the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.3/3">In addition, even if the Community law obstacles to introducing a restriction could be overcome, which is unlikely, the World Trade Organisation rules do not allow us to ban imports on the grounds of the welfare standards applying in third countries. Ultimately, the most effective action that can be taken is for individuals not to buy foie gras, if they dislike the way it is produced.</p>

	<p pid="a.85W.2/1">Road traffic has been identified as a significant source of pollution in 95 per cent. of the air quality management areas (designated by local authorities) declared so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.2/2">Local air quality assessments include a basic screening process to determine vehicles' impact on air quality. Typically, this considers traffic as consisting only of light and heavy duty vehicle types, assigning average levels of emissions to each of these in order to model their air quality impact on the surrounding area. Although this method does not apportion a fraction of the overall level of air pollutants directly to specific classes of vehicles, such as heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), it does ensure that their emissions are represented in the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.2/3">Should the screening process identify a likely failure of air quality objectives, a further, more detailed level of assessment is undertaken to establish whether an air quality management Area is necessary. These methods of assessment all consider the specific contribution of HGVs to ambient air pollution.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.2/4">No specific national assessment of the impact of HGV traffic has been made for the areas mentioned in <i> (b),</i><i> (c)</i> and <i> (d).</i> Terrestrial special protection areas are also notified as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs). Natural England data on the reasons for unfavourable condition on SSSIs identifies that 18,524 hectares of SSSI land are adversely affected by air pollution. However the impacts of air pollution and identification of air pollution as an adverse activity affecting site condition are currently considered to be under reported. Furthermore SSSI condition is not disaggregated to identify different sources of air pollution. Individual assessments of the impact from air pollution have been made in respect of specific sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.87W.5/1">The United Kingdom is a Party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES, which is implemented within the EU by the Wildlife Trade Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97), regulates trade in over 5,000 species of animals, including the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). Polar bears are listed under Appendix II as a species that is not necessarily now threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled. Under the EU Regulation the international trade in polar bears and other vulnerable species is strictly regulated to ensure that it will not be detrimental to their wild populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.5/2">Currently, however, the chief threat to polar bears is the impact of climate change, which is felt particularly strongly in polar regions. If global temperatures continue to rise, Arctic summer sea ice could disappear almost entirely by the latter part of this century. The UK continues to take a strong lead internationally on climate change. In particular, we are working through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the G8 to secure agreement to a long-term international framework that can address dangerous climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.87W.8/1">Under EU-wide Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-related feed ban controls, introduced in 2001, most processed animal proteins, including those derived from poultry, have been prohibited from use in any farmed animal feed. This builds on longer-standing controls on mammalian-derived processed animal proteins.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.8/2">Separate controls, in place since 2002 under the EU Animal By-Products Regulation, prohibit processed animal proteins from being recycled back to the same species they are derived from. These controls mean that feeding poultry using recycled processed animal protein derived from dead poultry is not permitted, either in the UK or in any other member state. Additionally, no poultry feed containing processed animal protein derived from poultry may be imported either into the UK, or into any other member state.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.8/3">Neither pigs nor poultry, as naturally omnivorous animals, have been shown in experiments to be orally susceptible to BSE, and no naturally occurring Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy have yet been identified in these species. Nevertheless, the principle of preventing intra-species recycling of processed animal protein in feed will continue to apply to all farmed animal species both now and in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.5/1">There are 182 protected areas in UK inshore waters with a marine element: 81 special protection areas with marine habitats for birds, 98 special areas of conservation with marine habitats or species, and three marine nature reserves. In total, these sites cover more than 1.8 million hectares, or 2.2 per cent. of UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.5/2">Work is under way to identify further sites in UK waters. To date, 19 areas for marine habitats have been surveyed and there are plans for additional survey of a further 10 areas. Between them, these areas cover up to 9,550,000 ha or 11 per cent. of UK waters. Seven areas for marine birds have also been surveyed, with plans for 30 more. A selection of these surveyed areas are likely to be recommended as marine protected areas under the habitats and birds directives, but the number and size of these sites is not yet known.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.5/3">The Marine Bill will also introduce a new mechanism to enable the designation of marine conservation zones. There have been a number of recommendations on what proportion of the UK marine area might be covered by such zones, including by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. However, there is currently insufficient scientific evidence to enable us to make an accurate assessment of the likely extent of a network of marine protected areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.5/4">To inform the impact assessment for the Bill, we have undertaken research investigating the likely extent of a network of marine conservation zones in UK waters under a range of different scenarios. The network configurations generated as part of the exercise all resulted in 14 to 20 per cent. coverage of the UK continental shelf. These figures were based on a number of scenarios, although none of these are necessarily representative of how the final network will look. The findings of this research have been published on the DEFRA website.</p>

For that reason, my Department has had no other discussions with these or any other bodies specifically about water supply infrastructure serving Peterborough.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.8/1">I opened the &pound;18 million River Quaggy Flood Alleviation scheme in Lewisham, London, with the chairman of the Environment Agency Sir John Harman. I asked people to mark World Environment Agency Day by identifying the one change they can make in their everyday lives to protect the environment and fight climate change. I also urged people to go to the Environment Agency's Mend the World online survey, which was the core component of the Environment Agency's campaign this year for WED. This has been asking people for the number one action they can do to tackle climate change, the one extra action they could take and what was stopping them from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.8/2">I also announced that the Government are to hold a second competition for youth Climate Change Champions to communicate climate change across the country. The nine inaugural champions, aged between 10 and 18, have been active in speaking out about climate change. Their efforts have reached an estimated 18 per cent. of the adult population and have engaged a large number of young people in the debate about what needs to be done. The competition will kick off in the summer, and nine new champions will be appointed in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.8/3">DEFRA also released a new booklet, &quot;Climate Change: Your Guide to Inspiring Action&quot; to help organisations communicate the ways in which people can make changes in their lives to help fight climate change. The first guide has been downloaded 40,000 times and 6,000 hard copies have been distributed. It is available on</p>

These included the launch of the Royal Society of Arts/Tesco Carbonator&mdash;an online CO2 calculator aimed at children aged 7-14 to raise awareness of climate change and the Royal Geographical Society's new website for 11 to 18-year-olds linking climate change to the geography curriculum. The fund provides financial support for communications projects seeking to achieve positive changes in public attitudes about climate change. The 83 projects cover a wide range of communications initiatives and media and are supported by &pound;8.5 million of funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.92W.5/1">Under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 the Secretary of State is required to specify detailed standards for zoo management that zoos are expected to comply with. The Secretary of State's Standards of Modern Zoo Practice are designed to ensure that the welfare of animals in zoos is adequately protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/2">The current standards state that euthanasia in zoos is an acceptable procedure only if an animal cannot be provided with captive conditions which meet the Five Principles of animal welfare, or if it cannot be released into the wild. These Five Principles are based on the 'Five Freedoms' drawn up for livestock by the Farm Animal Welfare Council, and they comprise: provision of food and water; provision of a suitable environment; provision of animal health care; provision of an opportunity to express most normal behaviour; provision of protection from fear and distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/3">The standards provide strict guidelines on circumstances where euthanasia is justifiable. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/4" class="indent">if, in the opinion of a vet, an animal is suffering from an incurable disease, or severe pain or suffering which cannot be alleviated.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/5" class="indent">if a zoo has to close, euthanasia may be the only option for some animals and the most humane for others.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/6" class="indent">if the animal poses a serious and unavoidable threat to human safety (e.g. because it has escaped);</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/7" class="indent">culling of surplus stock (including unacceptable sex ratios) where overcrowding compromises the welfare of the animals so that it is impractical to maintain them within the Five Principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.5/8">The standards further recommend that zoos have a policy, with appropriate protocols, which should be made available to zoo inspectors during their regular inspection visits under the Zoo Licensing Act. This should also form part of the zoo's audit process. Zoos are also expected to have in place an ethical review process, which would address issues such as the establishment's culling policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.100W.5/1">Those service personnel who have received a serious physical injury are treated as a matter of priority, most often at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine and then at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre. As part of their hospital care, they will receive psychological assessment and, if necessary, treatment can commence. If required, patients can be referred later to a military Department of Community Mental Health (DCMH).</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.5/2">For those who do not have a serious physical injury, if their GP judges that they might be suffering from an operational related mental health condition (for example PTSD), then they will be referred to a DCMH for a detailed multidisciplinary assessment of their condition. If it is confirmed that the individual is suffering from a mental illness such as PTSD, they will receive specialist treatment at a DCMH or, if in-patient care is required, a Priory Group Facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.5/3">Our mental health services operate in line with best practice to provide community-based mental health care. Our model for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment meets the standards set by the independent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.5/4">We have established 15 military DCMHs across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas) to provide out-patient mental health care. The MOD's performance indicators require urgent cases to be seen within 24 hours and others within 20 working days of referral. The DCMHs function within these requirements and we are not aware of, nor would we expect there to be, any patients who had to wait in excess of six months for a referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.5/5">It remains the case that medical discharge from the UK armed forces due to psychological illness is low. Out of almost 180,000 Regular Service personnel only about 150, or less than 0.1 per cent. are discharged annually for mental health reasons, whatever the cause. Of these, only 20 to 25 meet the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD.</p>

	<p pid="a.101W.5/1">The expression 'full pension' is taken to mean a pension reflecting the maximum amount of reckonable service allowed under the pension scheme rules. As the majority of service personnel belong to either the armed forces pension scheme 1975 (AFPS 75) or the armed forces pension scheme 2005 (AFPS 05) my answer is in respect of those schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.5/2">Under AFPS 75 the most an officer can accrue is 34 years reckonable service from age 21 and, for an other rank, the limit is 37 years reckonable service from age 18. The earliest that a full pension can be paid is age 55 and this full pension is worth 48.5 per cent. of representative pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.5/3">Officers who leave having accrued at least 16 years reckonable service from age 21 under AFPS 75 and other ranks who leave having accrued at least 22 years from age 18 are entitled to a pension paid immediately upon discharge but this is a proportion of the full career pension. Those who leave with two or more years service but insufficient to qualify for this immediate pension are awarded a preserved pension payable at age 60 for service before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> and 65 for service after that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.5/4">Under AFPS 05 the most that a member can accrue is 40 years reckonable service with no minimum age limit. The normal full pension entitlement is age 55. A full pension under AFPS 05 is worth just over 57 per cent. of final pensionable pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.5/5">AFPS 05 members who leave before age 55 with two or more years reckonable service are entitled to a preserved pension payable at age 65. Those who have given at least 18 years reckonable service and attained age 40 are eligible for payments from the early departure payments scheme. Their pensions are preserved until age 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.5/6">Finally, members of the armed forces do not typically serve to age 55 or beyond. In 2005-06 approximately 10 per cent. of officers and approximately 7 per cent. of other ranks served long enough to receive a full pension.</p>

Flowers can be provided only for OSRs as part of the cost of official entertainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.110W.8/2">There is no requirement to hold information regarding official entertainment costs to the level of detail that would allow the cost of flowers to be identified, and the information requested is not therefore available for the Chief of the General Staff and the Commander in Chief Land. For the Adjutant General expenditure on flowers was &pound;72.12 and for the General Officer Commanding (Northern Ireland) it was &pound;190 during 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.115W.0/19">The precise value of each contract is commercially confidential but the approximate value of each contract is indicated in an extensive table which I have placed in the Library of the House. The number excludes small-value local purchase orders, contracts placed on behalf of other nations and other Government Departments and those where the suppliers are a subcontractor or a member of an industry consortium. The total cost to the public purse of each contract in each of the past five years is also commercially confidential. However, the scale of total payments made to the major divisions of each supplier, over the past five financial years on all direct contracts, as published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency, is shown as follows.</p>

	<p pid="a.126W.0/2"><i> </i>Depleted uranium is a heavy metal used in some anti-armour munitions. While there is no appreciable radiation health risk, it can pose a toxic hazard through inhalation of ingestion of depleted uranium dust, or contamination of open wounds. This risk is relatively low and does not require individual protective clothing to be worn unless personnel are working in contaminated areas for a prolonged period. Advice provided on decontamination during combat operations was that clothing that may have been in contact with depleted uranium should have the dust brushed off in a controlled site while the individuals concerned were still wearing oral-nasal protection and gloves. Once brushed clean, the clothing was to be washed as normal. Thereafter clothing could be worn or disposed of locally as required.</p>
	<p pid="a.126W.0/3">Subsequent monitoring of several hundred UK troops has shown that this advice was effective. Tests have shown no detectable depleted uranium in anyone other than a very small number of troops injured directly by depleted uranium munitions.</p>

	<p pid="a.128W.2/1">During a post flight check on Nimrod XV227 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-22">22 November 2004</phrase>, it was discovered that a portion of Supplementary Cooling Pack ducting had failed. A unit inquiry was held which concluded that it was caused by pitting and cracking corrosion leading to failure. The unit inquiry made the following recommendations and the table identifies actions taken in response.</p>

			<tr pid="a.128W.2/5"> <td>The ruptured duct is replaced with new manufactured items on a fleet-wide basis as soon as possible.</td> <td>Recommendation closed. All such ducts fitted to in-service aircraft have been replaced with newly manufactured items.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.128W.2/6"> <td>A lifing policy is introduced for the ruptured duct and all similar ducts.</td> <td>See comments on maintenance policy recommendation. Action ongoing.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.128W.2/7"> <td>A maintenance policy should be instigated for the ruptured duct and all similar ducts.</td> <td>A study into the need for a preventative maintenance/lifing policy for this and similar ducts has been concluded by the Designer (BAE Systems). Their report, which is due to be issued imminently, is based on the results of a detailed analysis of a sample of ducts taken from a number of MR2 aircraft. This analysis has taken time to complete, but the report is expected to recommend that a lifing policy be introduced. Ducts due for replacement would be replaced during scheduled maintenance activities and it is anticipated that such a duct replacement programme would be in place by December 2007. Action ongoing.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.128W.2/8"> <td>The extent of the hot air leak warning system is reviewed to ensure that all possible duct failures are covered.</td> <td>Recommendation closed. A review of the aircraft warning systems revealed that the affected Supplementary Cooling Pack Duct was the only duct whose failure would not have been detected.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.128W.2/9"> <td>A hot air leak warning system is introduced for the ruptured duct and cross-air bleed ducts.</td> <td>Recommendation rejected. The duct failure was an isolated incident and was in the only part of the system where a leak would not have been detected. All of these ducts have been replaced with newly manufactured items that, based upon the previous 25 fault-free years that the original duct had been fitted, are expected to last well beyond the planned MR2 Out of Service Date (early part of the next decade). Moreover, fitting a discrete hot air leak warning system would be a complex modification that would have to be embodied across the fleet during its maintenance cycle and therefore take several years to embody. Considering the Out of Service Date of the Nimrod MR2, the fitting of such a system was not considered to be practicable. Action closed.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.128W.2/10"> <td>This incident is highlighted as a training point for Air Engineers.</td> <td>The incident was immediately publicised through the Air Engineer command chain at RAF Kinloss. Action closed.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.128W.2/11"> <td>The Aircrew Flight Reference Cards (FRC) regarding Supplementary Cooling Pack malfunctions are amended to reflect the information in the aircrew manuals.</td> <td>Amendments were made to Aircrew Flight Reference Cards and Aircrew Manuals to reflect the incident.

	<p pid="a.129W.11/1">The information is not held centrally in the format requested. Taking the eight ships as a whole, the approximate percentage of time spent at sea for Type 42 destroyers over the last 12 months and for 2006 is 30 per cent. at sea and 70 per cent. in harbour.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/2">Time spent in harbour includes both time spent alongside in the ship's home port and time spent alongside while deployed elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/3">The percentage figures allow for time spent in refit or maintenance periods.</p>

	<p pid="a.130W.6/1">Currently, the major portion of biodiesel production in the UK comes from imported soya, palm and jatrophe oils, along with locally grown oilseed rape, with a smaller contribution from recycled waste vegetable oil and animal fats. Bioethanol is sourced primarily from imports. However, a number of companies have announced plans to increase production of biofuels, either by expansion of existing plants or through construction of new plants which will use UK grown crops such as sugar beet, wheat and oilseed rape as a feedstock. Such biofuel production plants are being stimulated by a mix of Road Fuel Duty reduction and the forthcoming Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. The Government are also keen to support &quot;second generation&quot; biofuels which use more advanced technologies and have the potential to use straw, wood and biodegradable waste as feedstocks and is supporting a number of projects through the Technology Programme in this area. However, the majority of these processes are currently not proven at commercial scale. There is also significant development of biofuels internationally.</p>

The WMG, in particular, is one of many assets within the region which form an integral part of an overall regional proposition presented to knowledge driven business. It is rarely possible however to attribute the success in securing an inward investment project to one single factor as it often it is the results of a combination of issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.11/15">For example, Airbus decision to establish a systems engineering centre for fuel and landing gear systems in Solihull in 2006 was based on a combination of factors, including skills availability, access to existing Airbus centres in both north-west and south-west England and also to potential engineering links to regional universities including Aston, Birmingham and Warwick. WMG was nevertheless one of a number of factors which persuaded Airbus to locate in the region.</p>

It is for the planning process to consider if proposed upgrades are acceptable. In Scotland, those planning decisions rest with Scottish Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.137W.5/1">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires that distributors supplying electrical and electronic equipment to household end users provide facilities for WEEE to be returned free of charge. The UK's implementing regulations give distributors two options for meeting this obligation: they can offer in-store take back of old equipment when consumers buy a replacement item or they can join the Distributor Take back Scheme (DTS) which supports a network of primarily civic amenity site collection facilities where their customers can return their WEEE.</p>

The Department of Trade and Industry has a wide range of relationships with many sectors of the economy that address the challenges industry faces in light of increasing globalisation and which seek to improve competitiveness and create jobs. We have established a number of Innovation and Growth Teams in key sectors which provide a good example of the way in which we work with industry. We also work with inward investors to the UK who create employment.

	<p pid="a.140W.3/1">In the Energy White Paper, the Government made clear their view that display devices could give gas and electricity customers information to help them make early reductions in their energy use. Further activity in respect of smart metering is being undertaken by the Government, in partnership with gas and electricity suppliers. In setting out their White Paper proposals on display devices, the Government indicated that they would consult on the implementation of these proposals in the context of their ambitions to see a roll-out of smart meters within 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.8/1">No specific research has been commissioned by DTI on flexible working and skill shortages in the UK. However, to the extent that flexible working helps employers both to recruit and retain skilled staff, it will help to reduce skill shortages in the UK. DTI research has found that many employees consider the availability of flexible working to be important when deciding to work with their current employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.8/2">With regards to the percentage of men who would like to work more flexibly the DTIs Third Work-Life Balance Employee Survey found that almost half (46 per cent.) were either currently working flexibly, or had done so in the past year. When men who had not made a request to work flexibly were asked why, more than three-fifths said they were happy with their current arrangements or gave other personal reasons. Overall, 86 per cent. of male employees said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their current working arrangements, compared with only 5 per cent. who were dissatisfied and 1 per cent. who were very dissatisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.8/3">The relationship between various workplace practices and productivity is a complex one, mediated by a host of other variables; studies often find no statistically significant relationship. The relationship between work-life balance and labour productivity was investigated in Chapter 10 of the DTI-sponsored report, 'Inside the Workplace: Findings from the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey' (Routledge 2006). It was found that work-life balance practices were not jointly significant when added to the baseline labour productivity model. A forthcoming DTI research report, however, has found that in private sector workplaces an increased incidence of family-friendly provisions is positively associated with managers' perceptions of improved financial performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.8/4">In terms of raising awareness of the business case for flexible working among employers, the DTI has recently worked with Carers UK, ACAS, British Chambers of Commerce and British Gas to produce an employer's pack which illustrates the business case for flexible working. The Business Link website provides advice and guidance on flexible working and highlights the business case and benefits to employers of working flexibly.</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.10/1">Local authorities have an important role in securing new affordable housing. They should work in partnership with housing associations and developers, using their planning and other powers, to identify need and support development. But we are encouraging more direct development by authorities where it offers value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.10/2">We have changed the bidding process for social housing grant this year which will make it easier for arms length management organisations (ALMOs) or local authority special venture vehicles to satisfy pre-qualification tests of financial standing and technical capacity which has hampered previous ALMO bids; and ensure that when an authority brings forward land in a bid, this is likely to score well in meeting the criteria of deliverability and strategic fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.10/3">We are exploring with six local authorities, three of which have ALMOs, the benefits of their coming out of the housing revenue subsidy system. The pilots have shown that by being self-financing creates a number of benefits, one of which is the opportunity for councils to have a more direct role in building homes for rent. The work of the pilots is currently being assessed.</p>

Forty local authorities have already cut their costs in anticipation of home information packs (HIP) because they know that, for the first time, the charges and the length of time taken will be transparent to the consumer and to HIP providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.156W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.8/2">Local authorities are required to report quarterly data on municipal waste (encompassing household waste) to WasteDataFlow. When reporting data, authorities should specify the amount of waste collected for recycling that is subsequently rejected, at the point of collection, at a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF), or at the gate of the reprocessor. The data reported to WasteDataFlow are used by the Environment Agency and DEFRA to monitor the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.8/3">The agency has also carried out a survey on household waste materials reclamation facilities in England and Wales. They identified and visited about 80 candidate sites to ascertain recovery and reject levels at each site, verifying this information via a visual inspection of bale quality and the overall state of each facility. The overall typical spread of reject rates for MRFs was from 5-25 per cent. with 10-15 per cent. being the average. Around 1 million tonnes of municipal waste were reported to WasteDataFlow as being processed by an MRF.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.8/4">Analysis by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, based on a range of data sources, suggests that a conservative estimate of the amount of household waste collected for recycling which is not recycled, is around 5-10 per cent. In 2005-06, a total of 6.87 million tonnes of waste from household sources was collected for recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.8/5">I am not aware of any research carried out by the Audit Commission in this area. However, the Audit Commission has published a number of guidance documents containing advice to local councils on how they can meet their statutory requirements with regards to waste by improving their waste management and adopting best practice. The Audit Commission also examines the performance of councils and the services they provide, including waste, through the Comprehensive Performance Assessment, and provides recommendations for improvement.</p>

More recently, the Planning White Paper reports that our reforms have already brought substantial improvements in the performance of local planning authorities in deciding applications within target time scales.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.2/2">The White Paper sets out further measures which will improve the handling of planning applications. Planning performance agreements, will enable planning authority and developer to agree in advance a timetable and the requirements for achievement of each phase of processing a major application, avoiding unnecessary delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.171W.11/1">The percentage of local government revenue expenditure financed by specific grants in England in each year since 1997-98 and the estimated figures for 2006-07 and 2007-08 are tabled as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.171W.11/2">The table is produced on a non-Financial Reporting Standard (FRS 17) basis to 2003-04 and on an FRS 17 basis from 2003-04 onwards. The main implication is that the costs of entitlements to retirement benefits (pensions) in FRS 17 are accounted for in the year in which employment gives rise to the entitlement, rather than the year in which cash payments of contributions or pensions take place. On an FRS 17 basis, revenue expenditure is now financed by appropriations from pension reserves, in addition to appropriations from other reserves, revenue support grant, redistributed non-domestic rates, police grant and council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.171W.11/3">The large change in specific grant from 2006-07 onwards is largely due to changes in the way the expenditure on schools is funded. Local authorities now receive dedicated schools grant, included in specific grants, replacing funding previously included in formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.171W.11/4">The definition of local government revenue expenditure used here is that expenditure funded from aggregate external finance (AEF), council tax and authorities' reserves. AEF is central Government revenue funding that comprises formula grant (revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and police grant), general Greater London authority (GLA) grant and specific grants inside AEF, i.e. revenue grants paid for council's core services. The specific grants used here are the specific grants inside AEF. Comparisons across years may not be valid due to changing local authority responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.174W.8/1">The relevant code in the 2003 CEPFA Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) specified a rate of return of 3.5 per cent. real in respect of calculating benefit scheme liabilities. The relevant code in the 2004 SORP changed this. It specified the use of an equivalent current rate of return to that of a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities rather than a specific percentage figure. This reflects the Financial Reporting Board Standard 17 issued by the Accounting Standards Board, part of a general move for local authorities to comply with standard accounting practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.178W.6/2">No additional funding has been provided by my Department. However, the Government have prepared for possible consequences of England going Smokefree on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, including the potential increase in smoking-related litter.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.6/3">In May this year, the Government published guidance for local authorities on smoking litter prevention, which was sent to all authorities in England. DEFRA has also funded four smoking litter campaigns for the current financial year. These campaigns have been organised by Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS), the organisation that runs the Keep Britain Tidy campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.6/4">Central to this work is the issue of behaviour change. If smokers refrained from discarding their cigarette butts on the street, smoking-related litter would not be a problem. This is why, through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, we took the opportunity to clarify that smoking-related litter is in fact litter. As a consequence, anyone disposing of a cigarette butt is committing a littering offence, punishable with a fixed penalty notice fine or prosecution in the magistrates court. The Government continue to encourage local authorities to use their powers in this regard to take action, where appropriate, against those discarding smoking-related litter.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.6/5">We are also in the process of amending the Street Litter Control Notices Order 1991 to extend the types of premises currently falling within the scope of the Street Litter Control Notice provisions. This will enable them to be used against places which may attract outside smokers, including pubs, clubs, restaurants, cafes and other eating and drinking venues. It is intended to commence this power on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2007</phrase>. When there is a suitable opportunity, we also intend to amend both primary and secondary legislation so that Street Litter Control Notices can also be used in respect of offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.6/6">In instances where a partnership approach to deal with a litter or refuse problem has failed, Street Litter Control Notices can be used by local authorities to set out what can reasonably be required of the occupier of the premises in question to minimise the detrimental impact of their operation. For example, by providing bins and keeping a defined area clear of litter, including smoking-related litter.</p>

	<p pid="a.181W.0/2">Latest figures, for <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>, show that there were 1,871 dependant children in bed-and-breakfast style accommodation and 129,341 in all forms of total temporary accommodation. Note that these figures also include expected children when a pregnant woman is part of the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.0/3">The Government have made significant progress in tackling the use of inappropriate temporary accommodation for families assisted under the homelessness legislation. In March 2002, the Government set a target that no family with children should have to live in bed and breakfast provided as temporary accommodation under the homelessness legislation for more than six weeks. At that time, there were 6,960 families living in bed and breakfast as temporary accommodation, of which it was estimated that 3,500&mdash;4,000 had been in bed and breakfast for more than six weeks. The target was met by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> and, to ensure it would be sustained, the Government made the &quot;Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2003&quot;, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. The effect of the order is that, under the homelessness legislation, bed and breakfast cannot not be regarded as suitable accommodation for families with children unless alternative accommodation is not available, and even then cannot be regarded as suitable for more than six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.181W.0/4">In addition, in January 2005 the Government announced in &quot;Homes for All&quot; its commitment to halve the number of all households in temporary accommodation by 2010, and more recently on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-14">14 November 2006</phrase>, a further commitment that by 2010, no 16 or 17-year-olds should be placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation by a local authority under the homelessness legislation, except in an emergency.</p>

For the urban area, which excludes rural parts of the borough, but includes the contiguous urban area, which crosses local authority boundaries) the Census figure was 110,320. The most recent population projections published by the Office for National Statistics for the local authority area, indicates a population increase from 111,900 in 2006 to 120,100 in 2026. The projections are trend based and policy neutral. They do not illustrate either the implementation or non implementation of any strategy but indicate a continuation of existing trends.

	<p pid="a.182W.2/2">The proposed housing figures contained in the draft RSS were submitted by the South West Regional Assembly based on proposals put to it by Gloucestershire county council. The Member for Cheltenham would need to ask those bodies what assumptions they have made about the likely population of the Cheltenham area and the implications of the implementation or non implementation of those RSS proposals. Following the end of the current Examination in Public into the RSS in July this year and the subsequent submission of the Panel report, Government will then consider the recommendations in it, and the most up to date evidence, before considering the need to accept the RSS or propose changes to it.</p>
