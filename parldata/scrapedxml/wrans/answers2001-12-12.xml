Friend the Foreign Secretary has had a number of conversations with key figures to this end, the British Office in Kabul has engaged directly with United Front leaders, and a senior diplomat, Robert Cooper, attended the Bonn Conference.

Although extensive battle damage assessment is routinely conducted after each strike, we cannot know for sure how many bombing raids may not have hit their intended targets, nor how many civilian casualties may have been caused as a result.

Hence the main eligibility criterion is to have been taken as a prisoner of war while serving with our armed forces. In addition, certain other former military personnel who were taken as prisoners of war while serving in the colonial forces, the old Indian Army, or the Burmese armed forces and who received compensation in the 1950s under UK auspices under Article 16 of the Peace Treaty with Japan are also eligible for the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".865W.5/1">The safeguards provisions of the Euratom Treaty apply to all civil material in the UK and the Euratom Safeguards Office therefore inspects all parts of the BNFL Sellafield facility where such material is located. Since 1994 these inspections have involved between 1,400 and 1,750 person days of inspection each year. Reports on Euratom Safeguards Office activities are published periodically by the European Commission, most recently in July of this year (report reference COM(2001)436 final, accessible at the website of the European Parliament&mdash;Department of Trade and Industry Explanatory Memorandum 11669&ndash;01 refers).</p>
	<p pid=".865W.5/2">In addition to ongoing Euratom Safeguards Office inspections, civil material at UK nuclear facilities is subject to the terms of the tripartite safeguards agreement between the UK, Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), under which the IAEA designates certain civil UK nuclear facilities, or parts of them, for inspection. In the period in question, the IAEA has chosen to inspect the following parts of the BNFL Sellafield facility: the THORP Fuel Receipt and Storage area, the Special Nuclear Materials Store 9, the Oxide Fuel Storage Ponds, and the THORP Plutonium Store. The number of person days of inspection effort involved in these inspections has reduced from some 290 per year in 1994 to about 190 in 2000&mdash;reflecting moves by the IAEA to focus its efforts on the facility's major plutonium storage areas. Reporting on IAEA safeguards activities is included in the IAEA's Annual Reports (accessible at the IAEA's website).</p>

	<p pid=".875W.2/1">The Transport Council met in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>. I represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/2">The main focus of the Council was on the Galileo satellite navigation project and on aviation security. I am pleased to say that on both issues the outcome was satisfactory from our point of view.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/3">On Galileo, Ministers were asked to agree to the release of funding from the Trans-European Networks (TENs) budget to enable the project to proceed to its next phase, and to agree on the management structure that the project would have. I was among Ministers to press for deferral of decisions on the project. I drew attention to the concerns which the recently issued PricewaterhouseCoopers report had raised, on public sector funding, overall cost and lack of commercial benefits. The report made clear that any decision on the joint undertaking would have funding implications, so I argued that a decision on this should not be taken while funding issues were not sufficiently clear. There was also some discussion of the details of the draft Regulation to establish the joint undertaking, but a majority of member states declined the Commission's request for a vote to agree the text. Decisions on the next phase of Galileo were deferred and no formal conclusions were agreed. The Presidency indicated that the Galileo project might be discussed further at the European Council at Laeken later this month.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/4">The Council reached political agreement on a regulation establishing a Community framework for airport security standards and monitoring. The Commission had initially insisted on arrangements to oversee member states who were operating more stringent security measures. But in response to concerns which I and others expressed about the need for freedom to respond to perceived security threats it accepted that member states should be free to apply additional measures, provided they were in accordance with Community law. This important measure should ensure that high standards are in place throughout the EU and create a safer environment for air passengers using EU airports.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/5">There was discussion of a draft directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation, on the transposition of JAR-OPS standards into EC law, and on a draft directive on the training of aviation cabin crew. No decisions were reached on the first two issues, and the Presidency concluded that no progress was possible on the third. The UK view is that provision for cabin crew training should be included in the JAR-OPS legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/6">The Council noted the difficult economic situation faced by the air transport sector. On war-risk insurance, member states wished to return to a market approach, but the industry was not ready for that yet. In the interim the Commission was prepared to continue to approve state aid measures up to end March 2002, subject to monthly reviews. Ministers also noted the need to consider urgently ways to address possible unfair competition from third country carriers; the Commission will present a proposal in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/7">The Council noted the importance of making early progress on the recent proposal for a Directive to replace the hushkits regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/8">The Council reached political agreement on the regulation to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency, which was proposed as part of the ERIKA II package of maritime safety proposals. We are content with the text as agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/9">The Council agreed the text of a Directive to simplify reporting formalities for ships leaving and entering Community ports. It was able to accept the European Parliament's position on the proposal, and therefore reached agreement at the First Reading.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/10">I and the French Minister, with support from the Commissioner, stressed the need for member states to make quick progress on ratifying the Hazardous and Noxious Substances convention and other maritime pollution compensation Conventions, as the December 2000 Council Conclusions had urged.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/11">The Council noted a Presidency progress report on the proposal to update Regulation 3820/85 on commercial drivers' hours and rest periods. Further consideration of this will pass to the Spanish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/12">I maintained the UK's opposition to the proposal to extend the fitting of speed limiting devices to goods vehicles above 3.5 tonnes and to coaches/buses with over eight passenger seats regardless of weight. I argued that we were not in favour of a threshold below 7.5 tonnes, but that an extension of European regulation to 7.5 tonnes would be in line with UK law. I expressed my doubt that the safety and environmental consequences of fitting limiters to lighter vehicles would be beneficial. The Presidency concluded that Council adopted the proposal by qualified majority. The proposal will now be considered by the European Parliament early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/13">The Council reached political agreement on a draft directive setting out initial and ongoing training requirements for professional drivers.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/14">Following the recent fires in Alpine road tunnels, the Commission reported to the Council that it would propose legislation early in 2002 to improve safety. The proposals will address issues relating to technical equipment, driver information, traffic controls and training of operational staff. We await further details of the proposals, and will need to examine them carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/15">The Presidency presented its conclusions on the Commission's White Paper on transport policy, published earlier this year. The Presidency largely agreed with the White Paper's assessment of the negative impact of uneven development of different transport modes, and believed that modal shift and enhancement of quality should be promoted. It hoped the Council would further examine the White Paper and looked forward to Commission proposals to implement the priorities emerging from further discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/16">Under Other Business, I raised the issue of the new digital tachograph and the deficiencies in the Regulation on which the specification is based. I had previously written to the Commissioner asking her to propose amendments to address these shortcomings, which would create serious enforcement difficulties. Other Ministers at the Council supported me in asking the Commission to re-examine the issue and bring forward a new proposal to amend the Regulation. I expressed my disappointment at the Commission's response, which did not address the concerns we had put forward.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/17">Finally, the German Minister spoke of the safety benefits of ensuring that rigid bull bars were not fixed to road vehicles above 2.5 tonnes, through voluntary agreements with industry. The Commission agreed that this was a useful suggestion, but stressed that it was the responsibility of the Internal Market Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.2/18">No votes were taken at this Council.</p>

	<p pid=".878W.2/1">As part of our fundamental review of the planning system, we have decided that as from today we will give reasons for our decision not to call in planning applications. This decision, which forms part of the raft of measures in our Planning Green Paper published today, is in the interests of transparency, good administration and best practice.

The Secretary of State's policy on calling in planning applications&mdash;which is to be very selective&mdash;is set out in the written reply by the then Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/774" name="Richard Caborn">my right hon.

That approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is necessary to do so. Local planning authorities are normally best placed to make decisions relating to their areas and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference.</p>

Since that announcement a contract for the project has been awarded and a steering group representing aviation and environmental interests has been formed to oversee the work, and has met once. We are also setting up a peer review group representing both national and international experts.

	<p pid=".880W.0/1">The rebate scheme for goods vehicle excise duty had two stages: a rebate of up to 50 per cent. of the cost of a licence against licences in force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-30">30 November 2000</phrase>; and a similar rebate against all licences taken out between December 2000 and November 2001.

	<p pid=".881W.5/1">Following our review of the planning system, I am today publishing a Green Paper &quot;Planning: delivering a fundamental change&quot; setting out our proposals for reform.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/2">A good planning system is vital to our quality of life. We need a system that fully engages people in shaping the future of their communities and local economies. The present planning system is too complicated, too slow and engages insufficiently with local communities. We need to make it more efficient and more accessible so that it better serves everybody with an interest in the growth and development of their community, whether individuals, businesses or representative organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/3">The Green Paper sets out our proposals for simplifying the complex hierarchy of regional, county, unitary and local plans. We propose to replace local plans with new Local Development Frameworks that will have two main components: a set of core criteria that will allow local authorities to express a vision for the future of their areas and a strategy for its delivery; and action plans for specific areas where detailed planning is required. These include, for example, neighbourhoods, villages, town centres and major development sites. We intend that action plans should be a particular focus for community participation in the planning of local areas.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/4">The Green Paper proposes a much stronger emphasis on customer service, including delivery to business. New targets for processing planning applications by local authorities will distinguish business from householder applications in order that all applicants should have a clear and realistic expectation of the speed of decision. We propose that delivery contracts should be agreed between local authorities and business for the biggest planning applications that would include an agreed timetable for reaching planning decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/5">The Green Paper proposes the introduction of business planning zones in which planning consent will not be necessary for certain businesses so long as strict quality standards are met. We propose that each region should have at least one zone to promote technology companies.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/6">The Green Paper seeks to put communities at the heart of the planning system. We propose better community participation in the preparation of our new Local Development Frameworks and action plans. A statement of community involvement will set standards for consultation on planning applications and plans. Master planning of major sites will help developers plan for higher quality development, in partnership with local people and local authorities. There will be a much clearer procedure for submitting planning applications and a new emphasis on openness and accountability within the planning process.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/7">I also propose to speed up the handling of planning applications that have been called in and appeals that have been recovered for my determination. I give reasons where applications are called in but, up to now, they have not been given when I decide not to call in an application. In the interests of greater openness I shall, from today, give reasons in both circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.5/8">Copies of the Green Paper are being sent to every Member representing an English constituency and they will be available in the Vote Office and in the Library. An electronic copy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.planning.dtlr.gov.uk">www.planning.dtlr.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".882W.5/1">A Home Office study published in 1996 showed that accidents fell by 28 per cent. and speeds were reduced by an average of 4.2 mph at speed camera sites. Eight police force areas have been trialling a new funding system for speed cameras. Monitoring of the first year's operation of the pilots has shown a 47 per cent. reduction in those killed and seriously injured at camera sites and an 18 per cent. reduction in KSIs in the areas as a whole. The new funding system is now available nationally and I fully expect that, as more areas join, the numbers of those killed or seriously injured will decrease still further.</p>

	<p pid=".883W.5/1">Following discussions with officials I announced continued funding for existing neighbourhood warden schemes in England at the annual wardens conference on <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase>. Marketing expansion and funding opportunities for wardens schemes were discussed at that conference and continue to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.5/2">There are 85 neighbourhood and 125 street warden schemes covering each of the government regions. The Government have commissioned a national evaluation of the neighbourhood warden programme which is due for completion by mid 2003. The evaluation is intended to provide an assessment of scheme impacts and to understand the processes of scheme implementation. It is not possible to consider each and every scheme in the same detail but care is taken to ensure that all regions receive roughly equal coverage that enables a picture of national-level impact to be established. In addition, schemes are encouraged to undertake local-level evaluations appropriate to their needs. Street warden schemes in England have yet to start and will be subject to a similarly rigorous evaluation process.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.5/3">Government funding for neighbourhood wardens is &pound;5 million for 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;4.5 million for 2002&ndash;03. For street wardens the figures are &pound;5 million and &pound;10 million respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".883W.5/4">The continuation of funding for existing and future warden schemes will depend on the outcome of the 2002 Spending Review and at this stage it is too early to make applications for new schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".884W.2/1">A UK cost-benefit assessment carried out in September for my Department and the British National Space Centre by ESYS Consulting suggested that Galileo could yield net economic benefits for UK users and suppliers, based on European Commission studies and discussions with potential UK users. However, the recent study for the Commission by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), released on <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase>, excludes supplier benefits and estimates a much reduced and narrower range of benefits for transport users than previous Commission estimates. The report also made clear that there would be a need for continuing public sector funding throughout future phases of the project. On Friday the Transport Council deferred decisions on the next stage of Galileo in order to allow time for further consideration of the PWC report.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.3/2">Many Customs and Excise activities play an important part in countering fraud, including tax control work, debt collection and publicity. However, since <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> the Department's restructured Law Enforcement function has had prime responsibility for tackling indirect tax fraud, drugs smuggling and the range of other criminal matters assigned to Customs and Excise. Many Customs Law Enforcement officers have a multi-functional role, tackling both tax fraud and non-tax criminality.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.3/3">Because of restructuring, it is not possible to provide equivalent figures for earlier years, but in 2001&ndash;02 the Law Enforcement function of Customs and Excise has a budget of some &pound;320 million current, and &pound;40 million capital. The Customs and Excise voted departmental expenditure limit (as amended by the recent Winter Supplementary) is &pound;1,122 million.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.2/1">The Government have approved a wide- ranging programme of work in response to the review. Details will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/2">HM Land Registry is committed to providing the world's best service for guaranteeing ownership of land, and for facilitating property-related transactions. As a fourth time Charter Mark winner, the Land Registry already delivers excellent service to its customers. Further improvement to its internal operations recommended by the review are being pursued vigorously. By bringing forward this wider work programme, the Land Registry can, with the help of other Government Departments and stakeholders, develop innovative and customer-focused services for an even better service.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/3">The main elements of the wider programme, much of which depends on the Land Registration Bill introduced in July, are to:</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/4" class="indent">develop and promote electronic conveyancing services, including the National Land Information Service;</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/5" class="indent">expand the geographic coverage and content of the land register;</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/6" class="indent">explore ways in which the land register can contribute to making the property markets more efficient and more transparent;</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/7" class="indent">consider the business case for providing further advisory services relating to land registration by 2003; and</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/8" class="indent">launch a new independent adjudication service for land registration disputes in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/9">Those elements of the programme which are for the Land Registry to take forward will be delivered through a new 10-year strategic plan which I shall publish in the spring.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/10">I and ministerial colleagues in other Departments with responsibility for land and property markets will monitor the delivery of the programme closely. We will also review the arrangements for consultation across and between Government and those involved in these markets.</p>

	<p pid=".916W.2/1">Our overall aim is to help promote peace, stability and economic and social development. The UK's bilateral inputs are designed in the broader context of the overall international effort. We work increasingly through World Bank and European Commission channels. The objectives for the UK programme are to support the middle east peace process through capacity building and institutional development for the Palestinian Authority; and to help meet basic human needs, through delivery of health and education services.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.2/2">Poverty in the west bank and Gaza Strip has increased during the current crisis. Estimates suggest that the poverty rate has risen during this period from 21 per cent. to 35 per cent. The Palestinian economy shrank by 8.2 per cent. in 2000, while unemployment has risen sharply from a low of 10 per cent. in September 2000 to current levels of over 28 per cent. We have allocated additional resources to deal with the current emergency. We are targeting areas known to be major causes of poverty including unemployment, and lack of access to basic services and water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid=".916W.2/3">In 2001&ndash;02, we have increased our bilateral allocation from &pound;8 million to &pound;14 million. In addition, we have contributed &pound;25 million this calendar year to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) for education, health, relief and social services to Palestinian refugees in the west bank and Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.3/17">The agency, in accordance with its enforcement policy, has investigated the breach of the emissions limit that occurred at the stack from kilns 5 and 6 on 14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2001-02-15">15 February 2001</phrase> and a warning letter has been issued to Castle Cement. Over the period to August 2001, I understand that the company undertook its own exploration of emissions from the stack, including sampling. Following the February breach, the agency commissioned work modelling the likely fate of dioxins in the environment and the human food chain. This concluded that even under the worst conditions, individuals in the community exposed to the levels found during the breach of the limit would be most unlikely to exceed the World Health Organisation guideline intake. However, the agency will not accept any re-occurrence of the elevated levels found in February 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".919W.5/2">Under EU rules the UK is not obliged to inform other member states of any national review programme of pesticide products undertaken to address national issues. However, all member states and the Commission were informed of the UK programme to review organophosphate compounds which included carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos. In addition, all are automatically informed of any new product approvals and revocations. The separate European programme intends to review all active substances used in plant protection products within the community and all member states and the Commission are involved in this decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.5/3">The approval holders for carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos chose not to submit supporting data for their products under the UK review and therefore these products will not be available in the UK after <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase>. Under the European review programme carbofuran has been supported so far although its continued use will depend upon the assessment of the data submitted. Chlorfenvinphos has not been supported. The impact of the European regime will not be felt until 2003 when all the compounds not supported by companies anticipating extensive data requirements will be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.5/4">Member states, can however, carry out their own review exercises and carry them out at different times to the European review. In this case, the UK organophosphate review was introduced to address public concerns about the safety of these compounds and we have acted in a consistent manner to revoke their use where appropriate. However, the impact of the loss of these products is not underestimated and officials will continue to do everything possible to help the trade and user groups.</p>

It can affect many communities from a variety of cultural backgrounds and continents, not just Muslims. All major world religions condemn forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase>, the Government announced their action plan to tackle the problem, including measures to support victims, in response to the report of the Working Group on forced Marriage &quot;A Choice by Right&quot; published last year.

Catering departments prepare multi-choice menus, which meet the needs of the establishment's population and enable pre-selection to take place. All prisons must comply with all food safety legislation and must have regard to particular dietary and religious needs. The Prison Service Catering Manual, which is published as a Prison Service Order, provides full guidance for catering staff on hygiene and food safety, nutritional requirements, diets for special groups, food quality and quality control, and customer surveys. Its requirements apply to both Prison Service and contractually managed establishments.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.0/1">Chorley and South Ribble accident and emergency department plays a central role in the current services and will continue to do so. Figures for the number of accident and emergency cases taken to Chorley and Preston are based on the accident and emergency information system, which was introduced in 1997&ndash;98. Comparable earlier data are not available:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/4"> <th><i> </i></th> <th><i>1997&ndash;98</i></th> <th><i>1998&ndash;99</i></th> <th><i>1999&ndash;2000</i></th> <th><i>2000&ndash;01</i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/7"> <td>All ambulance patients</td> <td>4,046</td> <td>5,840</td> <td>6,491</td> <td>7,097</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/8"> <td>All ambulance patients admitted to Chorley</td> <td>1,544</td> <td>2,576</td> <td>2,812</td> <td>3,303</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/9"> <td>All Chorley ambulance patients admitted to Preston</td> <td>169</td> <td>239</td> <td>277</td> <td>291</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/10"> <td>Total A&amp;E patients transferred to Preston</td> <td>760</td> <td>1,339</td> <td>1,415</td> <td>1,472</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".926W.0/13">The unification of the accident and emergency department for Chorley and Preston has brought many enhancements to service levels and an increase in activity, as shown in the tables. The rotation of consultants and their junior colleagues between the two sites has enabled medical staff to gain the relevant experience at both locations to provide comprehensive, quality health care. This has led, specifically at Chorley, to more consultants working on the hospital site and, at the same time, to an increase in the number of middle grade doctors working over the 24-hour period.The accident and emergency service for Central Lancashire, which is provided on both sites, already has an excellent record of recruiting staff for the department. It is, for example, one of the few units in the north-west with a full complement of nursing staff.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.0/14">Chorley and South Ribble accident and emergency department was redeveloped and expanded in August 1996. The link with Preston has secured the future of this service, so that the population of Chorley and South Ribble will continue to enjoy access to two accident and emergency departments, at Chorley and Preston. Based on existing guidelines, and through its partnership arrangements, Chorley and South Ribble district general hospital has the capacity to provide 24-hour A&amp;E cover in all clinical situations.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.0/15">Total attendances at Chorley accident and emergency in each of the last five years were as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/18"> <th><i></i></th> <th><i>Number</i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/21"> <td>1996&ndash;97</td> <td>42,600</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/22"> <td>1997&ndash;98</td> <td>45,620</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/23"> <td>1998&ndash;99</td> <td>46,670</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/24"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>48,481</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".926W.0/25"> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>48,504</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".926W.0/28">The Boards of Chorley and South Ribble NHS Trust and Preston acute hospitals national health service trust made it clear that Chorley will continue to provide 24-hour emergency services. The Chorley and South Ribble primary care trust supports that plan. In addition, Chorley and South Ribble district general hospital will continue to play a major role in the provision of orthopaedic services for Central Lancashire.</p>

	<p pid=".930W.2/1">The most recently published study by the Food Standards Agency showed that exposures of United Kingdom consumers to aluminium from the typical diet in the UK were well within the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) established for aluminium in 1989 by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, even for those eating above-average amounts of food. Although general exposures from the diet are low, the Food Standards Agency currently has four research projects to test if there is migration of aluminium into food from, respectively, glazed ceramic ware, paper and board, kitchen ware and glass.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.2/2">Aluminium in drinking-water is a minor contributor to oral intakes of aluminium in UK consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.2/3">A wide range of types of research contributes to scientific understanding of the effects of aluminium in humans. There is no comprehensive national or international database of current research on aluminium. The most relevant studies listed in the National Research Register concern the role of aluminium in dementia, clinico-pathological correlates of dementia in Down's syndrome (including aluminium absorption), possible protective effects of selenium and magnesium on the toxicity of aluminium, and a clinical trial of immunotherapy with aluminium hydroxide. The National Research Register is a database of on-going and recently completed research projects funded by, or of interest to, the United Kingdom's national health service, and is available at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/research/nrr.htm">http://www.doh.gov.uk/research/nrr.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".930W.2/4">In addition, the Department and the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly health authority are funding continuing studies of health outcomes in relation to the Lowermoor water pollution incident of 1988, in which the principal pollutant was aluminium sulphate at very high concentrations.</p>

The hospital trusts that provided the treatment are given in list 1, the health authorities that purchased treatment from within their own area in list 2, and those that purchased treatment from outside their area in list 3. An appraisal of the use of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of AMD, which is being conducted by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), should be completed in July 2002 provided there are no appeals. NICE's guidance will provide for a consistent approach to the purchasing of the treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".935W.5/1">The provision of services for transsexuals has to be very comprehensive as most will require specialist counselling and psychotherapy before surgery takes place, and appropriate care afterwards. The Department does not produce care protocols for treatments, as these are clinical issues and are best left to the professional bodies. The Royal College of Psychiatry has already produced guidelines on child and adolescent gender identity services, and is planning to produce clinical guidelines for adults in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.5/2">Decisions on the types of services that should be delivered to meet the needs of a population have to be taken on the front line by the local heath commissioners. It is their responsibility to be aware of the needs of the population and in deciding what services to provide they should take account of resources. However, there should be no blanket ban on the provision of any service and each case should be considered on its merits. Whatever care is being given, all patients are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect for their individual needs.</p>

	<p pid=".936W.11/2">The Children and Young Persons Act 1933, as amended, allows local authorities to introduce byelaws with respect to the employment of children. Such byelaws may prohibit the employment of children in any specified occupation. Local authority byelaws do prohibit children below the minimum school leaving age from working in commercial kitchens and may deem fish and chip shops to come into this category. It would be for individual local authorities to provide a definition of a commercial kitchen in relation to their own byelaws.</p>

	<p pid=".937W.2/1">The Department does not run any competitive grant schemes aimed specifically at tackling social exclusion. However, most of what the Department does has great potential to tackle social exclusion by improving health and wellbeing. The Department, through the section 64 general scheme, makes grants to voluntary organisations working in health and social care to tackle health issues which in, for example, reducing health inequalities and reaching disadvantaged groups, assist in tackling social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.2/2">The section 64 general scheme is primarily aimed at national voluntary organisations although local projects of national significance can be funded. The degree to which individual section 64 grants tackle social exclusion would be impossible to calculate. Project, core and capital funding is available. Information is not available on the administrative costs of the scheme. A copy of the latest section 64 application form has been placed in the Library. Information on the number of applications received, approved and their total value for 1996&ndash;97 to 2000&ndash;01 was in the reply given by the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" name="John Hutton">my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase> to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1205" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-25">25 July 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2000-07-25.501W"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 501&ndash;02W</phrase>. Information on individual grants in payment is routinely displayed on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/sect64/grants">www.doh.gov.uk/sect64/grants</a>. Information on grants in payment for 2000&ndash;01 is currently being amended and will shortly be displayed on the website.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.2/3">The Department also funds the Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme. Under this scheme we make funds available to 17 national agents (voluntary organisations) to enable them to support local projects involving volunteers in health and social care related activities. A number of these national agents deal with vulnerable groups and a particular focus of the scheme is to provide opportunities for unemployed people to undertake voluntary work.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.2/4">The 17 national agents deal with applications direct from local projects. Administration costs for applicants are not known but the national agents receive approximately &pound;530,000 per annum to cover administration and project support costs.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.2/5">In 2000&ndash;01 some 487 projects were funded. A copy of the scheme's general notes of guidance 2000&ndash;03, which sets out the basic principles of the scheme and the types of applications considered by the 17 national agents, and the Annual Review 2000&ndash;01, which provides details of the funded projects, have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".938W.6/1">There is no specific central guidance issued on the purchase of car fleets. However, Government Departments have to be satisfied that they are achieving value for money and that they comply with European Union regulations on public procurement.</p>
	<p pid=".938W.6/2">The purchase or hire of cars and other vehicles is subject to the Suppliers Directive (93/36/EC as last amended by Directive 97/52/EC). Together with the relevant Remedies Directive (89/665/EEC) the Suppliers Directive has been given effect in the UK by the Public Supply Contract Regulations (SI.1995/201, last amended by SI.2000/2009). Compliance with these Regulations will also fulfil the purchaser's obligations towards suppliers from third countries pursuant to the EEA Treaty, various Europe Agreements and the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. The current threshold is &pound;93,896 and there are rules that require recurrent purchasers to be considered in aggregate over a governed period for the purpose of applying the threshold. Government Departments and other public bodies are responsible for complying with the regulations. The commission will follow up complaints of non-compliance with the member state concerned and may initiate proceedings under Article 226/EC. In the UK interested suppliers harmed or at risk of harm from the breach of the rules can seek interim or final remedies in the High Court (Court of Session in Scotland) which may lead to an interim or final injunction or the award of damages.</p>

	<p pid=".940W.2/1">The Cabinet Office does not have a specific break-even performance target, as it does not on the whole charge for its services apart from the administration and management of civil service pensions and for some of the activities delivered by Centre for Management and Policy Studies.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/2">However the Government Car and Despatch Agency (GCDA), which is an executive agency of the Cabinet Office, and the Central Office of Information (COI), which is an executive agency and separate Government Department reporting to the Deputy Prime Minister, both have a key performance target to break-even on an accruals basis.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/3">The GCDA met its break-even target for the financial year 2000&ndash;01. This was reported in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year 2000&ndash;01, which were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-17">17 July 2001</phrase>. At this stage, it is on course to meet its target in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/4">Central Office of Information (COI) met its break-even target for the financial year 2000&ndash;01. This was reported in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year 2000&ndash;01, which were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">20 July 2001</phrase>. It is on course to meet its target for 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/5">The Department is on course to deliver its agreed public service agreement targets, as detailed in the Cabinet Office's Departmental Report 2001, copies of which are in the Libraries of the House.</p>
