	<p pid=".873W.2/1">The Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement includes flexibilities which should enable developing countries in Africa and elsewhere to protect their public health in situations of crisis or national emergency. Until now, a lack of clarity around these flexibilities had been a source of concern.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.2/4">There is of course more to improving access to medicines in developing countries than global patent rules. The World Health Organisation recognises four key factors. These include sustainable financing, affordable pricing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs. My Department remains committed to working with our developing country partners and other international organisations to address all these issues, which are particularly pertinent in Africa. To this end we have pledged US$200 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria; set up a Working Group on Access to Medicines to look at options on differential pricing and increasing research and development; and committed over &pound;1 billion since 1997 to help developing countries put in place effective health care systems.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.2/1">Given Turkey's relative wealth and development we do not have a bilateral development assistance programme. We did provide Turkey with over &pound;1.4 million in response to the 1999 earthquake disasters, in the form of tents, medical supplies, blankets and a variety of other humanitarian assistance. Turkey also receives substantial assistance from the EU MEDA programme and through the international financial institutions to which DFID is a major contributor. Our share of EC commitments to Turkey during the last three years has been over &pound;50 million.</p>

	<p pid=".896W.2/2">Leicester Braunstone is one of the New Deal for Community Round 1 Pathfinders and has an overall grant of &pound;49.5 million to spend over up to 10 years.</p>

The review considered among other things the strategic direction and delivery of the programme, including progress in delivering the Braunstone Community Association 2001&ndash;02 Action Plan, developments in partnership working and community involvement.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.2/4">Proceedings, which were chaired by an official from the Government Office for the East Midlands, were conducted in a positive atmosphere. Nothing substantive arose during the review to change the status of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.2/5">The next few weeks will be very important for the Braunstone New Deal for Communities Programme as the BCA awaits the findings of an independent investigation it set up to look into various allegations related to its internal relationships. That investigation is expected to report by mid-December.</p>
	<p pid=".896W.2/6">In the meantime, in order to protect the public purse the Government office for the East Midlands has suspended delegated authorities to the BCA to commit expenditure. The Government office is also discussing with auditors the terms of reference for a mid-year audit of the NDC Programme (to end September), which, with evidence arising from the findings of the independent investigation, will allow the Government office what further steps it needs to take in order to secure the future of the Braunstone NDC Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.5/1">There is no standing EU rapid reaction force. An EU-led crisis management operation would take place only where NATO as a whole is not engaged. The decision to proceed on a particular operation would be taken on a case by case basis, but the types of operation the EU might undertake could include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. These are commonly known as the Petersberg Tasks. The European Security and Defence Policy does not cover war-fighting operations.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence does not monitor the number of rough sleepers. However, MOD has been working in partnership with the Rough Sleeper's Unit (RSU) to put in place preventive measures to reduce the ex-service component of rough sleeping, against the target of making an overall reduction in rough sleeping of at least two-thirds by 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.8/2">The Social Exclusion Unit Report published in December 1999 highlighted that between a quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the armed forces at some stage, predominantly as national service men. Since then the RSU in partnership with the MOD has set up schemes to help those vulnerable to rough sleeping, before, at the point of and after discharge.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.8/3">Figures published in August by the RSU showed that as of June 2001 there had been a 62 per cent. reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.8/4">But we are not complacent. As part of the Government's Veterans' Initiative we are looking at improvements to resettlement arrangements for the vulnerable groups from which rough sleepers are most likely to come.</p>

The next report is due to be presented at the December Ministerials, with the HLSG's final report at the Prague Summit next year.</p>

For example, a number of seminars were held with learning providers in 2000, prior to the introduction of the national framework for individual learning accounts, and these continued into 2001. At these events providers expressed a wide range of opinions. In September 2000 James O'Brien, Managing Director, Pitman Training, wrote to Ministers to express concern that the programme was open to abuse but that the cap on public support for each individual's ILA account introduced to help control such abuse had been set at too low a level. We have not yet been able to trace any earlier correspondence on the specific topic of potential abuse of the ILA scheme.</p>

The first reports were published in March this year and the next report is due for publication early in 2002. The quantitative analysis which is being carried out compares performance in the areas where we are piloting EMAs against &quot;control areas&quot; where EMA is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.2/2">Early findings from the evaluation show that EMA appears to have raised participation in education. The statistical analysis estimates an average gain in participation in pilot areas compared to control areas, among EMA eligible young people, of around five percentage points.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.2/3">Although we do not yet have figures on attainment, the qualitative aspect of the evaluation has found some evidence of a positive effect on young people's performance and commitment to study.</p>

	<p pid=".929W.5/1">The Government are committed in the 10-year Plan for Transport to tackling the maintenance backlog for local authority roads, bridges and street lighting. Over &pound;30 billion is being provided for local road maintenance over the next 10 years, an extra &pound;9 billion (27 per cent. in real terms) above the funding levels in the previous 10 years. Capital expenditure on maintenance, which is used to tackle deterioration, will increase by nearly &pound;7 billion over the 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.5/2">Funding for the maintenance and renewal of street lighting is currently made through the Highways Maintenance Standard Spending Assessment element of Revenue Support Grant. No specific provision has been made in the 2002&ndash;03 capital maintenance settlement for renewal of street lighting. The first priority in the 10-Year Plan is to halt the deterioration in carriageways and footways and to continue the bridge strengthening programme. Additional provision for street lighting renewal may be made through the LTP system in later years. For the present, authorities have discretion over the funding provided for maintenance and smaller integrated transport schemes and may use this to fund capital works on street lighting where this is a local priority.</p>
	<p pid=".929W.5/3">DTLR is aware that street lighting columns in a number of authorities are failing structurally, but does not have sufficient information to determine the number of columns that are unsafe. Local authorities have agreed with DTLR that a national condition survey for street lighting should be introduced, and that information from this should be used to compile a national inventory. In future years the inventory could be used to target funding for tackling the street lighting backlog.</p>

	<p pid=".943W.0/1">The concept of a hierarchy was considered as part of the Speed Review and the Government's Road Safety Strategy, both published last year.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/2">The Transport Act 2000 committed the Government to consider the development of a rural road hierarchy for speed management purposes. Following Royal Assent the DTLR set up a Working Group of professionals and the main interest groups. The Group has prepared a thorough report that raises some interesting points and recommendations. As required by the Act, the Secretary of State has today laid copies of this report before each of the Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/3">I commend the Working Group for the excellent job they have done in identifying the benefits of a hierarchy. I am also grateful for their frank assessment that currently, if it were developed as a system of different speed limits, a hierarchy would be costly both financially and in terms of environmental intrusion. Also, given the necessary infrastructure and behavioural changes required, the road safety and quality of life benefits could take too long to realise.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/4">I am grateful to the Group for identifying the clear links between the development of a hierarchy and several other Road Safety Strategy initiatives. Above all, I agree that the DTLR's assessment framework would be the best place to carry out the work to determine criteria for assigning roads within the hierarchy. As such, I fully accept their recommendation to incorporate the speed limit setting element of the hierarchy within the development of the assessment framework.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/5">They rightly identify the signing issues as a big obstacle to progressing the hierarchy as they have proposed it. The DTLR will shortly be commencing work on the Road Safety Strategy commitment to review speed limit signing regimes. I have instructed officials to consider the signing elements of the hierarchy report as part of this work.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/6">The Group recognised the need for traffic calming measures to support speed limits in order to achieve changes in vehicle speeds. The forthcoming DTLR project to develop practical speed management measures on rural roads will be the best vehicle for testing such traffic calming treatments.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/7">Of course, there are innovative measures that have already been tried by my Department, like vehicle activated signs, that will in future be more widely applied where suitable. Detailed guidance on the use of vehicle activated signs will be produced next year.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/8">Both the Working Group and the Speed Review identified the need for more information before we can properly assess the case for lower rural speed limits. I am therefore committing the DTLR to undertake a survey of vehicle speeds on a representative sample of rural roads to ensure that decisions are evidence based.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.0/9">With the package of measures I have outlined here, and those in the Road Safety Strategy, I am convinced that we will be able to build on this report and deliver real benefits to those who live, work and travel in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.2/1">Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) will involve the public, private, community and voluntary sectors to ensure that initiatives and services work together locally. LSPs will devise and implement community strategies and local neighbourhood renewal strategies, which will improve the delivery of local services generally, with a specific focus on deprived areas. These strategies should build on information from local people on what they need and want, rather than working from the top down. The statutory guidance, Preparing Community Strategies, refers to an analysis of needs which should be carried out by the various partners on the LSP. Considerable background information will already exist.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/2">LSPs must include local people, especially those from deprived neighbourhoods and from excluded groups, such as black and minority ethnic groups and older people. LSPs will need to provide them with training and support so they can be fully involved from the start. The Government have established the Community Empowerment Fund, which will provide &pound;36 million over the next 3 years to create 'Community Networks' in the 88 most deprived English areas. In each area, CEF moneys will be given direct to a local voluntary organisation chosen by the regional Government Office. This 'lead organisation' will form a Community Network to ensure a high level of community representation on the LSP.</p>

	<p pid=".947W.5/1">The Social Exclusion Unit published a report on rough sleeping in July 1998 in which the Prime Minister set the tough target of reducing the number of people sleeping rough in England to as near to zero as possible and by at least two thirds by 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/2">The Rough Sleepers Unit (RSU) was subsequently set up to deliver the Prime Minister's target and published it's strategy &quot;Coming in from the Cold&quot;, in December 1999, which outlined a raft of new policies and services:</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/3" class="indent">helping people sleeping rough on the streets with drug, alcohol and mental health problems;</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/4" class="indent">helping former rough sleepers rebuild their lives through education, training and employment; and</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/5" class="indent">preventing a new generation of rough sleepers particularly those leaving care, the armed forces and prison.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/6">The RSU published it's second Progress Report in summer 2001 which shows the significant impact the 'Coming in from the Cold' strategy has made.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/7">In 1998, there were approximately 1,850 people rough sleeping in England. In June 2001, published figures indicated that approximately 703 people were sleeping rough, (357 in London, and 346 outside of London). This represents a 62 per cent. reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/8">The Rough Sleepers Unit is currently carrying out research and consulting with organisations and individuals that impact on the strategy, with a view to developing a future strategy that will keep the number of rough sleepers as near to zero as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".947W.8/1">I have today made a direction that all safety reports provided under the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 should be excluded from the public registers maintained by the Competent Authority, that is the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.8/2">This is a sensible precautionary step taken on security grounds in the light of the current situation following the tragic events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase>. It is a temporary measure which will give time for sensitive information to be removed from existing safety reports, and the amended reports restored to the public register.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.8/3">Hazardous facilities, with the potential for causing major off-site accidents are registered with the HSE, the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, under the COMAH Regulations. These include major chemical works, petrochemical and gas installations and high quantity users of flammable/ explosive/toxic substances (e.g. chlorine at water treatment works).</p>
	<p pid=".947W.8/4">The 430 most hazardous (&quot;top-tier&quot;) sites have to prepare a detailed safety report describing the hazards presented and safety precautions taken. The regulations require safety reports for top-tier sites to be placed on public registers. The registers are maintained by Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency</p>
	<p pid=".947W.8/5">At present only a small number of the safety cases are on the public register. The remainder would have been put on over the next few months. The Direction will enable security sensitive information to be identified and a second, more targeted Direction to be considered. This would allow the amended reports to be placed in the public arena.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.8/6">It is important to note that the action on removing safety reports would not affect the arrangements in place to give the public vital safety instructions on such sites. People who are liable to be affected by an accident at a COMAH site are given specified information about the establishment, the major accident hazards and the safety measures that are in place. It is the site operator who has to provide this information independent of the safety report. This will ensure that the emergency services and the public know how to react in the event of an accident.</p>

The proportion of arrestees falling within this category for the financial year 1999&ndash;2000 was 15 per cent. This will provide an interim baseline against which progress can be tracked. A summary of full baseline data will be available in the spring of 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".955W.12/1">This public service agreement target reflects the Government's youth justice pledge to halve the average time taken to deal with a persistent young offender from arrest to sentence, from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days. The target has now been met for three consecutive months; i.e. the latest figure, for August is 66 days. This has been achieved through effective partnership working in the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid=".961W.5/1">I am publishing the strategy today. Copies have been placed in the Vote Office and the Library and sent to the members of the Standing Committee currently considering the Proceeds of Crime Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/2">The Asset Recovery Strategy is the first United Kingdom-wide initiative of its kind, in which the law enforcement, prosecution and relevant Government bodies have joined together to commit themselves to making financial investigation and asset recovery a higher priority.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/3">The strategy's aims are:</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/4" class="indent">To make greater use of the investigation of criminal assets in the fight against crime;</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/5" class="indent">To recover money that has been made from crime or which is intended for use in crime;</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/6" class="indent">To prevent criminals and their associates from laundering the proceeds of criminal conduct, and to detect and penalise such laundering where it occurs; and</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/7" class="indent">To use the proceeds recovered for the benefit of the community.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/8">The strategy sets out our objectives for meeting the challenging financial investigation target of recovering &pound;60 million in confiscation and forfeiture receipts during the 2004&ndash;05 financial year. Hitting this target would achieve the Government's commitment of doubling amounts recovered from drug traffickers and other major criminals by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/9">It is not acceptable that people should enjoy the proceeds of criminal activity and live a life of luxury when it is built on the misery of victims or activities which damage or exploit society.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/10">The strategy I am publishing today sets out how we propose to push forward recovering criminal assets with partners both inside and outside Government. Alongside the Proceeds of Crime Bill the strategy will help take the profit out of crime and dismantle and disrupt criminal enterprises.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.5/11">The strategy will be updated with further targets when the Bill is implemented and the new Assets Recovery Agency is established.</p>

We have no comparable figure for the south-west at this time.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/2">The west country enjoyed an Indian summer, which has extended the tourist season. This is helping to alleviate the loss of business due to the foot and mouth outbreak.

Completion is expected by April 2002. Two of the main road and rail corridors pass through east Devon. Comments have recently been sought from stakeholders and the public on a provisional strategy which addresses both existing and future problems.

	<p pid=".966W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has from time to time received representations about the accountability of the lottery distributors and their application processes. The accounting officer of a lottery distributor is accountable to both the Department's Permanent Secretary and to Parliament for the proper and prudent expenditure of funds, and distributors' activities are subject to external audit by the National Audit Office. As lottery proceeds allocated to distributors are public money, the general principles of Government Accounting must be applied in the design and implementation of systems for the distribution of that money.</p>

The increase in the resource element of the DEL arises from speeding up the reform of the CPS to allow it to contribute fully to criminal justice targets and implementation of section 37 of the Vehicles (Crime) Reduction Act 2001. The decrease results from a transfer of &pound;83,000 for work taken over by the Insolvency Service under section 218 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from an increase of &pound;1,750,000 to fund the introduction of joint CPS/police criminal justice and trial units and &pound;300,000 to fund the provision of digital certificates for the secure transmission of case information.</p>

	<p pid=".973W.3/24">The increases will be partly offset by an allocation of &pound;22,000,000 from the Criminal Justice System reserve, an allocation of &pound;250,000 from the Civil Service Modernisation Fund, a transfer of &pound;105,000 from the Home Office, an allocation of &pound;300,000 from the Capital Modernisation Fund, the draw down of &pound;1,750,000 of the Attorney-General's Department's capital Departmental Unallocated Provision and the surrender of &pound;99,000 of the Attorney-General's Department's capital end-year flexibility of &pound;4,406,000 as set out in Table 6 of the Public Expenditure 2000&ndash;01 Outturn White Paper Cm 5243 published July 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".973W.3/25">The remainder of the expenditure will be charged to the Reserve and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.8/1">Cleft lip and palate services are one element in a wider discussion around tertiary children's services in the North West and we want to ensure that the very best integrated paediatric care is provided.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.8/2">The Department's North West Regional Office produced a commissioning framework for cleft lip and palate services. A cleft review panel, which comprised local clinicians, commissioners, regional office representatives and national experts in cleft care including the chief executive of the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA), met in June 2001 to review presentations from both tertiary paediatric trusts&mdash;Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital Trust and Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals Trust. Discussions are taking place between the two trusts to reach agreement on the best configuration of cleft services for the north west and it is anticipated that a proposal will go to public consultation in January 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".978W.9/1">The Department has issued no specific guidance on the provision of care to transsexuals. Like all other services, decisions about whether gender reassignment surgery should be funded under the national health service, are made by individual health authorities, who must take account of the wider picture in terms of local priorities and circumstances when determining how resources are spent. Each case must be decided on its own merits.</p>

	<p pid=".978W.12/2">We are committed to ensuring that national health service dentistry is available to all who want it through registration with an NHS dentist. In supporting this commitment the Government have invested over &pound;100 million in the last two years. This includes a scheme that spends about &pound;20 million per annum on rewarding dentists with a significant NHS commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.12/3">Registration can play an important role in promoting oral health through strengthening the relationship between patient and dentist. However many people do not visit a dentist regularly. Systems are now in place for NHS Direct to advise patients in all parts of the country on where they can find a NHS dentist, within locally defined time and distance standards.</p>

These studies were commissioned in 1996 by the Department as part of a three-year research programme. Because of the unavailability of the pneumococcal vaccines it was not possible to begin these studies until 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".981W.2/2">The key question being addressed in these studies is how the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine performs under the two, three, four-month UK programme, in particular assessing whether a booster dose, or all three primary immunisations, are necessary. Information on potential catch-up immunisation schedules in older age groups is also being sought. The final results for these trials are expected to be available in early 2003. The effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the presence of bacteria naturally occurring in the population (carriage) will also be studied.</p>

Commissioners and providers should share information about services that may no longer be needed, or may be about to be withdrawn. In all cases, the aim must be to minimise the impact on the patient or service user. Care homes closing at short notice can be particularly distressing for the residents of those homes. If services have to be withdrawn, commissioners and providers should seek to achieve this in a planned way.</p>

	<p pid=".983W.2/2">From April 2002 the independent National Care Standards Commission will regulate, inspect and register social and health care services previously regulated by local councils and health authorities. In doing so the commission will apply comprehensive new national minimum standards for all care homes. The standards for older people's care homes were published in March and provide for homes to have a specified complaints procedure and to provide information to service users on how to refer a complaint to the commission.</p>
	<p pid=".983W.2/3">The Department is also piloting care direct in six councils in the south west. This new service is designed to provide help and advice for all older people, their relatives and carers about social care, health, housing and social security benefits. We plan to extend care direct to cover the whole of England by 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.3/2">The increase is the net effect of the addition of the FSA's End Year Flexibility (EYF) entitlement. Delays in appointing external Board Members meant that the overall FSA strategy, and hence certain projects, were also delayed. This amounts to &pound;6,637,000 programme and &pound;2,867,000 administration costs. Additionally, transfers from Scotland (&pound;783,000) and Wales (&pound;609,000) are needed to cover the estimated fall in Meat Hygiene Service income in these countries resulting from the revised charging methodology recommended in the Maclean report. A transfer of &pound;15,000 administration costs from the Department of Health is needed as contribution towards the cost of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. Finally, the FSA's EYF capital entitlement needs to be incorporated. The move of the FSA to a new office in central London was later than anticipated, caused by building delays.

From the Capital Modernisation Fund &pound;50,000,000 to support the NHS capital programme and a reallocation from resource DEL of &pound;4,852,000 and a transfer from the Scottish Executive of &pound;50,000 for a contribution to non-departmental public bodies.</p>

We have no objection to agreements to promote this trade to benefit the Iraqi people, provided that such agreements neither breach UN controls, for example by promoting the export from Iraq of goods other than crude oil, nor contribute to the Iraqi regime's aim to engineer the lifting of UN controls without having to meet its international obligations, particularly on disarmament.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.9/1">The Government have now considered the recommendations made by the Review Team in its second and final report.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/2">The report focuses primarily on arrangements for managing public sector civil nuclear liabilities on a more open, transparent, efficient and sustainable basis and on UKAEA's place within any new arrangements which might be put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/3">The conclusions we have reached are set out in the statement which the Secretary of State made to the House earlier today in which she announced the Government's intention to put a sharper focus on nuclear clean-up by setting up a new Liabilities Management Authority responsible for providing the strong strategic control and direction which is essential; developing a supply base capable of sustaining the clean-up programme over the long term; and enhancing safety and environmental performance while securing management efficiencies and best value for money. Working with the LMA, UKAEA will have a key role to play in delivering these objectives in relation to the liabilities for which it is currently responsible, building and improving on what it has achieved to date.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/4">In relation to UKAEA's other activities the report recommends that:</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/5" class="indent">UKAEA, in conjunction with the other public sector bodies on the site, should evaluate options for the future development of Harwell as a basis for decisions on a long term strategy for the development of the site as a whole;</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/6" class="indent">the UKAEA Constabulary should be established as a stand-alone force employed by a statutory Police Authority;</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/7" class="indent">UKAEA should retain responsibility for managing the UK's fusion capability and for operating the JET (joint European torus) research facility at Culham under contract to the European Commission but that a Fusion Advisory Board should be established to give fusion a more distinctive identity within the UKAEA, bring a broader perspective to its thinking on fusion strategy and drive forward action on science and industry out-reach;</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/8" class="indent">the Thurso pensions office should remain part of UKAEA for the foreseeable future but that options for outsourcing offering the prospect of additional work for the office should be kept under review.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/9">The Government have accepted all these recommendations. Those relating to the development of Harwell and fusion will be implemented immediately. Legislation to create an independent Constabulary and a statutory Police Authority will be brought forward at the first available opportunity. Views will be invited in due course on the precise detail of the legislative provisions involved.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/10">The Government believe that fusion power has the potential to make a real and valuable contribution to meeting energy needs in the medium term. We are therefore concerned to maintain and make best use of UK expertise in fusion research. To this end, responsibility for funding the UK fusion programme will be transferred to the Research Councils as a further means of encouraging integration with the wider science base and ensuring continuity in the UK's research capability in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".992W.9/11">I have arranged for copies of the QQR Team's Stage 1 and Stage 2 reports to be placed in the Libraries of the House. The reports can also be accessed via the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk">www.dti.gov.uk</a>.</p>

Under clause 8 of the Bill, these criteria are to be treated as published guidance that the Government must have regard to in making licensing decisions. As the Bill requires the Government to continue to take the criteria (which include criterion 8 on sustainable development) into account in licensing decisions, it is unnecessary to mention sustainable development on the face of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".994W.11/2">I launched the Quality Mark pilot scheme to consumers in Birmingham and Somerset in July. The Quality Mark scheme provides the public with a means of checking technical and other standards of a builder. The public response has been very encouraging. The call-centre is receiving an average of 60 calls a day and the website has had around 12,000 hits since the launch. Quality Mark companies are already starting to see positive improvements to their business. 131 builders and tradesmen have now been approved. 175 companies are in the pipeline with further numbers expected to come forward in the weeks and months ahead. We are continuing to work with leading trade bodies and other organisations to promote access to Quality Mark for their members.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.11/3">We will be commencing formal evaluation of the scheme with partners early in the new year and expect a report to be submitted to Ministers in February 2002, following which a formal decision will be made about extending Quality Mark to the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid=".1001W.5/2">The Government have ambitious plans to develop renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/3">The new Renewables Obligation, to come into effect next year, together with exemption of renewables from the climate change levy, will create a long-term market incentive for renewables which will be worth over &pound;1 billion per year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/4">The introduction of the Obligation will be underpinned by direct Government funding for renewables worth over &pound;260 million between 2001 and 2004. This will include an extensive capital grants programme for the early development of offshore wind and energy crops, the initial stage of a major photovoltaics demonstration programme and a boost for research and development.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/5">Other components of the Government's strategy to develop renewable energy include:</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/6" class="indent">honouring of contracts awarded under the earlier arrangements to support renewables, the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) Orders. In addition, we have consulted on a proposal to introduce a NFFO locational flexibility Order and we are now considering the responses made to this consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/7" class="indent">Initiation of studies of each UK region's capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. Once all these assessments are completed, it is expected that specific regional targets for renewable energy will be adopted across the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/8">The Government are also exploring the scope for upgrading the existing electricity infrastructure to enable the UK's huge renewable energy resources to be exploited to the full. I recently announced that we will be funding an initial study of the feasibility of an underwater cable to connect parts of the western seaboard of Scotland, the north west of England, Northern Ireland, western Wales and possibly the south west of England directly to the National Grid.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.3/2">The National Enterprise Campaign, now known as Enterprise Insight, is a 10-year private sector-led national campaign for enterprise. The campaign has strong support within Government and works in partnership with enterprise programme providers including Young Enterprise, Shell LiveWIRE and the Prince's Trust to promote enterprise by fostering an entrepreneurial sprit across the UK through four key initiatives: Enterprising Education; Enterprising Communities; Enterprising Media; Enterprising Business.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.3/3">The campaign has made steady progress over its first 18 months. Since the launch of the Enterprising Education Campaign in July 2001, 246 business have registered their interest in promoting enterprise within schools with a further 750 expected by 2002. The aim over the next two years is to get 40,000 more young people engaged in enterprise learning in schools and 5,000 new business people to support its delivery. This will be done through a number of activities including hosting road shows and the development of a website which will enable businesses to register their interest on-line. In addition, the Entrepreneurs in Residence scheme, which matches businesses to local enterprise projects, is also well under way&mdash;so far the first five matches have already been made. Enterprise Insight also aims to promote enterprise more positively across society and, in particular, plans to work with the media using case studies and role models to help spread more positive attitudes about entrepreneurship and business.</p>

	<p pid=".1019W.3/1">The Countryside Agency has adopted an indicator on business health. This necessitates the collection of a range of business data including business registrations and de-registrations (business registrations only include those businesses above the VAT threshold). The Countryside Agency use the number of business registrations as a proxy indicator of total business start-ups. However, in their 2001 State of the Countryside report they presented data from the Office for National Statistics on the total number of businesses, proportion of business by employee sizeband and VAT registrations and de-registrations.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.3/2">The Countryside Agency are working with the Office for National Statistics to procure accurate and up-to-date information from the Inter-Departmental Business Register for 2001. In addition they are working with the Small Business Service in looking at the broader picture of &quot;business health&quot; in England, in particular those businesses beneath the VAT threshold. For the 2002 State of the Countryside Report they will again publish data for rural areas on business start-ups as measured by registration and de-registration to give an accurate picture of business activity in the Countryside. This may be supplemented by data collected from a local research project.</p>

	<p pid=".1020W.5/1">The Countryside Agency's Rural Services Survey in 2000 researched the geographical availability of a range of services. This was the first year that a survey of this type had been undertaken at the household level across rural England. Full postcoded lists of services were used in the survey to calculate their availability to rural households within specified distances. The survey provides information on services available at a point in time. Future surveys will therefore provide a comparison with the base figures rather than reflecting the number of the openings and closings of services.</p>

The broad scope of the work has been to focus on the key influencing attributes of market towns including: size and spacing of market towns; urban/rural shift of economic activity; the economic base of market towns; and the clustering of economic activity. In addition, considerable work has gone into examining market towns in relation to the Index of Deprivation 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".1022W.6/2">Between 1967 and 1994, there were requirements to submit records of the waste deposited at the site under various waste and planning controls. This information was collected by the relevant local authorities at the time. Some of these records were passed to the Environment Agency, though full records do not exist for the complete period that the landfill site operated.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.6/3">The situation changed in 1994. Under paragraph 14 of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, operators are required to keep a record of the quantity, nature and origin of the waste disposed of at each site; and to make that information available, on request, to the Environment Agency. However, the agency must act reasonably in its use of this power. The agency would be open to legal challenge in the event of unreasonably seeking detailed information on all the substances, and the source of those substances, disposed of at the Pitsea landfill site since 1994. Nevertheless the detailed licence for the site which specifies the quantities and types of waste able to be deposited at Pitsea is available for inspection at the local Environment Agency office.

	<p pid=".1023W.2/1">The paper published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2000 recognises the potential for genetic modification to increase the quantity and quality of aquaculture products. It goes on to consider the areas of concern with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). These include possible adverse side effects on human health and the environment, trade impacts, intellectual property rights, labelling and ethics. It outlines possible solutions including the adoption of suitable legislation, codes of conduct or guidelines, and possible technical answers. The paper says that solutions will come only from addressing all sides of this complex issue. It also notes that technically there must be good scientific support with adequate testing and monitoring to reduce the uncertainties of environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.2/2">The Government note the potential of genetic modification but at this stage of development GM technology has yet to demonstrate any proven benefits in relation to aquaculture. It is feasible that the technology could be used to increase yields from fish farms or make farmed fish easier or cheaper to produce, but this is unlikely in the short term. There have been no environmental releases of GM fish in the UK and none is expected to be proposed in the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.2/3">However, the Government keep an open mind on this while making sure that suitable safety controls are in place to ensure protection for human health and the environment.</p>

	<p pid=".1025W.8/1">Our Energy Crops Scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme, makes &pound;29 million of assistance available to farmers. Applications which have been agreed or are being assessed total about 2 per cent. of this. This includes establishment grants for short rotation coppice and miscanthus and funding to set up a producer group for SRC growers. The low level of expenditure reflects slower than expected progress with biomass-fuelled projects. The Government have now allocated over &pound;70 million of funding for market development and we are working closely with Government Departments and other bodies to develop opportunities in power generation, combined heat and power and heat applications. We expect this to lead to a significant increase in uptake.</p>

	<p pid=".1028W.5/2">In theory all material collected for recycling should be recycled, but inevitably there will be losses. Some mixed material may be lost in the sorting process (for example at Material Reclamation Facilities). Material may also be rejected due to contamination, or sent for disposal due to the lack of a suitable market for the recycled material.</p>
	<p pid=".1028W.5/3">There are no current plans to centrally monitor the amount of waste collected for recycling which ends up in landfill. However, in the case of local authorities, we are looking at the way we measure household recycling rates in the Municipal Waste Management Survey to try to ensure that the rates reflect material that was both collected for recycling and actually sent for recycling. In the current 2000&ndash;01 survey we are asking for the percentage of materials collected for recycling and composting which were rejected at Material Reclamation Facilities. To ensure that such losses are minimised it is important to support markets for recycled materials through initiatives such as WRAP. It should also be noted that the best value statutory standards for household recycling rates are on the basis of material sent for recycling, not that which is collected.</p>

To enable them to meet the challenging Statutory Performance Standards for recycling, we are however, providing major extra funding. By 2003&ndash;04 revenue support in the relevant Standard Spending Assessment area will have risen &pound;1.1 billion over 2000&ndash;01 provision. Spending Review 2000 also provides &pound;220 million for PFI waste schemes over the spending review period and a &pound;140 million ring-fenced fund for waste and recycling. &pound;50 million of New Opportunities Fund moneys will also be available over the next two years to support community sector work on recycling work in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".1029W.5/2">Our record on managing industrial and commercial waste is already better than on domestic waste. Nevertheless in order to encourage businesses further to reduce waste and to put to better use any waste that is produced the Government in Waste Strategy 2000 have set the target to reduce by 2005 the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".1029W.5/4">The programme encourages the establishment of waste minimisation clubs. The clubs offer a means by which businesses can make environmental improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".1029W.5/5">The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime will also have a role to play. Those regulated under the regime will be required to abide by the general principle that waste production should be avoided and that where waste is produced it should be recovered unless technically and economically impossible.</p>

	<p pid=".1031W.5/2">The principal sources from which water is abstracted in the UK are surface waters (rivers and reservoirs) and groundwater (eg chalk aquifers). The main source in any given area depends on its geology though water resources can be, and are, transferred from one region to another where it is necessary to do so. Desalination is not seen as a necessary option in terms of public water supply at the present time.</p>

	<p pid=".1031W.8/3">These results are placed on the public register. I have asked the Environment Agency to provide the hon. Member with a summary of the recent results, and will place copies in the Library of the House.

	<p pid=".1031W.8/4">I am confident that the Environment Agency has the appropriate technical expertise to carry out accurate and repeatable dioxin analysis of incinerated material. The agency has its own accredited laboratory for dioxin analysis. Nevertheless, current analysis of the dioxin levels in incinerator residues involves the incinerator operators and the Environment Agency employing a standard sampling protocol but with analysis by a number of different laboratories approved by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service. One of the aims of this ongoing work is to confirm the accuracy and repeatability of the techniques employed.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.5/2">The effect of the moratorium on present day emissions is likely to be small, given the time lags involved in constructing new plants. There could, in principle, be a small and temporary effect on emissions over the next few years. It is however difficult to make an estimate due to many other influences that could also affect new build decisions, for example, changes in energy prices, the New Electricity Trading Arrangements, and other Government policies on energy and the environment. We would expect any effect from the moratorium to have died away before the end of the decade.</p>

The latter include power stations and refineries, and produce the electricity, refined petroleum and other energy products used elsewhere in the economy. Emissions from energy industries amounted to 48.8 million tonnes of carbon equivalent (MtC) in 1999, of which 5.2 MtC and 16.6 MtC were attributable to demand in the transport and domestic sectors. Emissions from fuels loaded in the UK and used by international aviation and shipping are not included in the UK's inventory under agreed reporting guidelines used by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

	<p pid=".1034W.2/1">On central assumptions, electricity generation from UK nuclear power stations is projected to fall from 86 terawatt hours in 2005 to 27 terawatt hours in 2020, as existing power stations reach the end of their licensed lifetimes (see table). Were it physically possible to replace all nuclear capacity by gas-fired power stations similar to the type presently being installed by 2005, the related greenhouse gas emissions would be about 8.3 million tonnes of carbon per year in 2005, falling to 2.6 million tonnes of carbon by 2020. This includes the effect of carbon dioxide arising from combustion plus minor associated emissions of methane and nitrous oxide.</p>
