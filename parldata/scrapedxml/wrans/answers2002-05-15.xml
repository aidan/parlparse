	<p pid=".633W.9/2">The OFCOM Act 2002, which established Ofcom earlier this year, dealt with the basic framework of Ofcom at the main board level and was intended to allow the process of establishing Ofcom as a body to get under way while the substantive Communications Bill, which will give it regulatory responsibilities, is debated. The structure and remit of the content board are best seen in conjunction with Ofcom's functions, in particular the detailed broadcasting functions which are set out in the draft Communications Bill and particularly in relation to broadcast content including radio.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.9/3">The structure of the content board is set out clearly in the draft Bill. It will consist of a chairman, who will be a non-executive member of Ofcom (but not the chairman of Ofcom), and as many other members appointed by Ofcom as Ofcom shall think fit. Ofcom is specifically required to ensure that there is a different member of the content board capable of representing the interests and opinions of persons living in each of the nations of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid=".635W.3/2">Accurate figures for losses due to internet piracy are difficult to gather and distinguish from other misuse of copyright material on the internet. However, a survey carried out by the industry body, the Alliance Against Counterfeiting and Piracy, which broadly represents British interests, estimated losses of &pound;180 million to cinema and home entertainment and &pound;20 million to the music industry in 2000 as a result of piracy generally. We are not aware of any music piracy figures yet for 2001, but industry figures show a 5 per cent. increase in legitimate recorded music sales in the UK in that year. The industry estimates for the years 1997 to 1999 are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".636W.6/1">The total number of Gulf veterans who have kidney and or liver scarring could only be established if all Gulf veterans were to undergo medical examination. It is the practice of the Ministry of Defence to examine only those veterans who wish to be examined and are referred by their GP or service medical officer to the Ministry of Defence's Gulf veterans' medical assessment programme (GVMAP). All patients seen at the GVMAP receive abdominal ultrasound examination which can detect kidney and liver scarring. In the absence of other indicators of kidney or liver damage, such scarring is of no clinical significance. Neither is described either in standard medical textbooks or classified by the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revisions. Kidney and liver scarring is therefore an incidental finding, does not cause any suffering and in itself is of no clinical significance in respect of suggestion of a link between ill health and the Gulf conflict. For these reasons, no centralised records are kept of such scarring. However, in a randomly selected anonymised sample of 1,000 patients examined at the GVMAP, one patient had a kidney scar and none had liver scarring. The GVMAP physicians do record kidney and livery damage where the damage is of clinical significance.</p>

	<p pid=".637W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence is fully committed to consulting those children and young people to whom we provide services. For example, Cadet Force adult volunteer instructors initiate opportunities to obtain cadets views. The skill force initiative is structured so that participants are required to develop their own learning aims. Still within the MOD, the Service Children Education Agency has instigated in many of its schools &quot;Circle Time&quot;. This gives young people the opportunity to express their feelings and concerns and to resolve relationship and behavioural issues.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.6/2">The MOD also consults with organisations concerned with young people but the information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The MOD is committed to the new core principles for the involvement of children and young people published by the Minister for Young People in November 2001. The MOD will shortly be publishing an action plan setting out for the first time how it will implement these principles to extend the participation of children and young people in the design, provision and evaluation of policies and services that affect them.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.2/2">Training in leadership skills is an extremely important part of development activities in the Ministry of Defence, for both military and civilian staff. Its importance&mdash;emphasised within the &quot;Modernising Government&quot; initiative&mdash;was reflected in the recent defence training review. As a result the defence leadership centre has been established as part of the new defence academy to provide a nationally recognised centre of excellence. In addition, there are many other areas of the MOD where leadership features in both general management and more specific training. The Defence Procurement Agency, for instance, has provided leadership masterclasses and the important new area of smart acquisition has introduced a specific scheme designed to help develop integrated project team leaders.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.2/3">I am not aware of any training undertaken by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts on behalf of Ministers or officials.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.2/4">The MOD does provide some training in media interview skills, which includes factors such as voice tone and stance. This training is available to all staff and on occasions has been undertaken by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.2/5">In addition, Ministers are able to take advantage of the &quot;Programmes for Ministers&quot; organised by the centre for management and policy studies (CMPS) in the Cabinet Office.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.3/2">The overall cost of the seven-year lease and all supporting arrangements for the four C-17 aircraft is in the order of &pound;750 million. The detailed lease costs and the underlying aircraft price are commercially sensitive and I am withholding this information under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government information.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.3/3">The lease contract does not specify either a target number or a limit on flying hours. However, funding for support of the aircraft was modelled on a total of 3,000 flying hours per full year for the fleet of four aircraft. In the first part year of operations the C-17 fleet exceeded the modelled hours by about 60 per cent. The additional support costs arising from this level of flying were in the order of &pound;4 million. There are no additional lease costs associated with increased levels of flying activity. Future support costs will vary in line with the operational demands made of the aircraft over the lease period.</p>

The Ministry of Defence is aware that ROD is currently carrying out a manufacturing strategy review to optimise its business such that it will remain viable and competitive in the defence sector. Any decisions that emerge from this review are a commercial matter for the company. ROD has also indicated that it intends to invest substantially in a number of sites across the United Kingdom.

	<p pid=".643W.0/1">The tethering or 'picketing' of horses is the military method of tying horses to a rope or peg in the open in order to prevent injury. The recommended method is to use a single long rope, stretched along the ground, or preferably suspended 3 to 4 ft high, to which each horse is separately tied with a head rope. Heel ropes tied to pegs may also be used in order to prevent a horse kicking the next horse. Details of the preferred methods to be used are laid out in the &quot;Manual of Horsemanship, Equitation and Animal Transport&quot; (WO Code 7193, 1937) and &quot;Animal Management&quot; (HMSO 1956).</p>

Within these areas military fast jets may operate down to a height of 100 ft separation distance and a proliferation of obstacles could negate the value of the training. Units also make use of these areas for specialised night training. In these areas wind farm developments may compromise flight safety to an unacceptable level.</p>

The agency's document sets out in some detail considerations of costs for the various technetium-99 abatement techniques that have been considered, and for a range of schemes to partially or fully replace the B211 facility where medium active concentrate (MAC), containing technetium-99, is stored. Costs are given both as undiscounted costs and present value costs, and they are further broken down into capital, operating and decommissioning costs. Where appropriate, the costs of combining abatement techniques with each other and with new storage facilities are also considered.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.6/3">The undiscounted cost of introducing so-called &quot;TPP abatement&quot; would be in the order of &pound;3 million, whereas &quot;MAC Diversion&quot; costs would be in the range &pound;14&ndash;90 million. The so-called &quot;end of pipe&quot; abatement techniques that have been identified by BNFL are estimated to cost in the range of &pound;76&ndash;256 million. Replacement of the B211 storage facility to include replacement of the current MAC storage capacity would cost in the order of &pound;450 million. BNFL are also assessing options for refurbishing the B211 facility, which would be notably cheaper.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.8/1">The Government conduct an annual pesticide residues surveillance programme for fruit and vegetables and other produce. This programme is overseen by the independent Pesticide Residues Committee (PRC). The PRC advises Ministers and the chief executives of the Food Standards Agency and the Pesticides Safety Directorate on pesticide residues in foods.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/2">Typically around 4,000 food samples are tested each year for a range of pesticide residues at a cost of &pound;2.2 million. The objectives of the programme are threefold:</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/3" class="indent">To back up the statutory approvals process for pesticides by checking that no unexpected residues are occurring;</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/4" class="indent">To check that residues do not exceed statutory maximum residue levels (MRLs);</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/5" class="indent">To check that human dietary intakes of residues are within acceptable levels.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/6">Most samples tested currently are collected from retail outlets. Sampling is biased towards samples that are more likely to contain residues.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/7">The scope of each year's programme and details of the samples analysed under the surveillance programme can be found on the PRC's website. The 2002 programme is on the website at <a href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/PRC/prc.htm">www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/ PRC/prc.htm</a>. The 2003 programme is currently being developed by the Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.8/8">The Department of Health also undertakes a similar monitoring programme for produce distributed to children under the national school fruit scheme. Details of the results from testing will shortly appear on the PRC's website.</p>

Most of these vehicles (1,852) are used exclusively in the service of the Crown and hence are exempt from vehicle excise duty under section 183 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The remainder (186 cars) are subject to vehicle excise duty due to an element of private use for which each user makes a payment.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.3/1">It is not possible to calculate the number of ewes with lambs at foot slaughtered either for disease control purposes or under the livestock welfare disposal scheme because lambs at foot have not been recorded separately. For the purposes of disease control it is only necessary to record animals by species ie cattle, sheep, pigs goats, deer and other. Lambs at foot have therefore simply been included in the sheep category.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.3/2">We are aware that to date not all the lambs at foot, slaughtered for disease control purposes, have been included in the figures on DEFRA's disease control system database (DCS). In the early stages of the outbreak, in line with normal husbandry practice, a number of ewes with lambs at foot were recorded as one unit (ie one animal). It was quickly recognised that each animal should be separately recorded and, as staff resources became available, an exercise to amend the DCS began.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.3/3">This exercise is now well under way and many of the lambs at foot are already reflected in the total slaughter figure of around 4 million for disease control purposes. Information describing this exercise has been on the DEFRA website for some time, where it is also noted that the data on the DCS are being validated and may result in figures being revised.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.3/4">Slaughtering under the livestock welfare disposal scheme took place at abattoirs and it was consequently more likely that lambs at foot were recorded in the slaughter figures. These figures are therefore very unlikely to change.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.5/2">Following regulatory action by the European Commission on products of animal origin from China, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) immediately began testing some products of animal origin already in the United Kingdom and as a result called for the withdrawal of jars of Chinese and blended honey on sale in the UK to ensure consumers are protected.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.5/3">Both streptomycin and chloramphenicol (antibiotics) were found in samples of Chinese and blended honey. The FSA published the results of this analysis in two press releases: 'Tests on Chinese and blended honey show traces of illegal residue of veterinary drug', which was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-06">6 February 2002</phrase>, and 'Tests on Chinese and blended honey show further illegal drug residue' which was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-19">19 February 2002</phrase>. Illegal residues of chloramphenicol were also found in samples of another bee product, royal jelly, at similar levels as those found in honey. The FSA again called for the withdrawal of Chinese and other royal jelly products which did not meet legal requirements. The main known risk from chloramphenicol relates to aplastic anaemia, a rare but serious blood disorder in susceptible individuals. The FSA, on the advice of expert toxicologists, has concluded that overall the levels of this antibiotic in honey pose an extremely small risk to public health. The streptomycin found was not considered to be of toxicological concern.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.5/4">The FSA's advice to the consumer is that, given the extremely small risk, people can continue to eat any honey they have already bought, irrespective of country of origin. This advice also applies to other foods that contain honey, where the risk is even lower. Given the low risk, consumers were not advised against the consumption of royal jelly.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.5/5">Full details have been published on the FSA website, <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk">www.food.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".660W.2/1">The career packages offered to scientists and engineers working in research and development are a matter for the employer. The Roberts' review's report &quot;SET for success&quot; identified a clear need for employers to improve the attractiveness of careers in R and D in order to compete effectively for talented staff.</p>
	<p pid=".660W.2/2">In 1997 the Research Careers Initiative (RCI) was established to focus on the policy dimension of improving the career management and development of research careers in the UK. The RCI identifies, encourages and disseminates good practice in the career management and development of contract research staff.</p>
	<p pid=".660W.2/3">More recently, Sir Gareth Roberts recommended that higher education institutions, as employers of scientists and engineers, should ensure that postdoctoral researchers have clear career development plans and access to training, and that researchers and academics should be better paid. He further recommended that R and D businesses should also offer improved career packages to attract the best science and engineering graduates and postgraduates that the UK has to offer.</p>
	<p pid=".660W.2/4">&quot;SET for success&quot; recommended that businesses must review their recruitment mechanisms, the salaries offered to researchers, their career structure (including levels of responsibility and opportunities to progress), and the training and continued professional development opportunities that they make available. Sir Gareth also recommended that a group of R and D employers should monitor employers' progress in rising to these challenges.</p>
	<p pid=".660W.2/5">The Government are formulating a response to the Roberts review, in tandem with the current spending review, and a statement on how the Government will be taking forward the recommendations will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".665W.12/1">The International Bar Association visited Zimbabwe in March 2001 and concluded that the rule of law there was in peril, and that the Zimbabwe Government had acted in a way that put democracy at risk. We are not aware of any more recent assessments by expert legal organisations of the independence of the judiciary in Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Government ignored the recommendations of the International Bar Association, and continues to apply pressure to members of the legal profession. Our judgment is that this pressure has seriously undermined the independence of the judiciary.</p>

Current work includes site clearance, earthworks, drainage and the diversion of water, electricity and telecommunications services. Construction of the Wolfshead roundabout, which will link the new road with the existing A5, has begun and, during the early Summer, there will be traffic management on the A5 to enable the roundabout to be completed. The planting will be done towards the end of the contract.</p>

	<p pid=".678W.9/5" class="indent">Aldehydes found in ambient air include irritant compounds such as formaldehyde and acrolein. It is possible, though unlikely, that exposure to the concentrations of these compounds found commonly in ambient air in the UK could cause symptoms of irritation of the eyes or mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. Outdoor concentrations of formaldehyde are generally low in comparison with concentrations that have been shown to produce irritation. Concentrations indoors may, on occasion, be sufficient to cause irritation: this is due to the release of aldehydes from building materials and from house fittings.</p>
	<p pid=".678W.9/6" class="indent">Though formaldehyde is a carcinogen in rats, the risks to humans associated with exposure to ambient concentrations, if any, will be extremely small.</p>
	<p pid=".678W.9/7" class="indent">Occupational exposure to high concentrations of formaldehyde has been linked with the development of asthma and a hypersensitivity response to this compound. The evidence is not clear cut: much more convincing is the evidence regarding the response to glutaraldehyde, though the concentrations of this compound in ambient air are very low. It is highly unlikely that exposure to ambient levels of aldehydes would lead to allergic and respiratory problems. There is some evidence to suggest that exposure to formaldehyde indoors is associated with asthma symptoms in children. However, the overall evidence is not, however, completely clear cut and more research will be necessary before this issue can be finally resolved.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.0/17" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".682W.0/18">1. The information is based on data held by the Pension Schemes Registry (PSR). It relates to final salary schemes only. There is a large minority of schemes on the Register where the scheme type is unknown, there are also some schemes offering a mixture of salary related and money purchase benefits. None of these schemes are included in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.0/19">2. Closed schemes do not admit new active members, but allow existing members to continue to accrue benefits. Frozen schemes do not allow any future accruals. Schemes starting to wind up are also frozen. Schemes that have completed wind up have no members&mdash;all assets are realised and all liabilities are discharged.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.0/20">3. The information relates to schemes, not employers. Some employers operate several schemes. Closure of a scheme may be due to a bulk transfer of members to another scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.0/21">4. The PSR system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status and the effective date of the change. Because of the way the data is held a later change will overwrite an earlier change, so data for earlier years become increasingly inaccurate. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there is likely to be a lag before the data reflects what is happening currently.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.3/2">The Department has undertaken a thorough review of the impact of screens in protecting staff from physical assaults. The review has taken account of the experience of a number of major public and private sector employers, both in the UK and abroad, as well as the results of an investigation carried out by the Tavistock Institute for the Employment Service. A copy of this latter research report has been placed in the Library. The general conclusions to emerge from this work are that the presence of screens tends to make communication between staff and customers seem more unfriendly and uncaring, which is, in turn, more likely to predispose agitated or anxious people towards aggression.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.10/1">I recently agreed funding of &pound;1.315 million to strengthen the work of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) over the next three years. This will be disbursed in yearly tranches. The tranche for 2002&ndash;03 is &pound;513,000. This is 47.5 per cent. of total ETI income in this year. Subsequent years will see a decrease in the proportion of DFID funds as a proportion of total funds, to 40 per cent. in year two and 26.5 per cent. in year three.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.10/2">We have provided &pound;780,000 since the ETI was set up in 1998 to the end of March 2002. This new three-year grant of &pound;1.315 million represents 38 per cent. of total ETI income over this forthcoming three-year period. This new funding will enable the ETI to build on the excellent progress it has made over the last three years and to develop expertise and knowledge in new areas which will help its increasing number of members continue to improve labour conditions in the supply chains of corporate members. The remaining 62 per cent. will be generated by corporate and NGO membership fees and a small amount of trading income from services provided to non-members, such as for training. The corporate membership fee total over the period is expected to be &pound;1.92 million, or 56 per cent. of total income. However, ETl's &quot;learning by doing&quot; approach is very demanding on members' time and other resources and this contribution has been conservatively valued as a further &pound;1.8 million over three years.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.10/3">DFID has supported the Ethical Trading Initiative since its establishment in 1998. It is an alliance of major British retailers, non-governmental organisations and trade unions dedicated to the improvement of labour standards throughout the supply chains of its corporate members. The ETl's corporate members bring together almost &pound;100 billion in annual turnover. Significant proportions of the corporate members' supply chains are located in developing countries and the ETI therefore has a considerable worldwide reach. The corporate members are committed to independent verification, and work to bring their supply chains into compliance with International Labour Organisation standards in a way that brings benefits to workers in developing countries.</p>

Relief of more than US$60 billion will be provided to these countries, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. Of the 26 countries, 21 have reached decision point and are receiving interim debt relief on their 'flow' of payment, and five have completed the HIPC process, and have received an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt. We hope that a further three will reach their completion point this year. The prospects for the remaining eleven unsustainable countries are not good. Six&mdash;Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan&mdash;are still affected by conflict; Togo has governance problems; Central African Republic, DR Congo and Comoros might go through next year and Lao PDR is undecided as to whether to opt for HIPC relief. Angola, Kenya, Vietnam and Yemen are regarded as sustainable cases, eligible for relief from the Paris Club.</p>

	<p pid=".684W.8/1">Good progress is being made with the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Interim Afghan Authority has prepared a national development framework and draft budget. Major investment and advisory projects are being designed in key sectors. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund has been established. Preparations are well advanced for the Emergency Loya Jirga next month that will appoint a Transitional Authority for the coming two years. Meanwhile, humanitarian assistance continues to be provided. Recovery activities are gathering pace, although it will take some time for the benefits to be felt by ordinary Afghans. Refugees are returning to Afghanistan in increasing numbers. But the security and political situation is still fragile. Much remains to be done: reconstruction will require a long-term effort.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/2">At the Tokyo conference in January, donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid over the next two and a half years. The agreed objective was to support the establishment of a secure and stable sovereign state based on the rule of law, able to absorb returning refugees, no longer a haven for international terrorists and drug traffickers, and in stable relationships with its neighbours based on mutual respect and non-interference. The continuing necessity of humanitarian relief was recognised.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/3">The conference also emphasised the need for close coordination between international donors and the Afghan Interim Administration. Donors have participated in multi-donor missions covering a range of areas, including health, education, agriculture, public finance, transport, infrastructure and community development.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/4">The UK is playing its part, in the political, military and development arenas. Our leadership of the International Security Assistance Force has helped to bring stability to Kabul, establishing the authority of the Interim Administration. We have provided support for poppy crop eradication. We have disbursed around &pound;60 million since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> through direct contributions to multilateral agencies and quick impact projects. We have plans in hand for further expenditure of about &pound;40 million this financial year. It is clear that this year, and perhaps next, the majority of this assistance will need to continue to fund humanitarian and recovery programmes. As now, this will include direct contributions to UN agencies and NGOs, quick impact projects to kick-start the recovery process and to underpin the Interim Administration until the Emergency Loyal Jirga, practical support to the political process, and help to establish the Afghan Authority for Assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/5">For the longer term reconstruction effort, we believe it will be important to avoid overburdening the Transitional Authority with many bilateral programmes, each funded by different donors with their own procedures and reporting mechanisms. For that reason we will channel much of our assistance through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. We intend to commit at least half of our Tokyo pledge&mdash;&pound;100 million&mdash;to the fund. We have already paid in our first contribution&mdash;the first donor to do so. We are encouraging other donors also to maximise their contributions to the fund, which we believe should be the main source of funding both for the reconstruction programme and for any quick impact recovery work.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/6">Our bilateral technical assistance is deliberately focused on support for capacity building in the Ministry of Finance and Central bank, in conjunction with the World bank and IMF. We also plan to support security sector reform, drawing on funds from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool.</p>

However, although some areas remain inaccessible due to volatile security conditions, the United Nations is now able to access 80 per cent. of the country, humanitarian aid is being delivered in significant quantities, and agencies are adapting their programmes from the provision of relief to include recovery activities.

	<p pid=".687W.8/1">According to WHO, Malawi's recent cholera epidemic was one of the worst that the country has experienced with 981 deaths resulting from 33,510 cases. The epidemic started last October and reached a peak in March 2002, since when case numbers have returned to pre-epidemic levels. The average cholera case fatality rate was particularly high this year because the outbreak coincided with food shortage. In these circumstances, reduced attention to hygienic practices in food preparation and consumption led to increased infection rates; these contributed to higher death rates. A national shortage of intravenous fluids contributed to the difficulties in treating the abnormally high case load. The Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) only presented a situation report and appealed for assistance in mid-March, by which time it was too late to co-ordinate an external response and the epidemic was already waning. The MOHP and development partners in the health sector are planning support for improved disease surveillance and response to avoid the same situation arising next year.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.3/1">The Government has been working to try to ensure that countries exit the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative process with sustainable debt levels. At the Annual Meetings of the World bank and IMF in Ottawa last November, we raised this concern and asked the World bank staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including HlPCs. The IMF and World bank analysis, published last month, shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens as a result. Following UK pressure, the World bank and IMF boards have agreed to provide additional relief to countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the Spring Meetings last month, and Burkina Faso became the first HIPC country to benefit from 'topping up' at Completion Point. We are also pressing the Bank and Fund to take more concrete action to encourage non-Paris Club creditors that have not yet delivered debt relief, to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/2">Debt relief is, however, not a panacea and further measures, including sound economic and debt management by HlPCs themselves, will be required beyond HIPC, to enable countries to maintain debt sustainability levels. To this end, the UK is co-financing a multi-donor funded project to help strengthen the debt management capacity in HIPC countries.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.6/1">In our second White Paper on international development, Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor (2000), we made a commitment to work towards a stronger and more effective voice for developing countries in the policy and regulatory mechanisms of the international financial system. To this end we are providing capacity-building support in diverse ways, bilaterally and in collaboration with other donors, to small states and least developed countries in order to strengthen their negotiating capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.6/2">In addition to many capacity building projects in-country, we are collaborating with other donors to provide support at key institutions. Examples of this include support to:</p>
	<p pid=".689W.6/3" class="indent">the multi-donor Debt Capacity Building Programme, which assists countries negotiate HIPC relief with the International Financial Institutions and the Paris Club;</p>
	<p pid=".689W.6/4" class="indent">the Agency for International Trade Information and Co-operation, which helps countries with little or no representation at the WTO in Geneva;</p>
	<p pid=".689W.6/5" class="indent">the independent, Geneva-based, Advisory Centre on WTO Law which helps countries take a case through dispute settlement at the WTO;</p>

	<p pid=".690W.2/1">In 2000 only 38 per cent. of EC official development assistance payments went to poor countries down from 52 per cent. in 1999. Accurate figures for EC spending in 2001 will be available early next year. However, it is likely that the share of EC spending in low income countries will have risen since expenditure from the European Development Fund in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries-most of which are low income-is reported to have increased significantly.</p>
	<p pid=".690W.2/2">There have also been improvements in the budgetary allocations for Asia, which has the largest number of poor people of any region. Last year we secured an extra e70m for Asia including humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. In the Preliminary Draft Budget for 2003 these increases have been sustained and are balanced by cuts in assistance to the Balkans now that the emergency reconstruction phase has ended.</p>
	<p pid=".690W.2/3">The poverty focus and effectiveness of EC allocations is still low. My Department continues to push for allocations based on developmental needs to countries committed to reducing their poverty.</p>

We are currently exploring with our G8 partners whether there are further actions they might wish to support on debt. It is important to ensure the full financing of any multilateral debt relief, to reduce the risk of skewing development resources away from other very poor countries who have handled their debt well. We will therefore be raising the issue of HIPC financing, and the possible need for further contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund.</p>

In order to tackle the substantial barriers to trade, a new trade round was launched at the fourth WTO ministerial meeting in Doha in November last year with a pro- development agenda. The meeting resulted in agreement on the need to reduce barriers to trade in agriculture and manufactured goods. In response to this, my Department is working with the DTI and DEFRA to ensure that these commitments become a reality.</p>

	<p pid=".700W.11/1">First of all I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy for the Taylor family who still have many questions left unanswered despite an intensive police investigation and a lengthy trial.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/2">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister (Mr. Blair) has said there should be no rush to judgment. This was always going to be a difficult case.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/3">My right hon. and noble Friend the Attorney-General (Lord Goldsmith) has asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to look into the handling of the case, to consider whether there are implications for the conduct of future cases and to make recommendations. Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate will be involved in the review. In particular, the Director has been asked to examine whether the time has come to introduce a system where, before trial, interviews of certain key witnesses are conducted by the prosecutor in a limited category of cases. The review will report by mid-summer.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/4">We are already taking steps to help children and other vulnerable or intimidated witnesses give their best evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/5">In June 1998 the Government published &quot;Speaking up for Justice&quot;, a report of an interdepartmental working group on the treatment of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses in the Criminal Justice system. It proposed a coherent and integrated scheme to provide appropriate support and assistance for vulnerable or intimidated witnesses. Key recommendations include a range of special measures available for use at the trial including:</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/6" class="indent">screens around the witness box;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/7" class="indent">clearing the court, in certain circumstances, so that evidence can be given in private;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/8" class="indent">removal of wigs and gowns;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/9" class="indent">video recorded statements to replace the evidence-in-chief;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/10" class="indent">video recorded pre-trial cross-examination;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/11" class="indent">live television links;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/12" class="indent">assistance with communication if necessary, including the use of an intermediary.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/13">The measures requiring legislation were included in Part II of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/14">Implementation of the special measures is imminent and they will be an improvement on the current arrangements. In January I announced a phased implementation programme starting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-24">24 July</phrase> this year. In the Crown court all the special measures will be implemented for vulnerable witnesses, with the exception of intermediaries and pre-trial cross-examination which will be subject to pilot projects. The same measures, with the added exception of video-recorded statements, will be implemented at the same time for intimidated witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/15">All other measures will be introduced in 2003&ndash;04 for all qualifying witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/16">In magistrates courts implementation of special measures in July 2002 will be restricted to television links and video recorded evidence for child witnesses in cases involving sexual offences, violence (including threats) and cruelty. This will provide protection for children in cases involving assaults, muggings and domestic violence. It will also bring the adult magistrates courts into line with the current provision in the Youth court. Most of the measures will be extended to magistrates courts by 2003&ndash;04 (after their evaluation in the Crown court) to bring them in line with the Crown court.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/17">Over the next year or two we will also be starting pilot projects on video-recorded pre-trial cross-examination and the use of intermediaries.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/18">A whole range of guidance and training materials for the criminal justice agencies have been published including:</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/19" class="indent">&quot;Achieving Best Evidence&quot;, which is comprehensive guidance on preparing for and conducting interviews with vulnerable or intimidated witnesses (both adults and children). It will replace the &quot;Memorandum of Good Practice in Video Recorded Interviews With Child Witnesses For Criminal Proceedings&quot; from <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-24">24 May 2002</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/20" class="indent">A practice guide on early special measures meeting between the police and Crown Prosecution Service and meetings between the Crown Prosecution Service and vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. From July, prosecutors will meet vulnerable witnesses to discuss special measures that can be taken in connection with their giving evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/21">We are working closely with a full range of agencies in the criminal justice system and voluntary sector in implementing these measures. Arrangements are already in place to evaluate the special measures once they have had a chance to bed down. We will also be looking closely at the findings of the inquiries being conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan police to see if there are any lessons to be learned for the measures needed to enable children and other vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give their best evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.11/22">On the wider front, Sir Robin Auld's Review of the Criminal Courts was published in October last year which resulted in a public consultation. The report contains 328 recommendations and makes wide proposals for reforming the courts and their proceedings. The Government is looking at the report and the results of the consultation carefully as well as other ideas for modernising the criminal justice system. We will publish a White Paper setting out our proposals for the way forward shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".703W.0/1">A three-year strategy was launched in February 2001 following the Prison Service's review &quot;Caring for the Suicidal in Custody&quot;, which recommended a radical move from awareness to prevention, including a commitment to reduce self-inflicted deaths in prison. The strategy embraces targeted, preventative measures within a holistic approach that seeks a supportive prison culture based on good prisoner/staff relationships; a physically safe environment with reduced opportunities for self-harm; and strong multi-disciplinary partnerships within prisons, with the courts, police and other criminal justice partners and with voluntary agencies particularly the Samaritans. Related work is tackling bullying and violence.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.0/2">The strategy focuses additional resources where the risks are highest such as the busy local prisons. Included in the strategy is a &quot;care of prisoners at risk&quot; project which is reviewing procedures and processes for identifying and supporting prisoners at enhanced risk. New procedures are being developed and will be trailed later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".704W.8/2">The Home Office neither sponsors safety tests involving the use of animals, nor does it set any requirements for data produced by any such procedures. Examples of specific legislative requirements under which procedures on animals may be carried out include the Medicines Act 1968, the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations, the Control of Pesticides Regulations, European Union Pesticides Directives, and the Food Safety Act. These requirements are matters for the relevant sponsoring Department.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/3">Where testing using animals is required, we ensure that the 3Rs are rigorously applied (the use of alternatives which replace animal use entirely, reduce the numbers of animals used, or refine the procedures to minimise suffering). In deciding whether to grant a licence for any regulated procedure, the 1986 Act also requires that the likely benefits of the programme are weighed against the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned (the cost/benefit assessment). We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/4">In addition, in August 2000, we announced an interdepartmental concordat on data sharing to enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals. The concordat commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests. Progress in implementing the concordat is currently being reviewed.</p>

	<p pid=".705W.2/2">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that regulated procedures can only be authorised and performed if there are no scientifically suitable alternatives that replace animal use, reduce the number animals needed, or refine the procedures used to minimise suffering. The likely benefits to humans, other animals or the environment must be weighed against the likely welfare costs to the animals involved.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.2/3">Although it has been suggested that information derived from procedures on animals cannot be extended to humans, these views do not reflect the consensus in the wider scientific community. This recognises that while there are physiological or bio-chemical differences between species, there are greater similarities. Species differences are taken into account within the design of research projects and the results of testing a new drug, for example, on animals can be used to predict the effect on humans.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.2/4">Animal procedures are, in any case, only one element of the tests carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of products. Before animals are used, they will also have been subjected to a variety of other screening processes including the use of computers, cell cultures and other non-animal tests. Clinical trials in humans also play an important part. It is not justified, therefore, to single out animal experiments for criticism when unexpected results are seen in full-scale clinical use. The simple fact is that biological science is not exact. However, until other suitable alternatives are developed, animal tests will continue to play an important part in minimising the adverse effects to humans caused by unexpected reactions during clinical trials and use.</p>

We have however taken a three week sample in eight courts to obtain an estimate of the number of excusals.

If this figure is accurate then nationally this would equate to under 7,500 of the 579,157 summoned.</p>

	<p pid=".712W.3/1">Mrs. Blair does not participate in the work of the Government and therefore the issue of accountability does not arise. She has not chaired a policy-making seminar at No. 10.</p>

The 1999 millennium lectures will cover education, work, leisure, wealth creation, science, arts and culture and what it means to be British in the 21st century&quot;. The lectures are not part of the policy-making process and there are no formal outcomes. Mrs. Blair has invited questions from guests when I have been unable to remain for the duration of the lecture, and hosted the drinks reception after the lecture.

	<p pid=".726W.2/1">The United Kingdom has held a substantial stockpile of smallpox vaccine for contingency purposes since smallpox vaccination ceased in the 1970s. The existing stock of vaccine is nearly 30-years-old. Although the vaccine has retained its potency, the technology underpinning these stocks is now also 30-years-old. In the aftermath of the events of September 11, we reviewed our ability to deal with terrorist attacks involving biological weapons. We have decided that the sensible course of action is to up-date our existing smallpox vaccine supplies with new supplies of cell based vaccines to reflect advances in vaccine development and safety standards.</p>

This raises issues of national security as well as public health. For this reason the Department is not making public details about the quantities of vaccine stocks or vaccine deployment, as this might be information that could be useful to terrorists. The Department issued guidance to all health authorities and regional directors of public health on the procedures to be followed in the event of a deliberate release of smallpox and other biological agents, on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>. At the same time, guidance for medical and laboratory staff was issued by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) concerning the precautions to be adopted in the event of an outbreak of smallpox.

	<p pid=".730W.6/1">Following the Decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the cases of Garaets-Smits/ Peerbooms (C157/99) and Vanbraekel (C368/98), my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State announced last autumn that he was removing the obstacles in domestic legal provision to allow health care commissioners in England to purchase care elsewhere in the European Economic Area (EEA) for English residents.</p>
	<p pid=".730W.6/2">These arrangements for direct purchase of care operate alongside the provisions of European Community law in Regulation (EEC) 1408&ndash;71. This allows referral of patients from the country of residence to the state medical sector in any of the member states of the EEA specifically to receive treatment for a pre-existing medical condition, using EC Form E112. The procedures for obtaining this document are set out in the Department of Health leaflet 'Health Advice for Travellers' available from Post Offices (copy available in the Library).</p>
	<p pid=".730W.6/3">In considering the national legislation of the Netherlands at issue in the Garaets-Smits/Peerbooms case, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that their system which required prior approval from the patient's sickness insurance institution for treatment in other EEA states, was contrary to the freedom to provide services provisions of the treaty establishing the European Community. However, the ECJ said that, provided certain conditions were met, such a rule was justified in the interests of maintaining the financial stability of the Dutch national health system.</p>
	<p pid=".730W.6/4">In the light of the ECJ rulings, the United Kingdom continues to operate a requirement that prior authorisation for treatment elsewhere in the EEA must be obtained. In the case of E112 referrals responsibility for this prior authorisation rests with the Department. Direct commissioning of health care services by national health service bodies by its very nature requires prior authorisation by the referring NHS organisation. Patients arranging treatment elsewhere in the EEA without obtaining the appropriate prior authorisation are personally liable for the costs involved.</p>

	<p pid=".731W.11/1">The study of medicine continues to be a very popular option among university applicants offering as it does the opportunity of a challenging, worthwhile and highly esteemed career within a huge range of possible job opportunities. Universities and colleges admissions services data are showing that home applications have increased by almost 17 per cent. in the current application cycle.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.11/2">In recognition of the longer length of medical training courses and the need to guarantee the increased future supply of medical staff, the Government have already introduced special financial support arrangements for undergraduate medical students. English domiciled pre-registration medical students who joined their courses from <phrase class="date" code="1998-09-01">1 September 1998</phrase> onwards, qualify for NHS bursaries in their fifth and subsequent years of study. NHS bursaries are also available to English-domiciled students undertaking the new four-year graduate-entry medical courses. These students qualify for NHS-funded support in years two to four of the course.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.11/3">Medical and dental students receive the same package of support as other health professional students studying at degree level and are therefore eligible for a means tested NHS bursary of up to &pound;2,640 for students studying in London (rate for academic year 2002&ndash;03), supplemented by a non-means tested reduced rate student loan. In addition all NHS-funded students have their liability for a tuition fee contribution (&pound;1,100 for academic year 2002&ndash;03) met in full, and without means testing. Additional allowances are available for older students, individuals with disabilities, single parents and others with dependants, and also to take account of the longer academic year attended by health professional students.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.11/4">During the first four years of the undergraduate medical course, students are supported under the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) student support regulations. On <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase> my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Estelle Morris) announced her Department's plans for a fundamental review of mainstream student support arrangements. The Department will be working with DfES to ensure the needs of medical students are taken fully into account in the design of any new arrangements.</p>

This follows a comprehensive review of cancer services, including palliative care, by the former South Cheshire health authority, which developed a four-year strategy in consultation with all relevant partners, including the hospice itself. Funding has risen in real terms over the last year. We have pledged, in the NHS Cancer Plan, that the national health service contribution to the costs of specialist palliative care will increase.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.14/2">The levels of compensation awarded by the courts in relation to mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases are a matter for the discretion of the court in the individual circumstances of the case. The Judicial Studies Board produces guidelines for the assessment of personal injury damages, based on existing case law. The most recent edition of the guidelines, published in 2000, indicates that at that time awards in respect of mesothelioma or asbestosis causing severe impairment both of function and of quality of life usually fell within the range of &pound;40,000 to &pound;50,000.</p>

	<p pid=".740W.2/1">The national health service's future health improvement plans are expected to take account of guidance on effective strategies to address overweight and obesity in supporting the implementation of the national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) and ultimately diabetes. This is to be agreed at a local level and should include the assessment for the need for specialist obesity units, which will be addressed locally.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.2/2">As part of the NSF CHD milestones, all NHS bodies need to contribute to the delivery of local programmes of effective policies on overweight and obesity. The Department has commissioned the health development agency to produce briefing that will help primary care trusts to design effective policies and strategies on healthy eating, physical activity, overweight and obesity, and tobacco control.</p>

The models that have been adopted in other countries vary considerably, and arise from the specific needs and individual circumstances of each country.

The primary role is to safeguard those children who are in receipt of a range of regulated services. These services include those provided by children's homes; independent fostering agencies; local authority fostering services; the welfare aspects of boarding schools; and, in due course, residential family centres, voluntary adoption agencies, and local authority adoption services. Regulations specifying the children's rights director's functions are expected to commence on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-24">24 May 2002</phrase>.</p>

Some centres have now started prescribing under the scheme, though the guidance in HSC 2002/004 recognises that appropriate NHS infrastructure may not yet be in place in some localities. It may take 18 months or longer before all potentially eligible patients are assessed under the scheme. The list of locally agreed prescribing centres is not yet finalised.

	<p pid=".743W.11/2">In July 2001 the chief medical officer was asked to set up an advisory group to look at the reform of clinical negligence in the national health service. It has not yet been possible to publish proposals for reform, because of the complexity of the issues raised by potential reforms, the need to consult widely (including through the Lord Chancellor's Department on how compensation is paid) and also to consider how potential proposals sit alongside a concurrent review of the NHS complaints procedure. Nevertheless, the chief medical officer has now held the last of his advisory group meetings and will shortly publish the findings along with recommendations for reform.</p>
