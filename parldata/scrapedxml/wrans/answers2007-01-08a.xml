	<p pid="a.209W.0/2">38 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with Employment Zone (EZ) advisers in Great Britain and 36 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with EZ advisers in London have moved into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.209W.0/3">Nine reports on EZs<sup>(1)</sup> and 23 reports on NDLP<sup>(2)</sup> have been published and are available in the Library. A list of the most recent reports is reproduced in the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.209W.0/4">Latest available data indicate that the cost of helping lone parents into work is around &pound;1,900 per person through EZs and around &pound;600 per person through NDLP. Direct comparisons cannot be drawn between the costs of helping someone into work through EZs and NDLP. EZs operate in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country while the New Deals operate nationally. In London EZ areas, employment support is provided to lone parents through EZs rather than through NDLP. Outside London, lone parents in EZ areas are offered help through NDLP at their first work-focused interview (WFI), but can choose between EZ and NDLP support if they continue to claim income support and have a second WFI. This increases the likelihood of such EZ participants requiring additional, and thus more costly, support to help them into work.</p>

	<p pid="a.222W.2/19">Records on each local authorities' LTP highway maintenance capital allocations and spend were introduced following the introduction in 2001-02 of LTPs.

	<p pid="a.222W.5/22">The number of S29 cases has decreased since the introduction in March 2004 of Continuous Registration enforcement from the record. The requirement to electronically submit S29 cases to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for prosecution, and the problems encountered in establishing this link led to a decrease in the number of prosecutions and an increase in the pursuit of these offenders by wheel clamping activity. A suitable method of transmitting cases electronically has now been found.</p>

	<p pid="a.225W.5/1">Funding for schools is a shared responsibility between central and local government. The majority of funding is provided by central government, with local authorities (LAs) providing the rest. In 2006-07, for the first time, schools received their funding from a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) rather than as part of the local government settlement. The DSG is a ring-fenced grant and must be used for schools' budgets. It is for each LA to distribute funding using a locally agreed formula, and for schools' governing bodies to decide how to spend the available resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.5/2">Support for children with special educational needs (SEN) accounts for a high proportion of all education expenditure. We do not hold information centrally about expenditure on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but information collected from LAs shows planned expenditure on the education of children with SEN of &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.5/3">In addition, schools and LEAs can use their School Development Grant to support SEN. SDG is allocated to schools and LAs to spend on teaching and learning according to their own needs and priorities. Total SDG for 2006-07 is almost &pound;2 billion and schools will see an increase over their 2005-06 SDG allocations of at least 3.4 per cent. per pupil in 2006-07 and 3.7 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

It includes special schools, and pupil referral and other educational units for pupils of secondary school age. It is prioritised on educational and social needs of geographical groups of schools proposed by local authorities. Projects including hospital schools or units are eligible where locally proposed. Such units are already eligible for devolved formula capital allocations.</p>

Of these, 3,000 children who were taken into care aged under one subsequently returned home between 2001 and 2006 to live with parents, relatives or other person with parental responsibility (excluding residence orders and special guardianship orders). Information on whether a child returned to live with their parents, relatives or other person with parental responsibility has only been collected since <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.

The 'category of need' codes record the main reason why a child is being provided with services. This provides a further insight as to why a particular child is being looked after. Information on 'category of need' was first collected in April 2000 and provides further information as to why a child is being looked after. Data on 'category of need' is not strictly comparable with the 'reason for being looked after' information that was collected prior to <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>

At present we are unable to give similar percentages for 2005/06 as the sub-national participation estimates for 2005 are not currently available. They are due to be published in June 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.2/27">Local authorities were responsible for the registration and inspection of children's day care facilities until these responsibilities were transferred to Ofsted in September 2001. The figures for 2005 were derived from the Ofsted database of registered child care providers. The figures for 1997 were derived from the Children's Day Care Facilities Survey, which was discontinued in 2001. Therefore the figures for child care providers for 2005 are not directly comparable with the day care figures for 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.2/28">With the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of responsibilities for registration and inspection of child care providers from local authority social service departments to Ofsted in September 2001, child care places were classified according to the type of day care provided: full day care, sessional day care, child minder, out of school day care or cr&egrave;che day care. Ofsted have produced figures based on this classification on a quarterly basis from March 2003. Their latest figures were published in their report &quot;Registered Childcare Providers and Places, September 2006&quot;, which is available on their website:</p>

Subject to future public spending decisions, the intention is to achieve this aim for every secondary school pupil within 15 waves from 2005-06 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.8/3">The first contracts for the BSF programme were signed earlier this year. The first &quot;Quick Win&quot; BSF school opened in Solihull in June and the second in South Tyneside in September. The first non-Quick Win school is scheduled to open in Bristol in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.8/4">In financial year 2007/08, we expect 14 schools will open of which three will be refurbished and a further 117 will start construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.8/5">In financial year 2008/09, 56 schools will open of which 21 will be refurbished and a further 182 will start construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.8/6">In financial year 2009/10, 129 will open and a further 182 will start construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.8/7">The figures for 2009/10 are indicative as this includes Wave 4 projects, which have just been selected this month, and certain Wave 2-3 projects where authorities have not yet finalised their plans.</p>

The figure, including walking, was 58 per cent. in 2002 and 64 per cent. in 1996. The apparent drop in participation may, in part, have resulted from a change in the wording of the question in relation to walking between the 1996 and 2002 surveys. Although in both surveys walks of two miles or more were asked about, the 2002 survey asked only about 'recreational walks.'</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.2/1">People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism industries) recently undertook a comprehensive Skill Needs Assessment as part of their 'Sector Skills Agreement' (SSA) process. This is a major DfES policy area designed to create a demand led system of education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.2/2">The Sector Skills Agreement has five stages, the first of which is the Skills Needs Assessment. This Assessment, undertaken between May and November 2005, looked at the current and future skill needs of the sector through extensive consultation with employers regionally, by industry and across the four UK nations. The research identified management and leadership, customer service and chefs skills as the priority skill areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.2/3">Linked to this, retention was also identified as a priority. The industry has high staff turnover rates, which cost the sector nearly &pound;1 billion each year. The full report and a summary can be found at <a href="http://www.people1st.co.uk">www.people1st.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.2/4">The second stage is an assessment of the supply of learning, which People 1st undertook between January and June 2006 (consulting with both employers and learning providers). The research revealed the sector employs a high percentage of students and international workers, has weak progression routes, and the majority of employers are confused about both what support is available and how to access it.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.2/5">The third stage looked at the gap between supply and demand, and is being used to inform the final two stages which involve working with employers and delivery partners to finalise the agreement. Further details will be available when these discussions have concluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.2/6">This research has underpinned the series of Skills Summits that DCMS held with People 1st. These summits are overseeing the development of a National Skills Strategy for the sector (the England arm of the Sector Skills Agreement), which is due for completion in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.2/7">I recently chaired the third summit in this series and launched the UK Skills Passport. The Passport will benefit both employers and employees by providing an entire system of career development and training, and signposting industry to qualifications and funding that meet their needs. A fourth Skills Summit will take place later this spring.</p>

The number of breeds with natural bobs is small and I think it extremely unlikely that an owner of such a dog would be prosecuted under the tail docking ban. Should such a case be brought before the courts, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to prove that an offence has been committed, and evidence from a veterinary surgeon or breed society is likely to establish the necessary facts.</p>

Within the NBU, there are eight regional bee inspectors and approximately 36 seasonal bee inspectors led by a national bee inspector. They carry out a targeted apiary inspection programme together with an extensive series of training events for bee keepers.</p>

	<p pid="a.268W.8/1">For the Great Britain routine herd testing programme for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), the Government uses the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (commonly known as the &quot;skin test&quot;). For reasons outlined, it is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of false positive results obtained from these bTB tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.8/2">When the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in Great Britain, there is less than a one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity in excess of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in a herd.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.8/3">It is important to bear in mind that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory, does not mean that the animal was not infected with bTB. In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case. Therefore, it is not correct to consider all skin test reactors that fail to disclose disease in the slaughterhouse or in the laboratory as false positives. The ease with which lesions of bTB can be detected at slaughter depends on the stage of infection, with lesions being harder to find in the early stages of bTB (that is, when most animals are detected using the skin test).</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.8/4">The following table shows, for 2004, 2005 and the first six months of 2006, the total number of test reactors slaughtered and the number of such reactors that had demonstrable evidence of infection at post-mortem examination and/or bacteriological culture:</p>

	<p pid="a.273W.6/2">The voluntary National Fallen Stock Scheme (NFSS) also benefits from &pound;20 million of Government funding over four years to November 2008, to assist with the costs to the industry of complying with the regulations.

	<p pid="a.274W.5/2">Local authority expenditure on flood risk management (including levies to the EA and internal drainage boards) is largely supported by the local government funding mechanisms operated by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).</p>

	<p pid="a.275W.0/3">There have been no prosecutions of intensive gamebird farms by DEFRA in the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.0/4">The Animal Welfare Act 2006, which will come into force in April 2007, introduces a duty on people responsible for an animal to take such steps as are reasonable to ensure its welfare. This new power will apply to gamebirds reared for sporting shooting prior to their release, and to gamebirds reared for meat.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.0/5">We have no plans to introduce regulations for the rearing of gamebirds. We do, however, propose to use powers under the Animal Welfare Act to produce a Code of Practice, which will provide guidance on accommodation and management methods, including aggression reduction. Specifically on the issue of raised laying units, before considering regulation or a ban on the system, I believe that it is important I obtain an independent view on this method of housing gamebirds. To that end, the Farm Animal Welfare Council's study of the system and its report will be fundamental in informing my decision on their future. As you are aware, I have particular concerns surrounding the use of raised laying units and will not hesitate to take appropriate action if, following the report, I believe that the bird's welfare is compromised. Any code would be subject to public consultation and endorsement by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.0/6">At present, all animals, including gamebirds reared for sporting purposes are covered by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. Under this Act it is an offence to ill-treat or cause unnecessary suffering to any captive or domestic animal. In addition, gamebirds reared for slaughter for food would be covered by the Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.0/7">There are no specific stocking densities of gamebirds required under present law.</p>

	<p pid="a.287W.5/2">Trichloroethylene, chromium, nickel, and cadmium are strictly controlled by existing legislation, and REACH will take a similar approach. There is a separate regulatory regime for biocides under the EU Biocidal Products Directive (98/8/EC), and these substances will be regarded as already registered for the purposes of REACH.</p>

	<p pid="a.288W.5/1">The Recycling Credits scheme was reformed through section 49 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (CNEA). Changes to the Scheme increase the flexibility of payments from waste disposal authorities (WDAs) to waste collection authorities (WCAs) in two-tier areas by giving them the option to jointly agree alternative arrangements. These changes have been in effect since April 2006. The CNEA also clarified that recycling credits can be paid for reuse activity and that reuse should be treated in the same way as recycling for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.5/2">Local authorities (LAs) have the power to pay credits to third parties for the recycling and reuse activity they carry out. These payments are at the discretion of individual LAs so that they can take account of local circumstances. The Government introduced updated guidance in April this year, which gives greater encouragement to LAs to adopt good practice. The guidance strengthens the existing presumption that LAs will consider applications for credits from third parties which meet certain criteria and consider the social, environmental and economic benefits associated with community recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.5/3">The guidance makes it clear that credit values should be the same for reuse as they are for recycling and disposal credits for third parties should be calculated on the same basis as credits for waste collection authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.5/4">Guidance on the recycling credits scheme can be found on the Defra website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.291W.2/1">The decision to end the adjudication scheme was not taken lightly. The Scheme supports the Code of Good Practice for agri-environment schemes and diversification projects within agricultural tenancies. It is administered by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors and was set up in December last year, with the intention that it would continue for a period of four years. However, since its launch in December 2005, there has not been a single application for the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.291W.2/2">Given the current financial constraints within DEFRA, it would not have been a sensible use of public money to allocate funds for a further three years to a scheme for which there has been no interest. Therefore, we decided reluctantly that the Scheme should be closed at the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.291W.2/3">The closure of the Scheme does not affect the validity of the Code of Good Practice, which stands in its own right and provides useful and informative advice to tenants and landlords contemplating diversification activities. The Code is available from the DEFRA website at:</p>

The Department agreed with the Claimants Group (CG) on taking mixed workers&mdash;those who had worked both underground and on the surface&mdash;into the scheme. The Department offered that any surface worker in a dusty job&mdash;with agreement on what these were&mdash;could go through the medical assessment for chronic bronchitis and temporary exacerbation of asthma which provides for low levels of compensation (on the lines of the tariffs now operating in the fast track scheme). And any surface worker with a pneumoconiosis reading (which the Department's claims handlers, Capita, took as a proxy for a marker of exposure to dust) could go through the full medical assessment and have access to higher levels of compensation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.6/1">As part of our analysis for the Energy Review we commissioned Jackson Consulting to undertake a high-level assessment of the suitability of the existing nuclear generating sites to support possible new power stations. The purpose of the report was to help us form a view on whether nuclear could play a role in the future generating mix. The study was not aimed at the potential siting of new plant&mdash;this will be for the private sector to decide, should they decide to bring forward proposals for new build.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.6/2">Subject to confirming our view that nuclear has a role to play alongside other low carbon options, in the Energy White Paper next year, we intend to carry out a strategic siting assessment. We will publish the preliminary technical assessment that we undertook for the Energy Review once this strategic assessment is finished. We believe that publishing it before the strategic assessment would prejudice that assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.302W.5/19">The contribution of renewables to total UK primary energy demand has grown from 1.3 per cent. in 2003 to 1.5 per cent. in 2004 and 1.7 per cent. in 2006. Thermal renewable sources appear to make a larger contribution to energy supplied by renewables when measured in primary energy terms because, by definition, the primary inputs of non-thermal sources such as wind and hydro are equal to the electricity produced and there are thus no conversion losses.</p>

	<p pid="a.305W.2/1">Britain's gas market is regulated by Ofgem, the independent regulator, operating within a framework set by Government. The Government welcome the initiative taken by Ofgem in calling for reductions in wholesale prices to be passed on to domestic customers. The regulatory framework provides for Ofgem to fine companies up to 10 per cent. of annual worldwide turnover if it finds evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. Ofgem can also refer the market to the Competition Commission if it finds evidence that competition is not working.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.2/1">As part of our analysis for the Energy Review we commissioned Jackson Consulting to undertake a high-level assessment of the suitability of the existing nuclear generating sites to support possible new power stations. The purpose of the report was to help us form a view on whether nuclear could play a role in the future generating mix. The study was not aimed at the potential siting of new plant&mdash;this will be for the private sector to decide, should they decide to bring forward proposals for new build.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.5/2">Boiler Tube Cracking is a recognised phenomenon at Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B. HSE's Nuclear Safety Directorate has monitored the situation since the early 1990s and BE disclosed the phenomenon in its recent re-listing prospectus. The Department was informed of the recent incidents of boiler tube cracking at these stations shortly before British Energy made its announcements to the market.</p>

It is possible that section 216 may also apply to new businesses run by directors of other insolvent companies which have no connection with that previous business' activities and consequently would not be considered as a &quot;phoenix&quot; company. Section 216 applies to any director of an insolvent company, independently of any wrongdoing. The number of complaints received via the Hotline since February 2005, which relate specifically to section 216 is 10 and none have yet resulted in either a disqualification or prosecution of a director.</p>

	<p pid="a.316W.5/1">The aim of Regulation (EC) No. 2006/2004 is to formalise and improve co-operation arrangements between member states' consumer enforcement authorities, in order to better combat cross-border frauds and scams. Its focus is on practices that affect the collective interest of consumers, rather than complaints affecting only individuals, and its scope is limited to the 15 pieces of EC consumer protection legislation named in the annex to the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/2">Basic details of alleged infringements e.g. business names and details of the complaint will be transmitted from one country's Single Liaison Office to another's and then on to the relevant enforcer by means of a secure database.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/3">Access to the database is limited to enforcers designated as competent authorities and national Single Liaison Offices (in the UK, the Office of Fair Trading). Single Liaison Offices will only have access to information relating to requests for mutual assistance, which have not been given confidential treatment. Non-EU countries do not have access to the database. The regulation does anticipate entering into arrangements with third (i.e.: non-EU) countries but none are in place at present, and any future arrangements should have appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/4">Data held on the database will be subject to the provisions and protections of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). While the regulation requires us to prevent the subject access provisions of the DPA being used by business to obstruct the proper functioning of the regulation, we are satisfied that this fact should not cause problems in practice because appropriate safeguards have been built in.</p>

For Iraq this figure was 86 per cent. and for Afghanistan was 75 per cent. Recent improvements to the Afghanistan air-bridge include refurbishment of the runway at Kandahar Airfield, which was completed in November 2006. This now allows troops to fly from an airport closer to the majority of deployed locations, reducing in-Theatre journeys by up to 24 hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.6/1">The effective management of stores involves the assimilation of considerable quantities of information from a wide variety of sources. The MOD currently operates six major supply systems, seven major inventory systems and six major warehousing systems. Currently there is considerable integration within the single services and some integration across the services.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.6/2">In light of experience during operations in Iraq in 2003 the Support Chain Programme was established to modernise and make significant improvements in the integration of the different information systems utilised for the management of stores, to drive forward change in logistic and engineering information systems and to provide a robust governance framework for the management of new projects and existing systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.6/3">The Programme is focussing initially on delivering improved operational capability to the Front Line, with major changes to Base systems following on later.</p>
	<p pid="a.326W.6/4">Under the Support Chain Programme the six major supply systems are due to reduce to one over the next few years. Work is also in hand to achieve similar reductions in inventory and warehousing systems. The programme will integrate both legacy and future information systems to retain coherence. To assist this, work is also underway to modernise the means by which applications are able to communicate with one another, with modern technology allowing for the creation of more flexible and intelligent networks. The ultimate aim is to move to a position where MOD is operating a fully integrated stores management system working right across Defence, including industry.</p>

It is the Government's position that criminal investigations led by the police generally represent the best way of achieving this.</p>
