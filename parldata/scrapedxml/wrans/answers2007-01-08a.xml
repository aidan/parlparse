	<p pid="a.2W.0/1">The Malaysian Federal Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, Muslims are subject to Shari'a law with respect to family matters which includes apostasy. Muslims can only change their religion with the permission of a Shari'a Court who will often not allow this, and may order periods of rehabilitation and other penalties for those who attempt to do it. In addition, the application of Shari'a is a state, rather than federal matter and so varies around the country&mdash;the State of Negeri Sembilan allows apostasy. This complicated issue impacts on a minority of people who wish to leave Islam&mdash;a recent survey by an academic found that there were only 100 applications to the Shari'a Courts to apostatise between 1994-2003. The majority of applicants are from people who had previously converted to Islam for the purpose of marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/2">There are no anti-conversion laws in Indonesian civil law. The constitution of Indonesia guarantees freedom of religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/3">There are anti-conversion laws in India. However, to date, nobody has raised with us specific cases of abuse, where anti-conversion laws have been used to prevent someone from willingly changing their religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/4">There is no anti-conversion legislation in Pakistan, although converts from Islam to other religions are subject to various social pressures and harassment and the blasphemy laws are often abused in this context.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/5">The Government, along with our EU partners, follows closely developments in states where anti-conversion laws exist. We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We urge all states to pursue laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect and to protect religious minorities from discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/6">The Malaysian Federal Constitution was amended in 2001 to provide against discrimination on grounds of gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/7">The Malaysian Government ratified Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995 and presented their first report to the CEDAW committee earlier this year. There are concerns that the rights of women in divorce and inheritance are not equal to those of men in the Shari'a Courts. There are also concerns that the proposed new Islamic Family Law Act will do little to alleviate this, with a widespread perception that it is even more detrimental to the status of Muslim women than existing laws, including making polygamy easier. However, the Government is re-examining the bill following concerns by non-governmental organisations and is consulting women's groups on the revision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/8">The Indonesian Government, through the Ministry of Women's Affairs, is actively working to increase the participation of women. In general, women play a significant and growing role in Indonesian society.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/9">In India, there is increasing awareness of women's rights issues. The Government are working with a number of organisations, including the National Commission for Women, to highlight and address these issues. One example includes a sponsored visit to the UK earlier this year by the chairperson of the National Commission for Women.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/10">We welcome the passing of the Women's Protection Bill in Pakistan, which marks a significant step forward on the &quot;enlightened moderation&quot; agenda. We will follow with interest the progress of further proposed reforms to improve women's rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.3W.2/1">We want to encourage China to act as a responsible member of the international community and support its closer integration into the international system, including through multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). To that end, Ministers raise WTO issues regularly in bilaterals with their Chinese counterparts, as indeed I did in July in my visit to China. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry visited China from 26 to <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. He emphasised the need for China to play an active role in the current WTO round and to continue opening up its markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.2/2">The WTO is an important pillar of the multilateral system and we encourage all WTO members to abide by their WTO obligations. At the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 to <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>, EU Foreign Ministers adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission Communication &quot;EU-China: Closer Partners, Growing Responsibilities&quot; and the Commission working paper &quot;Competition and Partnership&quot;. The Commission documents stress the mutual benefits of enhanced trade and economic relations between the EU and China, and the importance of China fully implementing its WTO obligations. The UK worked with other member states to ensure that the Conclusions reflect our position.</p>

	<p pid="a.16W.2/1">Darlington has benefited greatly since 1997 from Government support for its transport needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/2">Between 1997 and March 2006 Darlington borough council received around &pound;22.2 million in block grant for capital investment for its local transport plans. An assessment of Darlington's second Local Transport Plan running until 2011 and a further funding package to support was published in a written statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-18">18 December 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report, </i>columns 132-33WS.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/3">In April 2004, Darlington was allocated &pound;3.24 million over five years as a Sustainable Travel Town. In October 2005 the borough was awarded Cycling Demonstration Town status and allocated &pound;1.5 million over three calendar years.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/4">In the whole of the North East region a total of &pound;457 million has been set aside over the next 10 years for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/5">In the advice from the North East to Government on the allocation of these funds, a &pound;33 million scheme to improve the bus network across the Tees Valley, including Darlington, was identified as a priority. The Government have not yet approved this scheme but have confirmed that it would expect it to be added to the regional programme subject to the promoters producing a satisfactory business case that demonstrates value for money and deliverability.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/6">Darlington has benefited from rail and trunk road improvements both across the North East and nationally, but funding for these is neither recorded nor allocated on an individual transport authority level.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/7">The borough has also received very substantial central funding through revenue support grant. This is not allocated by the Government between individual council services.</p>

	<p pid="a.17W.0/2">Planning Policy Guidance 13 on planning and transport gives a clear preference for locating new retail development in town centre sites first, followed by edge of centre sites and only then out of centre. This is part of a framework of measures aiming to reduce the need to travel and promote more sustainable transport choices, thereby tackling urban congestion. Government policy on out-of-town shopping is therefore consistent with the Eddington study, which identifies this as a priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.2/1">The number of patients removed from waiting lists rose steadily throughout the 1990s, peaking in 1999 then falling and stabilising. The waiting list rules are clear that patients should be removed from lists if they are no longer waiting or are unavailable for treatment. Patients should also be removed from a provider's list when they are transferred to a different provider for treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.2/2">The trends in self-deferrals and suspensions closely follow the trend in the inpatient waiting list. The list peaked in 1998, as did self-deferrals, with suspensions peaking in 1999. The reductions in recent years reflect improved management by the National Health Service, which has contributed to the smaller waiting lists and faster times that patients experience today.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.2/3">The unusually high rates of growth in other referrals, those not from general practitioners or general dental practitioners, in the first three years of the period are likely to reflect improvements in data quality resulting from better recording of this type of activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.2/4">Since 1998-99 the average growth in other referrals is 6 per cent. This growth may be explained by the increasing specialisation of consultants, with more patients being referred from consultant to consultant, and by increases in referrals to consultants from the likes of physiotherapists.</p>

	<p pid="a.24W.2/1">Carisoprodol, brand name Carisoma, is a muscle relaxant authorised as an add on therapy to the symptomatic treatment of acute musculoskeletal disorders associated with muscle spasm. Clinical trials carried out by the marketing authorisation holder for carisoprodol were evaluated at the time of licensing to ensure that it met appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to justify its use as a muscle relaxant. Full guidance on prescribing and the use of carisoprodol, including possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers, the Summary of Product Characteristics, and the patient information leaflet.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.2/2">Since the marketing of carisoprodol, although no formal research has been commissioned, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have kept under review its safety in routine clinical practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.2/3">Up to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</phrase>, a total of 31 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been received in association with carisoprodol. The majority of these (28 out of 31 reports) were received prior to 1982. Of the 31 reports, a total of 20 reports describe suspected side-effects from using carisoprodol that are not listed in the patient information leaflet. Urticaria, three reports, and chills, two reports, are the only unlisted suspected side-effects associated with carisoprodol reported in more than one patient. It is important to note that a report of a suspected ADR does not necessarily mean that the drug caused it.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.2/4">In June 2005 the MHRA was alerted to concerns about the effect that an individual's genetic makeup may have on how they metabolise carisoprodol and that this may have implications for the likelihood of experiencing potential side effects associated with its use. Following a review of the available data, the Summary of Product Characteristics and the patient Information leaflet have been updated to reflect these new data and to add a warning that patients who are so called &quot;poor metabolisers&quot; for a specific enzyme, Cytochrome 2C19, involved in the metabolism of carisoprodol may be at an increased risk of certain side effects such as drowsiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.2/5">In parallel with this action, the overall balance of risks and benefits of carisoprodol has been raised at a European level. The MHRA in conjunction with its European counterparts is currently re-evaluating the risk and benefits of carisoprodol and considering what implications this may have for its clinical use. As soon as the European review is completed the results will be made publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.2/6">The use of carisoprodol in the UK is limited and the British National Formularly, a joint publication of the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, advises doctors that carisoprodol may not be considered as a drug of first choice although its use may be justifiable in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.2/7">The length of time for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to re-evaluate a drug by completing of a risk: benefit review depends on the public health impact of the safety or efficacy concerns and is commensurate with the need for a thorough evaluation of the available data.</p>

	<p pid="a.25W.5/1">The Child Health Interim Application (CHIA) is currently live in 10 primary care trusts (PCTs) in the London area. Supporting manual systems continue to operate for some aspects of the system's functionality, which remain under development. Software to enable PCTs to generate COVER reports from the live system is expected to be deployed into the live system in April 2007. Meanwhile, COVER reports for each PCT, using live CHIA data, are being produced centrally on a quarterly basis in line with Health Protection Agency submission requirements. However, due to a backlog of data, which have not yet been loaded on to the CHIA system, some PCTs have requested their data are not published until local data quality queries have been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.5/2">Successful deployments of child health systems by the national programme for information technology have already taken place in 48 PCTs across the programme's north-east and eastern cluster areas. The system enables production of the required statutory reports, and a robust data migration and checking procedure is in place, ensuring successful migrations of demographic and clinical data to the new system, which provides a fully integrated patient record across primary care. Experience has shown that the key variable around successful implementation and operation is the quality of local record keeping standards and processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.5/1">The Audit Commission estimated the annual cost of their recommendations for a clinical coding audit programme at &pound;6.7 million per year. This is detailed in &quot;Payment by Results assurance framework: Pilot results and recommendations&quot; published by the Audit Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase>, which is available in the Library. The Department is still discussing the final details of the scheme and its scope in 2007-08 with the Audit Commission and it is likely that the final costs will be lower than those contained in the report.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.8/1">A central assessment of the effectiveness of the community matron scheme has not been made. This is because monitoring the effectiveness of programmes of this nature is best done locally, by NHS trusts, working with their partners and stakeholders. However, the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre, was funded to carry out an in-depth evaluation of the Evercare pilot, the precursor to the community matron service. This work enabled important lessons to be incorporated into the setting up of community matrons.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.0/1">The Government commissioned a full review of the research arrangements at North Staffordshire hospital in 1999, in response to concerns about how research had been conducted there by Dr. David Southall, among others. The review, chaired by Professor Rod Griffiths, reported in May 2000 and the Government accepted all the recommendations of the &quot;Report of a review of the research framework in North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust&quot;, The Griffiths Report. The report recommended a substantial audit of the use of continuous negative extrathoracic pressure, a research intervention, to see if claims of significant benefit or damage could be substantiated. The findings were published in <i> The Lancet</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> as &quot;Outcome after neonatal continuous negative-pressure ventilation: follow-up assessment&quot; by Katherine Telford et al.</p>

Policies such as Liberating the Talents 2002, the Chief Nursing Officer's review of the nursing contribution to vulnerable children 2004 and the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services 2004 all reinforce the preventive contribution of health visitors, in particular for the most vulnerable children and families.

The Department and the new opportunities fund have provided funding of &pound;125 million to build 90 new or replacement catheterisation laboratories in England, increasing the capacity previously available by more than 50 per cent. The emerging findings from our national study of primary angioplasty show that the best times are achieved by ambulance paramedic triage and taking patients direct to the catheterisation laboratory without going via the A and E department.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.2/3">It is more appropriate for stroke victims to be taken directly to a stroke unit rather than to an A and E unit. Early analysis of best evidence provides an estimate that to provide immediate scanning for all stroke patients and increase uptake of thrombolysis to four per cent. Currently being achieved by the centre with the highest thrombolysis rate in England, it will cost &pound;6.7 to &pound;8.7 million. To increase uptake to 10 per cent. (Currently being achieved by leading centres around the world) the estimated cost is &pound;10.9 to &pound;12.9 million. However, analysis also demonstrates that this investment will result in considerable long-term savings, and allow a significant number of stroke patients to not only survive, but to live fully independent lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.38W.5/1">The national service framework for coronary heart disease set a target that thrombolysis, treatment with clot-busting drugs, should be given to heart attack patients within 60 minutes of calling for professional help. Good progress has been made with meeting this target but there has been less progress in reducing the time from pain to call. Public awareness of symptoms is a key issue here. The Department is supporting the British Heart Foundation's recently launched campaign to raise awareness of heart attack symptoms. Primary angioplasty is most effective when delivered within three hours of onset of symptoms but will provide some benefit up to 12 hours after they have developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.38W.5/2">Thrombolysis for stroke patients must be delivered within three hours of onset of stroke. The licence for the thrombolytic drug for stroke is only for delivery within three hours. It must be noted that a stroke may not involve pain so increasing awareness of the symptoms of stroke is an important part of delivering thrombolysis. The Department is currently supporting the Stroke Association FAST campaign which provides a clear and simple test to identify a stroke.</p>

	<p pid="a.46W.5/1">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme. Approximately 19,000 reports of suspected ADRs are reported to the MHRA/CHM through this scheme each year by health professionals and patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.5/2">The MHRA are committed to making information about the yellow scheme and the information it collects as accessible as possible on the MHRA website. Information on the Yellow Card Scheme website was most recently updated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase>. Drug analysis prints were most recently updated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-18">18 November 2006</phrase> to include ADR data received by the MHRA up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-26">26 May 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.5/3">The MHRA is currently implementing a major upgrade of the drug safety monitoring database and data reporting systems. This upgrade includes a review of the presentation of aggregated drug safety information with a view to making the information easier to interpret. Subsequent to this redesign, the MHRA will update the adverse drug reaction data on a three-monthly cycle.</p>

	<p pid="a.47W.2/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the United Kingdom regulatory authority with responsibility for the licensing and control of medicines on the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.2/2">In the UK, medicinal products on the UK market are controlled under the 1968 Medicines Act and supporting regulations. The Act places controls on the sale, supply, distribution and manufacture of medicinal products in the UK. It also places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State for Health to enforce, or secure the enforcement of, the provisions of the Act. Section 8 contains rights of entry, powers to inspect products and equipment, to take samples and to seize products and documentation in order to ascertain whether or not there may have been a contravention of the legislative requirements. MHRA guidance on the legislative requirements is available in the &quot;Rules and Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Distributors 2002&quot; and on the MHRA website at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>. No specific MHRA guidance is issued to retailers.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.2/3">Medicinal products which do not meet the regulatory requirements cannot be guaranteed for their safety, quality or efficacy and may pose a significant risk to public health and their sale or supply may constitute a criminal offence. Products suspected of breaching these legislative requirements can be inspected, sampled and seized under powers available under section 8 of the Act. If it is not known whether or not a product offered for sale is falling outside licensing requirements, a sample can be taken and submitted for analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.2/4">Enforcement officers at MHRA carry out investigations into suspected illegal activity involving medicines on a UK-wide basis. If products in stock at a retail outlet are found to be illegally on sale, they can be seized and removed from the premises. The products seized from Hedonic in Southsea were in response to an adverse drug reaction report for a product on sale for humans and containing Benzyl Piperazine (BZP) a derivative of a veterinary product, Piperazine. MHRA investigations are continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.51W.5/1">Tackling MRSA is a priority for Government and the national health service. We have set a target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by 2008 and each acute trust has its own target. The Department and its partner organisations have developed a range of mutually reinforcing activities that ensure combating the spread of MRSA is embedded in everyday procedures and policies, in particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/2" class="indent">all acute trusts are signed-up to the 'Saving Lives' package of best practice which, if implemented in full, should combat MRSA spread in the acute sector. It is supplemented by the 'Essential Steps' initiative, designed for non-acute care settings;</p>

	<p pid="a.51W.5/4" class="indent">the first ever national hand hygiene programme for hospital staff 'cleanyourhands', has progressed to its second year;</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/5" class="indent">a root cause analysis tool was published in September 2006 to help trusts investigate and better understand how and why MRSA bloodstream infections occur and hence where they should focus their action to prevent them;</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/6" class="indent">a statutory code of practice which requires NHS bodies to have appropriate management and clinical governance systems in place to deliver effective infection control came into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/7" class="indent">enhanced advice on screening patients at risk was published on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/8" class="indent">acute trusts have been invited to apply for additional capital resources to help tackle healthcare associated infections, with &pound;50 million set aside for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/9">Additionally, tailored support is available for those trusts in the most challenging positions. Improvement teams will during 2006-07, work with about 50 trusts, so as to help identify those issues that prevent reduction in infections at the local level, and help them develop action plans to speed up and sustain progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/1">National health service resource allocation is based on the principle of weighted-capitation, whereby resources are distributed between areas on the basis of the relative needs of their populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/2">The weighted-capitation formula is continuously overseen by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA). ACRA's role is to ensure equity in resource allocation. ACRA is an independent body which has NHS management, general practitioner, and academic members. Prior to each allocations round, ACRA agrees a work programme to support the revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs). On completion of the work programme, ACRA makes recommendations to Ministers on possible changes to the weighted-capitation formula. Decisions on changes to the weighted-capitation formula are made prior to each allocations round.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/3">Since 1997 the following changes have been made to the weighted capitation formula:</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/4" class="italic"> 1997-98 changes to the weighted capitation formula</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/5">In 1997-98 two changes were made to HCHS allocations:</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/7" class="indent">the staff market forces factor (MFF) was revised.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/11" class="indent">the emergency ambulance cost adjustment (EACA) was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/12">One change was made to prescribing allocations, with the introduction of new age/sex weights.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/13" class="italic"> 1999-2000 changes to the weighted-capitation formula</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/14">Prior to 1999-2000, there were separate funding streams for HCHS, prescribing and general practice infrastructure (GMSCL). In 1999-2000 these became a single unified allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/15">In addition, an English language difficulties adjustment (ELDA) was introduced as a supplement to the formula, for the extra costs of interpretation, advocacy and translation services.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/16" class="italic"> 2001-02 changes to the weighted-capitation formula</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/17">In 2001-02 an interim health inequalities adjustment (HIA) was introduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/21" class="indent">the additional need adjustment in the new GMSNCL component replaced the existing additional need adjustment in the general medical services cash limited (GMSCL) component;</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/23" class="indent">the HIV/AIDS special allocations became part of the unified allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/24" class="italic"> 2003-04 changes to the weighted-capitation formula</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/25">In November 1998, Ministers announced a wide ranging review of the weighted-capitation formula. The main objective for this review was &quot;to contribute to the reduction in avoidable health inequalities&quot;. The review was carried out under the auspices of ACRA. The new formula replaced both the existing formula and the HIA, and has been used for the 2003-04 to 2005-06 and the 2006-07 and 2007-08 allocations rounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/32">The following changes were made to the weighted-capitation formula for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations:</p>

	<p pid="a.64W.2/1">The Government are serious about tackling alcohol misuse and reducing alcohol-related harms. The Know Your Limits campaign focuses on young people who are binge drinkers, because research shows that 18 to 24-year-olds are most likely to drink irresponsibly and cause harm to themselves and others. It aims to ensure that sufficient information exists to help everyone to become more aware of the risks to individual health and personal safety that alcohol misuse can bring, and to make informed choices on the basis of that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/2">The campaign is designed also to reach a secondary audience of hazardous, harmful, dependent, and pregnant drinkers. These groups are being targeted through public relations and stakeholder work. Literature advising people how to drink sensibly has been produced by the Department, which targets these audiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/3">We have seen a fall in the proportion of men drinking more than the daily benchmarks on at least one day in the previous week, from 39 per cent. in 2004 to 35 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.64W.2/4">I am also pleased that the Drinkaware Trust has appointed as its new chair Debra Shipley, whom I very much look forward to working with as she takes the trust forward over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.5/1">Information on the number of children prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate) is not collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.5/2">In March 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the use of drugs to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). NICE has estimated that around 5 per cent. of school-aged children meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, equivalent to 366,000 children and adolescents in England and Wales, but not all these children will require medication. In the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase>, 384,000 prescriptions for methylphenidate were dispensed in England to children aged 0 to 15 years and those aged 16 to 18 years in full time education.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.5/3">We have no evidence to suggest that inappropriate prescribing of methylphenidate is widespread. NICE has recommended that drug treatment for ADHD should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.5/4">Methylphenidate is classified under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 as a schedule two controlled drug. As such, it is subject to additional restrictions in its use, for example it must be kept in a secure place that meets the requirements of the Safe Custody Regulations 1973. Amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in July 2006 brought in a standard prescription form for private prescribing of schedule two and three controlled drugs. Thus, the national data will now cover both national health service and private prescribing of methylphenidate by prescriber but not by patient.</p>

	<p pid="a.68W.0/1">The most recent estimate of the burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the United Kingdom comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside, suggested that ADRs account for 6 per cent. of hospital admissions. This is a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures from the United States. The study did not differentiate between prescribed and unprescribed medicines; however the majority of ADRs were associated with prescribed medicines. The projected annual cost of such admissions to the national health service (NHS) is &pound;466 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.0/2">This study highlights the importance of effective systems for monitoring and responding to issues relating to the safety of medicines, a process called 'pharmacovigilance'. This study, which was funded by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency {MHRA), underlines the Agency's commitment to improving the evidence base for pharmacovigilance in the UK. As part of this commitment to improving pharmacovigilance, the MHRA is working to strengthen and widen access to the Yellow Card Scheme for reporting suspected ADRs. Access has recently been widened to allow patients to report.</p>

	<p pid="a.70W.2/1">For in 2006-07 the Department decided to issue the education and training (MPET) budget, which provides a significant contribution to hospital training grade doctor budgets, as part of a bundle of central budgets to strategic health authorities (SHAs). The bundle included money to fund workforce programmes, the quality and outcomes framework, clinical excellence awards as well as other miscellaneous programmes. This has provided the SHAs with the maximum flexibility to determine locally their own priorities, including investment in education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.70W.2/2">The MPET budget was not cut in the 2006-07 allocations, in fact, allowing for inflation, it was broadly similar to the level of funding in 2005-06. However, within the overall resources allocated, it is up to each SHA to determine their own priorities including how much is invested in education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.70W.2/3">The NHS South East Coast reports that it has agreed a reduction across all devolved central budgets, including MPET. Although, the SHA has identified budgets that will receive a reduced allocation, it has not been prescriptive in terms of how the savings are made.</p>

	<p pid="a.76W.6/1">Working alongside the Government of Afghanistan and our partners from the United Nations and NATO, our strategic aim is a secure and stable Afghanistan, with a self-sustaining economy, strong institutions and broad-based representative government committed to eradicating terrorism, eliminating opium production, reducing poverty, and respecting human rights. We assess progress is being made against these objectives, especially in areas such as the development of democracy, the fostering of minority rights (87 women sit in the Afghan Parliament) and the development of a legitimate economy: for example, the International Monetary Fund estimated Afghanistan's economic growth averaged around 22 per cent. between 2002 and 2004, 8 per cent. in 2004-05 and up to 14 per cent. in 2005-06. The security situation has also developed substantially with the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force across the entire country, a development in which the British armed forces played a substantial role.</p>

	<p pid="a.79W.2/1">The protection of our forces remains a top priority and improvements in armoured fighting vehicles training continue to be made following my written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-15">15 June 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 14WS, that the Department would be seeking alternatives to the Private Finance Initiative as a means of securing improvements in the delivery of this training.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.2/2">Recent improvements in armoured vehicle training have included the introduction into service of a new 120mm Live Crew Gunnery trainer (Sub Calibre Device) for Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank in June 2006 and an improved Warrior Gunnery Turret Trainer that is due to enter service in February 2007. In addition, the Defence Procurement Agency is exploring options for an Enhanced Capability for Armoured Training Systems (ECATS) programme which includes determination of the cost boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.2/3">About 50 new vehicles, plus training support, are also being provided to meet the pre-deployment training demands for new vehicles in theatre. I can confirm that, following the statement made on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 74-76WS, refers a pool of about 300 vehicles to be used only on operations is being created including VECTOR, MASTIFF and BULLDOG with a proportion being retained to support pre-deployment training. This pool of vehicles will be resourced from the Conflict Prevention Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.82W.9/1">Devonport Royal Dockyard is a strategic asset that plays a direct role in maintaining the UK's nuclear deterrent. The Government require assurance that any prospective change of ownership of Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd. (DRDL) or any new influence or control should not adversely affect the essential security interests of the UK. On this basis the Government need to assess whether the planned separation of KBR from Halliburton would be acceptable. MOD is now in active discussion with KBR to ensure that the UK's essential security interests are protected. The ability for Devonport Management Ltd. to bid freely for defence contracts is a key element of these interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.84W.5/1">The total number of value for money exercises the Ministry of Defence has conducted on the use of management consultants and professional advisors in the last five years is not held centrally and could be only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.5/2">However, it is a requirement that before any engagement of management consultants or professional advisers within the Department, there is close scrutiny whereby managers have first to consult internally to ensure that the expertise is not available. Once this avenue has been explored, managers must raise a full business case explaining why there is a requirement to procure the work. The business case must state the impact of not doing the work and include a value for money assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.5/3">Departmental guidance makes it clear that external assistance should be used only when all other options for getting the task completed internally have been considered and rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.5/4">With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> arrangements have been introduced across the Department to tighten up the process of procuring consultancy even further, to ensure that MOD's internal consultancy resources are considered before engaging external assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.5/5">The same principles apply to buying in external assistance as apply to buying any other goods or services for the MOD.

	<p pid="a.89W.8/1">As at mid-November 2006, 120 claimants had been paid under the Ex Gratia Payment Scheme for former Far East Prisoners of War and civilian internees, on the basis that they met the 20-year residence criterion. Five claims had been rejected on the grounds that the claimant was unable to prove internment. No claims have been rejected for failing to meet the residency criterion; the nine claims that might currently fall into this category are being held pending a review of the way that the criterion is working that I will shortly be undertaking, taking account of the views of the Association of British Civilian Internees Far East Region (ABCIFER). 47 other cases remained under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.8/2">Employment overseas can count towards the 20-year qualifying period where there is reasonable evidence that the individual was expected to return to the UK. However, it does not count where there was no reasonable evidence that they would return to the UK, including cases where the individual was locally employed; this is because the close link to the UK, which is an overall requirement of the scheme, is not considered to have been demonstrated. It would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the scheme to allow such service to count and, were we to do so, it would have very significant financial implications for the eligibility criteria for the military side of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.89W.8/3">To respond to concerns that a number of those who do not qualify under the ex gratia scheme may be suffering hardship, officials have investigated the feasibility of providing financial assistance to a charity supporting such individuals.

	<p pid="a.91W.0/2">Devonport Royal Dockyard is a strategic asset that plays a direct role in maintaining the UK's nuclear deterrent. The Government require assurance that any prospective change of ownership of Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd (DRDL) or any new influence or control should not adversely affect the essential security interests of the UK. On this basis the Government need to assess whether the planned separation of KBR from Halliburton would be acceptable. MOD is now in active discussion with KBR to ensure that the UK's essential security interests are protected. The ability for Devonport Management Ltd. to bid freely for defence contracts is a key element of these interests.</p>

This represents around 1.5 per cent. of personnel deployed to Operation Telic over the same period. Of this number, 278 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

	<p pid="a.91W.7/3">The figures do not include any personnel who have received treatment for a mental health condition since leaving the armed forces. This is because on leaving the armed forces, or on demobilisation for reservists, it is the long established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. To collate figures on medical treatment received by every veteran would require an examination of the records of every NHS trust (and every independent healthcare provider) in the country and could therefore be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.7/4">At a time when personnel have been deployed to other operational theatres before or after deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition (which in some cases might not present itself until some time after the person's deployment ends) to service on a specific deployment. We therefore have not conducted a similar collation for Afghanistan. The Department is currently reviewing its methods of collating figures on service personnel diagnosed with a mental health condition.</p>

We have demonstrated our commitment to the irreversibility of nuclear disarmament. We continue to reiterate our unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of our nuclear arsenal leading to nuclear disarmament and have undertaken several unilateral steps towards nuclear disarmament including reductions in warhead numbers, increased transparency by publishing historical accounting records of our defence fissile material holdings and reduced the operational status of our deterrent.</p>

We continue to reaffirm our commitment to achieving the general and complete disarmament objectives of Article VI. We report regularly in a number of different formats and fora on the progress we have made under Article VI. We have pursued a widely welcomed programme to develop UK expertise in methods and technologies that could be used to verify nuclear disarmament. Finally, we produced a series of working papers culminating in a presentation at the 2005 NPT Review Conference. The Atomic Weapons Establishment continues to undertake research in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.101W.6/2">The Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) recognises that long-term value for money is the bedrock of the Ministry of Defence's procurement policy, while delivering the equipment and capability the armed forces needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.6/3">Open and fair competition both at prime and subcontract level remains one of the key mechanisms by which we achieve this. MOD rules require procurements to be advertised in either the <i> Official Journal of the European Union</i>, the MOD Contracts Bulletin or the European Defence Agency's Electronic Bulletin Board. All tenders are evaluated on the same basis and against the same award criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.101W.6/4">The DIS also recognises that competition is not always appropriate in achieving long term value for money but must be used intelligently alongside other options, having considered the nature of the marketplace. This assists in militating against the possibility of dominant private sector companies winning most or all outsourced defence business unless won in open and fair competition. A Key role of the new Defence Commercial Director is to ensure that particular companies do not achieve a dominant position that is not in the UK's interest.</p>

The Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75 (AFPS 75) is, and always has been, non-contributory and unfunded. The military salary was introduced in 1970 and from 1971 the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) began to make recommendations regarding military salary following consideration of civilian comparators.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.2/2">In 1981 the AFRPB recommended, following a Government Actuary's report, that the value of the AFPS 75 pension should be taken into consideration as part of overall earnings for service personnel during the process of remuneration comparison and in judging the appropriate levels of military salaries. As a result an adjustment was introduced by the AFPRB in making their overall pay recommendations to reflect the non-contributory value of AFPS 75 benefits as compared with the contributory pension benefits of comparator employees.</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.8/1">The HM Armed Forces Veterans Badge was introduced to provide a public mark of those who have served in the UK armed forces and are still alive; it was designed to allow veterans living in the community to be identified and to raise awareness of their number and diversity. One exception to this rule was made for War Widow(er)s who are in receipt of a War Widow(er)'s pension to recognise the unique circumstances of their spouses who were prevented from receiving their badge because of death attributable to illness or injury sustained during military service to their country. The badge is not a commemorative medal and we have no plans to introduce a posthumous entitlement more widely for widows of veterans who gave service in the First or Second World War and who died of natural causes, or for the children of deceased veterans.</p>

In addition, the survey of smaller music venues published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase> suggests that many premises previously restricted to operating under the 'two in a bar' rule can now offer a greater choice of live music for consumers by putting on more than two musicians.</p>

	<p pid="a.116W.2/1">Members of Parliament and local councillors may make representations on behalf of anyone who is an interested party under the Licensing Act 2003. This includes a person living in the vicinity of a premises. A councillor making a representation, who is also a member of the licensing committee, would be expected to disqualify themselves from any involvement in the decision-making process affecting the premises licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/2">Councillors are subject to the code of conduct for local authority members. The code includes rules on members' personal and prejudicial interests. A member has a prejudicial interest in an issue when they have an interest which a member of the public would reasonably regard as so significant that it would be likely to prejudice the member's judgment of the public interest. A member with a prejudicial interest in an issue is required to withdraw from the meeting where it is being discussed. The Department for Communities and Local Government is currently reviewing the code of conduct, and intends to consult shortly on a draft revised code. This will include proposed changes to the rules on prejudicial interests which will support members' advocacy role.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/3">Councillors also have a duty to act in the interests of all of their constituents. Their role as a community advocate must therefore be balanced with their ability to represent specific interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.117W.6/2">In October, I received from Jack Lemley his views on the progress of the Olympic delivery programme, drawing attention to the discussion at the Olympic Delivery Authority's (ODA) board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">28 September</phrase> of land remediation on the Olympic Park site. I was already aware of the ODA board discussions and the progress of ongoing site investigations within the park.</p>
	<p pid="a.117W.6/3">As Sir Roy McNulty, acting chair of the ODA, said in his statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>, the Stratford site is complex and much of the land will need remediating before construction. This was known from the very start of the bid process. For that reason, the London Development Agency (LDA) have had an expert team carrying out soil investigation work over recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.117W.6/4">At the September ODA board meeting chaired by Mr. Lemley, there was a detailed presentation, which included an update from the LDA's contractors currently on site. This presentation set out for the board the site investigations undertaken to date. These investigations have identified a variety of contaminants, such as metals and hydrocarbons, which are common on sites that have this kind of former industrial use. The expert team indicated that the levels of contamination assessed to date were in line with expectations and that the time allowed for remediation appears to be adequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.117W.6/5">The site investigation contractors have now investigated the majority of the land. The remaining land the ODA does not yet have access to because it is still occupied by businesses and residents who, with the exception of a very few, will be relocated by July 2007 subject to confirmation of the compulsory purchase order. The LDA, with an expert team advising, and the interim ODA team (as it was at that time), had previously identified the technologies required to tackle the contamination and have some of the best contractors available with these technologies ready to treat the soil when the site becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="a.118W.2/2">Before engaging KPMG the Department had already opened discussions within Government, in autumn 2005, on the VAT status of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). Our expectation was that ODA would be able to recover its VAT, in common with a number of other bodies which have functions akin to those of local authorities. As part of their work KPMG estimated the amount of VAT to be recovered. DCMS received KPMG's initial assessment of ODA's potential VAT costs in December 2005 and received revised estimates in March, May and August 2006. The Government are continuing to discuss the VAT status of the ODA.</p>

	<p pid="a.119W.8/2">48 public appointments to the NDPBs for which DCMS is responsible are vacant, and are either under discussion or in the process of being filled. There is no prescribed target time for filling vacancies, and the length of the appointments procedures can vary considerably depending on the role and the body involved. However, the Cabinet Office guidance, &quot;Making and Managing Appointments, a Guide for Departments&quot;, suggests that most Departments consider that about six to nine months is the minimum lead time for most appointments.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.5/1">It is not possible to provide the information requested for the Wantage parliamentary constituency as the DNA subject sample records held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) relate to police force area, not to parliamentary constituency area or local authority area. However, data are available for Thames Valley police which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire including Wantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.5/2">It is estimated that as at early December 2006 that there were approximately 103,600 individuals with a DNA profile on the NDNAD taken by Thames Valley police (TVP). These individuals would have been arrested, detained in a police station and had a DNA sample taken by TVP, but would not necessarily be resident in the TVP force area.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.0/1">It is not necessarily straightforward to say that an arrest is made on the basis of DNA evidence, as police investigations will often involve looking at several different types of evidence including DNA, and an arrest may be made on the basis of the whole package of evidence. We are, however, aware of two cases in which arrests were made on the basis of mistaken DNA evidence since the establishment of the NDNAD in 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/2">In October 1997 a bloodstain from the burglary of a dwelling was matched to a Mr. K who was arrested by the Metropolitan Police. In fact samples provided by Mr K. and Mr. H had been accidentally switched in the laboratory. Mr K. began legal action against the Forensic Science Service but did not complete it within the legally prescribed period.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/3">In August 1999, Mr E. was arrested on the basis of a DMA sample found in a burglary 150 miles from his home. He was suffering from Parkinson's disease and could not have got to the crime scene unaided. This was an SGM match&mdash;use of the more discriminating SGM plus technique (explained as follows) showed the first match was incorrect and the charges were dropped.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/4">These errors must be seen in the context of almost 300,000 matches between crime scenes and individuals during the period 1998-99 to 2005-06. Use of DMA profiling is an extremely reliable technique.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/5">Continuous quality monitoring of suppliers is carried out through the NDNAD's supplier accreditation section, and barcode and electronic document scanning systems are used in laboratories to minimise the possibility of human error.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/6">The SGM technique introduced in 1995 looks at six areas of DMA plus the area showing the person's sex and has a one in 50 million chance of being incorrect (the odds are very probably much better than this).</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/7">Home Office Circular 58/2004 and the ACPO DMA Good Practice Guide advise that where a match of a crime scene to an individual involves an SGM profile, strong consideration should be given to upgrading the SGM profile to SGM Plus to ensure that there is still a match.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.0/8">If a person is to be charged on the basis of a DNA match, the CPS require that there must be supporting non-DNA evidence available to be used in evidence. No-one is ever prosecuted solely on the basis of a DNA match; the DNA evidence is one piece of the information that the courts would require for a successful prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.3/2">Between 1999-2000 and 2003-04 the Government allocated funding for victims of domestic violence and their children through the Violence Against Women Initiative within the Crime Reduction Programme. The allocated budget for England and Wales from 2002-03 was as follows: 2002-03&mdash;&pound;6,355,000; 2003-04&mdash;&pound;7,145,000 (&pound;6 million allocated to the Violence Against Women Initiative, &pound;1 million allocated to a national awareness raising campaign, and &pound;145,000 allocated for domestic violence victims with no recourse to public funds); 2004-05&mdash;&pound;1,650,000 (&pound;1.1 million allocated to the Home Office Regional Directors fund for local delivery of support for victims of domestic violence and their children, &pound;500,000 allocated to a national awareness raising campaign, and &pound;50,000 allocated to implement the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004); 2005-06&mdash;&pound;5,500,000 (&pound;3 million allocated to the Home Office Regional Directors fund for local delivery of support for victims of domestic violence and their children, &pound;1 million to support the development of the Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme, &pound;1 million to fund a variety of projects including a matrix of national domestic violence helplines, and &pound;500,000 allocated to a national awareness raising campaign which rolled out between 2005-06 and 2006-07); 2006-07&mdash;&pound;6,000,000 (&pound;3 million allocated to the Home Office Regional Directors fund for local delivery of support for victims of domestic violence and their children, &pound;1 million to support the Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme, &pound;1 million to develop Independent Domestic Violence Advisors services for Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme areas, and &pound;1 million to fund a variety of projects including a matrix of national domestic violence helplines).</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.3/3">These budgets contribute towards the delivery of the National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence, a cross-Government plan which focuses on a range of key work objectives from early intervention and prevention through to developing a co-ordinated community response to tackling domestic violence. The budgets for the next five years are not yet confirmed. However, the effective prevention, and tackling, of domestic violence continues to be a Government priority.</p>

Each case was settled for &pound;3,807.10 excluding costs giving a total figure of &pound;749,998.70.

A Council Act of <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November 2003</phrase> (OJ C two, 6.1.2004, p.1) recommended adoption by the member states of a Protocol amending the Convention including certain of its provisions relating to the computerised system of collected information.

Certain provisions enabling Europol to operate the Protocol are included in two draft Council Decisions now under consideration in the Europol Management Board. These deal with aspects of processing of personal data and the rules applicable to analysis work files. The Government supports the purposes of the draft Council Decisions subject to consideration of the awaited Opinion on data protection matters of the independent Joint Supervisory Body established under the Convention.

	<p pid="a.143W.2/2">The National Identity Scheme is the result of a process of continuing development and consultation, beginning several years before the Identity Cards Act received Royal Assent in March 2006. The consultation paper, &quot;Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud&quot;, was published in July 2002 and invited views on whether a scheme should be implemented and if so, how. As a result of responses received during the six month consultation period, the Government announced their decision to introduce a scheme in &quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot;, published in November 2003. A draft Bill was then published and consulted on before the first Identity Cards Bill was introduced to Parliament in November 2004. The scheme has continued to develop as the legislation has undergone parliamentary scrutiny and following Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/3">The Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Identity Cards Bill set out other initiatives which were under way with the objectives of tackling illegal immigration and illegal working, security and organised crime, identity fraud and improving the administration of public services. The National Identity Scheme is not intended to be the sole method of solving any of these problems and other initiatives will continue alongside the scheme which will complement these other initiatives, not replace them.</p>

	<p pid="a.161W.2/1">Protecting the public from the harm caused by sex offenders is a priority for this Government. The means of tackling sex offending are constantly developing, and we work together with the front-line agencies to review their effectiveness and, where necessary, make improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.161W.2/2">Since the establishment in 1997 of a notification requirement for sex offenders to register with their local police (sex offender registration) there have been a number of major developments in measures to monitor sex offenders in the community. The notification requirements themselves have been strengthened by part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and in 2001 we introduced statutory multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) across England and Wales to enhance risk assessment and management of serious sexual and violent offenders. Similar arrangements are being introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.161W.2/3">The MAPPA were further strengthened by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and, in 2005, ViSOR (the violent and sex offender register) was successfully rolled out to the police service with plans to extend to the prison and probation services (local authority criminal justice social work departments in Scotland). ViSOR currently provides a national database of intelligence about the behaviour, residence and identity of sexual offenders and will include violent offenders by December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.161W.2/4">The Home Secretary has commissioned a review of the management of child sex offenders in the community, in order to identify additional public protection measures. The review is due to report in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.168W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions recognises the valuable efforts of carers in supporting sick or disabled family members, friends and neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/2">Depending upon their circumstances, carers have access to the full range of social security benefits. In particular, through payment of carer's allowance, the Department provides income maintenance support to over 450,000 carers providing at least 35 hours of care per week for severely disabled people receiving attendance allowance, or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component, or a constant attendance allowance paid under the industrial injuries disablement benefit or war pension schemes. Around 216,000 low-income carers are supported through the carer premium in income support and income-based jobseekers allowance, while a further 195,000 receive the carers additional amount in pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/3">We are continuing to make it easier for carers to claim their benefit entitlements. Since December 2003, carers have been able to make electronic claims for carer's allowance. Next month, we are introducing a shortened claim form for pension-age carers, which will make it easier for them to claim carer's allowance and, subsequently, the carer's additional amount in pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/4">The Pensions Bill, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>, contains a number of initiatives to help carers build up better entitlement to state pensions. It includes a new 'carers credit' for those caring for severely disabled people for at least 20 hours a week, a reduction to 30 in the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension, and changes to make it easier for carers to accrue the second state pension. The reduction in qualifying years for the full basic state pension will particularly help carers with gaps in their work records.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/5">Working age carer's allowance claimants who wish to combine caring and work have access to a range of support and services available from Jobcentre Plus, for example through the New Deal or a voluntary work focused interview with a trained personal advisor.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/6">As with all our policies, the Department will continue to regularly evaluate its support for carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.5/2">At the outset of a claim for benefit steps are taken to confirm that the address provided exists and is correct, by matching the details provided with historical data held within the Department. Decision notices issued when entitlement is established, and annual award notices issued when benefit rates change include written reminders of the need for customers to notify changes of address. In addition to this when it is known that an address is out of date and the customer is in receipt of benefit, steps are taken to obtain the correct address details.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.5/3">If an address could not be traced banks would be contacted to suspend payments and data matching takes place with organisations such as Royal Mail re-direct. Change of address details notified to one part of the Department are shared with other agencies within the Department through cross-benefit computer systems. These systems also hold addresses from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), where many customers in receipt of child benefit, child tax credits and new tax credits are also customers of this Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.5/4">The Department has a dedicated team, who are responsible for the quality and integrity of personal details data held within the Customer Databases Programme, and is constantly seeking new ways of maintaining all personal data, including up to date addresses. In order to maintain correct address details and up to date postcodes, the Post Office Address File is run against the DWP Customer Databases on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.5/5">Work is currently under way with HMRC on a project set up to examine taxpayer's out of date address data, which is then checked through Post Office Redirect and credit reference data, with any new addresses found notified from HMRC to DWP. There are safeguards in place to ensure that correct addresses for customers in receipt of benefit are not overwritten by this data without confirmation that the individual has moved.</p>

	<p pid="a.174W.8/1">Since 1997 the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport, most recently through the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 which met our commitment to put in place a comprehensive and enforceable set of rights for disabled people. Disabled people in Clwyd, South will have benefited from these significant improvements in disability rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.174W.8/2">The number of disabled people in Clwyd, South claiming disability living allowance or attendance allowance, and thus benefiting from the enhancement of independence and social integration that these benefits provide, has increased by almost 24 per cent. from around 6,200 in May 1997 to about 7,700 in May 2006. These include some 20 disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually, unable to walk and are currently receiving the disability living allowance higher-rate mobility component following the Government's decision in 2001 to reduce the lower age limit for entitlement from five to three years of age<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.174W.8/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since 1997 the number of long-term unemployed in Clwyd, South has fallen by 64 per cent. and the number of young people that are long-term unemployed by 47 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.174W.8/4">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 15 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with over 3,700 in Clwyd, South.</p>

It is difficult to estimate what the cost of the proposals would be after taking into account tax and benefit offsets.</p>
	<p pid="a.175W.5/3">In order to consider what reduction there would be in the income-related benefits, we would need data on the income distribution of those benefiting from FAS, the tax brackets they are in and their benefit entitlements. We do not hold such data. We cannot use the data held on income distribution over the whole of the pensioner population, as we cannot know if this relatively small group of people are typical of the entire population. The same applies to estimating increases in tax revenue.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.2/2">There was, and is, no specific benefit legislation to cover weavers. When deciding entitlement to benefits, weavers are treated in the same way as any other worker whose employment is seasonal.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/3">In any case of seasonal employment, the Department looks at the pattern of employment over a recognisable cycle, usually one year. If the average number of hours worked each week of this cycle is 16 or more the person is treated as in remunerative work for the whole of the period, and not entitled to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/4">If the average number of hours worked over the cycle is less than 16 per week the person may be entitled to benefit, depending on their income. Seasonal self-employed workers have their income, less any allowable deductions, averaged over the period of the work cycle to determine a weekly amount of earnings. An amount, usually &pound;5 for a single person, is disregarded each week.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/5">The Harris Tweed weavers are designated as self-employed as, while they are provided with yarn to weave the tweed, they work on a self-employed rather than an employed basis. They cannot therefore be counted as unemployed during periods when they have no work.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/6">This policy has been applied since February 2006 following a decision from the Social Security Commissioners in October 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.6/1">The information requested is in the following table. The package of reforms in the White Paper &quot;Security in Retirement: Towards a New Pension System&quot; is designed to:</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/2" class="indent">promote personal responsibility: tackling the problem of undersaving for retirement;</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/3" class="indent">be fair: protecting the poorest, and being fair to women and carers, to savers, and between generations;</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/4" class="indent">be simple: clarifying the respective roles of the State, the employer and the individual;</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/5" class="indent">be affordable: maintaining macro-economic stability and striking the right balance for provision between the State, the employer and the individual; and</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/6" class="indent">be sustainable: setting the basis of an enduring national consensus, while being flexible to future trends.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/7">The reforms to state pensions will provide a solid foundation for private saving, both by limiting the spread of pension credit entitlement and by delivering a simpler and more predictable state pension outcome. Under the proposed reforms, even with the standard guarantee credit linked to earnings to protect the poorest, only 6 per cent. of pensioner households will be eligible to guarantee credit only, with 94 per cent. of pensioner household above the level where private saving income is taken into account pound for pound in pension credit. Furthermore, those with private savings of less than &pound;15,000 could take them as a lump sum under the trivial commutation rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/8">The total number of pensioner households under the White Paper reforms is lower than the total number under the current system because of the phased increase in the state pension age starting in 2024.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/9">It cannot be assumed that all those with 100 per cent. marginal deduction rates are in receipt of the guarantee credit only. People on both guarantee credit and savings credit who qualify for additional amounts and are on the savings credit maximum will also have 100 per cent. marginal deduction rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/10">Numbers and proportions of pensioner benefit units in 2050 that will face: <i> (a)</i> a 100 per cent. marginal rate of pension credit withdrawal if the White Paper reforms are implemented and <i> (b)</i> a 40 per cent. marginal withdrawal rate if they are not.</p>

Care should be taken when interpreting these projections as they are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The projections are based on long run simulations of the incomes of individuals under a set of assumptions including life expectancy, partnership formation, earnings growth, employment rates, state and private pension accumulation.<br/> 3.

Projections under the White Paper proposals assume: continued earnings uprooting of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the White Paper. Figures exclude the effect of Personal Accounts.<br/> 7.

	<p pid="a.194W.11/1">We value the important role that employers with occupational pension schemes play in encouraging individuals to save for their retirement. That is why the White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; announced a rolling deregulatory review of private pensions regulation to investigate further ways to lighten the regulatory burden on business, with a view to encouraging and strengthening existing provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.11/2">We also said that we would remove some of the administrative complexity by abolishing contracting out for defined contribution schemes, and by allowing occupational pension schemes to convert guaranteed minimum pension rights into scheme benefits by offering the actuarial equivalent in exchange. Measures to achieve this are contained in the Pensions Bill recently introduced in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.11/3">We are determined that alongside the introduction of personal accounts, employers should be supported in continuing to provide occupational pension schemes. We will help by making the exemption process for high quality schemes as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.11/4">The Government have also lightened the regulatory burden imposed by the tax rules on schemes, and employers providing them, by bringing in key legislation in the Finance Act 2004 to replace the complex pension tax rules with one simplified regime from April 2006. Employers providing registered pension schemes for their employees continue to receive full tax relief on the value of contributions they make to those schemes.</p>
