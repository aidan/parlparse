	<p pid="b.506W.4/1">We have recently introduced enhancements to the fit of Osprey body armour which have improved user manoeuvrability. Additionally, a system which allows troops to wear front and back Osprey plates without the soft armour jacket has just been introduced. This system is used by troops who require extra mobility or are operating in confined spaces.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.4/2">The need to improve personal protection in response to developing threats is continually assessed. Further improvements to body armour and helmets are being developed and are planned to be introduced later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.506W.7/1">In the past year, we have introduced a number of significant improvements to our frontline aircraft capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.7/2">We have enhanced our strategic air lift capability by taking delivery of two more C-17s, taking our total C-17 fleet to six aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.7/3">We continue to improve our fast jet capabilities with significant enhancements to our Harrier and Tornado fleets to increase their effectiveness in the Close Air Support roles they fulfil in Iraq and Afghanistan. These improvements include our new Paveway IV Precision Guided Bomb, which entered service with the Harriers in December 2008, and which provides the RAF with a state of the art all-weather, day and night, precision bombing capability. The Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone also entered service in December 2008 providing increased target accuracy and reduced risk of collateral damage. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-01">1 July 2008</phrase> Typhoon was declared operational in the air to ground role, while on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-21">21 October</phrase> the first two Tranche 2 Typhoon aircraft were delivered to RAF Coningsby.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.7/4">We have also increased our surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities with the introduction of the Airborne Stand off Radar, which achieved its In Service Date in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.7/5">We have increased the number of helicopter airframes and hours available to our commanders in the last two years, delivering a 60 per cent. increase in available flying hours, and will be making further significant increase in helicopter capacity in Afghanistan over the next two years. By the end of 2009 the first of the eight Chinooks under the Mark 3 reversion programme will be delivered, providing a significant uplift to our heavy lift helicopter fleet. The first of the 12 upgraded Lynx Mark 9 helicopters will also be available by the end of 2009. Taken with additional Apache capability and the Merlins that we plan to move to Afghanistan once they have completed their mission in Iraq, these improvements will deliver a significant increase in our front line helicopter capability.</p>

While every effort has been made to ensure the completeness of the list over that period, it has not been possible to confirm absolutely that all substantive studies have been included due to a lack of consistency in recording information during a period of restructuring and change. Records prior to 2000 are not held on a central database and could be accessed and verified only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.2/2">I will place copies of the reports produced in 2008 in the Library of the House, subject to a check to ensure they do not contain information that should be withheld. I will write to the hon. Member when this has been done.</p>

It delivers elements of the city's climate change strategy, helping people and businesses understand their impact on climate change and providing them with information and support. Carbon Neutral North East also has the wider remit of promoting similar schemes and spreading the low carbon agenda through the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.5/3">A grant was made from the Climate Challenge Fund over 2006-07 and 2007-08 to Carbon Neutral North East for a travelling outreach programme using a 'Climate Dome'. This housed an exhibition about climate change, which brought information to the public throughout the north-east region. The Climate Challenge Fund was part of the Climate Change Communications Initiative granting funding to projects across England to encourage more positive attitudes towards tackling climate change. These projects worked through community-based organisations and other trusted intermediaries and used creative communications.</p>

	<p pid="b.524W.0/1">The affected trial grown in Somerset was of a new variety of conventionally bred, open-pollinated oilseed rape. The seed was imported from the USA with a view to being grown in various trials in the UK. This included national list trials, for which an application was made a year after the Somerset trial was sown. However, these did not take place and the variety has been withdrawn from the national list process. The trial in Somerset was carried out privately on behalf of the company that owns and imported the seed.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.0/2">The conventional seed had a low level of GM seed mixed within it (0.05 per cent. or one in every 2,000 seeds), of a type approved by the European Union for food and animal feed use, but not for cultivation. It did not become known that the seed planted in Somerset had this GM content until after the trial had been harvested. As such, no measures were applied during cultivation to limit the potential dispersal of GM material. After harvest the farmer contracted to grow the trial left the ground fallow and let his livestock graze on emerging oilseed rape 'volunteer' plants (those that grow from seed shed at harvest). The farmer is being advised by the GM Inspectorate on the best way to further manage and reduce any volunteers. Given the low level of GM seed originally sown and the farmer's action post-harvest, it is not expected that GM volunteers will be a significant issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.0/3">A separate trial of a different variety of conventional oilseed rape was grown immediately adjacent to the affected trial crop by the same farmer. Testing indicates that as a result of cross-pollination this adjacent crop acquired a very low adventitious GM presence (less than 0.01 per cent.). No other crops were grown in the vicinity of the affected trial, including on neighbouring farms, that might have been subject to GM cross-pollination. In this situation, it is not proposed to monitor the local area for potential contamination. The accidental sowing of the GM seed has not posed any risk to human health and the environment, and nor should there be any economic prejudice to neighbouring farmers through possible cross-pollination.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.0/4">The affected trial took place within the south Somerset district council area. We do not think it would be appropriate to disclose the precise location, in part because it might deter people from coming forward with information about potential unauthorised GM releases, which would not be in the public interest. However, we are currently considering requests to release the exact location under the Environmental Information Regulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.525W.3/1">The UK's negotiating position on the proposed authorisation regulation for plant protection products was adopted in consultation with other Departments and the devolved administrations through the Committee on National Security, International Relations and Development's sub-committee on Europe. Ministers worked extremely hard throughout the negotiations to secure a balanced outcome, and held bilateral meetings with Commissioner Vassiliou, Ministers of other member states, and key stakeholders on the proposals and its potential impacts. It remains unclear how the introduction of the regulation will affect the import of produce from outside the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.3/2">The Secretary of State had numerous discussions with other member states, devolved administrations and stakeholders on the CAP Health Check, including changes to the EU modulation regime. These helped to achieve an increased focus on environmental benefits across Europe, by increasing the rate of compulsory modulation to 10 per cent. by 2012, and therefore the share of CAP funding that goes towards environment and rural development schemes. As part of this, the Secretary of State met Ministers from other member states, including France, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Ireland, Denmark and Hungary, as well as Commissioner Fischer-Boel. In their approach to the health check negotiations, the Government worked closely with the devolved Administrations, both through ministerial meetings and technical discussions between officials, and with stakeholders, including through ministerial meetings and a public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.526W.0/1">In April 2007, it became a statutory requirement for water companies to prepare and maintain previously voluntary water resources management plans. The water resources management plans look ahead 25 years and include projections of current and future demands for water, and how the companies aim to meet this demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/2">In their plans, water companies must take into account the implications of climate change in their supply and demand forecasts, and include an assessment of the impact of each water resource supply option in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/3">The Environment Agency has responsibility for managing water resources. The Agency's forthcoming Water Resources Strategy will include the actions that will need to be taken to ensure enough water for people and the environment. It has been informed by research into future river flows to 2050 and groundwater resources to the 2020s and 2030s.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/4">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales and is taking forward the Restoring Sustainable Abstraction (RSA) programme. To date, the RSA has been limited to identifying the sites where abstraction is at unsustainable levels. It has carried out investigations to identify where changes to abstraction regimes are necessary. In many cases those investigations have concluded that the licensed abstractions are having no adverse effect on the environment. Therefore no action to alter licensed abstractions is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/5">Of the 2,970 Water Resources licences that have been assessed under the habitats regulations review of consents because they were likely to cause a significant effect on high priority Natura 2000 sites (that is special areas of conservation (SAC) and special protection areas (SPA)), 274 have been found to require an options appraisal to remove a possible adverse effect. In 2,696 cases it could be shown that there was no adverse effect on site integrity and therefore no action was required. Further work is required on medium and low priority sites but to date this relates to less than 10 per cent. of the abstraction licences in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/6">It may also be necessary to take action on other sites not designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives or as SSSIs.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/7">The first cycle of the Environment Agency's Catchment Abstraction Management Strategies has helped to improve the Agency's knowledge of where there may be problems of unsustainable abstraction around the country and of specific sites that will require further investigation through RSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/8">RSA will also contribute to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) by providing a framework to restore unsustainable abstraction and work towards achieving the WFD target of meeting good ecological status by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/9">The Agency is expecting to start taking action to revoke or modify abstraction licences at those sites where this is deemed necessary in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.0/10">Water companies in England have indicated that they intend to take account of the habitats directive changes in their water resource management plans and work with the Environment Agency to resolve unsustainable abstractions. This will mean that some of the licences that have the biggest impacts on some of England's most important conservation sites will be resolved by voluntary changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.531W.3/2">The breakdown of consultancy as requested in the question is not held centrally and to attempt to provide it now would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.3/3">The business units within the Department currently use separate accounting systems which record expenditure differently. The totals include a mixture of committed spend (i.e. orders raised) and actual spend incurred. The Professional Services Forum definition of consultancy has been applied since 2005-06 resulting in more accurate coding of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.3/4">Details of payments to advertising agencies are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Most payments relating to advertising expenditure are however made to the Central Office of Information.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.3/5">The majority of campaign advertising investment by the Department is in support of marketing activities on the THINK! Road safety campaign, Act on CO2 campaign, Concessionary Bus Fares campaign, aviation security and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's continuous registration campaign. Advertising expenditure is the largest value component of the Department's marketing expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.536W.2/1">I have placed details in the House Libraries of relevant funding from the Department for Transport provided to local authorities in the north-east. The funding streams covered are:</p>
	<p pid="b.536W.2/2" class="indent">(a) Block capital funding made available to local authorities since 2000-01 as part of the LTP settlement. This funding is not ring fenced. Integrated block funding is allocated at the Tyne and Wear plan level. Capital highway maintenance funding is allocated to local highway authorities.

This funding is also not ring fenced. A three year settlement covering 2008-09 to 2010-11 has been made for revenue allocations for detrunked roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.536W.2/5" class="indent">(d) Funding provided for emergency repairs following flooding to north-east local highways in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="b.536W.2/6" class="indent">(e) Capital funding that the Department has contributed to major local authority road schemes (generally costing over &pound;5 million). The table shows schemes completed since 2000 and those currently being delivered.</p>

Since 2007, road safety partnership grant has also been allocated to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.536W.2/8">Local authorities are also provided with financial support for road maintenance and road safety schemes through the Revenue Support Grant (RSG), administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government. There is no separately identified highways maintenance component in RSG and it is for each authority to determine how much of it should be allocated to their highway network.</p>

Estimates are compiled for regional expenditure to supplement data reported in the Department's annual report. The estimates for the north-east have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="b.539W.0/1">Most transport projects in local authority areas are the responsibility of the relevant local transport authority.

	<p pid="b.543W.6/1">The heating in 1 Parliament street is controlled by means of a computerised building management system (BMS). This allows the heating and cooling in each office to be individually monitored and controlled. The original system, installed in 1990, had become obsolete and was replaced by a modern system. The hardware was installed in the 2008 summer recess and the installation of a new control network was completed in November 2008. The arrival of the cold weather in the autumn highlighted a number of software problems which took longer than anticipated to resolve due to the lack of a network, which meant revisiting every office. At the same time, the opportunity was taken to replace any faulty heating or cooling valves and as a result some 50 cooling and 20 heating controls were replaced.</p>
	<p pid="b.543W.6/2">Now that the new BMS is installed, the method of heating control will be modified from a fixed time based method to the more efficient and accurate 'optimised start' method which ensures that the heating is switched on earlier if the outside air temperature is lower. In addition, a survey of the heating capacity of the boilers and associated pipe-work is planned for the 2009 summer recess. This will identify the heating capacity of the boilers and pipe-work, should larger radiators be required in some offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.544W.5/7">To minimise disruption to the occupants, a system is operated in Portcullis House whereby upon actuation of smoke/beam/video smoke detectors outside the atrium, the parliamentary fire section has 15 minutes to identify and resolve an incident before the evacuation alarm is automatically activated. Three of the five evacuations in the last 12 months were triggered because it was not possible during the 15 minutes to verify that the building was safe. On the other two occasions, operation of a manual call point and the interruption of a beam detector in the atrium automatically triggered an evacuation. In order to minimise the number of unwanted alarms, a full fire incident investigation is carried out by the parliamentary fire section, fire safety manager and London fire brigade after every incident to establish the cause of the incident and to identify the person(s) responsible. Key personnel involved in the alarm activation are interviewed and remedial action taken. In the case of technical faults, the fire alarm engineers are called to site to investigate and take remedial action. Fire safety training is regularly reviewed and revised to address trends in activation of fire alarms.</p>

This makes clear that while arrest is always the first option, an adult offender is likely to receive a cannabis warning for a first possession offence, and a penalty notice for disorder for a second offence. A third offence will result in arrest and consideration of likely further action including caution, conditional caution or prosecution. All subsequent offences are likely to result in arrest. If any aggravating factors are present the police will escalate the response accordingly. Ultimately, decisions as to the most appropriate disposal for an offender are made by the police and CPS using their professional judgment and experience.</p>

	<p pid="b.553W.5/1">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 provides for a new generic community sentence for under 18s, the Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO), which will replace nine existing community sentences. The Order provides a range of requirements providing a flexible sentence that can be tailored to meet individual offenders' needs. It includes two high intensity requirements, intensive supervision and surveillance and fostering set as direct alternatives to custody. The Act will also require a court to consider using a YRO with one of the high intensity requirements prior to custody. If custody is still given the sentencer must explain in court why the high intensity community sentence is not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.5/2">In addition the Government have provided a range of out of court disposals designed to keep low level offences and offenders out of the criminal justice system, yet provide interventions to prevent reoffending. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act introduces the Youth Conditional Caution which will be available to the Crown Prosecution Service as a final out of court disposal. Both these measures will be brought into effect later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.5/3">This Government believe in early intervention and prevention, but recognises that where offending occurs we should have a structured, robust sentencing framework aimed at preventing reoffending. However, where the offence is serious or persistent and there is a risk of harm to the public then custody should be available. These aims are set out in the Youth Crime Action Plan published in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.5/4">The number of 10 to 18s getting community sentences in 2007 was 66,007 out of a total of 97,387 sentenced. This counts all types of offence at magistrates' courts and the Crown court. These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.</p>

In addition, if there is a risk or perceived risk to the licensing objectives (such as the protection of children from harm) as a result of the position or promotion of alcohol, following representations and a hearing, conditions can be attached to the premises licence by the licensing authority to address the concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.563W.2/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have therefore asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment he has made of the cost effectiveness of the operational improvement plan in place at the Child Support Agency. (242214)</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/5" class="indent">The Operational Improvement Plan was launched in April 2006 and supported by &pound;120 million of additional funding. The three-year plan aimed to improve the service the Child Support Agency was delivering to its clients and to deliver more money to more children, while the entire system of child maintenance was redesigned. The Agency is currently in the third and final year of the plan and while some challenges remain it is on course to meet all of the commitments that were made when the plan was launched.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/6" class="indent">As a result of the investment in the Operational Improvement Plan the Agency is now delivering its services far more efficiently and effectively. Indeed, after two-and-a-half years of the plan the number of uncleared cases has fallen significantly, from 284,400 cases that were outstanding in March 2006, to just 95,900 cases outstanding at the end of September 2008. The number of children who receive maintenance has also increased under the plan to a total of 778,200 children in the three months to the end of September, 155,200 more children than received maintenance in the three months to March 2006. In addition, the Agency collected and arranged &pound;1.08 billion in child maintenance in the year to September 2008, which is a considerable increase from the &pound;836 million that was collected in the year to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/7" class="indent">The investment in the Operational Improvement Plan has resulted in more money for more children, and will provide a stable foundation on which the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission can build for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

Jobcentre Plus signposts customers to provision made available through Jobcentre Plus New Deal, the Learning and Skills Council, local authorities and other organisations from the public and voluntary sector.

	<p pid="b.572W.2/13" class="indent">While Jobcentre Plus will have an additional 6,000 staff in the next operational year we do not yet have the detailed plans on their deployment as these are still being worked on. We are therefore unable to say at this point which of these staff will be Personal Advisers. I am also unable at this stage to provide details for the next 12 quarters as this goes beyond the end of the department's CSR 2007 and information about the next CSR settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.2/14" class="indent">It is not possible to say how many of the extra 6,000 staff will come from those employed to support the introduction of the Employment Support Allowance. Significant recruitment is underway to achieve these revised numbers, and we hope that those employed to support the introduction of the Employment and Support Allowance will apply successfully for those recruitment exercises. Civil Service recruitment rules constrain our ability simply to extend the contracts of all these people for the whole period of the Spending Review.</p>

The Chancellor's Departments and their agencies all have small capital budgets that mainly relate to information technology expenditure. A thorough evaluation was undertaken that concluded it would not be appropriate to bring forward capital expenditure for the Chancellor's Departments. This was due to the limited size of the projects and value for money problems involved in doing so.</p>

	<p pid="b.589W.4/1">Since 2005, HMRC have reduced their overall headcount from 105,000 staff to 88,000 staff. HMRC have committed to reducing staff numbers further over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.4/2">My hon. Friend's answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-21.1473"><i> Official Report</i>, column 1473W</phrase> described how the pre-surplus arrangements work. Pre-surplus status is a term used by HMRC as part of their arrangements for managing workforce changes. When work volumes reduce or it is planned to move work to another location, HMRC use pre-surplus arrangements to help manage the consequent change in staffing requirements. HMRC use this scheme to help re-deploy staff to new roles ahead of any change in staffing requirements in a particular location or business unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.4/3">Potentially surplus staff are given pre-surplus status and then have priority for any vacancies that arise that they apply for. This allows HMRC to address proactively any potential staffing surplus as a result of a change in the business. Pre-surplus staff continue to carry out essential work for the Department as they await new jobs. This is a sensible way to make best use of the skills of people during a period of radical reconstruction to improve service to customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.4/4">If pre-surplus measures do not resolve the situation, staff can be declared 'surplus' after which the Department can start to move to redundancy. The pre-surplus arrangements are a key part of our strategy for managing surpluses, and the Department remains committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies as far as this is reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.4/5">Information on pre-surplus information was only retained from the quarter ended September 2007. The figures provided as follows provide a snapshot of the position at each date. The position changes on a daily basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.593W.6/1">In 1997-98, the total capital expenditure in further education colleges in England in the financial year 1997-98 was nil.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/2">In total since that time, this Government have invested &pound;2.4 billion and will be investing a record further &pound;2.3 billion across the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/3">Currently more than 250 projects are under way and funded by the LSC&mdash;helped by the recent decision to accelerate &pound;110 million in 2008-09 from future budgets to help beat the downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/4">In total, since the programme began under this Government, nearly 700 projects, at 330 colleges have been agreed. Only 42 colleges have not yet benefited from investment. The programme has therefore been a huge success.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/5">But the pace of demand for capital funding has increased. Projects and the scale of Government funding they require are becoming increasingly ambitious.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/6">In addition there are signs that the ability of colleges to raise their own funds for proposed projects is being affected by the downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/7">It is for this reason that over the next few weeks the LSC will be working closely with colleges that have submitted or are working on bids, to look at the individual current positions before making further funding decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/8">As a result of this the consideration of a small number of applications that were due for decision&mdash;both in principle and in detail&mdash;has been deferred from December to March.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/9">Research by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2003/04 into the effects of capital investment on educational outcomes found that capital investment appears to have a marked effect in increasing the level of student retention on courses and success. Frontier Economics updated the research in 2007 ('Evaluating the impact of capital expenditure in further Education' available from the Learning and Skills Council website) and confirmed a link with higher student enrolment.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.6/10">We know that colleges build strong communities economically and socially. To ensure we maximise the value of our capital investment, all contractors working on college projects are now required to have in place a formal training plan that maximises access to apprenticeships, work-based learning and other training opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="b.595W.5/1">The Secretary of State established when he finalised this policy in January 2008 that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) should conduct an annual review on its impact. I wrote to HEFCE earlier this month setting out the terms of reference for the review. I told HEFCE that they should consider whether there is evidence that any changes to the current approach will help universities respond more effectively to the challenges of the economic downturn. I also instructed that a review should not lead to a significant net increase in the overall number of ELQ students studying exempt or protected subjects because we will continue to give priority for public funding to those who have not yet obtained a first higher education qualification. HEFCE has started work on the review and plan to report later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.596W.6/1">Following the UK-chaired May Security Council debate, the UN Secretary-General was mandated to produce a report on Peacebuilding and Early Recovery by May 2009. A UK-hosted conference in July and a follow-up conference in Copenhagen have helped to build international consensus on the need to address three key gaps&mdash;in strategy and leadership, capacity and funding. We are working to ensure that the UN Secretary-General's report is ambitious and provides the basis for real improvements in delivery on the ground. Ministers and senior officials have met with key UN officials and other member states to urge an ambitious reform agenda. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's Special Envoy on Conflict Resolution Mechanisms visited New York and Brussels to emphasise the importance that the UK places on this work. In the context of the EU, we ensured that a focus on post-conflict stabilisation reform was included in the review of the European Security Strategy in December, and the UK will continue to push forward work to improve capabilities for EU missions during the Czech EU presidency.</p>

Although neither country has indicated it is ready to accede to the NPT, we are working to bring both India and Pakistan closer to the international non proliferation mainstream, including through the negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty.</p>

	<p pid="b.611W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.3/2">The UK took responsibility for Helmand province through the establishment of a provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in 2006. The PRT combines the efforts of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Department for International Development (DFID) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in a comprehensive approach to development. Accordingly, the PRT delivers reconstruction and development projects from a tri-departmental budget managed jointly by FCO, DFID and MOD. &pound;7.04 million was spent in 2006-07 and &pound;9.99 million in 2007-08 from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). To date, &pound;14.08 million (of a Stabilisation Aid Fund budget of &pound;34.41 million) has been spent in 2008-09. Prior to the establishment of the PRT in 2006, there was no specific allocation of funding to Helmand province.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.3/3">The tri-departmental funding facilitates a range of projects in Counter Narcotics, Rule of Law, Strategic Communications, Governance, Political activities and Area Based Stabilisation. These projects are administered in Lashkar Gah or London, dependent on the implementing agent. Projects are managed through a range of partners including the Afghan Government, local community organisations, international or local non-governmental organisations or external contractors. Programmes are reviewed and updated monthly by an official in the embassy in Kabul and the PRT in Lashkar Gah. Projects are evaluated at six-monthly intervals.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.3/4">In addition to this tri-departmental budget, the FCO, DFID and MOD also have individual budget allocations. From its bilateral programme fund, the FCO spent &pound;17,000 in 2007-08 on Helmand specific projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.2/1">The delivery of UK aid in Zimbabwe, alongside that of UN and other international agencies, is rigorously monitored and subject to regular reporting, independent evaluation and financial audit. Our estimation has been that UK assistance reaches its intended recipients. When we do hear of any attempt to divert aid, the programme in question is halted immediately while an investigation takes place. However, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-04">4 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-29">29 August 2008</phrase>, as a cynical and damaging electoral ploy, Robert Mugabe's regime instituted a ban on the operations of NGOs across the country. During this period, large amounts of international food-aid (including UK contributions) were obstructed; none of this aid was diverted, it was simply not distributed. Other non-food aid&mdash;including essential medicines and support to people with HIV and AIDS&mdash;was distributed where delivery to intended recipients could be assured.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.2/2">Since the lifting of the ban, the international community has scaled up its response rapidly to provide vital food assistance to over five million Zimbabweans. Despite this massive operation, rigorous monitoring has been maintained, with few reports of obstruction or diversion of aid, and we are confident that UK contributions are being delivered to intended recipients.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.6/1">There are many uncertainties involved in estimating deaths brought forward as a result of air pollution. Current estimates are being updated, but in 1998, the Department's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) estimated that 24,000 deaths were brought forward each year due to air pollution in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.6/2">The UK Air Quality Strategy aims to protect against risks to public health from air pollution. Healthy individuals are not thought to be at significant risk of short-term effects from current levels of air pollution in the UK, but associations have been indicated between daily variations in levels of some pollutants and daily variations in mortality and hospital admissions for respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.6/5">To inform the UK Air Quality Strategy (2007), COMEAP estimated that the average loss of life expectancy would be around seven to eight months in 2005. With the implementation of measures outlined in the Strategy, this is predicted to drop to around 5.5 months in 2020. As with any average, the loss of life expectancy will be greater than this for some people and less than this for others.</p>

	<p pid="b.619W.5/1">The public relations (PR) agencies employed by the Department during 2007-08 were:</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.5/2" class="indent">Euro RSCG;</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.5/3" class="indent">Fishburn Hedges Boys Williams;</p>

	<p pid="b.619W.5/8" class="indent">The Red Consultancy; and</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.5/9" class="indent">Trimedia Harrison Cowley.</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.5/10">PR companies are employed to support a range of marketing and policy initiatives including major public health behaviour change programmes such as tobacco control, sexual health, flu immunisation, hand and respiratory hygiene and drug and alcohol harm reduction campaigns. In addition to providing specialist knowledge of a wide range of media through which the Department needs to communicate with specific target audiences, they also provide extensive creative input to communications programmes. PR companies are a highly flexible and cost-effective resource as they can be commissioned for the duration of each individual project thus reducing the need for increasing internal headcount.</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.5/11">The total expenditure on external PR during 2007-08 (&pound;5.3 million) includes VAT and both fees and costs. Typically costs may include producing materials and newsletters, creation of content for online media, advertorials, photography, research, creation of toolkits for stakeholders and costs incurred for regional activity such as stakeholder or media roadshows.</p>

	<p pid="b.623W.0/1">We are investing &pound;4 million in 2008-09 for primary care trusts to develop local interventions to promote breastfeeding. These include implementing the principles of the Baby Friendly Initiative in both hospitals and community settings. As part of this initiative, training will be provided to all frontline staff. The overall aim is to increase breastfeeding rates, maximise the coverage of numbers of non-breastfeeding mothers in England and address inequalities.</p>

The EHIC was only introduced across the European Economic Area in September 2005, therefore data for 11 years are not available. There is only one issuer of the EHIC within the UK, which is the NHS Business Services Authority. The nationality of the applicant is not recorded during the EHIC application process as this is irrelevant; entitlement to free national health service treatment and also to an EHIC, is based on being ordinarily resident in the UK rather than on British nationality or the previous payment of taxes to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.629W.5/1">Section 206 of the Planning Act 2008 sets out which bodies will be charging authorities for the Community Infrastructure Levy. As part of the consultation on draft CIL regulations, the Government will consult on the use of the section 206(4). Executive agencies and regional development agencies cannot be charging authorities. However such bodies could receive CIL revenue from CIL charging authorities in order to provide infrastructure identified as necessary, through the development plan process, to support development. No estimate has been made of the level of CIL revenue that these specific bodies would receive as this will depend on the infrastructure planning and local decisions about funding priorities made by each CIL charging authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.5/2">The Planning Act together with the CIL regulations will set the framework governing how charging authorities will determine the rate of CIL in their area. The level of CIL will be set locally by each charging authority should they decide to establish a CIL.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.5/3">Section 211(2) of the Act requires charging authorities to have regard to actual and expected costs of infrastructure; the economic viability of development and other actual and expected sources of funding for infrastructure in setting the rate of CIL.</p>

	<p pid="b.645W.2/1">The Empowerment White Paper Communities in Control: Real people, real power announced that there would be a concise review of the current arrangements across public services, the private sector and in other countries to look at the feasibility and practicality of introducing and extending the idea of redress for citizens where their council services fail to meet agreed standards. The Secretary of State asked David Cook, Chief Executive of Kettering borough council to chair this independent review, which will consider a range of issues&mdash;including the potential role of compensation&mdash;and produce recommendations to ensure that local services are putting the consumer at the heart of everything they do. The review is expected to report in spring 2009.</p>

This may include one-to-one tuition out of school to help them with their reading.</p>

	<p pid="b.648W.8/1">We have provided, through our Local Authority Readiness Assessment (LARA) system, a wide range of guidance both for local authorities and local and national partners that covers legal, technical and operational issues. For example, we have issued guidance under section 12(12) of the Children Act 2004, which sets out the key statutory requirements of section 12 and the Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007. We have also issued guidance that covers project management and communications, the use of enhanced Criminal Record Bureau (eCRB) disclosures as part of an individual's application to become a ContactPoint user and guidance on shielding records on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.8/2">We announced, in August 2008, that ContactPoint would be deployed from January 2009. We are on track to deploy the first phase from that date and will continue to keep Parliament informed of key developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.8/3">Local authorities have been undertaking work with relevant local partners to identify children whose records may need to be shielded on ContactPoint. For the purpose of shielding only, ContactPoint will be deployed to all local authorities in England from January 2009. Wider ContactPoint functionality will be deployed first to the ContactPoint early adopters. The early adopters are 17 local authorities and two national partners, whose purpose is to test deployment and experience operational processes in a real environment. This will allow the national ContactPoint team to evaluate the processes and make any necessary adjustments, prior to full deployment of the system to other local authorities and national partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.8/4">The 17 early adopter local authorities are Blackburn with Darwen, Blackpool, Bolton, Bury, Cheshire, Cumbria, Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester, Rochdale, Salford, Sefton, St. Helens, Stockport, Warrington and Wigan. Two national partners, Barnardo's and KIDS, are also early adopters.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.8/5">All local authorities and national partners have been required to work through a series of detailed 'readiness assessment' checks and satisfy specified threshold levels, before progressing to the next stage. They are also completing monthly assessments of their progress. Early adopter local authorities have all completed nine readiness assessment checks to date. Other areas will complete a further readiness assessment before being accredited to grant ContactPoint access to users.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.5/1">The Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives strategy, published in January 2008, set out the Government's plans to reduce obesity, initially focusing on children. Every child should grow up eating well and enjoying being active and we want parents to have the knowledge and confidence to make this happen. There is no single, simple solution to reducing rates of overweight and obesity and therefore the Government are taking action on a number of fronts.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/2">At a national level, the Government are promoting healthy eating and physical activity. The updated Child Health Promotion Programme was published in March 2008. It prioritises obesity prevention and physical activity by promoting positive parenting during pregnancy and the early years of children's lives. We are working to support as many mothers as possible to breast feed and to continue to breast feed for longer&mdash;helped by children's centres, health and other services, all promoting healthy weight. The Healthy Start initiative provides free vitamin supplements, vouchers for milk, fruit and vegetables for low income pregnant women and children up to age four.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/3">The introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage for 0 to five-year-olds means that all early years education providers must promote the good health of children, by providing healthy, nutritious food and active play. The Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, sets out how Government will invest &pound;235 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 to develop play facilities for children of all ages. Ofcom have introduced restrictions on advertising foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) to children.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/4">At a local level, primary care trusts, working with local authorities, are responsible for co-ordinating work to tackle childhood obesity. PCT plans, developed alongside local authority Children and Young People's Plans, will feed into local area agreements agreed with the Government offices. Local areas will develop and implement their own initiatives based on local needs and circumstances. 130 LAs have chosen to include in their local area agreement at least one child obesity indicator from the National Indicator Set.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/5">Middlesbrough is also one of the nine towns that have been awarded healthy town status as part of the Governments &pound;30 million Healthy Community Challenge Fund. The money will be used to build on existing work and test out ideas on what further action needs to happen to make physical activity and healthy food choices easier for people.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/6">All this is supported by the Change4Life movement at a national and local level which aims to help families eat well, move more and live longer and which is initially focussed on families with young children. Change4Life is working with a range of commercial and voluntary sector partners, signing up to play their part and deliver concrete commitments to change both nationally and locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.661W.2/1">The Government have no plans to develop a statutory national curriculum for Religious Education (RE). There is a non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education that all major faith groups have endorsed in 2004. Religious Education is already a statutory subject and every maintained school must provide religious education (RE) for all its pupils. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governing body and the local authority (LA) to ensure that this is done. Local Standing Councils for Religious Education (SACREs), established by the LA, have the responsibility to ensure that local RE syllabuses, taking account of national guidance, reflect the make up of the local community.</p>

	<p pid="b.661W.5/1">We have taken the opportunity afforded by the revised code to remove areas of duplication in the text and therefore to improve clarity for admission authorities. The right of parents to apply for any school they want their child to attend and the duty on admission authorities to ensure that their preferences are met to the fullest possible extent are enshrined in section 86 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The requirement to offer a place, where one is available and where such an offer would not prejudice the provision of efficient education or the use of resources, at the school that is the parents highest preference is fundamental to the system and is reflected throughout the code and regulations, for example at paragraphs 1.37, 1.42 and 3.15(d).</p>

	<p pid="b.672W.11/1">The information requested is shown in the table. This is based on data obtained via the school census.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.11/2">The census shows 34,390 pupils aged five to 19 attending primary, secondary and special schools who are classed as being in care as at January 2008. Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, shows 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. The school census does not cover all looked-after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage partly explain the difference in the numbers from each source. It is possible that the school census undercounts the number of looked-after children in primary, secondary and special schools where they are unaware of a child's looked-after status. The improvements in care planning arrangements and increased focus on education through the implementation of the Children and Young Person's Act 2008 will ensure that schools have the information they need about a child's looked-after status. In particular, all maintained schools will be required to appoint a designated teacher for looked-after children on the school's roll. Through our wider Care Matters programme, the Department is funding 11 local authorities to pilot the role of a virtual school head to work with schools which have looked-after children on roll.</p>

	<p pid="b.674W.5/1">Guidance to local authorities on how to respond appropriately to the needs of young people who run away was published by the Department of Health, the Department which then had responsibility for children's services, in 2002. As part of the commitments made in the Young Runaways Action Plan, this guidance is currently being updated, and a draft version is out for formal consultation, in advance of publication later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.5/2">Running away should be seen as an indicator of an underlying problem for a young person which may need further intervention. Many children who run away from home are likely to be children in need requiring support and services provided by local authorities or by voluntary organisations acting on their behalf. Most runaways will return home; where it is inappropriate for them to do so, it is for the local authority to ensure that they are appropriately cared for.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.5/3">The new guidance will clearly set out local authorities' responsibilities relating to providing emergency accommodation for young people who have run away. It will reflect the emerging findings of the current review into the provision of emergency accommodation for young people. This review will help local authorities identify successful and cost effective forms of provision, and young people's perceptions of different types of emergency accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="b.677W.8/4" class="indent">The available information is provided in the attached table. The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS).</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.8/5" class="indent">The estimates by size of employer are based on respondents' understanding of the number of employees in their workplace. This may not equal the employer's total employment as it may have more than one site.</p>

	<p pid="b.677W.8/7" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.8/8" class="indent">The figures have been derived from the LFS microdata which are weighted using the official population estimates published in autumn 2007. Consequently the estimates from Q3 2006 onwards are not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release, which are weighted using more up-to-date population estimates.</p>
