	<p pid="a.372W.0/1">The Government recognise the negative impacts of stacking on operational efficiency and the environment. The 'Future of Air Transport' White Paper encourages making better use of existing airport capacity and supports the delivery of two new runways in the south-east. Implementing that policy should reduce the need for stacking. In particular, the Government's recent confirmation of its support for a third runway at Heathrow should help to reduce the need for stacking at that airport where lack of runway capacity is a significant contributory factor. However, runway capacity is not the only relevant factor, and that is why the UK also strongly supports optimising the use of airspace, including through implementation of the Single European Sky.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.0/1">DEFRA underwrote 28 million doses of BTV8 vaccine in 2008, enough for all susceptible animals in England. 12 million of these doses formed the supply at the start of 2009. This along with free market vaccine supplies from the three manufacturers authorised to market vaccine in the UK, Intervet, Merial and Fort Dodge should meet the demand for BTV8 vaccine in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.0/2">DEFRA continues to closely monitor the situation in Europe, and engage with experts and manufacturers on the issue of vaccine development and authorisation for other serotypes of bluetongue.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.0/3">However, currently BTV8 is the only vaccine that can legally be used in the UK, and farmers should not wait for BTV1 or bivalent vaccine to become available this year. We remain at risk from BTV8 and we are working with the industry-led JAB campaign to encourage farmers to vaccinate to protect themselves at the earliest convenient opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.8/2">Police forces in England and Wales are asked to provide monthly cumulative data for use in the Home Office's quarterly and annual crime statistics publication. However, the validation processes relate to quarterly data rather than monthly and therefore quarterly data for detection rates for violence against the person are given in the table. Detection rates are a ratio of crimes detected in a period to crimes recorded in a period, they are not based on tracking individual crimes recorded in a period as to whether they are eventually detected.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.8/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed a very small limited set of circumstances. This has significantly reduced the number of non-sanction detections which has been reflected in the overall detection rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.386W.6/1">The most recently published report; The impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder: an evaluation (2008) by Hough et al, found that violent offences between 3 am and 6 am had increased by 236 incidents in the first year following the introduction of the Act. These offences represent 4 per cent. of all night time offences. Overall the review found that crimes involving violence during the whole evening and night-time had reduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.386W.9/1">The first review of the Licensing Act reveals a mixed picture. Some people appear to be using the freedoms and are not sufficiently using the considerable powers granted by the Act to tackle problems. There is a need to rebalance action towards enforcement to tackle irresponsible behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.9/2">Actions in response to the review of the Licensing Act include: increase the fine for anyone not obeying an instruction to stop drinking in a DPPO area to &pound;2500 from &pound;500, make it easier for the Police to disperse antisocial drinkers, extend the use of acceptable behaviour contracts and to extend the arrest referral pilots to include under 18s. We are working across Government to take these actions forward.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary's visit to Syria in November 2008, he raised this issue with President Assad. We have serious concerns about Iranian support for Hezbollah. Such support is unacceptable and only serves to undermine regional security. Funding for arms supplies to Hezbollah are contrary to the arms embargo established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701.</p>

DFID's contribution to TBBC was &pound;770,000 in 2007-08 and &pound;1 million in 2009-09. DFID has not stipulated what proportion of these contributions should be allocated to cross-border programmes. DFID plans to give &pound;1.1 million to TBBC in 2009-10, a 10 per cent. increase over 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/3">Several other EU member states, as well as the European Commission, give funding to TBBC. Overall the EU contributed about 55 per cent. of TBBC's income in 2008. The Commission does not allow its contributions to be used for Thailand Burma cross-border programmes. Other member states have their own individual policies on how their funding to TBBC may be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/4">DFID and the European Commission both contribute to cross-border health care provision from China to Kachin and Shan States in Burma. We estimate that spending on this programme, by UK financial year, was approximately:</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.2/5" class="indent">2007-08&mdash;&pound;571,000 (&pound;235,000 from the Commission; and &pound;336,000 from DFID)</p>

	<p pid="a.399W.5/1">The UK Government strongly support and promote co-ordination among donors on both policy and implementation. At the global level the UK participates fully in co-ordination, for example through the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development and the UN Development Co-operation Forum. The UK strongly supports the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) which contain specific commitments by donor countries and recipients to better co-ordinate development efforts. The UK is on target to meet all Paris Declaration targets by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.5/2">In accordance with Paris targets, UK seeks to align its country programmes with partner country priorities and to harmonise and co-ordinate with other donors. This is achieved through Joint Assistance Strategies with other donors, in support of partner governments setting out their development policies and how they wish donors to provide development assistance. The UK also co-ordinates closely with other donors in co-financing partner country programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.0/14">The costs awarded to Land Registry following the successful defence and withdrawal of the claims exceeded these amounts. The authorisation of the surveillance was given by the then acting director of HR.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.0/15">In deciding to authorise surveillance. Land Registry considered the seriousness of the issue, the potential cost of the case and the impact on the organisation's core business and weighed this against the potential impact on the privacy of the individuals and their friends and family as well as the ongoing employment relationship. The surveillance was restricted to public environments, which limited the level of intrusion. The nature of this as a test case established a likelihood of high costs in the defence of the case, in payments to individuals if the cases were found proven and potentially in significant change to the organisations core business processes and the equipment used. With supporting legal advice it was agreed that the surveillance was a proportionate and justified action in defending this case.</p>

	<p pid="a.420W.5/1">Prison-NOMIS will be deployed to public prisons from spring 2009 to summer 2010. Following on from that roll-out, the needs of the contracted-out prisons (COPs) will be addressed. The approach to individual COPs may vary depending on their own internal IT systems and either Prison-NOMIS could be deployed to a COP or an interface with the COP's existing case management system and Prison-NOMIS could be established.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.2/3">The use of hearsay evidence in civil proceedings involving antisocial behaviour allows witnesses to remain anonymous.

	<p pid="a.423W.2/4">The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 introduced special measures for witnesses in proceedings for ASBOs. These measures were introduced to address concerns about the protection of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The measures include screening witnesses from the defendants, giving evidence through video link or in private, and the use of video recorded evidence. Special dedicated antisocial behaviour response courts have been established in magistrates' courts sitting in their civil capacity to ensure that witness issues are addressed. Local agencies have developed efficient case management systems which includes working in partnership with key agencies to provide support to victims after court proceedings. In addition the Home Office has issued a good practice guide to practitioners on how best to support victims and witnesses of antisocial behaviour through the whole length of the witness pathway. A range of detailed guidance is set out on the Home Office's website on antisocial behaviour website.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.5/1">The UK and France have made good progress on all aspects of defence co-operation that were agreed during the 2008 Summit.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/2">The Declaration of Intent for the European Carrier Group Interoperability Initiative (ECGII) has so far been signed by nine European nations, building on the Summit commitment to Carrier Group Operations. The inaugural Steering Group met in Paris on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-18">18 March</phrase>. This is a high level declaration of intent aiming to increase interoperability between countries operating aircraft carriers or with naval vessels able to support carrier operations. There is no intention to create a standing carrier group.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/3">The UK-France helicopter Initiative that was launched at the Summit continues to gather momentum. The Helicopter Fund opened by the UK to support projects aimed at delivering helicopter capability to operational theatres now stands at &euro;26 million with contributions from 15 nations. Other nations have offered to host multi-national helicopter exercises to prepare crews for deployment, to provide training courses, to donate surplus helicopters and even to supply pilots for other nations to use on operations. More importantly, the first nation to benefit from the initiative, the Czech Republic, deploys three helicopters to Afghanistan this year. Since the summit three other nations have also made a commitment to deploy helicopters and projects launched through the Helicopter Initiative will make a substantial and essential contribution to their theatre-entry equipment upgrades and crew training requirements. All this effort is very closely co-ordinated with NATO and EDA programmes to address the same problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/4">Both nations continue to discuss NATO transformation with one another and the work to strengthen EU/NATO co-operation is continuing. The anticipated return of France to the military structures of NATO has given a new impetus to these discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/5">Ministers and officials have met and continue to meet on numerous occasions to drive forward bilateral industrial defence co-operation. Progress has been made in all the areas highlighted in the 2008 Communiqu&eacute; and we continue to seek new opportunities to develop our co-operation. The High Level Working Group will be providing a report on progress to the 2009 Anglo French Summit that is due to take place later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/6">Specifically we have made good progress with Complex Weapons. We have been working to assess the scope to co-operate on a range of projects including the potential to enter into Assessment Phases to examine enhancements for Storm Shadow and the French SCALP programme and to develop an anti-surface guided weapon for use on naval helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.5/7">The UK and France have been working closely since the last Summit to explore the opportunities for a common approach to A400M support. This work is continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.2/1">The UK commitment to the EU Battlegroup roster for January to July 2010 will be met by forces from the Small Scale Contingency Battlegroup element of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF). As this is a national high readiness contingency which is already on stand-by during the relevant period, there is no additional cost to the UK of providing an EU Battlegroup on stand-by. The Small Scale Contingency Battlegroup will consist of forces drawn from the longstanding UK-Netherlands Amphibious Landing Force. As with all NATO activities, the principle of funding for the UK-Netherlands Amphibious Landing Force is that costs lie where they fall; each nation therefore pays its own costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.2/2">There would be additional costs to the UK were the Battlegroup to deploy. However, an EU Battlegroup is a stand-by commitment intended for emerging contingencies and it is impossible to predict at the current time whether or not it will be deployed during its stand-by period.

	<p pid="a.443W.6/3">Aggregated snapshot: data of the number of mobilised Volunteer Reservists are available and therefore it is possible to calculate the percentage of Volunteer Reservists mobilised at given points in time. The following tables show the number and percentage of Volunteer Reservists mobilised at <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase> in each year for which data are available, for each service:</p>

	<p pid="a.452W.2/17" class="indent">Historically it is difficult to make a robust estimate of the number of staff working on Social Fund alone. Although Social Fund activity was recorded on our Activity Based Modelling System, we know that for many of these staff Social Fund was only part of their work. Following centralisation of benefit processing, which began in April 2006 and was completed in March 2008, we can be more confident that our data represents people working full time on Social Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.3/1">The information is in the following table, and provides separate data for unfilled and notified vacancies to give the fullest picture of the number of Jobcentre Plus vacancies in any particular constituency. The labour market is dynamic and many new vacancies are filled so quickly they do not appear in the statistics for live unfilled vacancies, which are based on a snapshot of the vacancies available on a particular day.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.3/2">The coverage of these figures relates only to Jobcentre Plus notified and unfilled vacancies. Many vacancies come up through other recruitment channels and the proportion accounted for by Jobcentre Plus is likely to vary over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Estimates of the number of unfilled job vacancies across the economy as a whole are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.3/3">In addition, it should be noted that parliamentary constituencies are often a poor match to the area covered by the local labour market. The number and range of jobs available to people within normal travel to work distances often extends well beyond immediate constituency boundaries.</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.2/2">Estimates of the number of dependent children in lone parent households or dependent children in lone parent families are readily available from different sources. Dependent children in lone parent families include children who may not be included in lone parent households, usually because they live in a multiple family household. Figures for England and Wales taken from the 2001 Census show that there were 2.4 million dependent children living in lone parent households, while there were 2.7 million dependent children living in lone parent families. Historic time series data are only readily available for children in lone parent families not households.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/3">Historic estimates of the number of dependent children living in lone parent families in Great Britain are available in past issues of Population Trends. The relevant issues are 109 (autumn 2002): One parent families and the dependent children living in them in Great Britain and 91 (spring 1998): One parent families and their dependent children. These are collated in the following table.</p>

Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> 3. Notified vacancies are the monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br/> 4.

	<p pid="a.472W.11/1">We do not hold this information centrally. Empty dwelling management orders (EDMOs) are part of a wider range of powers available to local authorities to tackle empty homes in their area. We want to encourage voluntary reoccupation of empty homes but this can only work where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy. We are confident that the legislation is beginning to work well and local authorities claim that in many cases the threat of an EDMO has been sufficient to make owners take action to bring long-term empty homes back into use.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.11/2">We are keen for local authorities to make use of EDMOs, where appropriate, and are supporting the independent Empty Homes Agency's new guidance on EDMOs, which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-10">10 March</phrase>. The guidance is internet based and interactive and will take local authorities through the EDMO process step by step. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing (Margaret Beckett) provided a foreword for the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.11/3">We are also hosting a seminar at which I will address local authorities encouraging them to take action and to share best practice on tackling empty homes, including the use of EDMOs.</p>

	<p pid="a.484W.9/1">A business is eligible for small business rate relief if its sole or main property has a rateable value of less than &pound;15,000 (or &pound;21,500 in Greater London); and each additional property it occupies, if any, has a rateable value of no more than &pound;2,200; and the total rateable value of all of its properties is less than &pound;15,000 (&pound;21,500 in Greater London).</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.9/2">While the Government hold information on the rateable value of individual properties, they do not currently hold information on the rateable value of all properties held by each individual business. It is not therefore currently possible to establish the number of businesses that meet the eligibility criteria for small business rate relief. That is why currently ratepayers must declare to the relevant billing authority that they meet the criteria for the relief. Without the declaration it is not possible to establish whether a ratepayer occupies more than one property.</p>

Exact information on payments received by a local authority from the registered social landlord for a particular transfer would need to be ascertained from the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.486W.5/2">The values shown in the table are in respect of the gross transfer price for all positive value stock transfer where local authorities should have received a payment. In arriving at such values the Department and local authorities use a model agreed with HM Treasury to establish a 30 year tenanted market value (TMV) of the dwellings to be transferred. The TMV reflects the intended continued use of the properties for social housing: it is always less than the open market value. The TMV is calculated as the net present value of the RSL's projected stream of income from renting out the transferred stock, less its planned expenditure (including investment) stream. The precise details of payments received by LAs would need to be requested from Las themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.5/1">The Tenant Services Authority has no responsibilities in respect of leaseholders who own 100 per cent. of the interest in their homes. Leaseholders already have access to a wide range of protections and rights. The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 limits the Tenant Services Authority's future regulatory remit to 'social housing', which includes low cost rental and low cost home ownership accommodation as defined in sections 69-70 of the Act (including some types of &quot;shared ownership&quot; agreement), but not other owner-occupied homes or the private rented sector. However the Tenant Services Authority is likely to be interested in how registered providers deliver management across their stock.</p>

	<p pid="a.515W.2/1">The ELQ policy fundamentally addresses the perennial need of employers for a greater proportion of the population to acquire higher level skills because it represents a redistribution of funding from those who have already benefited from higher education to first time entrants. The policy also seeks to supply employers with more of the graduates they need most. Students co-funded by employers and those studying for foundation degrees are exempt from the policy and strategically important science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects still attract institutional funding when studied as an ELQ. To discern whether there is more the policy can do we have instructed HEFCE in their current review of the impact of the ELQ policy that, while they should continue to prioritise first time students, they should seek to assist universities in responding to the economic circumstances if appropriate changes are suggested by the evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.518W.2/1">A significant contribution to assisting patients to eat at mealtimes is the Protected Mealtimes Initiative (PMI), which was introduced by NHS Estates in partnership with the Royal College of Nursing in 2004, as part of the Better Hospital Food programme. The initiative is now led by the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) which has been working with key stakeholders in the development of a toolkit to assist national health service organisations in the implementation of the '10 Key Characteristics of Good Nutritional Care'. A factsheet relating to Protected Mealtimes was developed and launched in April 2008 and the NPSA will be launching the complete toolkit later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.2/2">Policy regarding families being present at patients' mealtimes is determined by local NHS organisations. Such organisations often establish action plans aimed at improving access to their meal services. A frequently used element of such plans is the 'red tray scheme', which identifies to ward staff, those patients at risk of poor nutrition.</p>

			<tr pid="a.520W.2/18"> <td colspan="6"><i> Notes:</i><br/> <i> General</i><br/> Strategic health authorities were reconfigured between 2005-06 and 2006-07. Separate figures for South Central and South East Coast SHAs are only available for the period from 2006-07. A total for the South East is provided for the period up to 2005-06.<br/> Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> <i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol.<br/> Details of the proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br/> Figures for under 16s are excluded because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s.<br/> <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in hospital episode statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/>  Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Assignment of episodes to years</i><br/> Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital episode statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.521W.2/1">We are informed by the chairman of Monitor (the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) that a detailed description of the assessment process for NHS foundation trust (NHS FT) applicants is set out in the document 'Applying for NHS Foundation Trust Status&mdash;Guide for Applicants' (Monitor and the Department of Health, November 2008). A copy of this document has been placed in the Library and is also available from Monitor's website:</p>

	<p pid="a.521W.2/3">Monitor has three main criteria which it applies to all applicants for NHS FT status. The applicant trust must be:</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/4" class="indent">Legally constituted;</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/5" class="indent">Well governed; and</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/6" class="indent">Financially viable.</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/7">Monitor's intensive assessment process takes approximately three months. Trusts must submit a wide range of information as evidence to support each category. Monitor reviews all the evidence submitted and conducts interviews with key stakeholders including primary care trusts, strategic health authorities, and the Healthcare Commission. Monitor probes the boards of each applicant trust to examine their capability to operate autonomously by questioning different aspects of their application, examples of which include:</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/8" class="indent">Does the board have arrangements in place for monitoring and continually improving the quality of healthcare provided to its patients?</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/9" class="indent">How is the board assured that it has action plans in place to meet existing targets and national core standards?</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/10" class="indent">Are there clear structures and comprehensive procedures in place for the effective working of the NHS FT board?</p>
	<p pid="a.521W.2/11" class="indent">Is the board confident that the senior management has the capability to and experience necessary to deliver the strategy set out in its business plan?</p>

	<p pid="a.527W.8/1">It is difficult to isolate the effect of the NMW on take home pay as take home pay is affected by hours worked and other sources of income such as tax credits and taxes. However, evidence suggests that since its introduction the NMW is affecting more people and the hourly wage is rising faster than average earnings and prices benefiting the lowest paid in the economy. The adult NMW has risen by around 59 per cent. since its introduction in 1999 from &pound;3.60 to &pound;5.73 per hour. The rise in the NMW has been greater than average earnings (around 46 per cent.) and retail price inflation (around 32 per cent. over the same period (April 1999 to October 2008).</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.8/2">Evidence from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) shows that a growing number of people are affected by the National Minimum Wage (NMW). BERR estimates that around 1.1 million people in the UK were covered by the October 2008 uprating of the NMW.</p>
	<p pid="a.527W.8/3">Information below Government office region is not readily available from the ASHE dataset. However, using spring 2008 ASHE data we estimate that around 93,000 employees were covered in East Midlands by the latest October 2008 NMW upratings.</p>

	<p pid="a.533W.0/1">Two tables have been placed in the Libraries and show the sponsorship arrangements for each of the academies open in March 2009. The first, headed &quot;Traditional Procurement Academies&quot; shows for each academy where sponsorship is a contribution to capital costs, the total pledged, the amount for which the Department has evidence of receipt, and the amount still expected. In some cases further sponsorship payments may have already been received by the Academy Trust but not yet reported to the Department. The second table, headed &quot;Endowment Sponsorship Academies&quot; shows for each academy where sponsorship is in the form of contributions to an endowment fund, the amounts pledged, the amounts reported so far to the Department as received and the amount still expected. As with the first category, there may be cases where further sponsorship has already been received by the Academy Trust but not yet reported to the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.0/2">Sponsorship in kind is additional to formal sponsorship requirements, the Department does not therefore keep records of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.0/3">In the case of &quot;Traditional Procurement Academies&quot; the timing of the receipt of cash sponsorship varies from academy to academy and is agreed as part of the Funding agreement between the Department and the academy.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.0/4">In the case of the &quot;Endowment Model&quot;, receipts commence only after the academy has opened, and usually over a period of five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.533W.3/1">There is no legal duty on schools or their staff to support a pupil with medical needs or to administer or supervise the taking of medicines. However, schools are encouraged to develop policies on managing medicines and supporting pupils with medical needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.3/2">The Department has issued guidance to schools to help them support their pupils. Our guidance to schools, 'Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings', issued jointly with the Department of Health in 2005, gives advice to schools on how they can support pupils with medical needs. It also encourages schools to draw up, in consultation with parents and medical professionals, individual Health Care Plans for children with medical needs. We produced sister guidance in the same year, entitled 'Including me: managing complex health needs in schools and early years settings'.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.3/3">In addition, since September 2007, schools have a duty to promote the well-being of all pupils, including those with long term medical conditions. This duty defines well-being as the five outcomes of the Every Child Matters, including being healthy and staying safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.3/4">The Child Health Strategy, Better Health: Brighter Futures, published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-12">12 February</phrase>, announced that we will be revising the guidance to schools on managing medicines which will include clear statements of expectations of those involved in supporting pupils with medical conditions, such as schools and PCTs. This work will be done in consultation with expert organisations and will be supported with an awareness raising campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.5/3">These figures relate to the number of orders made counted on a 'per child' basis, meaning that where an order affects two children it will be counted twice.

	<p pid="a.535W.5/4">Between 2004 and 2006, activity in the FPCs was reported on manual statistical returns. The figures were subject to an adjustment to take account of non-response to this data collection exercise. Figures for these years should be treated as estimates for this reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.5/5">The England and Wales totals may differ from those previously published in the annual &quot;Judicial and Court Statistics&quot; command paper due to updates made within the FamilyMan system used in the courts since publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.540W.5/1">The Waterhouse report, published in February 2000, identified a number of shortcomings in children's social services, including the failure to record, retrieve and understand the significance of information about children. The Department of Health (DH) published the conceptual framework for the Integrated Children's System (ICS) as a consultation document in December 2002. It consisted of an integration of the &quot;Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families&quot; (issued under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970) and the &quot;Looking After Children&quot; guidance, to provide an assessment, planning, intervention and reviewing model for all children in need. The conceptual framework was used to develop a set of requirements for local authorities to procure systems from IT suppliers to support the delivery of the model.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.5/2">These requirements were subsequently specified in further detail by the Department, in response to a progress review of implementation by all local authorities in 2006. Each requirement was reviewed with reference to industry standard attributes intended to make it unambiguous, traceable, testable and measurable for compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.5/3">The published requirements documents detail in full the statutory and regulatory sources of each requirement. An additional source of requirements includes new criteria requested in consultation by local authorities in 2008. These documents are obtainable from the following public sources.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.2/1">The Government acknowledge the difficulties disabled parents, including deaf parents, face. The most recent assessment made by the Secretary of State on the Department for Children, Schools and Families' report on progress towards disability equality under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, was published in December 2008. It describes both what is happening within the DCSF to promote disability equality and what the entire sector is doing and how we are working together to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/2">In December 2008 DCSF published its first Secretary of State report on progress towards disability equality across the children's and education sector. Although there is no specific reference to deafness, or indeed other impairments with the exception of learning difficulties, this impairment is part of this report in as much as it is about disability and this of course comes within that definition.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/3">In 2006 we asked each local authority to develop a parenting strategy within their children and young people's plan&mdash;these set out how the authority and its partners will make sure that parents get the services they need, including parents with disabilities. Most local authorities have developed strategies and have now moved into implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/4">To further support successful implementation of these strategies our parenting implementation project is working with 18 local authorities to test and develop new and innovative approaches to effective delivery of support services to parents and families. One of the project's work streams is considering the needs of parents with disabilities. The learning from the project will be shared with all local authorities in summer 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/5">We will continue to engage with stakeholders, including examining wider research relating to disabled parents' involvement in their children's education, to identify barriers to their effective engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/6">The Secretary of State's report on disability equality can be found at the Department's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/des/sosreport.shtml">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/des/sosreport.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/8">DCSF's Single Equality Scheme can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/publications/des/docs/single_equalityscheme.doc">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/publications/des/docs/single_equalityscheme.doc</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/10">With regard to services for parents, our Parent Know How Programme provides funding to a range of third sector partners to provide information and advice services for all parents. Within this ParentlinePlus provides a confidential textphone service for parents and carers who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech impairment. It is available on 0800 783 6783 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. As part of the ParentCast project we are preparing two videos targeted specifically at deaf parents&mdash;both are in British sign language (with an option for subtitles in English) which emphasise the need for deaf parents to have access to the same services as all other parents. The first video is about how two deaf parents got engaged in school activities and the second promotes the use of extended schools to deaf parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/11">We encourage schools to use a range of ways to enhance the partnership with parents and carers, including advising schools to find out from parents what they would find helpful and what would encourage them to come into the school and participate at parents' evenings.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/12">The Children's Plan, 2007, highlighted a partnership with parents as a 'unifying theme' across the whole plan and promised action on three fronts:</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/13" class="indent">an enhanced dialogue between the school and parents;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/14" class="indent">parental involvement in school governance;</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/15" class="indent">and an expansion of family learning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/16">We have promoted parental engagement in learning in other ways&mdash;for example, through encouraging parents and children to read together by providing free books to all families with young children through Bookstart, by improving access to information through Parent Know How, and by putting parent support advisers in place in many schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/17">These measures have made a difference. Evidence shows that mothers and fathers now feel more involved in their child's school life&mdash;up from 29 per cent. in 2001 to 51 per cent. in 2007&mdash;and have an increasing appetite for involvement. But these figures also show that more can be done to bring parents centre stage in their child's learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/18">To drive this forward, we proposed in The Children's Plan: Progress Report, published in December 2008, an approach which both empowers parents to engage and places parental engagement more centrally in the school and early years system. We made it clear that we will issue guidance to schools on working in partnership with parents and that that this guidance will cover how schools work with disabled, including deaf, parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.544W.2/97">The tables show closures where the schools ceased to be maintained and were not replaced. There are other circumstances involving school closure which have been excluded from the table because replacement provision was established, for example in the case of a change to a school's religious character or an amalgamation of an infant and junior school to form a primary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/98">Figures given in an earlier response differ slightly to those given in the following tables. Some double counting of secondary school closures meant a higher number of closures were previously recorded.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.3/1">Devolved Formula Capital (DFC) is allocated at school level, to be spent on whichever capital improvement a school considers to be the most beneficial, based on local priorities. Other funds can also be added to DFC, from the local authority and elsewhere, to improve facilities.

The Government are committed to ensuring social work is a high quality, high status profession committed to excellent practice and respected by clients and the wider public. We agree with lord laming that social work should become a Masters-level profession. We expect this to be an important element of the long-term and comprehensive reform programme for social work which will be informed by the advice of the Social Work Task Force and which we will set out in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.5/1">The Masters in Teaching and Learning (MTL) programme is currently being developed by MTL providers, which are schools and higher education institutions working together, and the Training and Development Agency for Schools. One of the aims is to develop a flexible programme, which can be personalised to meet each teacher's learning needs, reflecting the role being undertaken by that teacher. It is therefore not possible to provide details of time commitments for individual teachers at this stage. It is important to remember that, although teachers may need to undertake some study in their own time, the programme will be practice-based, with learning centred around what is happening in the classroom.</p>
