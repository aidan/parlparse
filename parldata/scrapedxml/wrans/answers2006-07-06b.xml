	<p pid="b.1242W.6/1">In 2004, 6.3 per cent. of general medical services (GMS) partnerships had opted out of providing childhood immunisation services. In 2005, the proportion of GMS partnerships opting out was reported to be 36.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.6/2">Comparison between 2004 and 2005 childhood immunisation services opt-out data should be undertaken with caution. Data as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase> was the first year in which opt-out data was collected on a partnership basis following the change in the general practitioner (GP) contract in April 2004. The figures published as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> (a revision of earlier collected data) shows a great increase in the number of partnerships opting-out of childhood immunisation services, with no corresponding explanation of the increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.6/3">The 2004 and 2005 data is published in full by The Information Centre for health and social care and can be found at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/73/41/04107341.xls">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/73/41/04107341.xls</a>. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.6/4">However, as part of its statutory duties, each primary care trust, under section 16CC of the National Health Services Act 1977(a), must provide a childhood immunisation scheme. If a GP opts out, then one per cent. is removed from the GPs global sum payment. This allows the primary care trust to re-provide the service with another contractor or to self-provide.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242W.9/1">The value of contracts let for the core components of the national programme for information technology, which is being delivered by the department's NHS Connecting for Health Agency, amounts to &pound;6.2 billion over 10 years and this has not increased. Information about local national health service expenditure on implementing the programme, separate from the totality of NHS spending on information technology, is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242W.9/2">However, the National Audit Office (NAO) have calculated that the full gross cost of the programme including national contracts and legitimately approved additions, other central expenditure, and local implementation costs is approximately &pound;12.4 billion at 2004-05 prices. But this figure does not take into account anticipated savings in the price paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, or in NHS staff time saved through using the programme's systems and services. The NAO report acknowledges an independent evaluation that confirms that &pound;4.5 billion has been saved by central rather than local procurement and also acknowledges a further &pound;860 million of savings achieved through centrally negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.2/1">The NHS Care Records Service (NHS CRS) is the key component of the new systems and services being delivered through the national programme for information technology. It has a number of applications, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/2" class="indent">personal demographics service (PDS), which holds nationally demographic information for every patient covered by the national health service in England, accessible through local systems, and is currently processing message transactions at a rate of over 9 million per month;</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/3" class="indent">spine directory services, which holds reference data such as users and locations. Over 260,000 users are now registered, around 50,000 currently access the system on any given day;</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/4" class="indent">access control framework, which registers and authenticates users, including patients, and provides a single log-in and a record of each professional accessing a NHS care record; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/5" class="indent">transaction messaging system, which processes and routes data messages, for example from a GP to a hospital or from one general practitioner to another.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/6">Introduction of the NHS CRS has not been delayed. These four elements went live on time and to budget in July 2004 to support choose and book. Among other planned applications, the first stage of the secondary uses service went live in June 2005 to support payment by results. Other core modules are scheduled for release over the course of 2006 and 2007. However, ambitious initial targets were set to drive the programme, and some individual components have been delayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/7">In general implementation is being achieved in carefully managed stages, via incremental rollout both geographically, and by increasing functionality over time to build the care record. The programme is about patient and clinician benefit and improved safety. We believe it is best to get things right in the long term rather than to push on regardless against a rigid timetable and risk getting things wrong in the short term. In the context of a 10-year programme the impact of this is limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/8">When fully deployed, the NHS CRS will be made up of records of individual clinicians recording episodes of care, key aspects of which will be placed in the detailed care record for sharing with others as their roles allow within local health communities, and a summary care record. The national programme's national clinical leads, working with NHS Connecting for Health, have undertaken work with a wide range of groups including the British Medical Association and the royal colleges to consider the best way of populating and launching the summary care record.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.2/9">As a result, a limited amount of clinical information will be automatically uploaded, such as prescriptions and allergies. More detailed information would then be added on a case by case basis. This approach is supported by the BMA on the basis that as it takes full account of the views of patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251W.2/1">Following publication of the strategy 'Delivering 21<sup>(st)</sup> Century IT support for the NHS', the NHS chief executive wrote to the chief executives of all national health service bodies in September 2003 explaining their responsibilities for implementing the national programme for information technology (NPfTT) and for using programme contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251W.2/2">Local programmes, led by trust executives and supported from the Department, have always been at the heart of implementation, taking responsibility for planning the pace and sequence of deployments. In addition, the Department has routinely used its planning and performance management regime to support local implementation of the national programme. For example, during 2004 annual planning round, the NHS were provided with targets relating to the planning and implementation of the programme. Similarly, in June 2005, the Department wrote to all strategic health authority (SHA) chief executives requiring the establishment of integrated service improvement programmes as a vehicle for bringing together benefits and improvements from current NHS initiatives and programmes, including NPfIT. In November 2005 the Department's delivery director reiterated the importance of giving close attention to issues relating to delivery of the programme, and that implementation and use of NPfIT systems and services should be one of the key priorities of all NHS organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256W.2/1">Reducing obesity is one of the six overarching priorities of the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper, published in November 2004. In July 2004, the Government set a public service agreement (PSA) target to halt the year-on-year increase in obesity among children under 11 by 2010 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/2">Specific actions to reduce childhood obesity include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/3" class="indent">requirements to meet healthy eating and physical activity criteria to achieve Healthy School status;</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/4" class="indent">new school food-based standards from September 2006, followed by more stringent nutrient-based standards in primary schools by September 2008, and secondary schools by September 2009;</p>

	<p pid="b.1256W.2/6" class="indent">looking at ways of restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children;</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/7" class="indent">working with the food industry to reduce levels of fat, salt and sugar in products, and to provide front-of-pack labelling to enable consumers to make informed choices;</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/8" class="indent">development of a healthy living social marketing campaign; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/9" class="indent">providing an activity toolkit for schools to support physical activity across the school day, including the journey to school and after school clubs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.2/10">In addition, we have published a self-help guide to assist parents in managing their children's weight, a care pathway for treating and managing childhood obesity and an obesity bulletin to give practitioners and managers new tools to handle obesity. We are strengthening our actions in early years through schemes like Sure Start and through health visitors' targeted interventions. The data on height and weight that primary care trusts (PCTs) will be collecting in primary schools from this summer will help them identify which areas, schools or children's centres need particular help. Comprehensive National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines on the prevention and treatment of obesity will also support PCTs' and practitioners' contribution to tackling obesity locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1257W.11/1">In developing the campaign, the Department is consulting with stakeholders, and the possible impact of the campaign on the demand for sexual health services is being carefully considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257W.11/2">The campaign planning process takes account of the fact that many areas will need time to make use of the major new investment, provided through the 'Choosing Health' White Paper, to improve capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257W.11/3">The campaign will particularly target 16 to 24-year-olds, the group at highest risk, and links closely to the joint Department and Department for Education and Skills media campaign that supports the teenage pregnancy strategy. It will initially focus on strong prevention messages to minimise the immediate pressure on services until such time as the number of new infections begins to stabilise or decline. Only then will the campaign start to signpost people to screening and treatment. And this will happen gradually through local mechanisms to help ensure clinics will be able to meet demand, as progress is made in modernising sexual health services through the chlamydia screening programme, improved access to genito-urinary medicine and reproductive health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257W.11/4">The Department has not set a firm date for the campaign launch but current plans are being developed for later this year. We are committed to the most effective action possible and ensuring that we work closely with stakeholders. The overall aim of the campaign will be to drive greater personal responsibility for sexual health.</p>

The Budget announced the extension of the 20 pence per litre duty differential for biofuels until 2008-09, and set out a range of announcements about the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, which will begin in 2008-09 and will ensure biofuels comprise 5 per cent. of the road fuels market by 2010-11. Furthermore, we are awaiting state aid clearance to introduce an enhanced capital allowance (ECA) for the cleanest biofuels production plant, to support innovation and help develop the lowest-carbon biofuels production methods.</p>

	<p pid="b.1265W.0/1">Latest Government Actuary Department (GAD) analysis shows that the guaranteed rates of return available on annuities by around age 75 become so large relative to other investments that increasingly unrealistic investment returns need to be achieved in order to match or do better than the income that could be achieved through an annuity. Any investment vehicle with an expected yield greater than an annuity after 75 would inevitably be both expensive and carry a significant degree of risk, which people in the later stages of life may be ill-equipped to bear. Of course the optimal age for individuals to annuitise before 75 will depend on a range of individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.0/2">A comprehensive academic survey on annuity pricing was published in March 2006. The authors conclude that after looking at the most recent analysis,</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The mark-up paid to life insurers&mdash;measured by the so-called money's worth ratio&mdash;is relatively small and fairly constant, thus suggesting that annuities are fairly priced&quot;.</p>

Since 2001, the Agency has undertaken further detailed investigatory works to confirm the problem and determine the remedial solution required.</p>

During these additional investigations, unexpected structural defects in the bridge were identified. As a result, traffic using the sliproad will continue to be restricted to a single lane, with a 40mph speed limit, for safety reasons. Short-term measures, and options for a permanent solution, are under consideration, and the timing of the resulting works will be subject to the scale of the work required and the availability of funding.</p>

Instead, Global Witness has called for timber companies not to import illegally logged timber, and for the Chinese Government to suspend imports of logs and processed timber across the China-Burma border. China has taken action by closing its border crossings to timber trucks from Burma. Burma officials have also been trying to stop the trade in recent months, and the military regime suspended tree-cutting, timber transport and log shipments to China at the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.1296W.0/1">Governments adhering to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises encourage enterprises operating in or from their territories to observe the Guidelines wherever they operate. Chapter II&mdash;General Policies states that enterprises should</p>

	<p pid="b.1296W.0/3">Chapter II&mdash;General Policies also states that enterprises should</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;encourage, where practicable, business partners, including suppliers and subcontractors, to apply principles of corporate conduct compatible with the Guidelines.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.0/5">As asserted m the September 2005 stakeholder consultation document on the UK national contact point's (NCP) promotion and implementation of the Guidelines, the NCP will follow its procedures where relevant and practicable if issues arise in non-adhering countries. Where information is not otherwise available, it may be able to obtain this through UK overseas posts. Where parties are unable to make their representations in the UK, it may undertake field visits, for which terms of reference will be established in advance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.0/6">The NCP has received no complaints relating to implementation of the Guidelines in specific instances by UK companies in Zimbabwe or Nigeria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.0/7">The NCP reports details of all complaints that it has decided justify consideration as a specific instance for inclusion in the OECD's annual report on the Guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="b.1296W.0/10" class="indent">&quot;information and views provided during the proceedings by another party involved will remain confidential, unless that other party agrees to their disclosure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.0/11">Accordingly, as asserted in the stakeholder consultation document, in the interests of transparency, the NCP will make available all documentation received from a party to other parties except in accordance with the exemptions provided for under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1296W.0/12">Details of the time taken to conclude specific instances by the NCP since it was set up following the decision of the OECD Council in June 2000 are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.5/1">Solar water heating for home owners have been supported as part of the Clear Skies programme, which had a &pound;13.25 million budget over three years beginning January 2003. To date over 5,500 household installations of solar water heating have been completed. We are continuing to support solar water heating, along with other microgeneration technologies, through the Low Carbon Buildings programme with a &pound;80 million budget over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.5/2">Since 2003, we have seen the installer base grow from approximately 80 to over 300 companies. Solar water heating is now a proven and commercial technology and we hope to see payback times reduce as economies of scale emerge in the supply chain, providing further benefits to householders. We also believe the Low Carbon Buildings programme will build on the achievements of the last three years and make a contribution to helping the industry move to a more sustainable market.</p>

Single year figures at local authority level are not representative due to small sample sizes and are therefore subject to fluctuation, so the average over the period 2001 to 2004 is a better representation than the figure for a single year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300W.3/3">The figures provided in the previous answer included conversions, which are only available at a regional level. The figures in this answer therefore exclude conversions, and as a result the regional total shown will be different.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300W.3/4">The tables also include figures for 1989 to 1992. Before 1989 the data was based on smaller samples and so is not comparable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1310W.2/1">On design quality standards Government have an ongoing dialogue with a range of professional bodies, either directly or through the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. Recently, we have not received any specific representations from specific professional bodies regarding design quality. The most recent was the March 2005 publication of the Royal Institute of British Architects' 'Manifesto for Architecture' (<a href="http://www.riba.org/go/RIBA/News/Policy_4440.html">http://www.riba.org/go/RIBA/News/Policy_4440.html</a>). However, this was not specific to Government, but aimed at a wider audience.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.2/2">On energy efficiency standards we are currently engaging a range of stakeholders in discussions around further reform of building regulations. During the period 2003 to 2005 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consulted widely on proposals for raising energy efficiency standards in line with commitments made in the Energy White Paper. These consultations supported improvements in energy efficiency standards through an amendment of the Building Regulations that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. I am aware that construction industry professional bodies have been active in disseminating the changes introduced.</p>

The Commissioners will have to have a demonstrable commitment to, and understanding of, the wider context of the equalities, human rights and good relations agendas. They will need to deal authoritatively with issues of equality that affect different people in different ways, depending on their circumstances.</p>

The Environment Agency's role for EIA purposes is as a statutory consultation body. There is a statutory appeal mechanism for an applicant for planning permission who disagrees with a planning authority's decision to require EIA.

	<p pid="b.1316W.5/1">As basements can provide extra space without additional land take, the Government supports their provision, in appropriate circumstances, as part of new housing or as alterations to existing properties. Whether planning permission is required depends on the circumstances of each particular case. For example, excavation below an existing property to create a basement would require planning permission whereas adapting an existing cellar would not require planning permission if all the works were internal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.5/2">The question of the need for planning permission for their provision in residential properties was one of a number of issues looked at by a group reviewing the subject of householder development consents more widely. The report of that group was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-04">4 July 2006</phrase> and it recognised that there was concern that the absence of guidance on the planning status of basements discouraged their wider use.

The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 provides controls on the development and use of land in all areas of the country. Whether the erection or use of any particular polytunnel is deemed to constitute 'development' under the Act will depend on the facts of each case, taking account of such matters as the scale, manner of construction and extent and nature of fixation of the polytunnel. Ultimately, this is a matter for the courts to determine.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.8/1">Since 1997, the Government have put in place a range of policy initiatives and measures to assist local authorities to deliver an urban renaissance, including the re-development of town and city centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/2">The Urban White Paper &quot;Our Towns and Cities: the Future&quot; published in 2000 identified a range of measures (policies, programmes and tax incentives) to foster and support an urban regeneration, including city centre renewal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/3">Over &pound;2 billion in funds is provided annually to England's nine regional development agencies (RDAs) to promote regional economic growth and urban regeneration, including support for city centre renaissance. English Partnerships (EP), the national regeneration agency, has a direct role in fostering urban renaissance. Together with the RDAs, EP has helped set up 21 urban regeneration companies, in partnership with local authorities, to drive forward regeneration projects many of them targeted on city centre re-development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/4">National economic stability has provided a solid foundation for local economic strategies and public-private partnerships which have attracted huge investment into city centre initiatives. Major public investment in civic squares, parks, open spaces, parks and river frontages has also attracted private investors to commit funds to major city centre schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/5">Through the Government's Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres (March 2005), assistance is given to local authorities and stakeholders on how to plan proactively for the redevelopment of town centres. It advises on how the Government's key objective, to promote the vitality and viability of town centres, should be taken into account in producing statutory development plans, and determining planning applications for town centre uses, such as retail, leisure and office development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.8/6">Also in March 2005, the Government published the &quot;How to Manage Town Centres&quot; guide, to assist local councils and other stakeholders in applying the powers and tools available for tackling priority issues, particularly those related to making town centres safer and cleaner. The guide includes examples of innovative approaches for using them and examples of good practice, and outlines the importance of pooling and sharing local information, responsive and pro-active local leadership, developing town centre strategies which are linked to local planning, crime and disorder reduction, licensing and transport strategies, and partnership working.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319W.13/1">The Animal Procedures Committee (APC) is an independent body set up under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to advise the Home Secretary and the Department of Health, Social Security and Public Safety Northern Ireland Minister on matters concerned with the 1986 Act and their functions under it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.13/2">Excluding the chairman, there must be a minimum of 12 members, one must be a lawyer and at least two thirds must be medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons or have qualifications or experience in a biological subject. At least half of the members must not have held a licence to carry out procedures on animals within the last six years and animal welfare interests must be adequately represented. The Act places certain restrictions on the balance of interests and competences to be represented and also limits the maximum term of membership to two consecutive terms of four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.13/3">There are currently 19 members of the Committee (including the chairman). Seven have a background and expertise in animal welfare. However, all members of the committee share a common concern for the welfare of the animals used in scientific procedures, and, under section 20(2) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, in considering any matter must have regard both to the legitimate requirements of science and industry and to the protection of animals against avoidable suffering and unnecessary use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.13/4">All appointments are made jointly with the Department for Health, Social Services and Public Safety for Northern Ireland (DHSSPSNI). Members are selected on personal merit, and not as nominees, delegates or representatives of any organisations or pressure groups. The posts are unpaid. Nevertheless, every effort is made to ensure that the Nolan principles are applied and to that end we entrust the management of the process to the Appointments Commission. All appointments to the Animal Procedures Committee are announced publicly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1324W.2/1">Section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (CJCS) inserted new provisions in section 38 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). These provisions enable police custody officers to detain a person after charge for the purposes of taking a sample (of urine or other non-intimate sample) to test for the presence of specified Class A drugs, subject to conditions and procedures set out in sections 63B and 63C of PACE .</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.2/2">The Drugs Act 2005 (section 7 and paragraphs 1-4 of Schedule 1) subsequently amended section 63B and other sections of PACE to allow for the testing of adults for specified Class A drugs on arrest while retaining the powers for testing on charge in the case of adults and the under eighteens (where applicable). Where a person has tested positive under these powers, section 9 of the Drugs Act introduced a new power for the police to require adults to attend an assessment of their drug use or face a criminal sanction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.2/3">This legislation forms a core part of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) and aims to identify problematic drug misusers at the earliest opportunity of their contact with the criminal justice system and get them into drug treatment and other support. Currently, drug testing operates within the 71 crime partnership areas across England and Wales with high levels of acquisitive crime, the so called 'DIP intensive areas'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.2/4">The volume of tests conducted under this legislation continues to grow. Some 17, 400 adult drug tests were carried out in April 2006, more than three times the number in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.2/5">The Home Office has received no specific recent representations about the operation of section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 although a number of police forces have made enquiries about introducing drug testing in their areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1324W.5/1">The total number of disclosure applications received and disclosures issued by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in the last 12 months is contained in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.5/2">Information on the average length of time taken to process the checks during these periods is not available in the format requested. The CRB operates to a set of a Published Service Standards (PSS) which for the majority of the period was to publish 93 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks. The monthly performance measured against the PSS is as shown in tables 2 and 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.5/3">The four week target for Enhanced Disclosures is made up of two distinct parts. The CRB is required to process 90 per cent. of valid Enhanced Disclosure applications to the police within 10 days, with the police forces required to process 95 per cent. of the checks within a further 14 days. The CRB consistently exceeded their target in 2005-06 and, for May 2006, processed 97.4 per cent. of applications to the police within 10 days. The CRB and the police forces are working together to reduce police completion times in line with the overall service standard objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324W.5/4">The CRB recently published its Five-Year Strategy and Business Plan 2006-07 and the PSS for the financial year 2006-07 for Standard Disclosures is 90 per cent. within 10 days and for Enhanced Disclosures 90 per cent. within 28 days. The shortening of the Standard Disclosure PSS is the result of the effectiveness of the CRB's internal processes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1326W.5/1">All 43 forces in England and Wales have been using the IMPACT nominal index (INI) since it was deployed in December 2005 to a child abuse investigation unit, with at least two trained users, in each force. The IMPACT programme will complete deployment to force child abuse investigation units by the end of July this year, on the basis of requirements identified by chief constables, which will mean that 850 staff (around a third of all staff in this business area) will be trained in the use of the INI.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326W.5/2">Although the IMPACT nominal index is currently intended to be used primarily for child protection, officers from other business areas may, with the authority of an officer of at least superintendent rank, have searches carried out where necessary for the prevention or detection of serious crime. It is our intention to deploy the INI to other business areas following full deployment to child abuse investigation units but we do not plan to train all officers in the use of the INI or to give all officers direct access to the system; searches can be carried out on their behalf. Which areas should receive the application, and in which order, will be determined in consultation with the police service, informed by the outcome of current trials involving the Thames Valley Force Intelligence Bureau; the Child Exploitation and On-line Protection Centre; the East Midlands Regional Special Operations Unit and the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command. At the conclusion of the trials in August, the IMPACT Programme Board will have a better understanding of the business benefits and resources required to respond to inter-force requests for information following a match on the INI. It is for forces to determine how to manage the resource requirements to implement the new operational capability we are delivering. The INI is being developed to incorporate certain local audit and administration functions. We are currently assessing the impact of INI on forces in terms of the operational benefits delivered by the system and the demands associated with responding to inter-force enquiries. On-site surveys and case reviews are being conducted to identify the type and number of cases where INI-identified data have made a significant contribution to their work.

	<p pid="b.1328W.2/1">Figures for the number of items handed in during the knife amnesty are being collected at police force level and will be released shortly. 17,715 items were handed in in England and Wales during the first week of the amnesty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/2">We worked closely with ACPO to develop the arrangements for the amnesty, which was part of our wider strategy to tackle knife crime. We are also focusing on legislation, enforcement, education and prevention. We have brought forward provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill that will raise the age at which someone can be sold a knife to 18; are introducing a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon; and are giving head teachers powers to search pupils for knives. The Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-19">19 June 2006</phrase> that he was giving very serious consideration to the suggestion that the maximum sentence for having a knife or blade in a public place should be increased from the current sentence of 2 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/3">Many police forces are undertaking tough enforcement operations, for example, the Metropolitan police's Operation Blunt and the British Transport police's Operation Shield, which uses search equipment to detect those carrying knives and other weapons on our transport network. We are also supporting educational initiatives that demonstrate to young people the dangers of carrying knives, and reinforce the message that carrying a knife can result in it being turned on you.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.2/4">Through our small grants programme, the Connected Fund, we are also supporting a wide range of local community projects which work with young people to provide mentoring, training, education and other support.</p>

Local accountability will remain, as operational policing in local areas will continue to be conducted by the BCD under the supervision of the commander.

	<p pid="b.1333W.8/1">Of the officers who retired with either an ordinary pension or an ill-health pension in 2004-05 10.5 per cent. retired with an ill-health pension, based on available data from 42 out of 43 forces. Since the number of retirements is liable to change from year to year, the rate of ill-health retirement is now measured against the number of officers in service, this being a more stable measure. For 2004-05 the rate of ill-health retirement was three per 1,000 serving officers. These figures are published in HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary's annual report for 2004-05 (page 25) which can be found at: <a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc0506/hc08/0842/0842.pdf">http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc0506/hc08/0842/0842.pdf</a>. This represents a significant improvement in performance, the rate having been 14 per 1000 in 1997-98.</p>

The Metropolitan Police Service Anti-Terrorist Branch would be informed in appropriate cases. Any information received by the Anti-Terrorist Branch is logged, assessed and prioritised formally on a daily basis. This process would include detailed inquiries to establish the veracity or otherwise of the information.</p>

	<p pid="b.1337W.9/1">Since August 2005, over 460 individuals have been arrested on suspicion of drugs related offences in Afghanistan. Prosecutors have handled over 350 cases and over 150 individuals have been convicted. This progress is being supported by improvements to the criminal justice system infrastructure, including the establishment of dedicated and secure narcotics courts and prison facilities. A counter narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force of 80 Afghan investigators, prosecutors and judges has been established to work with the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan specifically to conduct drugs prosecutions. New Afghan counter narcotics legislation was adopted in December 2005. The new law gives wide-ranging powers for prosecution of drugs offenders, covering both those transporting drugs and those facilitating or conspiring to do so, and sets out stringent minimum sentences for drug trafficking offences and tough sentences for public officials interfering in cases.</p>

During this interruption of inspections, INVO has focused its activities on consolidating and further analysing the information collected, with the objective of identifying lessons learned for the future and determining to what extent the Agency's plan for resuming verification activities needs to be adapted in light of those lessons and the changing situation in Iraq. Periodic reports are filed with the UN Security Council. The IAEA has stated that it remains prepared to resume its field and related activities in Iraq, pending guidance from the UN Security Council.</p>

DNA Bioscience was not eligible to be accredited by DCA as it was not a testing facility, so had no ISO 17025 accreditation. Following an application from DNA Bioscience, DCA agreed that DNA Diagnostics Center (the laboratory DNA Bioscience used to conduct DNA tests) could be added to the accredited list. The Department then agreed orally in December 2004, that DNA Bioscience's details could be added to the accredited list, but this was not as a result of an application for accreditation.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.2/4" class="indent">I fully accept that the services offered to our customers in Bournemouth and Poole over the last few months has not been as I would want. We are part of the way through the creation of a network of Benefit Delivery Centres to modernise the processing of claims for benefit. Chippenham, which serves customers in Bournemouth and Poole, is one of these sites and I regret to say that there have been a number of local issues which have had the effect of reducing the level of service below acceptable levels. Specifically, we have been short of experienced staff and some key management posts were unfilled which has inhibited our ability to respond to local problems. Experience levels are growing and we have recently filled all of the management posts. We now have four senior managers on site and 22 junior managers to support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.2/5" class="indent">We have developed a local improvement plan and a number of steps have already been taken with some early signs of improvement showing through in the data for April. These steps include the recruitment of 38 additional staff and the transfer of four experienced Incapacity Benefit staff from another site to bolster experience levels. We have also reviewed our internal process from first contact by the customer to payment, which will reduce the time it takes to assess claims. We are reviewing progress against this plan weekly and putting in place arrangements to clear the arrears of claims that have built up by lending Chippenham additional help from outside.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.2/6" class="indent">I have set out in the attached tables the latest data on claims clearance at Chippenham and representations received. Neil Couling, Director of Benefits and Fraud, would be more than happy to meet with you to discuss these.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.2/7" class="indent">Finally, you ask about the difficulties being experienced by customers getting through to Chippenham by phone. Some technical issues have exacerbated problems but I am pleased to say that these issues are being addressed. Our contractors hope the service will start to improve in July. Benefit Delivery Centres have a key role to play in supporting the improvements to our services, including improving processing times and reducing fraud and error in the benefit system. For customers who are unable to access our services through the telephone or electronically, we still have other options including office interviews and home visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1352W.6/1">The Serving Personnel Continuous Attitude Survey (CAS) is a management information tool that is used to assess and monitor the attitudes of serving officers and soldiers over time. Its findings inform the development of service personnel strategy and policies. In the ninth Serving Personnel (SP9) survey, which was distributed in September 2005, question 66 was removed and replaced with question 39c, an open-ended question which asks &quot;If within the last 12 months you have suffered unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment and/or bullying and you have chosen not to complain please explain why?&quot;. The analysis of open-ended questions is complex and not contained in the Technical Annex of the CAS Report, which is placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/2">The analysis of question 39c is summarised as follows. It gives the number of comments made as well as a more detailed breakdown of the negative comments, which are used to identify areas for improvement. Overall, a total of 90 officers and 252 soldiers commented, which equates to 8 per cent. and 16 per cent. respectively of those who responded to the questionnaire.</p>

	<p pid="b.1353W.2/1">UK funding for the UN Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) is drawn from the Tri-departmental (FCO, MOD, DfID) peace-keeping budget.

The UK also currently provides six officers to MONUC, at a gross additional cost of &pound;740,000 in 2005-06. These officers fill key strategic posts, notably that of the Chief of Staff in the Eastern Division HQ in Kisangani, and the Military Assistant to the Force Commander in the MONUC Force HQ in Kinshasa. In addition, we have provided training support during the stand-up of the Eastern Division HQ and advice, with other nations, through the short-term deployment of a technical assessment mission.</p>

EUFOR RD Congo is deploying in support of MONUC and with the approval of the Congolese Transitional National Government. UK MOD is currently providing three personnel for EUFOR RD Congo: one officer for the Operational HQ in Germany; one officer for the Force HQ (FHQ) in Kinshasa, for the duration of the Operation; and one further officer from the European Air Group to the FHQ, to assist with planning and logistics for up to four weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1355W.2/1">The continued requirement for 771 Squadron's Maritime Counter Terrorism (MCT) role will be fully assessed in due course. Assuming the requirement remains, the task will be fulfilled by an equally capable military unit using an in-service helicopter, operating out of its usual base. Helicopters based at RNAS Culdrose would be considered along with all MOD helicopter types, and Culdrose would be considered as a possible future operating base for fulfilment of the MCT role currently undertaken by 771 Squadron.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361W.5/1">The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) has the policy lead on the re-use of public sector information, in accordance with the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations (2005 No. 1515) which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>. Since then OPSI has made a significant contribution in sharing best practice across the public sector. This includes developing an on-line licence that can be used across the whole of the public sector, developing an on-line assessment tool which gauges the effectiveness of public sector organisations in meeting their obligations, and speaking to over 400 public sector organisations about their new responsibilities. OPSI has also played a key role in setting standards of compliance and in the resolution of disputes. These initiatives help to encourage and facilitate the re-use of public sector information in the context of value added information products and services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377W.2/2">There are a few incinerators in Northern Ireland handling industrial waste although the incineration facilities for industrial or indeed other waste are not extensive. All such operations are required by the regulators to meet UK and European standards of operations. These standards, in particular the emission limits on discharges to air, are set at a level to ensure that there can be no meaningful impact on local air quality standards or any detriment to health. All incinerators undergo regular monitoring to ensure these standards are consistently met.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377W.2/3">The impact of all incinerators is also assessed by the regulators as part of the process of determining applications for the environmental permits that each incinerator must hold in order to operate. For the larger incinerators this includes the use of computer software to model the impact of emissions on local air quality.</p>

	<p pid="b.1378W.2/1">Our strategic priorities for adult learning which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase> are to: support adults who lack basic skills or the platform of skills for employability; ensure a wide range of opportunities at level 3; and, ensure the continued availability of a wide range of opportunities for personal and community development (PCDL). I reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard the funding for PCDL in mainstream further education and local authority funded adult education (adult and community learning) with a budget of &pound;210 million in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1378W.2/2">Overall we have increased further education funding nationally by around &pound;2.5 billion since 1997&mdash; equivalent to 48 per cent. in real terms. Our investment in adult learning will remain broadly stable at &pound;2.9 billion but the nature of provision will change. Colleges will provide more publicly funded long courses to meet national skills demands including a new free entitlement to a first full level 3 qualification for young adults for which we are making available new funds of &pound;25 million. Post-16 providers, including colleges, will provide around 3.5 million adult places in 2007/08, a reduction of around 6 per cent. compared to now.</p>

	<p pid="b.1379W.5/2">The entitlement must be free at the point of delivery. The funding the Government provide is not a subsidy, and should not be treated as such by providers. Providers must make no charge to parents for the funded hours accessed and must reduce their fees by the amount they would usually charge were the child not accessing a free place. Providers may not require parents to take up additional hours or services as a condition of access to a free place. To allow this practice could result in a two-tier system where real choice exists only for the well-off, and the most disadvantaged&mdash;precisely those who stand most to benefit from free provision&mdash;are excluded.</p>

	<p pid="b.1382W.0/1">The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Department holds regular meetings with representatives of the principal stakeholder groups for our policy areas and with relevant experts. Organisations and individuals can also contribute to the Department's formal consultations which abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation. Known stakeholders are alerted to the fact that a formal consultation is taking place. As required by the Code, the Department then gives feedback on the responses received and on how the consultation process influenced the policy decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1382W.0/2">Four Government Bills have been introduced to Parliament by the Department in the current parliamentary session, the Children and Adoption Bill, the Childcare Bill, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill and the Education and Inspections Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1382W.0/3">The Children and Adoption Bill was published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of both Houses, and the Government published their response to the report of that committee before the Bill was introduced to Parliament. Prior to that, the policy proposals on which the Bill was based were subject to full consultation through the Green Paper &quot;Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities&quot;. Discussions were held with key stakeholders throughout the preparation of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1382W.0/4">Full consultation was carried out on the Childcare Bill, including discussions with stakeholders and a formal consultation from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-15">15 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-07">7 October 2005</phrase>. The Department published a response to this consultation, &quot;Report on Responses to Consultation on Legislative Proposals for the Future of Childcare and Early Years Provision in England&quot;, in late October 2005, copies of which can be found in the House of Commons Library. Regular meetings were held throughout the framing and drafting of the Bill with key stakeholders including provider organisations, children's charities and local authority representatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1382W.0/5">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (SVG) Bill was subject to extensive consultation prior to introduction. A range of consultations have informed the development of the centralised vetting and barring scheme for which the SVG Bill will provide the statutory framework. In April 2005 a consultation was carried out on proposals for the vetting and barring scheme (VBS). Further engagement with stakeholders on the policy detail was carried out in December 2005, and January, March and April 2006 on the Independent Barring Board (IBB). The Department continues to consult with stakeholders as the VBS systems and processes are developed in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.1382W.0/6">Proposals for the Education and Inspections Bill were set out in the Schools White Paper &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&mdash;More Choice for Parents and Pupils&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase>. This followed on from the DfES Five Year Strategy published in July 2004 which was extensively consulted upon. In addition, it enacts the policies that were set out in the 2005 Labour party manifesto. The Department discussed the White Paper with a very wide range of stakeholders over recent months.</p>

	<p pid="b.1387W.0/1">The Government recognise the importance of personal finance education for all young people. The National Curriculum for Citizenship, which is compulsory at key stages 3 and 4 (11 to 16-year-olds), includes teaching pupils about how the economy functions, including the role of business and financial services. In addition, the DfES has asked the QCA, as part of the wider review of GCSE maths and the emphasis on improving functional skills, to consider including financial capability more explicitly in the maths curriculum. QCA has also developed a package of guidance for teachers of PSHE which includes two units of work on financial capability. In September 2004, we made work-related learning a statutory element of the curriculum, and from September 2005 are funding schools to develop a new focus on enterprise education, defined as enterprise capability supported by better financial capability and economic and business understanding. We are also working closely with the Financial Services Authority to take forward its Financial Capability Strategy which includes support for schools to deliver better personal finance education.</p>
