	<p pid="a.2121W.3/2">2008 was in exactly the same mould as previous years. The four Christmas receptions held in Northern Ireland in 2007 were attended by over 1,400 members of the public drawn from the criminal justice, policing, military, business, charity and community sectors. The guests included families of the security forces and serving personnel, representatives of victims groups, churches and businesses, as well as many others working in the community sectors across Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.2121W.3/3">These events provide some recognition of the tremendous contribution made by people, both individually and collectively, who have helped to transform Northern Ireland. We work hard to monitor costs at these occasions as we are mindful in Government of the need to provide value for money. Anyone with a close understanding of Northern Ireland will know the value of these occasions in bringing people together in a renewed political environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.2125W.5/3">The model was produced by the Civil Aviation Authority (commissioned by the trustees of the Air Travel Trust), to assess the sustainability of a per passenger ATOL Protection Contribution in building up sufficient funds to meet potential refund and repatriation costs arising from the failure of tour operators, under different adverse scenarios. External forecasts from third parties such as travel companies, insurance firms and banks were used as the basis for assumptions. Information was received from a spread of ATOL license holders, including the four largest air travel tour operators, five medium sized operators and two online tour operators. The spread of firms accounted for more than half of all passengers covered by the ATOL protection scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.2125W.5/4">The Civil Aviation Authority engaged a professional services firm with expertise in economic modelling and the travel sector to review the model methodology, its fitness for purpose and a number of the underlying assumptions.

The UK will be required to modify the RTFO in order to implement the Renewable Energy Directive in 2010. The directive incentivises second generation biofuels through requiring member states to count their contribution towards renewable energy targets as twice those of first generation biofuels. We shall be consulting later this year about how to take forward the implementation of the directive in UK legislation.</p>

Last autumn the Government also announced that the Department anticipates contributing up to &pound;3 million per year over the next two financial years to the Carbon Trust's Advanced Bioenergy Directed Research Accelerator.

	<p pid="a.2127W.2/3">The Department did however provide Chorley borough council with &pound;69,004 in 2007-08 for the cost of producing and issuing the new England-wide bus passes to all their eligible people. In 2008-09 DFT will provide Chorley borough council with special grant funding of &pound;280,000 for the improvement to statutory concessionary travel; this is in addition to the existing formula grant funding from CLG. The Special Grant Funding represents a 33 per cent. increase in funding over and above Chorley borough council's declared costs of &pound;0.85 million for concessionary travel in 2007-08.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase>, the Government, in consultation with UKFI, agreed to convert the RBS preference shares, plus accrued coupon and underwriting fees, into ordinary shares.

	<p pid="a.2145W.0/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) administer almost 20 different taxes and duties and several other collection and payment regimes such as tax credits, national insurance and child benefit. All of the regimes make provision for administrative financial penalties to underpin compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/2">Financial penalties are levied to address non-compliant behaviour in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/3" class="indent">Failure to notify taxable activity;</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/4" class="indent">Late filing or non-filing of returns;</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/5" class="indent">Late or non-payment of taxes, duties and national insurance contributions;</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/6" class="indent">Errors on returns due to negligence, carelessness or deliberate action;</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/7" class="indent">Failure to provide information or to make business premises and records available for inspection;</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/8" class="indent">Regime specific contraventions such as unauthorised issue of VAT invoices or unauthorised use of a customs warehouse.</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.0/9">The numerous existing regime specific penalties are being replaced by a smaller number of new generic administrative financial penalties, with no penalty charged for mistakes where the taxpayer has taken reasonable care. Significant reductions will be available for those who make unprompted disclosures, with smaller reductions for prompted disclosures. Most penalties will be charged as a percentage of the tax under-declared.</p>
