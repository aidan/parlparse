	<p pid=".550W.3/1">The Victoria Cross is awarded for most conspicuous gallantry of the highest order during active operations <sup>1</sup> . As such it is the highest award available for operational gallantry. Lesser degrees of operational gallantry are recognised by awards of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and a Mention in Despatches. Recommendations for any of these awards are initiated by the service man's or service woman's Commanding Officer and considered by Committees at various levels in the Ministry of Defence. The Committees consist mainly of senior officers of all three services who will have had considerable operational experience. Successful recommendations are passed to the Queen for her approval. The awards are then published and recipients invited to a State Investiture where they are invested by the Queen or her representative.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.3/2">The Victoria Cross along with the other awards for operational gallantry may be awarded to all ranks of the naval, military and air forces of the United Kingdom, all members of the Merchant Navy and civilians serving under the orders of any of the above forces. All these awards may be made posthumously.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.3/3" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> This is expanded on in the Third Clause of the Royal Warrant for The Victoria Cross which reads: &quot;It is ordained that the Cross shall only be awarded for most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.9/1">The A400M aircraft will meet all current international noise regulations, but exact noise characteristics will not be known until the aircraft's development and flight tests have been completed. The C130J aircraft meets all relevant US Federal Aviation Authority civil noise regulations. The Ministry of Defence does not hold noise information on the C130J in the form requested. We expect the noise characteristics of the A400M and the C130J will be similar. But their overall noise impact should be less than that of the C130K aircraft they are replacing, because significantly greater usage of ground simulators for training will reduce the overall number of flights.</p>

However, decisions about funding of individual science research projects&mdash;whether in these earmarked areas or not&mdash;are, by long-established convention, matters for the research councils, not for my Department.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.5/2">Details of all UK radioactive waste disposals in the north-east Atlantic have been made public and are available from a number of sources, including the &quot;Report of the Independent Review of Disposal of Radioactive Waste in the North East Atlantic&quot; (HMSO, 1984), copies of which are available in the Library of the House. The report contains data on the location of dumpsites, weight of material dumped, levels of activity and numbers of containers. The information on weight and numbers of containers is aggregated in the report for the whole period from 1949&ndash;82 during which the UK disposed of radioactive waste at sea. We estimate that, during the 1960s and 70s, around 41,000 tonnes were dumped in the north-east Atlantic in around 75,000 containers of various sizes and types. Radioactive waste disposals were also carried out in the north-east Atlantic by a number of other countries during this period.</p>

	<p pid=".566W.6/1">New requirements for labelling of passenger cars were recently introduced into UK law, in the form of regulations implementing EU directive 99/94/EC. This had the effect of adding information on CO <sub>2</sub> emissions to the information on fuel efficiency which was already displayed on labels in the UK. A new standardised format for labels was also introduced.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.6/2">The directive requires member states to monitor and report on the effectiveness of these measures and the Government will be an active participant in the subsequent review by the European Commission. In order to better inform the UK position, the Department will shortly be conducting a consultation exercise on options for banded or comparative labelling.</p>

	<p pid=".574W.3/1">My right hon. Friend receives environmental advice on all policy decisions for which environmental issues are relevant.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.3/2">In 1998, the former Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions published &quot;Policy Appraisal and the Environment: Policy Guidance&quot; which gave advice to Departments on when and how to carry out an environmental appraisal.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.3/3">The guidance made clear that environmental appraisal is part of the overall policy appraisal process. Accordingly, my Department does not now generally publish free-standing environmental appraisal documents. Environmental implications of the Department's policies and programmes are, where appropriate, set out in the various consultation documents and regulatory impact assessments that form part of our overall consideration of policy.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.3/4">In terms of administrative actions, our activities are governed by the Department's greening operations policy statement, published on the DTLR website in December 2001. Proposals for specific projects are assessed in respect of operational need, compliance with policy, environmental benefit, and value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.3/5">Since the publication of the 1998 policy guidance, my Department, with others, has been developing an integrated policy appraisal methodology which will be used to assess the likely effect of proposed policies on a range of economic, environmental and social issues. My Department is using a summary version of the methodology to consider the sustainable development implications of our Spending Review submission to the Treasury. Beyond the Spending Review process, and in the light of further development of the methodology, we hope to use the methodology to ensure that full account is taken of all relevant economic, environmental and social factors before policy decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.3/6">No officials from my Department have so far attended the environmental appraisal and integration into policy training course run by the Civil Service College.</p>

The Office for National Statistics subsequently revised the New Earnings Survey (NES) data for 2000 on which these provisional figures were based, in order to include a large number of additional records that had yet to be processed earlier in the year. The final ACA figures for 2002&ndash;03 are based on the revised NES data, as it is important that we use the most robust data that are available to us at the time the settlement is made.</p>

Throughout, it was recognised that decisions on care services are devolved and those on benefits are reserved. The Government have made it clear that they are not prepared to transfer resources in this area to the Scottish Executive.

	<p pid=".596W.12/1">It is a mandatory requirement that all policies, programmes and projects are subject to environmental screening at the concept note stage.

	<p pid=".596W.12/2">In 1999, DFID produced an environmental guide. It emphasises that environmental appraisal is concerned just as much with identifying environmental opportunities for improving development outcomes as it is with identifying environmental risks. It also stresses that environmental appraisal is applicable at policy and programme levels as well as at the project level. The guide complements the more detailed 1996 Manual of Environmental Appraisal.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.2/1">DFID's regular environmental appraisal procedures are described in response to PQ 2127. It is mandatory within DFID that policies, programmes and projects are subject to environmental screening at the concept stage, with further environmental appraisal to identify risks and opportunities being conducted as required. This work then becomes an integral part of the project documentation, which although not formally published, can be made available to the public on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/2">In situations where the environmental screening reveals the need for a formal environmental impact assessment (EIA), the assessment will be undertaken by consultants for the national government of the partner country, with funding and, if necessary, additional international technical assistance from DFID. Publication of the EIA is the responsibility of the partner Government, in accordance with their legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/3">Examples of formal EIAs since January 2001 include:</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/4" class="indent">Ngamiland veterinary fences, Government of Botswana, March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/5" class="indent">Impacts of Tsetse Fly Control in Okavango, May 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/6" class="indent">Strategic Environmental Assessment for the &quot;Rehabilitation of Feeder Roads in 9 Districts&quot;, Ghana Department of Feeder Roads, July 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/7" class="indent">Terms of Reference for full EIA of Gerald's Park Airstrip, Government of Montserrat, January 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/8">DFID development spending has increasingly focused upon resource transfers to sectoral and general budgets. There has therefore been a corresponding decrease in infrastructure work requiring a formal EIA.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.2/9">In addition, as part of DFID's commitment to green housekeeping, environmental appraisals were undertaken for the relocation of the DFID London HQ; the consolidation of four DFID offices into one in Delhi, India; and environmental audit was voluntarily undertaken of the DFID Caribbean office; and the DFID Uganda office is to commence an audit in February 2002.</p>

I concluded that the time was right for a major international effort to help the parties resolve Africa's most costly and longest running civil conflict. All whom I met expressed their strong commitment to progress on peace, agreed that there was a window of opportunity and expressed their willingness to engage in negotiations. But all doubted they would succeed, given the legacy of mistrust, without outside help, which they thought should include major UK input. I confirmed that we stood ready to play our part. I also emphasised the potential economic benefits for all, and UK readiness to engage in development if stability can be achieved.</p>

	<p pid=".599W.9/1">Delays in payments by the European Commission to NGOs have been discussed on many occasions by member states, including the UK, and the commission. We and others have urged the commission to take the steps needed to improve the handling of such payments since the delays are often excessive and cause real hardship to the organisations and individuals concerned. The commission has improved the management systems used to process those payments and we understand that the delays have been reduced but remain of concern. This is also the case with many payments for implementation of EC programmes in developing countries, where we are also promoting reform. We stay in close touch with UK NGOs about this issue and will continue to monitor the position with them.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.2/1">The Government are committed to the principle that primary education should be made free. No child should be denied access to a basic education because the costs, direct or indirect, cannot be met by the household. School fees are an example of a direct cost, but there may be indirect charges for books, uniforms and exams which can make education unaffordable to many.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/2">The equitable financing of education is a key issue for achieving universal primary education by 2015. Governments of developing countries need to demonstrate the political commitment to abolish education charges. The abolition of primary tuition fees in Malawi and Uganda, brought about by strong political leadership, resulted in enrolment increases of up to 3 million in Uganda and 1.9 million in Malawi. The impact was greatest on the enrolment of girls. Education budgets for proving effective primary education for all should be developed within national poverty reduction strategies and factor in the costs of introducing free primary education.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.2/3">In our dialogue with partner Governments, civil society and the international community on poverty reduction and education sector programmes, we will continue to argue for the reduction of the financial barriers that exclude large numbers of the poorest children.</p>

	<p pid=".604W.6/1">I have corresponded with the Youth Hostels Association and met their Chairman and Chief Executive, as has my hon. Friend the Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting I have also received around 200 letters from hon. Members on behalf of constituents concerned about the impact on the YHA's income of foot and mouth disease and the measures taken to control it. The YHA estimate that they lost &pound;5 million 2001 out of an annual income of &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.6/2">I have also met representatives from the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers and discussed the impact of foot and mouth disease on their activities. I understand that the losses they suffered are in the region of &pound;250,000 out of an annual income in the order of &pound;23 million.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.6/3">I am well aware of the impact that foot and mouth disease had on a range of charities, especially those involved in promoting countryside access. The measures we put in place to help affected businesses were mainly focused on small businesses, and were not well adapted to helping national organisations such as the YHA or BTCV. During later stages we modified the guidelines for the Business recovery fund to clarify that charities' individual business units may be treated as separate business entities and may receive assistance in their own right if their applications meet the fund's other criteria. Charities may also benefit from rate relief granted by local authorities (for which we raised the rate of central subsidy from 75 per cent. to 95 or 98 per cent. in rural areas) and from the deferral of tax payments due. We have also put a lot of effort into encouraging local authorities into reopening footpaths as soon as possible to attract visitors back to the countryside, and put extra resources into tourism promotion via the British Tourist Authority and English Tourism Council.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.6/4">I accept that the help available is modest compared with the losses that organisations such as the YHA have suffered. It is not possible to provide compensation to charities for loss of income, any more than to farming or non-farming businesses affected by the disease and by the measures to control it. As explained in &quot;England's Rural Future&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>, we are looking urgently and sympathetically at further measures to help charities&mdash;especially those involved in promoting countryside access&mdash;to recover from the impact of foot and mouth disease.</p>

National park authorities are also encouraged to work with DEFRA's Rural Development Service to ensure that effective delivery of the ERDP contributes to the aims and objectives of national parks. The national park authorities also play a positive role in encouraging uptake of the agri-environment schemes which now form part of the ERDP. In particular they can use their detailed knowledge of the parks to ensure that the Countryside Stewardship Scheme is utilised positively and appropriately within the individual parks.</p>

	<p pid=".612W.9/2">Measurements of all major types of radiation in the environment around the Sellafield site are undertaken routinely by BNFL, the Environment Agency and the Foods Standards Agency <sup>1</sup> . The data are published annually in respective environmental monitoring reports. The measurements cover the marine and terrestrial environments and reflect both present and past operations on site. It is not possible to identify separately monitoring data relating specifically to waste storage facilities from those relating to other operations on site. Assessed doses to those most likely to be exposed to radiation (the critical group) are based on these measurements. These estimated doses reflect total risk from the site, and are within national and international dose limits for members of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.9/3">Radiation measurements taken within the Sellafield and Dounreay sites, around the waste storage facilities (and other facilities), are carried out by BNFL and UKAES respectively. The results of these measurements are available to Inspectors of the Health and Safety Executive. Both of these operators have a duty to ensure that the radiation doses arising from, among other things, their waste storage facilities are below statutory limits and are kept as low as reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.9/4">Responsibility for environmental protection policy in Scotland (Dounreay) is a matter for the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.2/1">The Spending Review 2000 announced the framework for the Government's support to local authorities for the next three years up to 2003&ndash;04. This included an annual increase in the revenue support to local authorities for Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS), which includes waste management services. By 2003&ndash;04 this support will have risen by &pound;1.1 billion over the 2000&ndash;01 provision. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for Essex county council to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/2">In addition to general support to local authority revenue expenditure, the spending review provided &pound;140 million of Government grant for waste management work and &pound;220 million for Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) resources, for waste projects. We are currently in consultation on how the &pound;140 million fund should be distributed. At this stage it is not possible to identify what funding Essex county council might receive from this source.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/3">The next tranche of lottery funding from the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) will include a &pound;159 million fund for transforming communities, of which &pound;49.5 million will be directed towards community sector reuse, recycling and composting schemes across the UK. This will benefit local authorities seeking to work in partnership with local community groups.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.2/4">Copies of the consultation on the distribution of &pound;140 million fund are available from the House Libraries and from the DEFRA website: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/wastefund/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/ environment/consult/wastefund/index.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.5/1">All local authorities in England and Wales have been set statutory performance standards, under the best value regime, for recycling and composting household waste. It is up to individual authorities to decide how best to meet these standards, according to local circumstances. However, guidance was issued in March 2001, by the then DETR, on the development of joint Municipal Waste Management Strategies (MWMS) for waste collection and waste disposal authorities to encourage all authorities to set out integrated plans for meeting their recycling/composting targets. This guidance contains some case studies of local authority waste management schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.5/2">In July 2000 guidance was issued to local authorities on applying the best value framework to all waste management services &quot;Waste Strategy Guidance&mdash;Best Value and Waste Management&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.5/3">The Department also encourages the pooling of local authority experience and the promotion of best practice schemes, through the Beacon Council scheme, local Public Service Agreements and Best Value Networks.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.5/4">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently preparing a pilot training scheme, to begin in March this year, for local authority recycling officers, and for waste managers within the private and community sector. This scheme will aim to provide information on best practice from the UK and from around the world, information on the costs of recycling schemes, and advice on tools and techniques. Those involved will also be encouraged to identify and address areas where existing schemes could be improved, for example by looking at other recyclable materials or by targeting in other sectors of the community.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.5/5">WRAP hopes to make this training scheme available across the UK from September this year and intends to provide further training and development for chief officers and elected members in local authorities to raise their awareness of recycling issues. Collection operators, who come into direct contact with the public, will also be given further training so that they are better able to deal with public inquiries.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.5/6">WRAP also intends to invite tenders for assessing best practice guidance.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.2/1">The Government are determined to ensure that there is equality of opportunity for all in every area including sport. Our policy of 'Sport for All' is aimed at encouraging everyone, including women into sport. Sport England provides over &pound;6 million of Exchequer funding to sports governing bodies and all are required to ensure that they have proposals for the development of women as part of the condition of funding. Sport England also fund the Womens Sports Foundation (WSF) which is the only organisation in the UK that is solely committed to improving and promoting opportunities for women and girls in sport at every level. More women than ever are finding that regular physical exercise can lead to improvements in health, self-confidence and well-being. Women's team sports such as football and rugby are among the fastest-growing sports in the country.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.0/1">The Heritage Lottery Fund's standard practice is to consult with a range of organisations and individuals, including statutory agencies and practitioners, in advance of policy developments. For example, in reaching a new policy statement on skills and training for the heritage sector, to be published later this month, the Heritage Lottery Fund commissioned a MORI survey, and discussed findings with heritage organisations and employers to inform policy making. The fund's new strategic plan is being considered against the background of extensive consultation undertaken during summer 2001. The consultation process was UK wide, and included heritage practitioners and representatives of non-heritage organisations, members of the public and community leaders. The Heritage Lottery Fund received some 315 responses to its consultation document, and took the views of nearly 600 people who attended workshops, seminars and focus groups into account. The Heritage Lottery Fund follows the Cabinet Office's Code of Practice on written consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.2/2">Cold weather payments are a key part of our strategy to tackle fuel poverty. They provide extra help towards heating costs for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society in periods of exceptionally cold weather. They are paid to pensioners receiving the minimum income guarantee, and to people receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who have children under the age of five or who have a premium for disability or long term sickness.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/3">The payments are made automatically and are triggered when the average temperature is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0 degrees Centigrade or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. So far this year we estimate that payments to the value of almost &pound;16.8 million have been triggered. Available information on the breakdown of the payments is in the tables.</p>

	<p pid=".629W.5/1">We recognise chronic fatigue syndromes, including ME, as potentially debilitating illnesses and the Department's Chief Medical Adviser constantly evaluates the latest developments in the understanding of these conditions. The personal capability assessment which is used in determining entitlement to incapacity benefit is a functional assessment which looks at the extent to which a person's ability to carry out certain everyday activities is affected by their medical condition. In general, it is the effect of the condition that is important, not the specific diagnosis.</p>

	<p pid=".629W.8/1">To avoid duplicate provision from public funds, the Great Britain-wide social security benefit rules have always precluded payment of attendance allowance to people in residential care homes and nursing homes who receive help with the cost of their place in the home from a local authority or a health authority. Benefit spending is determined by the number of claimants who satisfy the qualifying conditions that apply to a particular benefit. A reduction in forecast benefit expenditure will increase the funds available for public expenditure as a whole, and issues regarding their allocation will be dealt with in the usual way. The funding arrangements for free nursing care have always been entirely separate from those for attendance allowance.</p>

The position is unchanged when they receive leave to remain in the United Kingdom. While the young people are under 18 the local authority is able to claim grant funding from the Home Office to meet the costs of support.

	<p pid=".649W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/2">The international response to the resource commitment made at the World Education Forum in Dakar (and endorsed by the G8 at Okinawa) has been slow and has lacked effective co-ordination. At the Education for All High-Level Group meeting in Paris in October, I called for international action to be stepped up in a coherent, well-organised and supportive way.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/3">Achieving universal primary education (UPE) can happen only through reform and action at the country level. More attention needs to be given to determining whether a country is &quot;seriously committed&quot; to education for all. Key indicators of commitment are the development of sound national education policies, closely linked to the country's poverty reduction strategies; the rapid abolition of user fees and other direct cost barriers to education; the resources allocated to education, and specifically to primary education; and concrete evidence of efforts to promote gender equality. Being serious about UPE means clear commitments in all of these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/4">Where countries are making these commitments, the international community must deliver the additional resources they require. We believe that delivering this Dakar resource commitment is best analysed and acted upon at the country level. It should be incorporated into all country level negotiations on poverty reduction strategies. It will also require a step-change in the level of international financing to support and sustain UPE, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Development agencies and the multilateral development banks, including the World bank, must increase the resources committed to helping reforming Governments deliver UPE. We also need much greater co-ordination between development agencies, working together in support of a country's own development strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/5">DFID's &quot;Children out of school&quot; paper sets out these proposals and urges much greater international energy and co-operation in taking them forward. It also calls for the response of the developed world to the Dakar resource commitment to be monitored and reported at the World bank annual meeting, and in the report on progress towards the millennium development goals provided by the multilateral developments banks for the G8.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/6">The Government give high priority to the UPE goal and DFID has committed over &pound;600 million to support the development of good quality, sustainable primary education systems in developing countries since 1997. We will do more. Canada shares our strong commitment to UPE and now chairs the G8 Education Task Force, where DFID represents the UK. Information submitted to the task force indicates clearly that the priority given to primary education within other G8 members' development programmes varies significantly. We would like the task force's report to this year's summit in Canada to indicate how the G8 can deliver effectively on its Okinawa commitment, and complement other international action to accelerate progress toward the UPE goal.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.12/1">The information in the table was compiled from data supplied to HM Treasury by Departments for the annual fraud report in 1997&ndash;98, 1998&ndash;99, 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 and is an analysis of internal frauds only (ie frauds committed by departmental employees).</p>
	<p pid=".652W.12/2">The list of Departments is not complete. The absence of a Department from the list indicates that a 'nil' return was received from that Department in each of the four years. The data relate to frauds and thefts committed by employees of Departments only.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.12/3">The values of frauds supplied by Departments are often only estimated values as a number of cases reported each year are at an early stage of investigation when values might not be known.</p>

	<p pid=".655W.11/1">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) determined that Renewco's activities would be classified to the public sector. The decision was based on the application of internationally agreed definitions for national accounts. This means borrowing by Renewco would be public sector borrowing and add to public sector net debt. The borrowed funds are therefore &quot;public sector money&quot;. Payments by Government to Renewco would be transfers of public sector money within the public sector and so would have no impact on the consolidation public sector statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.11/2">Loans to Railtrack's administrator count as lending by the public sector to the private sector. That lending has to be funded from public sector sources such as taxes or government borrowing, and so is &quot;public sector money&quot;.

Several systems of financial and performance monitoring encourage commissioners and providers to identify and agree budgets for community equipment services for the coming financial year. These include spring and autumn monitoring exercises with senior managers of social services. Budgetary commitments agreed in local business plans by social services and national health service trusts feed into local modernisation reviews and planning for the integration of local services.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.0/2">The fees paid to community pharmacy contractors vary according to the item prescribed. The large majority of prescriptions attract a basic dispensing fee. From July 1999 to October 2001 that fee was 97.5p per prescription dispensed. In November 2001 it was changed to 87.4p. This represents a reduction of approximately 10.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/3">The basic dispensing fee is one of a number of fees and allowances by which the global sum for community pharmacies is distributed between pharmacy contractors. The global sum is the amount to be paid to contractors overall in the year in question. The global sum for 2001&ndash;02 for England and Wales is &pound;806.6 million, an increase of 3.7 per cent. over 2000&ndash;01.</p>

	<p pid=".664W.5/47"><sup>(28)</sup> The time spent waiting for admission is calculated for HES purposes as being the period elapsed from the initial decision to admit until the date that the patient is actually admitted. This takes no account of any periods when the patient may have been unavailable for admission, or may have been suspended from the waiting list for medical reasons. It is for this reason that this analysis apparently shows patients waiting over 15 months. The waiting time figures published by the Department of Health take these situations into account.</p>

	<p pid=".665W.2/3">For out-patients, the total number of patients still waiting for a first out-patient appointment is not collected. As a result, the average is calculated using data for patients who have already been seen for their first out-patient appointment.

Specifically, existing care homes will have until 2005 to comply with the standards requiring a minimum of 50 per cent. of care staff to be qualified at NVQ level 2 or equivalent. Existing care homes will have until 2007 to comply with the standards relating to room size, shared facilities and places in single rooms.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.2/3">However, non-compliance with national minimum standards will not lead to the National Care Standards Commission automatically pursuing enforcement action or deregistration.

This requires NHS trusts to ensure that written policies, procedures and guidance for the prevention and control of infection are implemented and reflect relevant legislation and published professional guidance, including that on decontamination and the reprocessing of re-usable medical devices.</p>

This reflects increases in the numbers of doctors in higher specialist training in surgery as a result of the NHS Plan. Projections to 2009&ndash;10 suggest an increasing gap between supply and demand may emerge without further action. We continually review future work force needs as part of our national work force planning processes and take action accordingly to address any shortfalls. This action includes increasing numbers in training but also modernising roles and developing new ways of working for doctors alongside other staff.</p>

	<p pid=".683W.6/1">The figures requested are not available. The Medical Research Council's recently completed review of the Epidemiology and Causes of Autism notes that differences in definitions used in the past make comparisons problematic.

The Children in Need census issued in September/October 2001 is collecting data on the numbers of autistic children known to social services departments in England, who will be an important group within the overall total.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.6/3">In June 2001 the Department for Education and Skills carried out a pilot exercise on data collection on a broad range of types of Special Educational Needs involving 200 schools and is now considering introducing a requirement for schools and local education authorities to provide this information from 2003 or 2004.
