The information is typically the average grammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per passenger km on that aircraft or airline rather than on that specific flight. In addition departmental officials have contributed to the development of tools that estimate the emissions for a particular flight both for the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the Government's Act on CO2 website.</p>

	<p pid="c.863W.3/1">All Departments are actively involved in the cross-Government Adapting to Climate Change Programme, which aims to help society adapt to climate change. The role of the programme is to develop and provide a comprehensive evidence base including adaptation tools, to raise awareness of the need to adapt, to measure success and to work across Government at all levels to embed adaptation. Further details about the programme's work can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.863W.3/5" class="indent">Working closely with Network Rail in designing methodologies to ensure renewal work incorporates increased resilience and that the network can withstand future climate related events.</p>
	<p pid="c.863W.3/6" class="indent">Establishing a cross-rail industry forum and commissioning research to identify and address challenges to the railway and produce hazard maps highlighting vulnerable areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.863W.3/7" class="indent">Completing research on adapting materials and techniques in highway works to the changing climate which will be published by the Highways Agency as a guide for local authorities.</p>

It has, however, been shown in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs. The main rationale for investment to address climate risk will be to reduce the UK's vulnerability to longer-term climate change impacts.</p>

The vulnerabilities of GPS because of intentional or unintentional interference or because of environmental interference have always made it unwise for any GPS user to rely on it as the only means of radio navigation position fixing. It is customary to use multiple navigation systems for marine and aviation navigation for example.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/3">However, the European Commission has announced plans to prepare a European Radio-Navigation Plan (ERNP), by next year, which will draw up a comprehensive inventory of the vast array of radio-navigation services (satellite and terrestrial)&mdash;with the aim of informing future strategy and policy development for all users not just transport. The plan will set out how best to harmonise radio-navigation services and to ensure redundancy and reliability in the use of any mix of navigation systems in support of safety, security, transport, environment and economic policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/4">Departmental officials will work with the Commission and other EU member states to develop the emerging strategy and policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.865W.8/1">The Government announced in December 2008 a series of changes to the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) which is paid to operators of local bus services in England. Changes have been introduced to ensure that the grant is targeted more towards achieving environmental and climate change objectives. The changes encourage operators of local bus services in and around Coventry (and the rest of England) to achieve greater fuel efficiency by paying a higher rate of grant to any operator which achieves fuel efficiency improvements. In addition, an extra payment of 6p per kilometre will now be paid for all kilometres operated by low carbon emission buses.</p>

These requirements ensure consideration is given to initiatives to encourage walking, cycling and other forms of sustainable travel.</p>

This work was published in the peer reviewed journal, Public Library of Science Medicine in March 2009. For the first time, the study linked databases of discharged personnel and the national database of suicide and undetermined deaths. The results showed that overall rates of suicide of those who left were little different from the equivalent serving or civilian general populations. There was an increased risk for young men who left the armed forces after a short period of service.</p>

	<p pid="c.870W.6/1">British Waterways manages its maintenance programme using a risk-based approach in order to ensure that its network remains in a reasonable and safe condition. British Waterways estimates that it would cost around &pound;200 million to remove a backlog of maintenance to both principal and non-principal assets. In 2004, British Waterways eliminated its backlog of safety related arrears.</p>
	<p pid="c.870W.6/2">In 2004, the Environment Agency estimated the backlog of assets that needed to be brought to required condition and so began a &pound;60 million programme through to the end of 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.870W.6/3">The following table shows the number of assets brought back into required condition by the agency over the last five years.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.870W.6/6"> <td></td> <td><i> 2004-05</i></td> <td><i> 2005-06</i></td> <td><i> 2006-07</i></td> <td><i> 2007-08</i></td> <td><i> 2008-09</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.870W.6/12">However, more of the agency's navigation assets have fallen below required condition since 2004 as it has not had the funding needed to maintain them in a steady state. The agency currently estimates that it will cost &pound;71 million to address all of the 2004 assets and the additional backlog. Up until March 2009, the agency spent &pound;40.5 million on this programme. A further &pound;9.5 million has been allocated for 2009-10, with &pound;21 million remaining thereafter. The cost of addressing the remaining backlog is currently under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.871W.2/1">Plant protection products are subject to a rigorous, safety based, system of regulation. Council Directive 91/414/EEC established a harmonised framework for the authorisation of plant protection products in Europe. There is a two tier system with active ingredients being registered at community level and products containing these ingredients being registered at national level, but in accordance with common rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/2">The directive provides detailed rules as to what data should be supplied for formulated plant protection products (Annex III). Guidance for member states as to how to evaluate these data and reach decisions is provided in annex VI to the directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/3">The data required (on the formulation, including active ingredient and co-formulants), and subsequent regulatory risk assessments, for plant protection products cover issues such as physical and chemical properties; efficacy; toxicology; operator, worker and bystander (including resident) exposure; residues and consumer exposure; environmental exposure; and the risk to wildlife.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/4">Full details of these requirements can be found in Directive 91/414/EEC. A copy of the directive (including annexes III and VI) is available on the website of the Health and Safety Directorate's Chemicals Regulation Directorate at:</p>

	<p pid="c.871W.2/6">Plant protection products and their active ingredients are evaluated in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge based on the appraisal of a dossier supplied by the applicant. Each scientific evaluation will be specific to the formulation and use for which approval is being sought. Each case is treated on its individual merits there being no list of permitted co-formulants in pesticide formulations. Co-formulants with unacceptable toxicological properties would be identified in the overall toxicity of the formulation and would result in either a more restrictive level of classification or refusal for use as a plant protection product.</p>

	<p pid="c.876W.8/1">The interaction between the red and grey squirrel is not straightforward. They can live in the same area for up to 15 years, but in the end, the greys displace the reds. Where greys carry Squirrelpox virus, they can displace the reds within a very short period of time as the virus is normally fatal to reds while the greys remain unaffected.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.8/2">Our policy in England is to protect the remaining red squirrel populations that appear to have the best chance of survival. These include the populations on the Isle of Wight and Poole Harbour Islands where no grey squirrels are present and in the 17 designated red squirrel reserves in northern England. These have associated buffer zones where the culling of grey squirrels is actively encouraged.

To obtain the required information would require the inspection of individual case files, which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.889W.8/1">Strategic Objective 3 of the Land Registry's 10 Year strategic plan in 2002 was to complete the registration of all remaining unregistered titles by 2012. Land Registry strived to achieve the objective, making significant progress each year, but recognised that the achievement of a complete land register required compulsion, which would be unpopular and require primary legislation. As a result, Land Registry no longer has a target to produce a complete Land Register by 2012. Instead, it aims to create a comprehensive Land Register as soon as possible and has annual targets. The KPI for 2008-09 was to register 325,000 hectares of voluntary registrations, which was exceeded. The total percentage of England and Wales that is now registered is around 70 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.899W.8/2">The majority of Exchequer funding provided in general support of these activities is channelled to local authorities via settlements from the Department for Communities and Local Government. DCMS works with other Departments and our network of sponsored bodies (NDPBs) to set overarching objectives relating to the sectors for which we have policy responsibility in Government. Recent information relating to Coventry is provided, with much of the detail provided by our family of NDPBs:</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/3" class="italic"> Sport</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/4" class="italic"> Free s wimming</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/5">Coventry city council has opted in to both the under 16 and over 60 Free Swimming Programme and will receive revenue monies directly from DCMS. The local authorities that have opted to offer the scheme to both age groups have also received a share of a &pound;10 million capital fund to spend on modernising or improving pool provision in time for the start of the two-year scheme in 2009. Those local authorities that will offer free swimming to both age groups also stand to benefit from a further &pound;25 million capital challenge fund in both 2008-09 and 2010-11 to spend on improving pool facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/6" class="italic"> PE and sport strategy for young people</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/7">Coventry, like the rest of England, will benefit from the Government's PE and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP)&mdash;the &quot;five hour offer&quot;&mdash;which will create a world-class system for PE and sport in England, in which all five to 16-year-olds have access to five hours of high-quality PE and sport per week&mdash;and all 16 to 19-year-olds can access up to three hours high-quality PE and sport a week&mdash;by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/8">'Sport Unlimited' is a Sport England initiative to get more children and young people taking part in sports outside of school in line with PESSYP. 964 young people were involved in Sport Unlimited projects delivered between September 2008 and March 2009, with 713 young people attending 60 per cent. of the sessions. It is predicted that 1,627 young people will be involved in Sport Unlimited activities within Coventry throughout the summer and autumn terms of year 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/9" class="italic"> One million active people</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/10">Sport England has a target of getting one million people doing more sport by 2012-13. This strategy will be driven by National Governing Bodies of sport (NGBs) through community clubs, coaches, officials and volunteers, including in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/11" class="italic"> Cultural programmes</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/12">A new national organisation, Creativity, Culture and Education (CCE) has been created to generate transformational cultural and creative programmes for children and young people across England to enhance their aspirations, achievements, skills and life chances, including Creative Partnerships&mdash;the Government's flagship creative learning programme. Creative Partnerships has worked on 222 projects with Coventry schools (LEA area) making school more exciting for young people. In the wider Creative Partnerships area, Creative Partnerships has involved 13,250 young people, and 1,651 of their teachers.</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/13">In addition there are six organisations in Coventry (Open Theatre Company, Warwick Arts Centre, Talking Birds Theatre Company, Arts and Media Training, Belgrade Theatre and Theatre Absolute) that are classed by Arts Council England as Regularly Funded Organisations. The latter, Theatre Absolute, has a particular focus towards young people who are at risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/14" class="italic"> Lottery <i> f</i> unding</p>
	<p pid="c.899W.8/15">Finally, organisations supporting young people in Coventry are also likely to have benefited from awards from national lottery distributors, including the Big Lottery Fund. Details of such awards can be found on the National Lottery database at</p>

	<p pid="c.902W.2/1">All Departments are actively involved in the cross-Government Adapting to Climate Change Programme, which aims to help society adapt to climate change. The role of the programme is to develop and provide a comprehensive evidence base including adaptation tools, to raise awareness of the need to adapt, to measure success and to work across Government at all levels to embed adaptation. Further details about the programme's work can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.902W.2/3">As well as working together to tackle issues that affect all Departments and their work, each Government Department is adapting to climate change in its own operations and policies. Reflecting evidence that climate change in the UK is likely to increase the severity and frequency of flooding events, the 2007 comprehensive spending review announced that total government expenditure on flood and coastal erosion risk management will rise from &pound;600 million in 2007-08 to &pound;800 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.902W.2/4">In addition, Treasury officials have also been working with DEFRA and other Departments to develop supplementary Green Book guidance to enable adaptation to climate change to be taken into account in appraisal and decision-making. It is planned that this will be issued during the summer and made available to all Departments through the Green Book website.</p>

	<p pid="c.902W.5/1">It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years. It has, however, been shown in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs. Some of these benefits will accrue to Departments as cost-savings over the next three years, with further more significant gains to be made in future years. The main rationale for investment to address climate risk will be to reduce the UK's vulnerability to longer-term climate change impacts.</p>
	<p pid="c.902W.5/2">The Government are undertaking a Climate Change Risk Assessment and Economic Analysis, which will provide estimates of the costs and benefits of adaptation to the UK. This analysis will be presented to Parliament in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.902W.5/3">The Government will also be publishing supplementary appraisal guidance this summer. This will help to ensure that adaptation measures are designed and implemented in a cost-effective manner.</p>

	<p pid="c.908W.2/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) keeps abreast of developments in tracking and tracing techniques through its regular contacts with UK tobacco manufacturers and customs authorities in other EU member states, and through its participation in the development of the illicit trade protocol to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. HMRC is particularly supportive of efforts by the tobacco manufacturers to develop an industry-wide standard tracking and tracing system.</p>
	<p pid="c.908W.2/2">HMRC has legislation in place which requires tobacco manufacturers to control their supply chains. This legislation was introduced to reinforce the existing memoranda of understanding with tobacco manufacturers and requires manufacturers to provide tracking and tracing information for all seizures that meet the supply chain legislation criteria. These criteria are currently set at 100,000 cigarettes and 50 kg of hand-rolling tobacco.</p>
	<p pid="c.908W.2/3">HMRC does not require tobacco manufacturers to provide tracking and tracing information for goods on which UK excise duty has been paid and which are sold legitimately in the UK. As such, no tobacco products legitimately sold in the UK were monitored by HMRC using track and trace technology.</p>

	<p pid="c.913W.8/1">For most young people, eligibility for education maintenance allowance (EMA) is subject to an assessment of their household income based on the financial year prior to the academic year in which they start their course. The assessment will be based on evidence of that income. The upper threshold to qualify for EMA is &pound;30,810. If they meet other eligibility criteria such as being a young person aged 16 to 18 and on a relevant course, and residency requirements, applicants will qualify for EMA if the income evidence supports that.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.8/2">A successful assessment provides a young person with a guaranteed entitlement of up to three years of EMA on the same rate, plus a guaranteed minimum level of non-repayable student support should they progress into higher education within three years. It is appropriate that such guarantees for long term support for those who need it are provided on the basis of evidence rather than conjecture.</p>

History is not compulsory post 14 to allow greater flexibility within the curriculum. However it remains popular at KS4 and beyond.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-06-10c.272570.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-06-10c.922W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="922W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090610/text/90610w0013.htm#09061070002123">
	<p pid="c.922W.5/1">The Government announced an independent review of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in the Children's Plan. The review considered progress made in delivering services to meet the educational, health and social care needs of children and young people at risk of and experiencing mental health problems, including those with complex, severe and persistent needs; and practical solutions to address challenges and deliver better outcomes. The review and the Government's response to its report, together with work we are taking forward around PSA 12&mdash;improving the health and wellbeing of children and young people&mdash;demonstrate our determination to ensure the right services reach children with acute problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.5/2">The Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme seeks to develop the social and emotional skills of all pupils through a whole-school approach, and across the curriculum. The small group work element of SEAL aims to address the needs of pupils who need more support in this area to develop their social and emotional skills. Wave 3 provides intensive, specialist support necessary for pupils with severe behaviour difficulties, or mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.5/3">Following publication of the CAMHS Review report, &quot;Children and Young People in Mind&quot;, the Government set up a National Advisory Council for children's mental health and psychological wellbeing. The National Advisory Council has agreed that one of its key focuses will be to take forward work around removing the stigma associated with mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.5/4">Schools and local authorities are statutorily required to have regard to the SEN code of practice for children and young people whose chronic and severe mental health needs entail special educational needs (SEN). The code says that local authorities should have effective arrangements in place to ensure the needs of children and young people with SEN are assessed quickly and matched by appropriate provision, and that schools must do their best to ensure necessary provision is made for pupils with SEN. Special educational needs include those entailing behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.5/5">The Government's guidance, &quot;Access to education for children and young people with medical needs&quot; is clear that &quot;School policies and practices need to be as positive and proactive as possible in order to welcome the child or young person back into school and to assist successful reintegration. Consultation with the child and parents about concerns, medical issues, timing and pace of return is important. For some, reintegration is likely to be a gradual process over a period of time. Initially some children and young people will benefit from flexible arrangements which may include attending school part-time while retaining some other support. Others may require alternative provision to allow them to cope with peer relationships and a school environment, before a gradual return to school is possible. Support may need to continue to be available on return to school&quot;. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that an individually tailored reintegration plan is in place for all pupils before they return to school. The plan should have multi-agency approval, and schools have a key role to play.</p>

	<p pid="c.925W.6/2">Changes introduced by The Enterprise Act 2002 were aimed at streamlining the administration procedure and introducing greater flexibility to the regime.</p>
	<p pid="c.925W.6/3">One of the primary aims of the corporate insolvency provisions of the Enterprise Act was to promote the use of administration and restrict the use of administrative receivership where office holders are appointed to act on behalf of charge holders. This was to be achieved in a very direct way by removing the right to appoint an administrative receiver where a floating charge was created on or after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-15">15 September 2003</phrase>. Instead, administrators would be appointed who would act in the interests of creditors as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.925W.6/4">Since the introduction of a more streamlined procedure, the number of company administrations in England and Wales has gone up. Evaluation of the Enterprise Act published in 2008 by The Insolvency Service found that the changes implemented by the Enterprise Act 2002 have encouraged a greater uptake of the administration regime as a viable insolvency option. This has been accompanied by a large decrease in the number of administrative receiverships since the introduction of the act.</p>
	<p pid="c.925W.6/5">Recent Insolvency Service statistics show a sharper increase in the number of corporate insolvencies over the last four quarters, suggesting that it is the current economic climate which is causing the number of company administrations to rise.</p>
	<p pid="c.925W.6/6">Statement of Insolvency Practice Number 16, introduced by The Insolvency Service and the Recognised Professional Bodies that regulate insolvency practitioners, is intended to foster greater transparency in the pre-pack administration process.</p>

	<p pid="c.927W.2/1">This information is not routinely collected centrally. To ensure the effective provision of dental services, primary care trusts (PCTs) need dental professional advice. Dental public health advice will most appropriately be obtained from a consultant in dental public health. In addition, PCTs may find it helpful to appoint on a sessional basis a dental practice adviser to assist them with issues about the delivery of general dental services. Dental practice advisers (DPA) are members of the dental public health team working particularly in the field of patient safety and quality improvement in dentistry. A survey conducted in autumn 2007 identified 57 dental public consultants working in England and around 90 dentists working as DPAs with some working for more than one PCT. The majority (87 per cent.) of PCTs in England had a dental practice adviser working on a sessional basis.</p>
