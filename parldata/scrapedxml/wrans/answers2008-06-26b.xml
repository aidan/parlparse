In addition operating costs of &pound;92,000 per kilometre per year (2004 prices) were assumed. These costs were based on experience from the M42 hard shoulder running scheme, with some adjustments for development of design and allowance for risks. By way of comparison the capital cost of conventionally widening this section of the M42 was estimated at between &pound;18 million and &pound;25 million per kilometre in current prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.433W.2/2">The EU's proposed 16 per cent. burden-sharing target for the UK's non-traded sector is still subject to negotiation and applies to the entire non-traded sector. As such it will not be broken down into specific sectoral shares, for example between the transport and domestic heating sectors. The Government's framework for managing carbon budgets, including road transport emissions, will be established under the Climate Change Bill currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.433W.2/3">Further details are available from the Bill website:</p>
	<p pid="b.433W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/legislation/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/legislation/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.433W.2/5">In summary this framework will involve a requirement to meet emissions reduction targets in 2020 and 2050, and to set legally binding five-year carbon budgets starting from 2008. It will also involve annual progress reporting to Parliament and advice to Government and scrutiny from the independent Committee on Climate Change. In setting these budgets the Government will take account of their international and domestic obligations such as the EU's Climate and Energy package (including the 16 per cent. burden sharing target) and the Kyoto target.</p>

	<p pid="b.433W.5/1">The Department is working closely with Network Rail and Stagecoach South Western Trains (SSWT) to finalise the design and costs of the partial conversion of Waterloo International to accommodate some domestic services. Therefore some services, most likely on the routes to Windsor and Reading, could use platform 20 of Waterloo International from the timetable change date in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.433W.5/2">It is primarily the railway infrastructure outside Waterloo that limits the number of trains that can use the station rather than the number of platforms. Therefore the need is to run longer trains rather than more trains. So we are planning to make all the platforms at Waterloo long enough to accommodate 10 car trains and to modify the junction layouts on the approaches to the station so that, ultimately, all the platforms at Waterloo, including those once used by Eurostar, can be used by 10-car domestic services. Such a scheme would allow the use of longer trains than currently use the short platforms and would result in a large increase in capacity on the South Western network.</p>

	<p pid="b.434W.6/1">Since 1998, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has applied precautionary reference points as the basis for its advice, identifying which harvesting rates meet precautionary criteria. These criteria aim to ensure sustainability by keeping spawning stock biomass (SSB, the weight of mature fish) above a minimum precautionary level, Bpa (set high enough to allow a margin of error sufficient to keep SSB above a lower limit level, Blim), and keeping the fishing rate (F) below a maximum precautionary level, Fpa (set low enough to allow a margin of error sufficient to keep F below an upper limit level, Flim).</p>

	<p pid="b.445W.8/1">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) modelled in detail the numbers and types of staff likely to be needed to undertake the back office operations from now until post 2017. This showed that, despite increasing volume from ID card demand, there will be a reduction in traditional examining and related production and customer support posts in IPS, due to the process efficiencies to be delivered from increasing automation and processing by the new Application and Examination system. These changes put pressure on IPS to adopt a more efficient operating model and to adjust its staff structure in some offices. Glasgow emerged for this proposal for the reasons that it has a relatively small production capacity; it currently has lower output per full-time equivalent compared to the larger offices; it already has an established capability for carrying out post issue counter fraud activity and there are opportunities for redeployment. The service to the public will remain the same.</p>

	<p pid="b.452W.12/1">There has been a significant increase in the breadth and depth of defence co-operation between UK and India since the Joint Declaration of 2004, and combined military training involving all three Services is an important dimension of our security relationship.</p>
	<p pid="b.452W.12/2">The UK also has a strong commitment to partnering with India in the field of defence equipment production. We are well placed to support India's efforts to develop a sustainable defence manufacturing sector that produces a positive contribution to the economies of both UK and India.</p>
	<p pid="b.452W.12/3">The growing relationship is underpinned by a regular dialogue between our respective Defence Ministries at the highest level that provides for the exchange of ideas, the sharing of experience as well as a forum for the resolution of any problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.460W.2/1">The Government remain committed to making all social housing decent and to increasing the proportion of private housing in decent condition occupied by vulnerable groups. Some social landlords will need to go beyond 2010 to make their stock decent, and individual dates have been agreed. But based on returns from social landlords, we are currently still expecting 95 per cent. decency by 2010. Progress towards meeting the private sector decent homes target is ahead of trajectory.</p>

Children living in former SSLP areas exhibited more positive social behaviour and greater independence/self regulation, while parents made greater use of support services, exhibited less negative parenting and provided a better home learning environment. The analysis of the most recent data shows beneficial effects for almost all children and families living in SSLP areas and provides almost no evidence of adverse effects on population sub-groups such as workless or lone parent families.</p>

	<p pid="b.463W.3/1">The seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive introduced a requirement that data on animal testing relating to cosmetic products or their ingredients, and performed by manufacturers, their agents or suppliers, be included in the product information accessible to the competent authorities (Article 7a(1)(h)). This requirement is now contained in the Cosmetic Product (Safety) Regulations 2008 Article 16(1)(i).</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.3/2">However, the UK has operated a voluntary ban on the testing of cosmetic products on animals since 1996. This ban was made compulsory on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-11">11 September 2004</phrase>, with the implementation of the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/2152), which implement the seventh amendment to the EU Council directive on the safety of cosmetic products and which introduced a ban on the testing of cosmetic products in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.3/3">By March 2009, cosmetic manufacturers will no longer be able to use animals to test any ingredients or combinations of ingredients for cosmetic purposes, even if alternative methods are unavailable. The same deadline sees the introduction of a marketing ban in the Union on any cosmetic product whose ingredients have been tested on animals. The only exception will be certain toxicity tests for which the deadline has been extended for four years to 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.3/4">At present virtually the only tests on cosmetic ingredients that are carried out in the EU relate to substances which are already in use in cosmetics and for which safety concerns have been raised, either by or to the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products. If regarded as necessary, any animal tests would normally be carried out by a test house on behalf of the pan-European industry, in collaboration with the Commission and the SCCP.</p>

	<p pid="b.466W.3/1">The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has expressed concern that the Islamic Republic of Iran's lack of a comprehensive regime for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) represents a significant vulnerability within the international financial system. In addition to its role in setting and monitoring standards for AML/CFT in general, the FATF has warned the financial sector of the risks posed by Iran and advised jurisdictions on implementation of the financial provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions relating to Iran's nuclear activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.466W.3/2">The FATF issued statements on Iran in October 2007 and February 2008. These statements warn businesses in the financial sector about the heightened risks of money laundering or terrorist financing arising from the deficiencies in Iran's AML/CFT regime, and recommend that they apply increased scrutiny and due diligence to transactions associated with Iran. The FATF has also met Iranian authorities to discuss measures to improve Iran's AML/CFT regime. The FATF is keeping the risk posed by Iran under review and discussed progress at its meetings in London this month. In response to these FATF statements, HM Treasury has issued advisory notices to UK businesses on the heightened risk of money laundering or terrorist financing from Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.466W.3/3">At its June 2008 meeting in London, the FATF reaffirmed its public statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase> regarding the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism risks posed by Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Principe, and the northern part of Cyprus. It welcomed the actions taken by its members to advise their financial institutions of these risks, and noted it was concerned about the lack of progress by, in particular, Uzbekistan and Iran. The FATF will continue to assess the situation and take further actions in October, as necessary, to protect the international financial system.</p>
	<p pid="b.466W.3/4">The FATF has also produced guidance on implementation of the financial provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions relating to Iran's nuclear activities. The FATF published Guidance in July 2007 on &quot;Implementing Financial Provisions Of UN Security Council Resolutions To Counter Proliferation Of Weapons Of Mass Destruction&quot;, including guidance on implementing targeted asset freezes as required by UNSCR 1747. In October 2007 the FATF published &quot;Guidance Regarding The Implementation Of Activity-Based Financial Prohibitions Of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737&quot;; advising jurisdictions on preventive measures to guard against the use of the financial system to support Iran's nuclear programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.466W.3/5">A new mandate for the FATF has been agreed under the UK presidency which recognises its increased role in combating proliferation finance. The FATF will shortly publish a typology study on proliferation finance, detailing the extent of the threat and the methodologies used by proliferators.</p>

The Government undertook a review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act in 2002 and published the document &quot;Breaking the Circle&quot; which set out proposals for reform of the Act. That paper made proposals for modifying disclosure periods for offences, and other changes to the operation of the Act. In 2003 the Government agreed that the proposals had merit and proposed to legislate when parliamentary time allowed. The position is now under review in the light of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which was based on the recommendations of the Bichard report, and which makes changes to the disclosure situation for ex-offenders in many areas of employment.</p>

	<p pid="b.479W.5/1">Disposal of waste is a matter for local management across the prison estate. As prisons are much more than simply 'dwellings' for prisoners, the waste comes from several sources. There is the equivalent of domestic waste but there is additional waste generated by industrial, commercial, horticultural and office activities. The majority of prisons now sort waste for sale, recycling or re-use. When waste cannot be disposed of in this fashion, generally prisons arrange for commercial collection and disposal. There is one known exception, when a prison pays a collection charge to the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.481W.6/1">Raising quality is integral to our ambitious plans set out in &quot;World-Class Apprenticeships&quot;. We are establishing the National Apprenticeship Service from April 2009 to ensure the provision of high quality apprenticeships in England. It will have responsibility for building on the current excellent completion rate of 63 per cent. which has risen from 24 per cent. in 2001/02. In the meantime, the Learning and Skills Council is progressing with its work to agree minimum levels of performance for apprenticeships; developing a new blueprint which clearly defines the core elements of an apprenticeship and specific training requirements; and working with the new Learning and Skills Improvement Service to secure continuous improvement in the provision of apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="b.487W.8/1">In Malawi it is estimated that around 80 per cent. of primary school-age children are in school. The draft Malawi National Education Sector Plan (NESP) 2008-17 has a target of increasing this to 95 per cent. by 2012-13. This is only achievable with increased investments in teachers, classrooms and teaching and learning materials. With these efforts, the Department for International Development (DFID) estimates the net enrolment ratio (NER) could increase to 86 per cent. in 2009-10; 89 per cent. in 2010-11 and 92 per cent. in 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="b.488W.2/1">The UK Government recognise the significant contribution the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) makes to tackling poverty. This, however, can be increased further by the AsDB focusing more on ensuring that programmes achieve their anticipated results and improving the performance of its staff. Over the last year, the UK has pursued these objectives in formal discussions of the AsDB's work and strategy, in financing negotiations, and bilaterally with Bank's President and management.</p>
	<p pid="b.488W.2/2">Last September, the UK formally withdrew the offer of additional funding that had been made subject to the AsDB implementing changes to improve its effectiveness. During the latest financing negotiations which finished in May 2008, the UK Government made clear again that the level of the UK contribution would be based on its effectiveness. The AsDB were able to show some improvements and gave a number of commitments to take further action. However, we reduced our share of total donor contributions (from 6 per cent. to 4.8 per cent.) to signal that we were not satisfied with the pace of reform.</p>

	<p pid="b.488W.5/2">The AsDB has launched a number of climate initiatives under its CEIF Climate Change Programme.

We have also committed &pound;1.4 million to a regional technical assistance programme for the AsDB to take forward its work on adaptation to climate change. The AsDB is ensuring that climate change issues are fully integrated in its new Country Partnership Strategies. This includes helping countries to build adaptation into their development plans and into AsDB's future investments. DFID, FCO and DEFRA are also supporting the AsDB to carry out a &pound;450,000 Regional Review of the Economics of Climate Change study in South East Asia.

	<p pid="b.490W.0/1">During my recent visit to Bangladesh, I reiterated that the UK's interests, like those of the Bangladeshi people, are best served by a stable, prosperous and democratic Bangladesh. I met the Bangladesh Finance Adviser, and the Bangladesh Chief of Army Staff and expressed the UK's support for the roadmap for national elections before the end of 2008. I also repeated the UK's call to relax the provisions of the State of Emergency in Bangladesh, in order to facilitate conditions for the preparation of free and fair elections. I publicly urged all sides, including the political parties, to engage and participate positively in the democratic processes to bring a smooth transition to an elected government, which can sustain credible democracy thereafter. Also, I asserted the UK's belief that a return to the violent and confrontational politics of 2006 could never sustain democracy in Bangladesh.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.0/2">The UK, through DFID, is providing practical support to democratic processes in Bangladesh. We are currently providing &pound;10 million to the Government of Bangladesh in support of the development of a new photographic voter roll and National ID Card. This will help to eliminate 'ghost voters', and to provide a fair, safe and transparent election.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.0/3">We are also providing &pound;2.1 million to the national election programme aimed at supporting domestic non-governmental organisations to provide domestic and international monitoring of the election; and &pound;2.8 million for 'BBC Sanglap' in support of a &quot;Question Time&quot; style debate show on television and radio in Bangladesh that encourages political/public dialogue. Both programmes are designed to minimise the scope for electoral fraud and reduce the risk of political parties boycotting the elections.</p>

The official Burmese government death toll is 84,537 dead with 53,836 missing, and the UN estimates the total number of people badly affected to be in the region of 2.4 million. The Red Cross estimates on the basis of reports from 22 organisations working in Burma that between 69,000 and 128,000 were killed. DFID estimates that of the affected population, 300,000 remain extremely vulnerable and require immediate humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.3/2">Some progress has been made in improving access to the affected areas by international humanitarian workers. The rate of delivery and volume of relief goods has increased since the UN/Association of South East Asian Nations conference on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-25">25 May</phrase>, but the UN estimates that approximately 1.1 million of the 2.4 million cyclone victims have yet to receive assistance. Some areas are just now being reached for the first time. However, the ASEAN's joint assessment process (PONJA&mdash;Post Nargis Joint Assessment) is under way and appears to be progressing well.</p>

	<p pid="b.492W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) believes that poor farmers, if properly supported, have the potential to contribute significantly to reducing hunger and poverty by growing food for their families and the immediate community. This also contributes to overall economic growth. At the recent Rome Food Summit the UK called on all donors, other international organisations, developing country governments, the private sector and civil society to double our efforts to tackle hunger and poverty under a Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food (GPAF). DFID works directly on agriculture in more than 20 countries, investing &pound;120 million a year. In Africa and Asia DFID also supports a range of social protection programmes. In Africa alone we spend &pound;55 million a year on rural safety nets which deliver social transfers to 8 million poor farmers.</p>
	<p pid="b.492W.0/2">An increasing amount of DFID's funding is now going through multilateral channels. The European Commission and the World Bank are both significantly increasing the amount that they are committing to agriculture. This year's World Development Report, published by the World Bank, supported by DFID through funding and technical inputs, is devoted to the subject of agriculture and development. It highlights the need to provide support to poor farmers, and to provide alternative income opportunities in rural areas. DFID is also a leading supporter of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme, CAADP, an Africa-led initiative looking to find the best ways of addressing the primary millennium development goal target of poverty and hunger.</p>

	<p pid="b.492W.3/1">The 2006 White Paper on International Development made climate change a strategic priority for the Department for International Development (DFID), and has led to an increase in capacity and resources on this issue. As part of the 2005 G8 meeting in Gleneagles, the UK helped push for a Clean Energy Investment Framework to stimulate greater investment in lower carbon energy sources by the multilateral development banks. Linked to this we have part-funded five low-carbon growth strategies in Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.492W.3/2">The UK has been a major contributor to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and our current funding totals &pound;140 million over four years (2007-8 to 2010-11). About a third of GEF's funds support projects tackling climate change, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transport, and new low carbon energy technologies. The UK Government's longer term objective is to enable all developing countries to access global carbon markets, and we have supported programmes to ensure greater participation in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) by African countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.493W.0/1">At the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles the UK championed the Clean Energy Investment Framework (CEIF), which commits the World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to increase their investment in renewable sources of energy. Our longer term objective is for global carbon markets to act as the primary driver of investment in sustainable energy sources in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.493W.0/2">The UK will be one of the major contributors to the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), which will provide additional resources, via the multilateral development banks, to help developing countries pilot new approaches for the demonstration and deployment of low carbon technologies. The CTF is part of the newly created Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), and will be capitalised from the UK's &pound;800 million Environmental Transformation Fund. The Department for International Development (DFID) also provides core funding to the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP) and the Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP).</p>

	<p pid="b.493W.3/1">In 2005 the UK EU presidency launched the European Consensus on Development. This landmark agreement committed EU member states and the Commission to ensure that policies that affect development (such as trade and migration) do not compromise, and where possible, support progress towards achieving development goals. This goal is termed Policy Coherence for Development (PCD).</p>
	<p pid="b.493W.3/2">The first EU biannual report on PCD was issued in October 2007. The report highlighted that progress had been made in the Commission, particularly around establishing mechanisms to promote PCD. Substantial efforts have been made on some policy areas, on trade for example, the EU has been at the forefront of making development a key issue at the World Trade Organisation negotiations and in seeking a successful outcome of the Doha Development Agenda. Implementation of PCD at the member state level was more varied although the UK was seen as a good performer.</p>
	<p pid="b.493W.3/3">The report was an important step forward in raising awareness and understanding of PCD. In future reports, there will be more focus on the wider impact and outcomes of PCD efforts.</p>

	<p pid="b.496W.2/1">At global level the World Health Organisation and World Bank are working effectively together in leading the International Health Partnership (IHP). The eight multilateral health agencies (WHO, World Bank, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, GAVI Alliance, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNAIDS and the Gates Foundation) also meet regularly to coordinate their work and implement the IHP as the H8. At a country level, Department for International Development (DFID) offices are also reporting progress. For example, in Mozambique a central part of the IHP will be developing and implementing a coordinated strategy to scale-up health workers; and in Nepal, the IHP gave momentum to a new policy on free health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.496W.2/2">DFID is pleased that there will now be an external review of the IHP to assess progress against commitments set out in the global IHP Compact, which was signed in September 2007. DFID will be calling for a discussion of the results of that review at ministerial and head of agency level.</p>

	<p pid="b.500W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is a strong supporter of the UN and recognises that it is a key partner in achieving the MDG's. $15 billion of all development aid flows through the UN. The UK spent &pound;615 million through the UN in 2005. The high level panel report recommended key reforms to the way the UN works at country and the central level.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/2">In 2007 DFID provided catalytic funding to assist the transition of the Delivering as One initiative in eight pilot countries as well as active support of the UN country teams as they develop their new plans for a more streamlined UN programme through effective co-ordination between the UN, national governments and donor partners, that support national governments' own development priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/3">DFID is playing a significant role in supporting the transition to a more strategic and coherent programme, better placed to support national capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/4">The success of some of the pilots has led to another 30 governments and UN country teams expressing interest to become part of the next phase of the One UN to improve the coherence and effectiveness of their programmes.</p>

President Zoellick's vision is for the World Bank Group to contribute to &quot;inclusive and sustainable globalisation&quot;&mdash;to overcome poverty, enhance growth with care for the environment, and create individual opportunity and hope.

The World Food Programme estimates that 5.1 million people may need food aid in the coming year. The severe HIV/AIDS crisis, increasing poverty and destitution, the chaos caused by hyperinflation, and the breakdown of water and sanitation services, are all adding to the risk factors for a major humanitarian emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-04">4 June</phrase> the Government of Zimbabwe suspended the field activities of all NGO's and Private Voluntary Organisations (PVOs), with severe implications for the delivery of humanitarian relief. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that around 1.5 million people are being immediately affected. UNICEF say this number includes half a million children.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.2/3">The World Food Programme's main feeding programme is due to scale up from August. The absence of large scale food aid programmes in the second half of the year could lead to high levels of malnutrition and increased mortality.</p>

	<p pid="b.504W.0/1">The Department has not issued guidance about how the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) impacts on carers. Most carers are volunteers and are not covered by the EWTD.</p>

Allocations to local authorities (LAs) have increased by 39 per cent. in real terms since 1997. The detail of contracting arrangements between LAs and independent sector providers of care is a matter for local decision. We expect LAs to take into account a range of provider costs such as implementing the EWTD.</p>

Suffolk primary care trust (PCT): In 2006, Suffolk PCT was formed from four former PCTs: Suffolk Coastal PCT, Ipswich PCT, Central Suffolk PCT, Suffolk West PCT. 2. Finished admission episodes (FAEs): A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. 3. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 4. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. 5. All Diagnoses count of episodes&mdash;primary and secondary&mdash;&quot;drug related&quot;: These figures represent a count of all FAEs where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record. 6.

Data quality<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/>  2. FCE<br/> A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> 3. All operations count of episodes<br/> These figures represent a count of all FCE's where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002-03) operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br/>  4. Low numbers<br/> Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with '*' (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional smallest number have been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br/> 5. Ungrossed data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).</td> </tr>

The United Kingdom comprises only 3.5 per cent. of the global market and in patent medicine prices will continue to be significantly greater than manufacturing and distribution costs.

(The other two clinical areas, depression and smoking indicators, are based on subsets of other clinical registers.) The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.<br/> Raw prevalence for each clinical area is defined as a percentage of patients on a practice list:<br/> Raw prevalence = (number on clinical register/number on practice list) x 100<br/>  QOF prevalence<br/> It is important to emphasise that QOF registers do not necessarily equate to prevalence, as defined by epidemiologists. For example, prevalence figures based on QOF registers (eg obesity) may differ from prevalence figures from other sources because of coding or definitional issues. QOF registers are constructed to underpin indicators on quality of care. QMAS only uses 'Read codes' that are common to all three versions. It is difficult to interpret year-on-year changes in the size of QOF registers. For example, a gradual rise in QOF prevalence could be due partly to epidemiological factors (such as an ageing population) or due partly to increased case finding.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.530W.5/1">The new National Stroke Strategy, published in December 2007 (copies of which are available in the Library), sets out 20 quality markers for the provision of high quality treatment and care for adult stroke survivors. Of those quality markers, seven link directly to the kind of support and services which those who have had a stroke and their carers need in the community. These include support with communication disabilities and other high quality rehabilitation, information, advice, practical and peer support throughout the care pathway, in line with individual need.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.5/2">In addition to the funding that has gone to primary care trusts, &pound;105 million of central funding over three years will support implementation. This includes &pound;45 million to local authorities (LAs), including Wakefield metropolitan district council, to help them develop or accelerate their existing provision of long-term support to those who live with the effects of a stroke. The strategy recognises that some people who have had a stroke, including those with aphasia and other communication difficulties, will have specific support needs. We expect that LAs will use some the new funding we have made available to meet these needs in line with local needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.532W.5/1">We remain deeply concerned at the political situation in Burma. The regime continues to ignore the calls of the UN Security Council for a genuine and inclusive dialogue with the opposition and ethnic groups. Such a dialogue is the only way the country will achieve the national reconciliation, prosperity and stability it needs now more than ever. The renewal of Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-27">27 May</phrase>, and the regime's decision to undertake its flawed referendum in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, underline the urgency of making progress. As my right hon.

	<p pid="b.535W.8/1">The security situation in Iraq varies from province to province. The security situation in Iraq has improved significantly over the course of the second half of 2007 and 2008. In and around Baghdad, violence has reduced to levels not seen since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.535W.8/2">There are a number of factors that have contributed towards the downturn in levels of violence across Iraq. The increased capacity and capability of the Iraqi security forces has had a positive impact in reducing levels of violence. Other factors include the surge of US forces and the emergence of predominantly Sunni tribal 'Awakening' Councils and Sons of Iraq/Concerned Local Citizens, who have turned against al-Qa'eda. The continued ceasefire declared by Moqtada al Sadr in August 2007 has also had a positive effect in the south, although we remain concerned about violence committed by militant elements linked to the Sadrist movement.</p>

These usually involve dietary and medical issues raised by prisoners. Our consulate in Dubai has taken up four cases of ill treatment with the Dubai authorities in the last three years. Posts also continue to liaise with the authorities in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi to ensure that the appeals are progressing.</p>
