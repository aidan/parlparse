	<p pid="b.23W.7/1">In Helmand there are reported to be two refugee camps near Lashkar Gah. The exact population of these is currently not known, but UN estimates suggest that about 2,800 families in Helmand have been displaced. The Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) community is thought to comprise of: semi nomads (Kuchis); those displaced by drought; and those displaced as a result of violence. A number of the IDPs are not living in camps but with host families; and families from rural areas are moving to the main town of Lashkar Gar to buy supplies and sell crops as they would any year. This confuses the picture.</p>
	<p pid="b.23W.7/2">UK officials have been monitoring the IDP situation in Helmand. In August the Governor asked the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) to assist in the provision of food and non-food items to 3,000 IDP families. The PRT provided $60,000 to help with this. The assistance was distributed by the Government and we have had no request for further assistance. The UN has reassured us that in Helmand the basic needs of the 2,800 families are being met. Assistance from the World Food Programme, United Nations High Commission of Refugees and the Afghan Red Crescent has been made available to Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="b.23W.7/3">Mukhtar Camp was established in 1995-06. The second camp, outside Lashkar Gar, was established this year and is hosting newly arrived IDPs.</p>

	<p pid="b.24W.2/1">Over the last five years DFID has spent over &pound;390 million on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. At the London Conference inJanuary 2006, the UK signed a 10-year development partnership agreement with the Government of Afghanistan. This agreement commits DFID to provide &pound;330 million for reconstruction and development over the subsequent three years. This forms part of the UK's overall pledge at the London Conference of &pound;500 million over three years. DFID's budget for Afghanistan is &pound;102 million in 2006-07. This will rise to &pound;113 million in 2007-08, and &pound;115 millionin 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="b.24W.5/1">DFID does not have a direct development programme in Cuba, so no specific assessment of sustainable development policies there has been made. DFID's Caribbean office focuses on the English-speaking Caribbean, and therefore only maintains a watching brief on developments in Cuba. We are of course generally concerned about the welfare of the Cuban people and about how Cuba affects the wider Caribbean through its relationship with its neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.5/2">DFID does provide support to NGOs working in Cuba through our central funding. Currently, through our Partnership Programme Agreements, DFID provides funding of two NGOs working in Cuba&mdash;Save the Children and the Ethical Trading Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.5/3">As part of the European Union, we are committed to the policy of constructive engagement with Cuba. In the period 2000-05, the European Commission's support to Cuba has included humanitarian aid and disaster prevention; food security; NGO co-financing in various sectors&mdash;including agriculture, health and education; economic cooperation; financial and technical cooperation; and support to the promotion of democracy and human rights. Since August 2003, the EC's support to Cuba has been constrained by Cuba's refusal to accept EC bilateral aid cooperation. Since then EC support has been provided only through non-governmental entities. For example, in 2005, the EC committed approximately &euro;300,000 to Cuba, all of which was for NGO co-financing.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.5/4">We will continue to monitor political and other developments in Cuba and respond as needed in the context of our engagement in EU institutions and our Caribbean regional programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.2/1">The aim of all DFID's work is to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that make people vulnerable to trafficking. The main channel for funding projects which specifically combat human trafficking is the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Since 1999, DFID has committed almost&pound;9 million to support their programme in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region. A further &pound;3 million has been allocated to their programme in China.

	<p pid="b.27W.5/1">The Government's aim for Fire and Rescue Service training is to ensure that best use is made of resources at the appropriate level. The Fire and Rescue Service National Framework 2006-08 states that regional management boards should draw up a regional HR strategy which encompasses training and development and identifying and implementing the most efficient and effective means for delivering this. The preparation and updating of these regional HR strategies will provide information on current and future training needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.5/2">That training at national, regional and local level should be complementary is based on the principles set out in the National Fire and Rescue Service Learning and Development Strategy for England (LDS), published in November 2005. There are a number of examples where Fire and Rescue Services work in partnership to provide training and there may be further scope for some facilities to be shared on a regional or sub-regional basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.5/3">The Fire Service College continues to provide a national and international facility for operational incident management training, centred on its unique facilities and recognises the need for learning and development to be delivered more flexibly to meet the changing needs of the Fire and Rescue Service. It is reviewing its programme of training courses and products to meet the changing needs of the Fire and Rescue Service.</p>

	<p pid="b.42W.5/1">Hits to <a href="http://www.hedgehogs.gov.uk">www.hedgehogs.gov.uk</a> are set out in the following table. The hedgehogs website is designed to engage children and promote wider awareness of road safety. It is however but one channel within our wider suite of communication activities taken forward as part of the THINK! child road safety campaign. We use a broad mix of TV, cinema and online advertising, PR, partnership marketing and education materials to communicate child road safety messages.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.5/2">We measure our activity through research tracking and ultimately through the number of children who are killed or seriously injured on our roads. Our recent child tracking research showed high awareness of the campaign with eight out of 10 children being aware of our advertising. Children were also very positive about the campaign and there is a clear correlation between traffic to the website and online marketing activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.5/3">The increase in hits and visits to the website in March 2006 is a reflection of increased online advertising activity that month.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.5/4">The Government have set a demanding target to reduce the number of children aged under 16 killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads by 50 per cent. by 2010, using the average for 1994-98 as the baseline. We are on course to exceed this target. The THINK! road safety campaign is an important component of our strategy to reduce deaths and injuries.</p>

	<p pid="b.46W.6/1">The magistrates retirement age is setat 70 under the Courts Act 2003. It is our policy to increase judicial diversity and it is particularly important that magistrates, whose great strength is that they are local people delivering local justice, reflect the diverse communities they serve. Nationally, 80 per cent. of magistrates are over 50. We need to recruit substantially more magistrates under the age of 50, and allowing magistrates to sit beyond 70 would work against this important objective.</p>

	<p pid="b.57W.2/1">The Government believe strongly that the best approach to ensuring strategic exports are not diverted or misused, is by case by case assessment, against the Consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria, of any proposed export at the time of application, i.e. before the export goes ahead. If, after careful assessment at the licensing stage, it is assessed there is a risk that the equipment will be diverted from its stated end use a licence will not be issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.2/2">The possibility of diversion of exported goods to an undesirable end use is part of the strict risk assessment undertaken by dedicated personnel in four Government Departments (the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Defence, the Department for International Development) involved in the export licensing process at the time of application. This takes into account relevant information the Government may hold, including from the Government's overseas posts who monitor local developments closely and note any information that comes to light that equipment supplied by the UK has been used in a manner inconsistent with the consolidated criteria. Should information come to light that goods have been diverted, the Government will take this into consideration when assessing any future applications. The Government may also revoke the relevant licence(s) and ask the authorities in the country concerned to investigate.</p>

	<p pid="b.57W.5/2">All export licences are assessed on a case by case basis against the EU and national consolidated export licensing criteria. This includes in criterion 2 the 'respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination'. If an export is considered inconsistent with the criteria, a licence will not be issued. Given the thorough and strict pre-licensing assessments, we are confident that our exports do not have adverse effects on the human rights situations in the countries of final destination.</p>

At the time of writing, many of the details surrounding the Israel/Lebanon conflict were still unclear. A decision was made not to cover the conflict as a whole. However, we were able to insert a section about the UK's efforts to bring about a ceasefire and our plans to help with reconstruction. Additionally, two paragraphs were added to the section on Syria remarking on their unhelpful role in supporting Hezbollah. We had concerns about Israeli actions during the conflict, which we made public at the time. And there is a large section in the human rights report covering our other concerns about Israel. We intend to cover the Israel/Hezbollah conflict in greater detail in our next report.</p>

	<p pid="b.61W.2/1">Following President Gayoom's speech in June 2004 outlining his aspirations for democratic reform, the Special Majlis (Constitutional Assembly) was established. Political parties were legalised for the first time in June 2005. We understand there are now at least three registered political parties. In March this year President Gayoom launched the Roadmap for the Agenda Reform. However, the process of bringing modern democracy to Maldives has been lethargic and subject to setbacks. After two years, the Special Majlis has made little progress on a new constitution.</p>
	<p pid="b.61W.2/2">This summer in talks between the Maldivian Government and the Maldivian Democratic Party, which were hosted by the British high commissioner to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, there were encouraging signs of progress. In September, my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr. Howells), made a statement calling on the Maldivian Government and all political parties to work constructively both together and with the people of the Maldives to step up the pace of the democratic reforms. It is disappointing that the main stakeholders now seem to be drawing back from the progress they had made together. We continue to underline directly to stakeholders the need for open discussions among all political parties on the implementation of the democratisation process and on the promotion of democracy in the Maldives. We welcome and support the efforts of the EU, and other individual partners within it, in doing the same.</p>

We made improving the availability of psychological therapies a manifesto commitment in 2005, and it was a commitment we also made in the Our Health, our care, our say White Paper. The need to increase access to psychological therapies was also highlighted by Professor Louis Appleby, the national director for mental health, in his 2004 report on the progress made in implementing the national service framework for mental health.</p>

			<tr pid="b.79W.5/8"> <td><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. <i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 2. <i> Main operation:</i><br/> The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br/> 3. <i> Time waited (days):</i><br/> Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br/> 4. <i> Ungrossed data:</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 5.<i>  Data quality:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for Health and Social Care</td> </tr>
