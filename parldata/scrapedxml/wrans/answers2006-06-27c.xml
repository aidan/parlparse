	<p pid="c.255W.8/2">The X-Factor is an adjustment made to military pay, recommended by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), which recognises the relative disadvantages of the conditions of service experienced by members of the armed forces, compared with personnel in the civilian sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.255W.8/3">X-Factor is currently set at 13 per cent. for Regular personnel and is made up of a number of elements, one of which includes an element of separation. Therefore, to avoid double recompense, service personnel must experience a degree of separation (the qualifying period) before Longer Separated Service Allowance (LSSA) becomes payable.</p>
	<p pid="c.255W.8/4">With the roll-out of the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA), LSSA is being replaced by Longer Separation Allowance (LSA). In recognition of the fact some junior personnel, particularly those in the infantry and Royal Marines, deploy immediately after their training, the Initial Qualifying Period for LSA has been set at 100 days of qualifying separated service. (Qualifying separated service requires personnel to be at a location that precludes return to their duty station, family or permanent residence for periods in excess of 10 days). This change from 12 months benefits those who deploy early in their careers.</p>

	<p pid="c.256W.6/1">The new Supervisory Care Policy for Defence Individual Training Establishments was published as a Defence Information Notice in March 2006 (2006DIN06-049). The policy mandates the determination of a Supervisory Care Directive, underpinned by a Unit Commander's Risk Assessment. The Supervisory Care Directive clearly articulates a Unit Commander's commitment to the care of trainees. It highlights areas where detailed care responsibilities are required, and cross-refers to other policies where appropriate. The Unit Commander's Risk Assessment takes account of the particular factors of the environment, the trainee population and the type of training being undertaken at each training establishment. The new policy mandates that minimum levels of supervision are determined from the Unit Commander's Risk Assessment and must be articulated against the relevant serials during the working day, out of hours, weekend and leave periods. Implementation of the new Supervisory Care Policy is subject to evaluation by the MOD HQ Defence Individual Training Capability (DITC) team in order to establish whether relevant policies have been correctly interpreted and successfully implemented.</p>

	<p pid="c.258W.0/2">The Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO), which we announced last year, will provide significant further support to this industry by ensuring a stable, long-term market for biofuels in the UK. It should mean that by 2010, sales of biofuel will amount to over 2 billion litres, or around 5 per cent. of total petrol and diesel sales. A number of firms have reacted very positively to our announcement and are planning significant investment in UK biofuel production capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.258W.0/3">In addition to the RTFO the Chancellor has announced that, subject to European Union State Aid approval, the Government will introduce a 100 per cent. first year capital allowance for the cleanest biofuels production facilities.

	<p pid="c.258W.6/1">On the basis of four months' experience of compulsory helmet wearing in 1973, it was estimated that around 200 fatal and serious casualties would be saved per annum. Because helmet wearing is now so long established in the UK, it is no longer possible to calculate further effects on road safety: there is no non-helmet wearing group with which to compare.</p>
	<p pid="c.258W.6/2">However, US researchers are able to compare helmeted and unhelmeted riders as some states do not have helmet laws. Comparisons have concluded that the use of a safety helmet is the single critical factor in the prevention and reduction of head injury, with unhelmeted riders being 2.4 times as likely to sustain head injuries as helmeted riders.</p>

	<p pid="c.261W.0/1">Although the circumstances of the incidents on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-17">17 March 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June 2006</phrase> were significantly different, lessons learnt from incidents such as that in 2004 have enabled the Highways Agency to better manage the recent event. The nature of the earlier incident enabled traffic to pass safely the site of the accident; the more recent one resulted in fire and damage to infrastructure which prevented this from taking place.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.0/2">Since 2004 the Highways Agency has improved capability for the evacuation of the motorway through detailed and tested joint operating procedures with the local emergency services in the event of a major incident. It has also developed detailed incident management procedures such as the capability to implement rearward relief; the process by which trapped vehicles are turned on the carriageway and returned to the previous exit. These procedures include the support and welfare of motorists where they cannot be assisted from the site.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.0/3">The period since the 2004 incident has seen significant developments in the Highways Agency's capability to minimise congestion caused by incidents. The introduction of Regional Control Centres as part of the Traffic Officer Service and the commencement of the National Traffic Control Centre provide an ability to divert traffic away from an incident through strategic signing, and around an incident through tactical signing and direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.0/4">The Highways Agency has substantially strengthened its ability to detect and respond to incidents and reduce the resulting congestion. The Traffic Officer Service on the M25 and other motorways is enabling significantly increased resources to be more quickly available at the scene to support the management of the incidents. Traffic officers worked well with emergency services on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June</phrase> to minimise the duration of the incident and quickly restore the motorway to a safe condition. The emergency procedures were implemented and motorists received both welfare and medical assistance as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.0/5">The Highways Agency has continued to develop its Incident Support Unit service on the M25 and, following its successful contribution to incident management on the M25, implemented similar services on most of the strategic road network. In addition Regional Control Centres are proactively monitoring the road network quickly to detect incidents and improve communication between responders with the aim of reducing the clearance time.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.0/6">All major incidents are reviewed soon afterwards jointly by the Highways Agency and emergency services to identify lessons to be learnt in dealing with future incidents. There is an ongoing programme to continually develop incident management capability including innovations such as central reserve screens to prevent visual distraction of motorists on adjacent carriageways and specialist equipment to support the clear-up operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.262W.2/2">The M25 clockwise carriageway was closed for 22 hours. The anti-clockwise carriageway was also closed for 1.5 hours for safety reasons while the tanker was being removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.2/3">The Highways Agency advised motorists of the incident and delays by providing radio stations and news media with regular updates, and their website and Information Line also provided up-to-the-minute information. Television and press representatives were invited to the incident scene by Essex police to observe the recovery operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.2/4">The Highways Agency repaired the nearside boundary fence and used a specialist environmental sub-contractor to clean the road surface. This enabled the carriageway to be opened safely for the public after the vehicles and debris had been removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.2/5">Essex police carried out the incident investigation, co-ordinated the recovery operation, and set the diversion signs. They also allowed the trapped clockwise traffic between junction 29 and the incident to escape using lanes 2 and 3. Throughout the duration of the closure, the variable message signs advised motorists that this section of the M25 motorway was closed. Contractors undertaking road works on the A128 were contacted by Essex police and agreed to change the mechanism of temporary traffic lights at the road works in order to give priority to diverted traffic travelling south from the M25.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.2/6">An Executive Summary and full report were produced at the time of the incident. The summary was a chronological log of events on the day detailing agencies involved and actions taken to clear the incident. A full copy of the report has been sent to my hon. Friend by the Highways Agency, and copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.264W.8/1">The decision to change these services was made during the replacement process for the South Western franchises. The replacement process offers the opportunity to review current service levels, and to assess whether value for money is delivered for passengers and taxpayers by their operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.8/2">The South Western franchise has specified that there will be a regular half-hourly service operating between Salisbury and Southampton. This will be formed of the existing Cardiff-Portsmouth hourly service, and a new hourly service that has been created by extending the current Romsey-Totton operation; this creates a net increase in services between Salisbury and Southampton despite a small reduction in Greater Western trains.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.8/3">The decision to remove services between Reading and Brighton via Eastleigh has been specified in the South Western franchise. Surveys were conducted in September 2005 that confirmed the low utilisation of this service, and the Department for Transport's standard appraisal methods confirmed that the withdrawal of the service represents good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.8/4">Most journeys on this service occur on stations between Basingstoke and Eastleigh, and along the South Coast between Havant and Brighton. A new service is proposed to operate between Brighton and Southampton. The specification does not preclude providing a service between Havant and Eastleigh in the future to meet proposed developments or in response to customer demand, subject to the franchisee's commercial position and Network Rail's operational assessment.</p>

An application can be made to the magistrates court under that section of the Highways Act 1980 for an order to keep a highway in repair.

	<p pid="c.266W.3/1">DFID's aid programme to Afghanistan (&pound;102 million in 2006-07) supports three of the Afghan Government's own objectives, as set out in their Interim National Development Strategy: (i) Building effective state institutions; (ii) improving economic management and the effectiveness of aid to Afghanistan; and (iii) improving the livelihoods of rural poor. These are the key steps needed in Afghanistan to generate a self-sustaining state with the capacity to meet basic social needs and start the process of reducing poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/2">The UK is currently the largest donor to the Government's recurrent budget through allocations to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. This covers recurrent costs such as salaries for teachers and health workers. This is the support the Afghan Government wants, and is the best chance for building effective state institutions that will last and are able to deliver basic services across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/3">The UK also supports a number of key Government of Afghanistan National Programmes, which focus on improving the livelihoods of the rural poor. The National Solidarity Programme (NSP) for example, helps local communities to identify their own needs and provides the means to meet them. Often this includes the provision of basic service infrastructure such as schools and health centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/4">DFID also provides 19 per cent. of the EC's commitment to Afghanistan of 1 billion euros (2002-06) and over 10 per cent. of the World Banks Commitment of $250-300 million a year. DFID also contributes to UN agencies. These partners are all actively engaged in the delivery of basic services across the country.</p>

The World Bank, which will ultimately assume management of the mechanism, expects its operation to be ready in August.</p>

The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) or Community Safety Partnership (CSP) in Wales on which both local authorities and police authorities are partners would have to respond to any report of the scrutiny committee, and to explain any decision not to take action.

	<p pid="c.277W.5/1">There is considerable evidence, originating mainly from North America, to support the effectiveness of offending behaviour programmes in reducing re-offending (McGuire, 2002; Pearson et. al., 2002; Lipton, et. al., 1998). However, UK research examining the effectiveness of the Enhanced Thinking Skills programme in prisons has produced mixed results. An evaluation of the programme before it was accredited found that reconviction fell considerably after treatment (Friendship et. al., 2002). Further studies since accreditation have found no differences in reconvictions between programme participants and matched comparison groups (Falshaw et. al., 2003; Cann et. al., 2003). These findings might be explained by differences in programme delivery and implementation or research design limitations. The current Home Office research programme includes further research on the effectiveness of offending behaviour programmes based on more effective and rigorous research designs.</p>

	<p pid="c.278W.3/1">Generally, anyone who resists or wilfully obstructs a constable in the exercise of his duty is guilty of an offence under section 89(2), Police Act 1996. As regards motoring offences, including those which may have resulted in a fatal accident, the police are empowered under section 172, Road Traffic Act 1988 to ask the registered vehicle keeper who was driving it at the time, and it is an offence not to give that information if possible. Under section 99, Transport Act 1968, the police can examine and copy records relating to commercial vehicles and their drivers. It is an offence not to provide those records, which may provide information relevant to an accident investigation, or to obstruct the police. Details of the circumstances in which police exercise these powers and in which offences are committed are not recorded.</p>

	<p pid="c.281W.9/4">Re-offending rates vary considerably by type of disposal and some of this can be explained by the differences in the characteristics of offenders given each disposal. For instance, the number of previous offences is one of the key indicators for predicting re-offending and these differ substantially between disposals. For reasons such as this, the rates cannot be used to judge the effectiveness of different sentences. Analysis of re-offending by disposal is discussed further on pages seven to nine of the report on adults and pages eight to 10 of the report on juveniles.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-27c.80250.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-06-27c.293W.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="293W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060627/text/60627w0012.htm#06062748001725">
	<p pid="c.293W.9/1">The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 has been in operation for less than two years, and the benefits of the move to prevention based fire and rescue services are already evident. Provisional figures for the year to June 2005 show significant decreases in the number of deaths and injuries, the number of primary fires and the number of deliberate fires. In England, by comparison to the previous year, there has been a 21 per cent. fall in deaths in accidental dwelling fires. The number of fires to which the fire and rescue service were called fell by 25 per cent. Within the primary fires category, there was a fall of 7 per cent. in the total number of building fires including a 10 per cent. decrease in non-domestic building fires (i.e. commercial premises, schools, etc.). Deliberate primary fires fell by 20 per cent. That is a tribute to the way our fire and rescue services have exercised their duties and powers under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.293W.9/2">The Government have received representations about charging by fire and rescue services for non-fire-fighting related work; operation of Integrated Risk Management Planning (IRMP) under the National Framework; and about the 24 hour delay on powers on entry to domestic premises for fire investigation purposes. On charging, the matters for which fire and rescue authorities may charge are set out in The Fire and Rescue Services (England) Order 2004. We keep that under review and will consult on any changes that we propose. For the National Framework we have recognised that it can assist fire and rescue services in forward planning if the framework has a longer life than one year. We have therefore introduced a two-year Framework for 2006-08 following consultation with the Fire and Rescue Service. Finally on fire investigation, the powers available to the fire and rescue authorities are at least equivalent to those available to the police. Nonetheless, we are considering the points made in conjunction with the Arson Control Forum.</p>

	<p pid="c.300W.2/1">In the recent consultation on the future of local strategic partnerships, LSP were positioned as the overarching partnership in an area that would bring all relevant service deliverers together. In order for this to work effectively the consultation described the LSP as needing to consist of a board, which will determine the priorities for an area through the Local Area Agreement, and a series of thematic sub-partnerships including the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) which would deliver against these agreed priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.2/2">The Home Office's recent Crime and Disorder Act review built on this model and gave further emphasis to the strategic leadership role to the LSP in reducing crime and antisocial behaviour through its setting of the LAA targets. Furthermore, all LAAs contain mandatory targets on both crime and antisocial behaviour, which are developed by LSPs.</p>

	<p pid="c.306W.9/1">Funding for schools is a shared responsibility between central and local government. The majority of funding is provided by central Government, with Local Authorities (LAs) providing the rest. For the first time this year, schools will receive their funding from a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) rather than as part of the local government settlement. The DSG is a ring-fenced grant and must be used for schools' budgets. It is for each LA to distribute funding using a locally agreed formula, and for schools' governing bodies to decide how to spend the available resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.306W.9/2">Since 1997-98, total funding for education in England has increased nationally, by &pound;1,170 per pupil from &pound;2,940 in 1997-98 to &pound;4,110 per pupil in 2005-06. This represents a rise of nearly 40 per cent. per pupil.</p>
	<p pid="c.306W.9/3">Support for children with special educational needs (SEN) accounts for a high proportion of all education expenditure. We do not hold information centrally about expenditure on autism but information collected from LAs shows planned expenditure on the education of children with SEN has increased from &pound;2.8 billion in 2001-02 (when data was first available) to &pound;4.1 billion in 2005-06. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending. The figure of &pound;4.1 billion includes about &pound;1.4 billion for maintained special schools, &pound;2.0 billion for mainstream schools, &pound;481 million for independent and non-maintained special schools and &pound;264 million for LA duties and support services.</p>
	<p pid="c.306W.9/4">In addition, between 1997-98 and 2003-04 the Government allocated a total of &pound;360 million through specific grants, to support SEN. The SEN element of the School Development Grant in 2004-05 was &pound;84 million (not ring-fenced, schools decide how they use SDG). Total SDG for 2005-06 is &pound;674 million. This will increase by 3.4 per cent. per pupil in 2006-07 and 3.7 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.0/2">The London Childcare Affordability Programme began in November 2005, with the aim of creating up to 10,000 affordable and flexible child care places. The Department has commissioned an independent evaluation, which began in February 2006 and will be completed in April 2009, to assess the effectiveness of the programme. Interim findings will be published at key points in the study and used to inform the development of policy on affordable child care both in London and more widely.</p>

	<p pid="c.311W.2/2">With effect from April 2006, funding has been channelled to local authorities through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) to fund educational provision for children aged up to 16 in all types of settings. This includes private, voluntary and independent settings delivering the free nursery education entitlement. The DSG provides the total funding to local authorities. It is then up to the local authority to decide how best to apply the total funding across different settings and age groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.311W.2/3">The level of funding provided to local authorities for under fives is determined by the number of full-time equivalent pupils in the authority, multiplied by the DSG &quot;guaranteed unit of funding&quot;. The number of full time equivalent pupils for under fives in PVI settings are calculated according to their age and the number of sessions they complete. The Department consulted widely on the Dedicated Schools Grant between February and May 2005, and on the method of its distribution over summer 2005. The Department will be reviewing various aspects of the funding arrangements over the conning months.</p>
	<p pid="c.311W.2/4">Local authorities are best placed to determine the most effective use of resources at local level and have discretion over the rate at which they fund settings for delivery of early years provision. However, the &quot;Code of Practice on the Provision of Free Nursery Education Places for Three and Four Year-Olds&quot;&mdash;a copy of which has been placed in the Library&mdash;strongly encourages local authorities to fund provision delivered in different sectors on an equal basis, taking into account local need and circumstances.</p>

The fees charged cannot exceed the cost to the Government of providing this service and we are committed to making charging fair, straightforward and based on income.

	<p pid="c.324W.5/2">The Government recognise that some patients have experienced long waits for genetic tests and this will have caused stress and anxiety. This is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/3">So, to improve access and cut waiting times, the genetics White Paper 'Our Inheritance, Our Future&mdash;realising the potential of genetics in the NHS', published in June 2003, committed up to &pound;18 million for national health service genetics laboratories in England. This major investment is boosting capacity and supporting modernisation in genetics laboratories, thus helping them meet the rising demand for genetics tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/4">To ensure that this investment resulted in real patient benefit, the White Paper set out new standards for genetic test turn around times, to be achieved by the end of 2006. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/5" class="indent">within three days where the result is needed urgently, for example for prenatal diagnosis;</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/6" class="indent">within two weeks where the potential genetic mutation is already known, for example, because another family member has already been tested; and</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/7" class="indent">within eight weeks for unknown mutations in a large gene.</p>
	<p pid="c.324W.5/8">This money was allocated during the last two financial years (2004 to 2006), and laboratories are working hard to get their new facilities up to speed to meet these standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.332W.9/1">National health service trusts are paid for the provision of care services commissioned from them by primary care trusts (PCTs). The great majority of funding allocated to PCTs is not hypothecated for specific purposes. Exceptionally, &pound;84 million was allocated for local implementation of the national programme for information technology (IT) in 2004-05, and a further &pound;84 million in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.332W.9/2">Each NHS organisation is expected to use its resources in a way that delivers the best possible care for patients and value for money. Spending on modern information technology is vital to getting the best out of NHS staff and equipment, and makes them more effective quicker than any other investment. The NHS already spends about &pound;1.2 billion each year on IT, and the Department has have always made it clear that it expects NHS trusts to follow the recommendations in the 2002 Wanless report to increase this over time. Monitoring progress towards achieving this is part of the Department's regular performance management arrangements for the NHS. It has therefore always been recognised that some national programme implementation costs, for example, on training and local hardware upgrades, will be borne locally over the programme's 10-year life.</p>

	<p pid="c.334W.2/1">Prime responsibility for implementing information technology support for social services lies with individual local authorities. However, with a view to delivering the aim of achieving appropriate integration of health and social care information systems in England by 2010 the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency has undertaken a number of national initiatives to support local action. These include the establishment in 2005 of the electronic social care record board (ESCRB). The board has responsibility for overseeing national implementation of the electronic: social care record and ensuring consistency of its implementation by local authorities with social services responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.2/2">The board engages with the work of the national health service national programme for information technology to enable sharing of information across traditional boundaries. The board is providing advice and guidance, and will establish national standards for the electronic exchange of information between health, education and social care agencies in support of implementation of the electronic social care record, whilst recognising the independence of local authorities. It will ensure appropriate links are made with NHS electronic patient records and children's electronic information systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.2/3">Under the auspices of the ESCRB, a study has been commissioned into the options for national implementation of the electronic single assessment process for older people. This is a prime example of shared activity between health and social care. Consultation has been undertaken with health, social care and supplier representatives, and a report is due later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.2/4">A variety of information systems and tools are now available to support this process. There have been successful local deployments of such systems by national programme suppliers notably in the programme's North East and Eastern clusters. They are subject to the same strict access controls as apply to national programme-delivered patient healthcare records, requiring the use by social workers of a smartcard with identification and a pass code, which can only be obtained upon verification of identity and through a formal user registration process. These systems have demonstrated the value of the technology and its potential to support the rapid development of integrated multi-agency working across all client groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.334W.2/5">In addition, allocations of the &pound;25 million capital expenditure grant recently paid to local authorities by the Department for improving information management made specific reference to the single assessment process in the expectation that the grant will be used to facilitate integration of social care information in the implementation of the NHS care records service.</p>

	<p pid="c.337W.9/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase>, the security forces used violence to break up a peaceful women's protest in Tehran. The protest called for an end to legal discrimination against women; for a woman's testimony in court to have equal value to that of a man; and for a woman to be able to choose her employment and where she travels without the prior permission of her husband. Police officers were deployed&mdash;some used batons and pepper sprays liberally. According to the Iranian judiciary, 42 women and 28 men were arrested. We understand all except one have now been released. We support the EU's plans to raise the violent actions against the women's protest with the Iranian authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.340W.5/1">Following the inauguration of Afghanistan's National Assembly in December 2005, both the lower and upper Houses of the National Assembly have begun work.</p>
	<p pid="c.340W.5/2">In March 2006, in line with the public administrative recommendations in the Afghanistan Compact, President Karzai has rationalised Government Ministries, of which two were abolished, and reshuffled his Cabinet. Newly appointed Cabinet Ministers appeared before Parliament to receive approval. This process, and the parliamentary vote, was broadcast live on television. In addition, the National Assembly has approved the financial year 2006-07 Budget and raised objections to some of the President's nominations for the Supreme Court. These are clear signs that the democratic mechanisms necessary to support governance and the rule of law are becoming more established in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="c.340W.5/3">Law enforcement capability and judicial reform capacity building have continued apace. The German-led Police Reform programme, assisted by the US, is continuing to develop the Afghan National Police (ANP) into a professional, credible and effective civil force. In June 2006, President Karzai acted upon the final recommendations of the Police Reform Commission in the second round of the police reform process, appointing 86 senior officials and streamlining the ANP's senior command. Counter-narcotics police interdiction operations continue with increased resources and personnel. The Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan and the Afghanistan Special Narcotics Force continue to cause disruption to the narcotics trade at a regional level. Working Groups, co-chaired by the Ministry of Justice and international donors, are making progress on law reform, institutional capacity and physical infrastructure, legal education and professional training, legal aid and access to justice, land reform, prisons and juvenile justice. Work continues on criminal and civil procedures, a new penal code, and family, company and anti-terrorism laws. Technical support to justice institutions has been revitalised with the UN Development Programme's &quot;Strengthening the Justice System of Afghanistan&quot; commencing in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.340W.5/4">Since the launch of the Afghanistan Compact in January 2006, work has continued on long-term reconstruction and development projects throughout Afghanistan. For example, sanitation and waste management programmes in Kabul and provincial cities are in progress. The Afghan Government's National Solidarity programme, supporting small-scale reconstruction and development activities, has now reached over 8.5 million Afghans with more than 4,500 projects completed (88 per cent. of these community projects involve infrastructure such as irrigation, rural roads, electrification and drinking water supply). The Afghanistan Compact sets out clear benchmarks on development issues against which the Joint Co-ordination and Monitoring Board will measure progress.</p>

Funds from the joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)/DFID/Ministry of Defence Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) have provided a further &pound;0.5 million to this project, which includes promotion of human rights, strengthening justice sector institutions, rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure and training and capacity building of justice sector personnel. The GCPP also recently provided $1 million to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission towards their overall core costs for financial year 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="c.341W.2/3">The FCO's Global Opportunities Fund (GOF) continues to support the promotion of human rights in Afghanistan.

	<p pid="c.342W.2/1">The UK is spending &pound;270 million over three years in support of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy&mdash;including, from 2006, some &pound;25-30 million per annum in Helmand province. Of the total &pound;270 million, approximately 50 per cent. will be channelled into efforts to strengthen and diversify legal rural livelihoods, and much of the remainder devoted to building capacity within the Afghan counter narcotics law enforcement and criminal justice agencies responsible for bringing traffickers to justice. However, UK resources will not, on their own, be sufficient to bring about a sustained reduction in the amount of land under poppy cultivation. As a partner nation for counter narcotics, the UK is therefore working hard to ensure that international assistance is targeted in line with the priorities set out in the National Drug Control Strategy. We have supported the establishment of a Counter Narcotics Trust Fund, to which a number of partners including the US and the EC are now contributing, for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.342W.2/2">Progress is being made: last year saw the conviction of over 150 drug traffickers, and a 21 per cent. reduction in the cultivation of opium poppy. However, sustainable drug elimination strategies take time, particularly when the challenges are as severe as they are in Afghanistan. After last year's decline, this year's cultivation figures are unlikely to decrease further as consolidated progress in areas where governance, security and access to livelihoods have improved is still being outpaced by increased planting in the more lawless south, including Helmand province. Our deployment to Helmand is part of the broader international support for the reconstruction effort, which is vital to the success of the Government of Afghanistan's counter narcotics campaign and to the sustained reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium poppy.</p>

	<p pid="c.342W.5/1">The Taliban and drug traffickers flourish in the same ungoverned space and they have a confluence of interest in ensuring that central Government is unable to extend its authority to their areas of operation. There is growing evidence of links. At the tactical level, there are some ad hoc links between the Taliban and traffickers where their specific interests coincide. Recently, there has been evidence that the Taliban are encouraging Afghan farmers to grow opium poppy and in the south, including Helmand, the Taliban have encouraged farmers to resist Government eradication efforts. It is unclear how much the Taliban use drug money to facilitate their operations. There are some signs of contacts at the strategic level. We continue to assess the links closely, particularly as the UK presence in the south consolidates. We support Afghan efforts to disrupt any linkages.</p>

	<p pid="c.343W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad. Without an effective control mechanism, a lot of opium will still be refined into heroin for illicit markets in the West and elsewhere. We could not accept this&quot;.</p>

We are also concerned about reports of forced recruitment of young men and teenagers from the refugee camps in Eastern Chad by Darfur rebels.</p>
	<p pid="c.349W.9/2">We continue to call on all sides to show restraint and on the Governments of Chad and Sudan to resolve their differences, fulfil their obligations under the Tripoli Agreement and restore calm to the region without the use of violence.</p>

	<p pid="c.350W.3/1">Since 2001, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has funded counter-narcotics (CN) training as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.350W.3/4"> <td></td> <td><i> Funding (&pound;)</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.350W.3/12">Afghanistan has been a high priority country for CN assistance since 2002. The UK law enforcement and criminal justice budget for 2006-07 is over &pound;20 million. Within Afghanistan, the UK, as key partner nation, has helped to establish the counter narcotics police of Afghanistan (CNPA)&mdash;the lead national drugs law enforcement agency, with its headquarters in Kabul and seven provincial offices&mdash;through training, mentoring and equipping the force. The UK also co-ordinates the mentoring of senior officers within the CNPA and has contributed &pound;1.5 million to the Afghan Law and Order Trust Fund which supports salaries and purchases of equipment for the CNPA. Additionally, the UK has assisted the establishment of a Counter Narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force, and is providing mentoring on prosecution and investigation. The UK is also helping to strengthen the borders of Afghanistan through contributions to border management assistance in Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.3/13">In Jamaica, the main focus of our training has been to ensure that Jamaican law enforcement agencies become more effective crime fighting forces and in particular are able to dismantle organised drug syndicates, by enhancing their investigation techniques and ability to gather intelligence and evidence. Training has also been provided to the coastguard on interdiction techniques and to deter illegal drug trafficking into and out of Jamaica, as well as customs training at airports.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.3/14">In Turkey, CN training is delivered through the UK/Turkey Prime Ministers' Action Plan, agreed at the UK/Turkey summit in May 2004. Our CN training assistance to Turkey concentrates on intelligence capability with a view to facilitating joint operational work with UK law enforcement to tackle trafficking in drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.3/15">In Iran, the UK supports operational engagement to tackle drug traffickers, providing technical advice to Iranian law enforcement agencies, in particular the anti narcotics police, on how Iran can further improve its performance on supply reduction. We are also helping to strengthen border management capability, and improve drug detection work, mainly through contributing to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Iran CN programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.3/16">In Pakistan, the UK is helping to improve Pakistan's CN capacity through law enforcement intelligence and interdiction capability training for the Anti Narcotics Force (the UK's key CN partner), including capacity building at sea and airports. We also assist judicial CN training to help to improve the criminal justice processes to bring drug traffickers to justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.3/17">In the Balkans, our aim is to help law enforcement agencies to be better equipped to fight drug traffickers and other organised crime groups at an international level through strengthened border controls, intelligence capability and drug detection training and equipment.</p>

	<p pid="c.356W.3/16" class="indent">With regard to planned expenditure on this route over the next 3 years, I can advise that it is expected that work will commence on the A5 between Ballygawley and Tullyvar (north of Aughnacloy) and Stage 3 of Strabane Bypass. We would also hope to spend over &pound;4m on the A5 on a mix of overtaking lanes and resurfacing schemes. At this stage it is not possible to predict future spend on a year by year basis, as this will depend on the availability of funding during any given year. In addition, the Tullyvar scheme is being improved and upgraded under the Roads Service's Public Private Partnership 2 Project and being delivered using a Design Build Finance and Operate contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.356W.3/17" class="indent">You also asked about any joint plans Roads Service and the Department for Transport in the Republic of Ireland have to upgrade the A5/N2 Derry to Dublin road. I should first of all advise that Roads Service has good working relations with both the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the Department for Transport in the Republic of Ireland, through the Cross Border Roads Steering Group meetings that are co-chaired by both Chief Executives. Through meetings of this group, information on the programmes of development of the cross border routes in both jurisdictions is shared and compatible strategies for improvement are agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.356W.3/18" class="indent">Roads Service's and the NRA's plans for major works at present include proposals to upgrade the existing single carriageway sections of the A5/N2 route between Derry and Ardee, through the construction of widened carriageway to &quot;2 + 1&quot; layouts and thus provide guaranteed overtaking opportunities and improve safety on the route. The relatively low traffic flows on the route do not merit the levels of investment needed to upgrade the route to dual carriageway standard when considered in the context of the need to also upgrade other key routes within the current budget levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.358W.3/1">There is no target ratio for dentists per head of population. The aim is to ensure an adequate level of dental provision both in terms of availability and accessibility. In Northern Ireland at November 2004 there were 43 general dental practitioners per 100,000 population. This compares to 37 general dental practitioners per 100,000 population in England, Scotland and Wales. Population figures for 2005 are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="c.358W.3/2">I am satisfied with the current level of dental provision both in terms of availability and accessibility. Nevertheless, I fully recognise that the General Dental Service, through which the vast majority of our primary dental care is delivered, is in need of reorganisation in order to continue to provide a quality service to patients, address the oral health needs of the population and provide a rewarding career for dental professionals.</p>

	<p pid="c.362W.5/1">The establishment of the five new health and social care trusts, as with the other Review of Public Administration proposals, is intended to result in net savings. The resources released will be used to further improve the provision of front line services to the people of Northern Ireland. It is not possible at this stage to calculate precisely the level of net savings because detailed management arrangements have yet to be determined. At this initial stage, however, it is anticipated that the new Trusts will be expected to save in the order of &pound;20 million per annum in administration costs. This will require a one off investment of approximately &pound;40 million, consisting largely of early leaving payments.</p>

	<p pid="c.364W.2/1">I shall shortly be consulting on a reform of sexual offences legislation and shall include a proposal to amend the law to give a statutory definition of 'capacity' in rape cases. This bears on the law on consent and can be an important aspect of a court's consideration of an allegation of rape. In addition the Public Prosecution Service has trained all its prosecutors in the use of 'special measure' provisions which are designed to assist victims and vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give best evidence. Further training is planned in relation to sexual offence cases. The sexual violence strategy currently being developed for consultation will also make an important contribution to the effectiveness of the immediate support available from the health authorities and the police to victims of rape and sexual assault.</p>

There will also be new regulations covering the post-contractual information given to consumers.</p>

	<p pid="c.372W.0/1">The UK has announced a clear timetable to reach 0.7 per cent. ODA/GNI by 2013. With the International Finance Facility (IFF), the UK would reach the equivalent of 0.7 per cent. ODA/GNI sooner. Depending on the size of its contribution to the IFF, the UK could reach the equivalent of the 0.7 per cent. target as early as 2008-09. However, a decision on the size and timing of a UK contribution will not be made until the launch of the IFF.</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.0/2">With the support off other OECD DAC countries, the IFF aims to provide up to $50 billion a year in development assistance between now and 2020 to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The IFF would issue bonds on the international capital markets, leveraging additional frontloaded resources on the basis of long-term pledges from donor governments.</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.0/3">The frontloading principles of the IFF are already being demonstrated in the pilot IFF for Immunisation (IFFIm), which has secured financial contributions from eight countries including the UK. The IFFIm will disburse $4 billion over the next 10 years to scale up efforts to tackle preventable diseases in the world's poorest countries. The World Health Organisation has estimated that these resources will save a total of 10 million lives, including 5 million children before 2015.</p>

	<p pid="c.378W.5/1">VAT is not chargeable on the construction of new dwellings or on any approved alterations to certain protected dwellings. Under European VAT agreements a reduced rate of VAT of not less than 5 per cent. is available for certain works of construction, renovation and alteration of housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.5/2">To date, the Government have been sparing in their use of reduced rates and only applied these where they offer the best targeted, most efficient support for our objectives. In the area of housing, this has included the application of reduced VAT rates for certain residential conversions, to support the creation of new homes through better use of the existing housing stock, and the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years, to help bring vacant homes back into use.</p>
