	<p pid="a.1381W.9/1">The Department for Transport does not hold central data on park and ride sites located in seaside towns. Local authorities are responsible for funding most park and ride schemes, mainly through the integrated transport block, which the Department allocates to support local transport plans (LTPs). The funding is for local authorities to invest in transport capital works, including park and ride, according to their local plans and priorities. It totals &pound;576 million for the 2008-09 period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.9/2">Local authorities also make appropriate assessment of the on-going viability of park and ride schemes. It would not be appropriate to initiate a specific nationwide audit of park and ride schemes on top of the other audit and reporting processes Government require from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.9/3">The Department does provide funding for major transport projects of over &pound;5 million. In 2008, one major scheme in a coastal town for which there was a park and ride element received &pound;16.2 million of Government funding. However only a small proportion of that amount would have been dedicated to the park and ride element.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.9/4">Park and ride schemes play an important part in helping to tackle congestion in many localities. They are one of a range of policy tools suggested by the full guidance on the second local transport plans (2006 to 2011), published in December 2004 and shortly due to be revised for the next planning round.</p>

	<p pid="a.1384W.10/1">The Northern Ireland Assembly recently passed legislation to reduce the number of councils in Northern Ireland from 26 to 11. This reduction is being implemented and it is planned that it will be in place by 2011. For this reason Parliament recently approved legislation to postpone the local elections previously scheduled for 2009 in Northern Ireland until 2011, so that the next local elections can be held under the new 11 council model.</p>

However, crime levels fluctuate in the short term, and it is too early to draw firm conclusions about longer term trends and the influence of individual factors on crime in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.3/2">Academic research, including a study by the Home Office, has demonstrated an association between changes in the economy and some crime. However, in looking at future crime, these studies cannot fully allow for the impact of policy or other interventions and hence do not predict actual levels of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.3/3">Since March 2003, overall property crime has fallen by 18 per cent., exceeding the 15 per cent. target set out in the Home Office's public service agreement. That reduction is greater than would have been forecast based on economic factors alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387W.3/4">The Government have long-standing, sound systems and flexible policies in place to deal with crime. These have led to significant reductions: overall crime, as measured by the British Crime Survey, has fallen by 39 per cent. since 1997. They also mean that we are well placed to prevent future rises in crime. As the Association of Chief Police Officers pointed out in January, the Police Service has never been in a better and stronger position to meet challenges caused by the economic downturn. The Department is confident that these policies and systems provide the flexibility needed to respond to future economic challenges.</p>

	<p pid="a.1388W.5/1">The number and proportion of recorded crimes detected in which a DNA match was available for 2008-09 to date is shown in table 1. Data on the number of crimes detected with a DNA match are collected on a quarterly, rather than a monthly, basis. The figures provided are for quarters 1 and 2 of 2008-09; the quarter 3 figures are not yet available. Table 1 also includes projected figures for the full year 2008-09 which are based on the figures for quarters 1 and 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388W.5/2">The figures for the number of crimes detected in which a DNA match was available only include crimes detected in which a DNA match was reported by the National DNA Database (NDNAD). They do not include DNA matches which arise through case work in serious crime, which usually involve comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory; this data is not collected centrally. It is also important to note that the detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388W.5/3">The presentation of crimes detected with DNA as a proportion of total recorded crime undervalues the relative contribution of DNA to the crime detection rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388W.5/4">It should be noted that the majority of recorded crimes do not have a crime scene (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.) and do not have a crime scene examination. In 2007-08, just over 854,000 crimes had a crime scene examination (17 per cent. of recorded crimes). In those crimes which have a crime scene examination, some do not yield any forensic material (DNA or fingerprints). In 2007-08, potential DNA material was collected at 102,400 crimes; and of these, 41,800 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD. Of the 41,800 crimes in which a crime scene sample profile was loaded, a match was generated in 37,375 crimes (this represents 89 per cent. of crimes where DNA material was loaded to the NDNAD).</p>
	<p pid="a.1388W.5/5">The proportion of 'crimes detected in which a DNA match was available', of those, 'crimes where potential DNA material was collected' is shown in table 2.</p>

	<p pid="a.1391W.2/2">Under the Disclosure of Death Registration Information (DDRI) scheme, the supply of death registration records to vetted organisations commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October 2008</phrase>. The scheme is administered by the General Register Office for England and Wales on behalf of the three Registrars General. Six organisations are currently in receipt of a weekly supply of death registration records, and further applications to receive the data are being processed. The information is being used to prevent and detect fraudulent applications for financial gain. Early results show that pension funds, banks and mortgage companies have been using this data to check against loan and credit card applications, insurance payouts and pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.2/3">Identity and Passport Service (IPS) has for some years matched death data against passport records and identified a number of fraudulently issued passports, as well as stopping fraudulent applications made using such identities. Close liaison with law enforcement agencies in taking action against those responsible would include consideration of wider criminality, including the impact on private enterprise, particularly the financial sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1404W.0/2">There is a general requirement in building regulations, and more generally other public health legislation, that drains should be constructed in such a way as to minimise the risk of blockage. Grease from hot food premises is acknowledged as a significant cause of drain blockages. Drainage is dealt with in part H of the Building Regulations and when the guidance was comprehensively revised in 2002 additional guidance was added about the provision of grease control measures to hot food premises. Where drains malfunction, building legislation provides local authorise with enforcement powers to ensure that the problem is remedied.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.0/3">In order to test the effectiveness of the above measure my department was party to a joint research project with the water industry. The outcome of this research has enabled water companies and local authorities to be more confident in their enforcement measures and has enabled some pilot projects to deal with some particularly troublesome cases and bring them to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1407W.7/2">In 2007 the World Health Organisation (WHO) published estimates, on behalf of all UN agencies, of the incidence of unsafe abortion and associated deaths for the year 2003.

	<p pid="a.1407W.7/4">Given the clandestine nature of abortion in many settings and the difficulties in collecting data, it is likely that the true levels of unsafe abortion and related mortality are higher than estimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1407W.7/5">Worldwide an estimated 19-20 million unsafe abortions are estimated to occur each year. Millions of women and girls suffer complications following unsafe abortion and around 67,000 die as a result of these complications. Most of these abortions, complications and deaths could be prevented if people who wished to had access to family planning and if abortion services had been legally available and affordable everywhere. Progress to achieve Millennium Development Goal number five, Improve Maternal Health, cannot be made unless we are prepared to do something to reduce the death and disability caused by unsafe abortion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1411W.5/3">The UK government's policy on population and sexual and reproductive health in the developing world is about providing choice, not coercion. Couples and individuals should be able to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children, and have access to the information and services to be able to do so. DFID actively works to promote and uphold the principals of free and informed choice as set out in at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994.</p>

	<p pid="a.1420W.5/4">Personal data obtained by relevant persons as a result of checks made under the Regulations is subject to the Data Protection Act, which places a number of requirements on those persons to safeguard that data.

To provide help to pensioners on the lowest incomes, the 2008 pre-Budget report announced an above indexation increase to the standard minimum income guarantee in pension credit in April 2009. This means no single pensioner need live on less than &pound;130.00 a week in 2009-10 and no pensioner couple on less than &pound;198.45.</p>

To provide additional support sooner, an additional one-off payment of &pound;60 for each pensioner is being made, equivalent to bringing forward the uprating of the basic state pension from April to January. To support those pensioners who pay income tax, the age-related tax allowances will rise in April 2009 to &pound;9,490 for people aged 65 to 74 and to &pound;9,640 for people aged over 75.</p>
	<p pid="a.1422W.5/3">This support is in addition to other measures taken by the Government to assist pensioners, including the introduction of winter fuel payments, free eye tests and local off-peak bus travel, and free TV licences for households with someone aged over 75. The Chancellor keeps all tax and benefit rates under review as part of the Budget process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1425W.2/1">The Government recognise the difficulties that many individuals as well as businesses are having in obtaining credit at the moment. The Government are particularly concerned about access to credit for low income families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.2/2">The Government have implemented a number of measures to support low income families during these difficult times. We are investing &pound;80 million in the Growth Fund to support the expansion of affordable credit alternatives through credit unions. The Growth Fund is tackling financial exclusion in England, Scotland and Wales and has already supported more than 130,000 loans to financially excluded people, worth over &pound;56 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.2/3">We have also acted decisively and without delay taking action to stamp out unfair treatment of borrowers to ensure access to credit for all is maintained throughout the downturn. Following the credit card summit in November 2008 we secured agreement from credit card lenders to develop fair principles for any interest rate increase they introduce on reviewing an individual's risk profile. These came into force in January 2009 and provide extra protections when a customer or group of customers' interest rate is changed as a result of a perceived change in their ability to repay their debts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.2/4">Where a lender increases their rates customers will be given the option to close down their account and repay their remaining balance at the existing rate of interest. Lenders also agreed not to increase rates for customers who have failed to make two or more consecutive minimum payments, where an agreed repayment plan is in place for the account, or where lenders have been notified by a not-for-profit debt advice agency that the customer is in serious discussion with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.2/5">Credit card lenders will also give a breathing space of up to 60 days to borrowers in difficulty. During this time lenders will not commence debt collection proceedings, giving borrowers time to agree a repayment plan with the help of a not-for-profit debt advice agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.2/6">I have established the Consumer Finance Forum to allow the Government a platform to continue to monitor the credit market closely throughout the downturn. The forum will regularly bring together representatives from the financial services industry, consumer groups and Government to address issues facing borrowers during the downturn.</p>

These discussions have included the costs incurred by business. A full Regulatory Impact Assessment was published alongside the UK WEEE Regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1427W.2/2">Under the UK WEEE Regulations all producers of Electrical and Electronic Equipment have an obligation to register with a Producer Compliance Scheme (PCS) to discharge their obligation. 4,348 producers were registered with PCSs for the 2007 compliance period. This has risen to 5,190 for the 2008 compliance period. All PCSs met their obligations on behalf of their producer members for the 2007 compliance period. No fines have been imposed for failure to comply.</p>

	<p pid="a.1430W.9/1">The underlying principle is that costs incurred by nations deploying their forces on NATO-led operations are borne individually by Allies. The net additional cost to the UK of operations in Afghanistan in 2007-08 (i.e. expenditure above that which would have been incurred anyway, such as salaries) was &pound;1,504 million. Other nations' contributions to multinational operations are a matter for them.</p>

The body of medical opinion confirms that hearing loss caused by excessive noise does not increase once exposure to the source of the noise ceases. Any subsequent hearing loss cannot therefore be due to service.</p>

An Annual Review, which covers all aspects of the scheme, including fund performance, forms part of this advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1446W.6/2">In its 2006-07 review report, Hewitt confirmed that Standard Life and Scottish Widows remained suitable AVC providers but raised concerns about the suitability of the With-Profits funds for CSAVCS investors.

Cabinet Office also wrote to existing investors in With Profits, giving these members the choice of transferring to another fund or leaving their accumulated fund in With-Profits and continuing to make contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1457W.3/22">&pound;1.5 million was used to support the 'You're Welcome programme', to make health services more young-people friendly, particularly contraceptive services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/23">&pound;0.5 million was used to set up the 'Healthy Further Education Programme', which will put in place a framework to improve the contribution of colleges to health and well-being, with priority this year for sexual health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/24">&pound;0.5 million was used to support more schools to gain 'Healthy School Status', including satisfying the criteria for delivering good quality Sex and Relationship Education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/25">None of the &pound;26.8 million additional contraceptive funding was reallocated from any other budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/26">England's under-18 conception rate is 41.7 per 1,000 and has fallen by 10.7 per cent, since the launch of the teenage pregnancy strategy. The under-16 rate is 8.3 per 1,000 and has fallen by 6.4 per cent, over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/27">Statistics published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February 2009</phrase> by the Office of National Statistics show that in 2007 the under-18 conception rate rose by 2.6 per cent. Despite the rise in national figures in 2007 the long-term trend is still downward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/28">The success of the teenage pregnancy strategy relies on all local areas applying it effectively. However, there is still significant variation at a local level, with some areas achieving reductions of over 30 per cent. whereas in other areas, rates have increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/29">We have identified a range of factors that are in place in the areas where they have made most progress, which are either absent or being delivered less intensively in areas performing less well. These are highlighted in the document Teenage Pregnancy Next steps - guidance for Local Authorities and Primary Care trusts on effective delivery of local strategies a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.3/30">We have asked all local areas to ensure that they take account of these key ingredients and to update their local strategies as necessary. In addition, the NHS was reminded of the importance of provision of the full range of contraception to reduce teenage pregnancy in the NHS Operating Framework for 2009-10. An additional &pound;20.5 million has been allocated for 2009-10 to support this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1460W.2/1">Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former General Dental Service (GDS) arrangements. These were demand led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health service work they chose to undertake.</p>

The primary dental service funding allocations made to West Hertfordshire PCT for each of the three years since PCTs assumed full responsibility for primary dental care services are in the following table. These are net of income from dental charges paid by patients, which are retained locally to supplement the resources available for dentistry. Actual expenditure levels are determined by the pattern and type of services commissioned by each PCT. PCTs may also dedicate some of their other NHS resources to dentistry if they consider this an appropriate local priority. Allocations are not apportioned by individual constituencies or towns; PCTs determine the distribution of resources within their area on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1463W.2/1">Foetal anticonvulsant syndrome describes a group of disorders in which birth defects and developmental disorders occur in association with a characteristic facial appearance in children whose mothers took antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Information on the total number of individuals diagnosed in the United Kingdom with foetal anticonvulsant syndrome is not available, however epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of birth defects in babies born to mothers receiving antiepileptic medicines is approximately two to three times higher than the background rate in the general population.</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.2/2">The UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register was established in 1996 in order to gather further information on the outcomes of pregnancies in women receiving antiepileptic medicines. All pregnant women taking antiepileptic medicines are encouraged to notify their pregnancy or allow their clinician to notify their pregnancy to this register. Findings from this register were published in 2005 and suggested that almost 96 per cent. of live-births born to women with epilepsy did not have a major birth defect. It also confirmed that the likelihood of a baby being born with a birth defect is increased if the woman is taking more than one antiepileptic medicine (polytherapy).</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.2/3">The best established risk of abnormalities is associated with sodium valproate. An increased incidence of birth defects (including head and face deformities, deformities of the bones, malformations of the arms and legs and defects of the spinal cord and spine such as spina bidifia) has been shown in children born to mothers who took sodium valproate during pregnancy. For sodium valproate taken as monotherapy, the report from the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register suggests that approximately five babies are born with a major birth defect for every 100 women taking this drug. This risk increases to approximately nine in 100 at higher doses (over 1,000 mg per day).</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.2/4">The authorised product information on sodium valproate for prescribers and the patient information leaflet contain clear advice about its safety of use during pregnancy. This includes information about the potential for birth defects and recommends that any woman taking sodium valproate who is likely to become pregnant should receive specialist advice on these risks. There is also a recommendation that if taken during pregnancy sodium valproate should be used as monotherapy at the lowest effect dose. Folic acid supplementation prior to pregnancy is also recommended as this may reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida.</p>
	<p pid="a.1463W.2/5">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has published a clinical guideline covering the diagnosis, treatment and management of epilepsies in adults and children. This clinical guideline specifically covers the treatment and management of epilepsy in pregnancy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1465W.2/1">There were 191 responses to the consultation on &quot;Reform of health and social care complaints: Proposed changes to the legislative framework&quot;. Prior to this the Department ran a consultation on the policy and principles of the new approach to complaints handling in the national health service and social care in 2007, entitled &quot;Making experiences count: a new approach to responding to complaints&quot;. There were 376 written responses to this earlier consultation, the majority of which were positive and supportive of the new approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/2">Under the new approach as provided for in the forthcoming legislative framework the Local Authority Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009 laid before Parliament on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-27">27 February</phrase> and coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, every local authority, NHS body, and primary care provider must designate a complaints manager to be responsible for managing the procedures for handling and considering complaints in accordance with the complaints regulations. Front line staff who provide the complainant's care may be required to contribute to investigations of complaints and provide explanations or reports as necessary, but not to take responsibility for managing complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/3">Under the new system, complainants will retain the same rights as now to take their complaints either to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman for NHS complaints, or to the local government ombudsman for social care complaints for independent investigation, where they are dissatisfied with the response they have received from the local organisation. In addition the flexibility of the new system allows for local independent investigation of complaints where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/4">In social care this will give adult social care complaints managers greater freedom to determine whether their handling will contain a single response, or stages, and at what point senior managers will become involved in considering the complaint. They will also decide whether and how independent consideration of the complaint will be addressed (i.e. whether there will be investigating officers conducting an investigation, and whether these will be independent of the organisation, and also whether there will be independent advocacy).</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/5">The procedures for complaints about social care for children are remaining separate and unchanged under the Children Act 1989, and complainants will continue to receive a three stage procedure. This features an automatic right to advocacy for any young person, independent consideration of all stage 2 complaints through an independent person, and also a review panel (with a minimum of two independent people on it) for all stage 3 complaints. The director of children's services will normally become involved with complaints that reach stage 3 (though s/he will be briefed on complaints in general and all significant cases by the complaints manager).</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/6">Under the Children Act, the complaints manager must be a direct employee of the local authority; this is no longer a feature of the reforms for adult services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/7">The new system for the NHS and adult social care will require chief executives of local authorities and NHS bodies to be responsible for ensuring compliance with the new arrangements and in particular ensuring that action is taken if necessary in the light of the outcome of a complaint. It is envisaged that in local authorities chief executives may delegate this role to directors of adult social services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1474W.11/1">Patients have a right to clean safe care and the national health service is working hard to ensure that hospitals are clean and safe for patients. The results of the most recent Healthcare Commission in-patient survey reflect this hard work with the NHS achieving its highest ever cleanliness rating.</p>
	<p pid="a.1474W.11/2">During the two years in question, the Department took a number of key steps to improve hospital cleanliness including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1474W.11/3" class="indent">the provision of &pound;62.6 million funding for a deep clean of all hospitals in 2007-08;</p>

	<p pid="a.1475W.2/1">The NHS IT programme is delivering front-line systems and services that are providing major benefits for national health service organisations in England, staff and patients, enabling significant changes in the way the NHS operates, and delivering major system reform. All acute trusts have at least one system which has been delivered through the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1475W.2/2">As at the end of February 2009, a total of 146 patient administration systems had been deployed as part: of the programme to 45 acute, 24 mental health and 77 primary care trusts. Information on which of the organisations concerned include a hospital site, and which may have more than one hospital site, is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1475W.2/3">It is not possible to provide comprehensive details of the future number, location and sequencing of future deployments. This is because meeting the needs and priorities of individual trusts that are maintaining normal business operations requires flexibility in deployment planning, and inevitably means that plans will always be subject to potential change. Detailed implementation planning became the responsibility of individual trusts and the chief executives of strategic health authorities from April 2007. Taking the country as a whole, however, as reported in the National Audit Office <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</phrase> report on the programme, it is likely to be 2014-15 before all trusts have fully-deployed care records systems, though some should receive the final releases of the software in late 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.1476W.5/1">The cancer reform strategy, published in December 2007, sets out guidance to the local national health service on how to improve cancer prevention, speed up the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, reduce inequalities, improve the experience of people living with and beyond cancer, ensure care is delivered in the most appropriate settings and ensure patients can access effective new treatments quickly. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to use the funds made available to them and work in partnership with strategic health authorities, local services, cancer networks and other local stakeholders to deliver these aims. Information on the work being done in the north-west can be obtained from the individual PCTs directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.5/2">Through the cancer reform strategy's national awareness and early diagnosis initiative, the Department, in partnership with Cancer Research UK, is co-ordinating a programme to support local interventions to increase cancer symptom awareness, and encourage people to seek help early.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.5/3">'High Quality Care for All', the final report of the NHS next stage review, said that every PCT will commission comprehensive wellbeing and prevention services, in partnership with local authorities, with personalised services offered to meet the specific needs of their local populations. It stated that efforts must be focused on a number of key goals, including reducing smoking rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.5/4">Reducing smoking among young people is a priority for the Government. Much has already been achieved in this area, including raising the age of sale of tobacco products and legislation to strengthen sanctions available against retailers who persistently sell tobacco to children and young people. Smoking is also addressed in the national curriculum and through the healthy schools programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.5/5">Protecting children and young people from smoking was one of four key aspects of the Department's consultation on the future of tobacco control published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-31">31 May 2008</phrase>. Responses to the consultation are informing the development of a new strategy on tobacco control, which will include action to continue to tackle the uptake of smoking by young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.5/6">The Government this year are taking forward tobacco control legislation intended to protect and support young people in the Health Bill. The Health Bill includes a prohibition on the display of tobacco products, which will help to eliminate the marketing of tobacco products, to which young people are susceptible. The Bill will also provide powers to restrict or ban the sale of tobacco from vending machines, removing a major source of tobacco for young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.5/7">Local stop smoking services are able to provide a range of support options to anyone wanting to quit smoking, including young people. Resources are also available that can be accessed by smokers direct on smoking cessation, these include the national health service 'gosmokefree' website and from the general NHS smoking helpline (0800 169 0169).</p>

	<p pid="a.1486W.0/2">The cost of production of the strategy and the commissioning document, including VAT, totalled &pound;82,879. The cost of packing, handling and posting hard copies of the documents, including VAT, totalled &pound;2,708.91.</p>
	<p pid="a.1486W.0/3">&quot;Healthy lives, brighter futures&quot; built on a large body of existing research and no new research was commissioned specifically for the strategy. The Secretaries of State for Health and Children, Schools and Families were involved at key stages in the development of the strategy. Both Secretaries of State hosted a deliberative event for parents and teenagers in June 2008, and further deliberative events were held with other groups, including child health professionals and parents of children with complex health needs. The cost of these events totalled &pound;125,120.07, including VAT. Other work to develop the strategy was carried out by officials from the Department of Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families and through a range of meetings with stakeholders. Costs for this work cannot be identified separately.</p>

	<p pid="a.1490W.3/24">The Government are committed to rebuilding apprenticeships. Since 1997 we have witnessed a renaissance in apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007/08. Completion rates are also at a record high with 64 per cent. successfully completing an apprenticeship&mdash;up from 37 per cent. in 2004/05. A remarkable achievement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1497W.2/1">Overpayments can be identified for a variety of reasons following an audit of an institution's records. There is then a process of mitigation to determine the extent of any repayment. In addition there are ongoing adjustments to grant throughout the year to reflect student recruitment against indicative plans. As a result the information requested is not readily available. It is held across a disparate set of paper and electronic records and would take a considerable amount of time and resource to assemble. This information is therefore available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1502W.2/1">'Year end' non-consolidated performance payments are paid to high performing members of the senior civil service (SCS) to reflect their individual contribution during the previous performance year. In the 2008-09 financial year &pound;1,648,000 was paid to SCS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/2">Within the Ministry of Justice there are different methods of reward for former DCA staff and staff in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/3">Payment of non-consolidated pay to former DCA staff below the SCS level may be either 'year end' or 'in year' performance payments. 'Year end' performance payments are paid only to staff who achieve the highest possible performance marking for the previous reporting year, which runs from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March</phrase>. The amount of 'year end' payments made in August 2008 to staff in the former DCA was &pound;2,011,200.</p>

	<p pid="a.1502W.2/7">NOMS operate a performance management system which provides for 'year end' performance payments and recognises outstanding performance with 'in year' payments. It is not possible to give a figure for the total paid in performance payments for the current financial year i.e. 2008-09. However, such payments cannot exceed 0.5 per cent. of the paybill in any unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/8">Performance payments are funded within existing paybill controls, have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets, and, as such, do not add to future paybill costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.2/9">Performance payments, which are non-consolidated and non-pensionable, are paid to high performing individuals as part of the Department's reward strategy. Such payments are a cost-effective means of encouraging and rewarding high performance and drives continuous improvement throughout the organisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1508W.0/3">The Courts Act 2003 introduced a series of measures aimed at improving fine collection. These included making it mandatory that a Deduction from Benefits Order or an Attachment of Earnings Order be the first form of enforcement to be applied following default or history of default. It introduced clamping of vehicles, fines payment work (currently being piloted), fine increases and the registration of financial credit (which may affect their ability to obtain credit). Other enforcement tools include warrants of execution, delivery and/or possession (where a bailiff may seize goods, money and land to the value of the debt). Imprisonment is the ultimate sanction for the non-payment for financial penalties, where the court has exhausted all other enforcement options.</p>

	<p pid="a.1508W.9/1">The National Offender Management Service delivers a broad range of interventions to address the particular risks and needs of offenders. There are a number of accredited offending behaviour programmes which address violence including thinking skills, anger management, domestic and other types of violent crime as well as sexual offending. A range of interventions is available for prisoners with an alcohol problem. Other regime activities such as training, education, work, non accredited courses and resettlement also have a significant part to play in reducing risk and preparing a prisoner for release. This work is delivered as part of prison baseline funding and it is not possible to disaggregate accurately the costs. NOMS is currently undertaking a specifications, benchmarking and costings exercise which will provide costings of the interventions delivered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1514W.0/1">Statistics on persistent young offenders (PYOs) are only available for those offenders that are arrested and then found guilty.

	<p pid="a.1514W.0/2">The PYO figures are designed to measure the speed and efficiency of the youth justice system; through monitoring the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days. They are not designed to measure overall trends in youth crime, and will give a misleading picture of the true trend if used for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1514W.0/3">The table following on this response shows the number of PYOs dealt with in England and Wales. London and for the London borough of Bexley. The counts of this type of offender are split by court jurisdictions for England and Wales and the London area. The figures for Bexley are very small and therefore subject to year-on-year volatility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1514W.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>. the Secretary of State for Justice announced in a written ministerial statement that the PYO pledge would be dropped with effect from the end of 2008.

	<p pid="a.1516W.3/1">A carbon accounting system is required to determine compliance with the carbon budgets and targets in the Climate Change Act 2008. It will set out the detailed rules for calculating the &quot;net UK carbon account&quot;, which must not exceed the budget at the end of each budget period. This will include determining which types of carbon units can count towards the account, the circumstances when carbon units can be credited to and debited from it, and the system that will keep track of the units.</p>

These recognise the benefits in carbon reduction from the use of biomass, such as wood pellets, over fossil fuels such as coal or fuel oil, but that in some cases, this would result in increased emissions of air pollutants. The consultation document sets out ways the Government are seeking to facilitate uptake of biomass heat without compromising air quality or public health. A final strategy is due to be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1522W.5/1">The current global economic climate is one of a number of factors determining investment in renewable energy projects. The Government are working to create the right conditions for rapid deployment of renewable energy&mdash;both to meet challenging climate change goals and maintain energy security.</p>
	<p pid="a.1522W.5/2">The global recession will affect availability and cost of capital to all firms, not just renewables. For the most part vertically integrated companies are well placed to manage their own capital requirements. Smaller companies may find it harder to raise capital but Government are providing a range of financial help in addition to the main financial support provided through the renewables obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1522W.5/3">We also have a range of measures already in place to bring on more renewables development, including onshore and offshore wind, in order to meet our targets. Our Renewable Energy Strategy, due to be finalised in spring 2009, will build on these to provide an attractive framework for investment. Furthermore, the Secretary of State announced in the pre-Budget report that we would be extending the renewables obligation (RO) until 2037. This will ensure that investors can plan with confidence for the future so that over the next decade the market will continue to deliver the renewables projects that we need to achieve our 2020 target.</p>
	<p pid="a.1522W.5/4">We take very seriously the concerns that some developers have raised regarding renewable energy developments in the current economic climate. We are maintaining a close dialogue with developers and stand ready to consider any evidence they bring to our attention.</p>

	<p pid="a.1522W.11/1">To date there have been no assessments of the effects of National Policy Statements (NPSs) on Marine Scotland nor have there been discussions with Scottish Executive Ministers on NPSs as they are at early stage of drafting. However, there will be public consultation on my Department's NPSs later in 2009 and my Department will want to engage with the Scottish Executive on them before then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1522W.11/2">With the exception of certain oil and gas pipelines that cross into Scotland, the IPC will only have powers to determine applications for nationally significant energy infrastructure projects in England and Wales and the territorial sea adjacent to England and Wales and the Renewable Energy Zone (except those parts where Scottish Ministers have functions), where a relevant NPS is in place. Therefore, the NPSs only directly apply to decisions for new infrastructure in those areas. However, energy policy is generally a reserved matter and the Scottish Executive must have regard to policy statements on energy as a relevant consideration in decisions. NPSs are, for these purposes, a statement of Government policy, so we expect that NPSs will be a relevant consideration for decisions by Scottish Ministers on energy infrastructure in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1525W.0/1">I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to his question today 259459 regarding the number of wind farms expected to begin construction in the next five years. It is not possible to provide a precise figure for the number of turbines as this will vary by site according to factors such as location and wind speed. In addition, larger turbines are being developed, meaning fewer turbines may be needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.0/2">However, taking an average turbine size of 3 megawatts (MW) it is possible to estimate the number of turbines which may be built for projects awaiting construction and those presently in the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.0/3">For example, there are currently 7855.1 MWe of onshore and offshore wind developments awaiting construction. This would be equivalent to 2618 3MW turbines. For those in planning, 7261.7 MWe of onshore and offshore wind would be equivalent to 2420 3MW turbines. However, not all of these projects may receive consent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1530W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-09">9 February 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking when the additional &pound;3 million funding for the Jobcentre Plus Rapid Response Service will come into effect; how many additional staff will be employed by the Rapid Response Service as a result of the additional funding; and how the additional &pound;3 million of funding will be allocated. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/5" class="indent">An additional &pound;3 million is available for the Rapid Response Service (RRS) in the 2008/09 financial year to support the expansion of the service. A further &pound;6 million is also available for the next financial year, 2009/10. In total therefore there is now &pound;6 million available for RRS in 2008/09 and &pound;12 million in 2009/10.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/6" class="indent">The additional funds for 2008/09 are available already. This funding is to provide direct support to individuals facing redundancy rather than for extra Jobcentre Plus staffing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/7" class="indent">I should set the position in its full context. We typically deliver our Rapid Response Service in partnership with other local agencies&mdash;for example local authorities, the Learning and Skills Council in England and others. It is very common for these partnerships to be able to provide the support and services individuals need from within their existing resources&mdash;for example, local Jobcentre Plus staff would make initial workplace presentations, existing publicly funded training opportunities would be made available to people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/8" class="indent">In that context, our Rapid Response Service funding is designed to ensure that we are able to deliver support which individuals need in a specific situation, but which cannot be sourced from partners' existing programmes and operations. Examples of the uses of RRS funding include providing individuals with a Skills Transfer Analysis, enabling individuals to undertake job-related training that is not available through partners' existing programmes and supporting individuals to be able to take up a new job, for example with initial travel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/9" class="indent">I should add that each Jobcentre Plus district has appointed a Rapid Response Manager to co-ordinate RRS support. Those posts have however been funded from the resources for extra staff announced for Jobcentre Plus in the Pre-Budget Report rather than from the additional funds for RRS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530W.5/10" class="indent">We have allocated the additional RRS funding equally between each English region, Scotland, and Wales. A similar amount is held centrally in a contingency fund for those who need to call on any extra funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1533W.6/2">For people going to live or already living in another European economic area (EEA) state or Switzerland, their claims must be considered under the provisions of the sickness benefit chapter of the European Regulation 1408/71. For these customers, the ordinary residence and presence conditions, which apply domestically, are not applied. Other domestic conditions of entitlement, such as the disability conditions and the past presence test, still apply. The latter test, under domestic legislation, requires a customer to be present in Great Britain for not less than 26 out of the last 52 weeks and it applies for every day that a customer claims benefit. However, for people going to live or already living in another EEA state or Switzerland, the test has been modified: for customers taking the benefit away with them, it is last applied on the date of 'export' and for customers claiming from another EEA state or Switzerland it is applied only once, on the date on which entitlement to benefit can be established.</p>

This includes, but is not restricted to, house builders and developers and their supply chain partners. The dialogue is maintained largely through regular meetings with both individual representatives and representative bodies, such as the Home Builders Federation, as well as participation in round-tables, seminars and other fora. The downturn in house building levels has featured regularly in these discussions, as have many other issues facing the industry. The Government have been keen to explore ways to ensure that the effects of the downturn on house building output can be mitigated, so that vital new homes continue to be constructed, jobs and skills can be protected, and so that everything possible is in place to assist a rapid recovery in the market.</p>

	<p pid="a.1556W.8/2">&quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; (2006) sets out clearly that a child for the purposes of the Children Acts 1989 and 2004 respectively is anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday. It also stresses that the fact that a child has reached 16 years of age does not change his or her entitlement to services or protection under the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556W.8/3">In recognition of the fact that a significant number of young people who are the subject of a child protection plan or otherwise known to children's services may have or are being neglected, the Department of Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families has commissioned York university undertake a study on the neglect of adolescents. This includes a review of the literature on the neglect of adolescents and the preparation of evidence-based materials to improve practice in this important area. The work will be published in the spring and disseminated widely within children's services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1560W.11/1">We allocate revenue funding to local authorities via the Dedicated Schools Grant. The allocation to each local authority recognises through proxy indicators the needs of pupils in the authority but is provided for all defined responsibilities of local authorities and schools. It is not possible to specifically identify a sum for learning disabilities. The local authority will then apply its local funding formula, which will have been developed in consultation with the Schools Forum, to allocate funding to the schools in their area and to ensure that their formula takes account of the individual needs and pressures of their schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.11/2">Schools have a duty under section 317 of the Education Act 1996 to use their best endeavours to make the necessary provision for pupils with SEN. In May 2008, an interactive website was published on the Audit Commission website, which helps schools determine if their spending on children with special educational needs is offering value for money and making real improvements to outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1564W.5/1">Nutrient-based standards have been mandatory in primary schools since September 2008 and come into effect in secondary and special schools from September 2009. The School Food Trust has undertaken pilots in both primary and secondary schools to assess the practical steps schools and catering organisations would need to take in order to implement the standards. Both sets of pilots, found that while implementing the nutrient-based standards, does require schools to change those menus that are not compliant, the standards are nevertheless achievable and essential to improving the nutritional health of children. The lessons learned from both the primary and secondary pilots have been published in the trust's guidance on introducing nutrient-based standards which includes case studies at primary and secondary level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1570W.2/1">By the end of 2008-09 academic year I fully expect that we will have reduced the funding gap between schools and colleges to around 5.6 per cent. This is in line with our commitment made in 2004-05 to reduce the gap by 8 percentage points. We will continue to close the gap further as funding allows but our priority is to maximise participation in learning by young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/2">The LSC have the detailed information required to calculate what the cost would be to close the funding gap between 16-18 pupils in school sixth forms and sixth form colleges/FE colleges. Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member setting out that in the current year the estimated cost of closing the gap would have been more than &pound;135m. A copy of his letter will be placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Hayson, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-23">23 February 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/4" class="indent">Further to your question to the SOS for Children, Schools and Families and the reply by Jim Knight, Minister for Schools, I am supplying the additional information referred to in his answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/5" class="indent">In his response Mr Knight mentioned that the gap in funding currently stands at 5.6%. Our funding system which came into effect for 2008/09 uses standard funding rates per standard learner number (SLN, a measure of the number of learners and the breadth of their learning). The base rates per SLN in 2008/09 are &pound;2,945 for school sixth forms and &pound;2,860 for FE college learners (including Sixth Form Colleges).</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/6" class="indent">As this is a new system there are no equivalent figures for 2007/08 but one may use the difference between the two base rates (&pound;85) as a proxy for the difference in funding in 2007/08, as the rates have both increased by the 'minimum funding guarantee' of 2.1%. We estimate that the number of SLNs in FE in 2007/08 was 1,002,322. Therefore the cost of bringing up the base funding rate per learner in all colleges would be approximately &pound;85 million. In addition, schools receive a further &pound;50 million towards pension payments for teachers. There are also a number of other factors influencing the funding differences between school sixth forms and FE, which are explored in more detail in a report undertaken for the LSC by KPMG, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-06">6 May 2008</phrase>. This is available on the LSC's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1570W.2/8" class="indent">We are continuing to work with DCSF and schools and colleges to review this funding difference and to look at ways of equalising funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/9" class="indent">I hope you find this information useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1571W.0/2"><i> </i><i> (a)</i> It is not possible to separate out the cost of conducting an educational assessment on a child or young person in juvenile custody from other delivery as the cost is incorporated into the hourly rate paid to staff working in juvenile custodial establishments. As custodial establishments vary in size, the larger ones will carry out proportionately more assessments and will therefore benefit from economies of scale in price negotiations within awarding bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1571W.0/3"><i> </i><i> (b)</i> Local authorities are currently not responsible for assessing the educational needs of young people in young offender institutions because local authorities do not currently have responsibility for providing education and training for young people in juvenile custody. The current Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill proposes legislation to change this to make local authorities responsible for securing education and training for persons in juvenile custody.</p>

The recommendation from the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA)&mdash;the national governing body for the sport&mdash;is that ideally school swimming is taught by instructors with ASA/UK Coaching Certificate Level 2, and that they should be supported by a class teacher, who has undertaken at least Module One of the ASA National Curriculum Training Programme.

	<p pid="a.1574W.2/2">The revenue grant totals for 2006-07 onwards are not comparable with figures in 2005-06, because the introduction of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded for education services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574W.2/3">Before 2006-07 local authorities were funded through education formula spending (EFS). This formed part of the annual local government finance settlement. EFS comprised school functions and local education authority (LEA) central functions, whereas DSG only covers the school functions. The DSG is based on each local authority's spend on schools in 2005-06, up rated each year for cost pressures and adjusted for changes in pupil numbers. LEA central functions are still funded through the local government finance settlement but cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. For information the EFS figure for Westminster in 2005-06 was &pound;97.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1575W.3/1">In 2009 the average unit cost of a UK member of staff based in Kabul is estimated to be &pound;270,000 and the average unit cost of a UK member of staff based in Helmand is estimated to be &pound;460,000. This constitutes salaries, allowances, administrative costs, accommodation, running costs and security, with the latter constituting the largest proportion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575W.3/2">The additional cost of deploying a member of staff to Helmand mainly relates to providing security for civilian staff to relieve this burden from the military, and covering a fair share of costs in the use of military assets for transport.</p>

We have provided $35 million (around &pound;19 million) to the World Bank-led seven year multi-country demobilisation and reintegration programme (MDRP). The MDRP has invested more than $200 million in the first phase of demobilisation and reintegration in the DRC. The UK Government has also recently granted an additional &pound;1 million to the World Bank emergency trust fund focusing on reintegration of combatants, including children associated with armed forces, in Eastern Congo, and an additional $450,000 to the UN mission in DRC (MONUC) to support the repatriation of Rwandese combatants to their country of origin.</p>

	<p pid="a.1582W.5/1">Meetings have been held at official level with both the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) since the new Administration took power. Both USAID and PEPFAR are experiencing considerable transition and it will take some months before policy and funding changes are clarified. Discussions will be on-going to engage with and where appropriate to influence this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582W.5/2">The UK Government welcome early signs of the new US Administration's support for family planning and sexual reproductive health and rights. Rescinding the Mexico City Policy paves the way for organisations such as the International Planned Parenthood Fund (IPPF) to apply for US funding. In addition the US President has made a clear statement in support of UNFPA and the US Congress has already passed the omnibus financial year 2009 Spending Bill that provides for US$50 million for UNFPA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1582W.8/1">The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has successfully demonstrated that non-coercive family planning methods can be effective in China. UNFPA's policies and activities in China, as in the rest of the world, are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted programme of action of the international conference on population and development in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582W.8/2">UNFPA's policy of constructive engagement with the Chinese Government is helping to influence China's approach to reproductive health and rights. For example the Chinese national population and family planning commission and the Ministry of Health have begun to harmonise standards of service delivery protocols to include UNFPA quality of care principals, such as counselling, to enable informed choice and promote client rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.1583W.2/1">A recent household survey conducted by UNICEF in Zimbabwe showed that 77 per cent. of households across rural areas relied on a safe water source. A large number therefore, do not have good enough water to prevent exposure to diseases such as cholera. In urban areas, where most people rely on piped municipal water, a breakdown in infrastructure and a lack of chemicals has placed an increasingly large number of households at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.1583W.5/1">We expect that 7 million people will have received food aid in February, and more disease outbreaks are possible. The Government of Zimbabwe have failed to procure the share of food necessary, in turn creating additional pressure on existing supplies. Although the harvest looks set to be reasonable, it will be small in scale. It is expected that a significant food aid programme will be required in the coming year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is doing everything it can to help save lives in Zimbabwe.

	<p pid="a.1584W.2/1">Years of political and economic mismanagement have eroded a once very fine health service in Zimbabwe. General health status indicators have fallen in the last few years and especially since the failed elections of 2008. The number of preventable deaths has increased significantly as public health services have been depleted. Rural transport networks have become expensive and the majority of Zimbabweans have found it increasingly difficult to access health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584W.2/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting the preservation of basic life-saving health services for the Zimbabwean people through the procurement and distribution of vital medicines and supplies, the retention of health workers, support for the cholera response and to the on-going, crippling HIV and AIDS epidemic. Altogether, DFID will contribute over &pound;20 million this year to protect access to basic health services in Zimbabwe, as part of a &pound;49 million programme to help meet the essential needs of the Zimbabwean people, in terms of food, medical and other assistance.</p>

Our support includes: help to establish a cholera command and control centre (to coordinate the response); distribution of cholera response kits; provision of potable water in affected areas; and essential medicines and other vital support to health systems.</p>
