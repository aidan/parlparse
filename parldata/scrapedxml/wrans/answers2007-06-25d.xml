However, Members of Parliament are entitled to claim a bicycle allowance of 20p per mile for official travel, a rate which provides an incentive to use an environmentally-friendly means of travel and is approved by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.</p>

	<p pid="d.16W.3/1">The fall in the numbers of prosecutions and convictions in relation to escape from lawful custody offences since 2005 may partly reflect a change in policy, whereby prisoners who were granted temporary leave but failed to return on the agreed date were no longer automatically charged with an offence. Only in cases where the prisoner had been unlawfully at large for longer than eight weeks was a prosecution sought.</p>
	<p pid="d.16W.3/2">Under new proposals, however, PSNI will be notified as soon as a person has been unlawfully at large for seven days or more, with a view to prosecution. Notification may also be made for periods less than seven days, when the Governor in question considers this is justified by the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.16W.3/3">In addition, the PSNI have recently agreed new reporting procedures with the Northern Ireland Prison Service to ensure that all such cases will now be investigated and reported to the PPS. This will increase the number of convictions being achieved.</p>
	<p pid="d.16W.3/4">The procedures surrounding the supervision of prisoners both within and outside of prison establishments are constantly reviewed to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness and to minimise the possibility of escapes.</p>

	<p pid="d.29W.5/1">DFID supports the World Health Organisation (WHO), through its core funding, in its efforts to help developing countries strengthen their pharmaceutical legislation, good manufacturing practices, national drug regulatory capacity and performance. The WHO also promotes information exchange among drug regulatory authorities to help combat drug counterfeiters.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.5/2">DFID is working with a wide range of partners, including the WHO, developing country governments, pharmaceutical companies and non-governmental organisations, on the development of the Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA).</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.5/3">MeTA seeks to increase transparency over vital information on the price, quality and availability of essential medicines in developing countries to help tackle high prices, challenge corruption and counterfeiting, and address inefficiency. Up to a third of medicines on the market in developing countries are fakes.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.5/4">MeTA seeks to change this by securing high level political commitment to increase transparency and accountability over medicine procurement and supply in participating countries. MeTA also seeks to bring the right people around the table&mdash;Government Departments, civil society organisations, companies and others&mdash;to agree ways of disclosing information on the price, the quality and the availability of essential medicines into the public arena, with the aim of ultimately reducing the cost, improving the quality and increasing the availability of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.5/5">DFID has for example provided support to Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control which has taken an active lead in reducing counterfeit drugs throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="d.30W.2/1">DFID is committed to helping countries that want to remove charges at the point of delivery. In the recent DFID White Paper we made a commitment to help partner governments abolish user fees for basic health services and help them tackle other barriers to access, including discrimination against women.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.2/2">In 2003, as part of transition arrangements, user fees for health services in Liberia were suspended. At the end of the transition period on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, the President accepted the Minister of Health's recommendation that healthcare should continue to be free. We support this policy, although it is essential that it is implemented in the context of wider health sector reform, including financing, human resources, institutions, and procurement/supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.2/3">DFID has agreed to extend its support to Save the Children UK in Liberia which is playing a leading role in assisting the Government with the development of pro poor policies and health financing. DFID will jointly fund the placement of an SCF-UK Technical Director for Health to work specifically on co-ordination, policy and advocacy, including on access to free healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.2/4">User fees are one of several constraints to access to health care in Ethiopia, others being distance to health facilities and availability of drugs. Since more than one in five Ethiopians lives more than 10 km (or two hours walk) from a health care facility, Ethiopia's Health Sector Development Plan focuses on expanding access to primary health care services, especially preventive services, most of which are provided free. DFID helps to fund the delivery of these services through its contributions to the Protection of Basic Services grant, which supports recurrent costs of health and other services at local level and procurement of essential commodities such as vaccines, malaria drugs, bednets and contraceptives.</p>

	<p pid="d.30W.5/1">As outlined in the new DFID health strategy &quot;Working together for Better health&quot;, assisting countries to strengthen their health services is a UK priority.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.5/2">In Ethiopia, DFID provided direct budget support to the Government in support of its poverty reduction strategy from January 2003 to March 2005. This included &pound;2.9 million for strengthening of the national health system and delivery of health care. Between June 2006 and end March 2007, DFID provided a grant of &pound;8.7 million for the Protection of Basic Services, to help fund the recurrent costs of delivering basic health care services and the procurement of key commodities including vaccines, malaria drugs, bednets and contraceptives. Since 2005, DFID has committed a total of &pound;145,000 to a multi-donor fund to cover costs of technical assistance, studies, consultations and meetings that are crucial to the implementation of Ethiopia's Health Sector Development Programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.5/3">In Liberia DFID has been providing humanitarian support for health services since 2003 through Save the Children, Merlin and other NGOs. They have focused on providing basic services, working closely with Country Health Teams. These Teams will take on increasing responsibility for health service management and delivery through training and carrying out joint supervision of health facilities. DFID's support to NGOs in Liberia is structured around supporting public healthcare systems to be delivered free to the patient. As well as building capacity to strengthen systems, the support ensures payment of staff and provision of drugs.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.5/4">DFID will provide up to &pound;8 million over the next two years for building and strengthening systems at the central level. This includes support to the Ministry of Health to establish strong financial management and contributing to a proposed multi-donor fund to support Liberia to strengthen its health systems under its National Health Plan. DFID will continue to support NGOs to cover critical gaps in the provision of healthcare with increasing focus on transfer of leadership to the Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.31W.2/1">Since March 2003, the UK Government have budgeted &pound;744 million for the reconstruction and development of Iraq. Our contribution will help the Iraqi Government, at provincial and national level, to plan and deliver investment in basic services (electricity, hospitals, etc.), improve oil production, generate jobs and manage its own resources more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.31W.2/2">DFID has committed over &pound;100 million to infrastructure projects in Iraq, and disbursed over &pound;80 million so far. Our work on improving power and water supply has helped create employment for several thousand Iraqis in repairing some of southern Iraq's key infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="d.31W.2/3">DFID power projects have added or secured 350 MW of electricity to the Iraqi national grid, and will be adding or securing a further 120 MW over the next six months. This has been achieved by repairing damaged electricity transmission and distribution networks, including transmission lines from Al-Hartha power station to Basra city (securing electricity supplies for 1.5 million residents), and the Al-Hartha power station chimney (securing electricity supplies for 340,000 people).</p>
	<p pid="d.31W.2/4">By late 2007 DF1D will have improved access to water for one million people. We have replaced 200 kilometres of water mains, repaired over 5,000 leaks, cleared out 7,000 septic tanks and cleared over 40 kilometres of drains. We have refurbished a reverse osmosis unit to supply potable water to about 500,000 people, improved water supply to 60,000 people in Al Amtahiyah, constructed a water training centre in Basra to increase the skills of Iraqi engineers in water treatment and leakage repair, and provided technical advice for a major sewage installation in Al Amarah, providing up to half the city's population with access to a piped system and replacing open sewage channels.</p>

	<p pid="d.32W.2/1">DFID is in the process of preparing a new Country Assistance Plan for Pakistan for 2008 to 2012. As part of that preparation, we have commissioned an independent evaluation of DFID's impact on the three strategic outcome areas of the 2005 Country Assistance Plan: (1) increased incomes for the poor; (2) improved delivery of education, health and population services to the poor; and (3) greater accountability of the state to its citizens. We aim to publish this evaluation by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="d.32W.2/2">We have also just completed consultations within Pakistan, and with the Pakistan Diaspora, on what our future priorities should be. The overwhelming sense from these consultations was that DFID's programme in Pakistan has been making an impact, and that we should look to increase our efforts in support of Pakistan's poverty reduction strategies and plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.32W.2/3">DFID's work, especially in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake, has won the UK many friends in Pakistan and has contributed to strengthening the ties between our two countries. This was illustrated in November last year when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister signed a 10 year Development Partnership Arrangement (DPA) with Pakistan's Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz. The DPA is based on a shared commitment to pursuing poverty reduction objectives, respecting the human rights obligations entered into, and improving financial management and accountability in Pakistan.</p>

	<p pid="d.33W.6/1">Of those aid groups based in Thailand, DFID provides &pound;1.8 million (over three years&mdash;2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08) to the Thailand-Burma Border Consortium for the provision of food, shelter, cooking fuel and non-food items for the 166,000 refugees in the nine camps on the Thai-Burma border, and for their support to internally displaced people, particularly those in hiding in areas of ongoing conflict. We provide an approximately equivalent amount of funding to the Thailand-Burma Border Consortium's refugee work through our contributions to aid provided by the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="d.33W.6/2">DFID acknowledges the importance and value of cross-border aid, especially in supporting many of the 100,000 internally displaced people living in conflict areas in eastern Burma. We also acknowledge the value and importance of work by community based groups inside the country, who are able to reach many of the 400,000 internally displaced people living in Government controlled areas, mixed administration areas (where both ethnic armed groups and the Burmese army are present) and cease-fire areas. We believe strongly that the two mechanisms should be seen as complementary to each other&mdash;not as competitors.</p>
	<p pid="d.33W.6/3">We have removed the restriction on the use of UK funds provided to Thailand-based non-Governmental organisations for cross-border assistance. But while several Governments already fund cross-border work, the UK is the only bilateral donor currently supporting community-based groups reaching internally displaced people from inside Burma. Our judgment is that the best use for our additional money is to support community based organisations working inside Burma, which is why we also provide assistance to internally displaced people through community-based groups inside Burma (&pound;400,000 in 2007-08) to provide emergency relief, health and education programmes in eastern Burma.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.2/1">In 2006, the UN Secretary-General set up a High Level Panel (HLP) on UN System-wide Coherence. The Panel, with the Chancellor's participation, reported in November 2006 with recommendations to improve the UN's position and response to new global development challenges, and to achieve greater efficiency and co-ordination. This included the establishment of 'One UN' pilots at country level. The pilots are testing an approach based on one integrated UN programme with one consolidated budget, managed by one UN leader (the Resident Co-ordinator), where appropriate housed in one UN location. The aim is to create a genuinely united nations at country level, operating in partnership with, and responding directly to the needs of developing countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.2/2">'One UN' is currently being piloted in eight countries: Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Pakistan, Vietnam (all priorities for the UK), Cape Verde, Uruguay and Albania. The HLP recommended that the programme expand to up to 40 countries by 2010. DFID is working closely with country offices, governments, and the UN system to ensure that 'One UN' is successful. Progress is already being made in aligning the UN with national priorities, in greater efficiency and in taking the necessary change management steps. DFID is working closely with partners and the UN system to ensure robust monitoring and evaluation processes are in place, so that lessons learned and best practice are fully utilised in future 'One UN' countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.35W.2/1">DFID is committed to helping countries that want to remove charges at the point of delivery. DFID made a commitment in the recent White Paper to help partner governments abolish user fees for basic health services and help them tackle other barriers to access, including discrimination against women.</p>
	<p pid="d.35W.2/2">In Rwanda, the Government and major aid donors are conscious that financial barriers are inhibiting poor people from accessing health services. DFID is therefore working closely with the Government to investigate how DFID aid and technical assistance can best be provided to reduce the level of out-of-pocket expenditures on health services. In particular, DFID is looking at various options to specifically address the needs of the very poor that are most adversely affected by present patient charges.</p>
	<p pid="d.35W.2/3">In Zimbabwe, access to health services is rapidly decreasing as the economy contracts, inflation surpasses 4500 per cent. government capacity to maintain services diminishes and travel for most people becomes harder. User fees are currently charged for most health services other than preventive care to children under five and HIV treatment services. Where commodities have been donated, the Ministry of Health policy is that these should not be sold through fees but passed on for free. We are all aware of the situation in Zimbabwe which prevents a development partnership between DFID and the Zimbabwean government. However, DFID engages whenever the opportunity arises to discuss the adverse effects of user fees. DFID provides technical assistance and financial support for research in order to strengthen the evidence base and support the policy process.</p>

The UK is one of the largest bilateral donors of humanitarian support to Zimbabwe, supporting over 1.5 million of the poorest people. Our funding prioritises HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and supporting orphans and vulnerable children. Our current programmes will help ensure that an additional 30,000 people receive anti-retroviral treatment, will provide health care for around 350,000 children, promote food security in both urban and rural areas and assist extremely vulnerable displaced people. The UK does not give direct funding to the Government of Zimbabwe. All DFID's bilateral funding is channelled through NGOs and UN agencies, much of it programmed jointly with other donors.</p>

The Creative Economy Programme is considering the broad framework of support for the creative industries and through that work there is a broad recognition that creativity itself is a vital component of sectors such as ceramics, where I am aware that there are many examples of companies achieving renewed success through their innovation and willingness to reinvent themselves.</p>

	<p pid="d.63W.2/1">Before the recent change to rules on pet bird imports, there were more restrictions on movements of pet birds into the UK than on commercial birds of the same species. In respect of disease risk, there is no justification for imposing additional rules on individuals wishing to bring their pet birds into the UK. Pet birds are confined in a house or aviary, with minimal contact with wild birds or commercial poultry, and are closely observed, so disease is noticed promptly. Bird keepers are advised to be alert for signs of avian influenza or Newcastle disease at all times and to report any suspicion of disease to their nearest animal health office.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.2/2">Following a public consultation, including an animal health risk assessment, moving pet birds to the UK from other European countries does not require licences or quarantine subject to conditions: there must be five or fewer pet birds, the import must not be intended for a commercial purpose and the birds cannot be poultry.</p>

We have growing capacity for the treatment of TVs and monitors with cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and good treatment capacity for lamps and fluorescent tubes.

	<p pid="d.75W.3/1">DEFRA funds the Carbon Trust, who work closely with business to encourage sustainable use of energy, establish energy efficient practices and systems, and develop low carbon technologies. Under its Solutions programme the trust advises businesses on cutting carbon emissions through reducing energy use, including advice on switching off lighting and equipment during non-business times. The Carbon Trust holds free lighting workshops, and produces a number of publications specifically focused on lighting in the business sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.3/2">The Secretary of State has the power to enter into climate change agreements (CCAs) with industry sectors and individual companies that meet certain eligibility conditions. CCAs give entitlement to claim an 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency or carbon emissions reductions targets. The targets apply regardless of when energy is used.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.3/3">In addition, as part of the Energy White Paper, the Government announced that they would be taking forward the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC). The CRC is a mandatory emissions trading scheme that will target energy use emissions from large non-energy intensive commercial and public sector organisations, such as supermarkets, banks, large local authorities and Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.3/4">This sector accounts for around 10 per cent. of the UK's carbon emissions and is rising. There is scope for significant abatement. The CRC will deliver emissions reductions of 1.1 MtC per year by 2020 from this sector. It would encourage organisations to minimise their energy use by placing a cap on their overall energy use emissions.</p>

We believe the Communication significantly underestimates the potential enforcement difficulties and costs associated with such measures, especially in the mixed fisheries around the UK.</p>

	<p pid="d.83W.0/1">Flycapture, the national database of fly-tipping incidents, was set up in 2004 by DEFRA, the Environment Agency and the Local Government Association, to record fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the Environment Agency and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.0/2">Flycapture data show that, in England, 926,534 incidents were reported in the period from April 2004 to March 2005. There were 2,509,976 incidents reported from April 2005 to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.0/3">A possible reason for the rise in fly-tipping offences recorded by Flycapture in its second year may simply be due to better reporting and a rise in the number of local authorities in England submitting regular returns. This number rose significantly, from 79.5 per cent. in April 2004 when the database was first launched, to 92 per cent. in 2005-06. Over time, the database will help us build up a more accurate picture of illegally dumped waste, as well as providing a useful management tool for local authorities in tackling the problem.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.0/4">Data for 2006-07 are not yet available but will be published this summer. Flycapture does not record fly-tipping tonnages.</p>

	<p pid="d.83W.3/1">Foie gras is not produced in the UK and this Government have made their view very clear that the production of foie gras using force feeding gives rise to serious welfare concerns. If any production were to occur, Animal Health would be asked to investigate and advise on any contravention of UK animal welfare laws. The UK has the highest animal welfare standards we have ever had and they are among the highest in the world. This Government have been at the forefront of implementing higher standards domestically, and have been active on a European and international level in trying to improve standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.3/2">The free movement of goods is a well established principle in Community law and is enshrined in Part III, Title I of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (TEC). A unilateral ban by the UK on the import or sale of foie gras would contravene the provisions of the TEC and would be highly likely to result in proceedings being brought against the UK before the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.3/3">In addition, even if the Community law obstacles to introducing a restriction could be overcome, which is unlikely, the World Trade Organisation rules do not allow us to ban imports on the grounds of the welfare standards applying in third countries. Ultimately, the most effective action that can be taken is for individuals not to buy foie gras, if they dislike the way it is produced.</p>

	<p pid="d.85W.2/1">Road traffic has been identified as a significant source of pollution in 95 per cent. of the air quality management areas (designated by local authorities) declared so far.</p>
	<p pid="d.85W.2/2">Local air quality assessments include a basic screening process to determine vehicles' impact on air quality. Typically, this considers traffic as consisting only of light and heavy duty vehicle types, assigning average levels of emissions to each of these in order to model their air quality impact on the surrounding area. Although this method does not apportion a fraction of the overall level of air pollutants directly to specific classes of vehicles, such as heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), it does ensure that their emissions are represented in the assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.85W.2/3">Should the screening process identify a likely failure of air quality objectives, a further, more detailed level of assessment is undertaken to establish whether an air quality management area is necessary. These methods of assessment all consider the specific contribution of HGVs to ambient air pollution.</p>
	<p pid="d.85W.2/4">No specific national assessment of the impact of HGV traffic has been made for the areas mentioned in <i> (b),</i><i> (c)</i> and <i> (d).</i> Terrestrial special protection areas are also notified as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs). Natural England data on the reasons for unfavourable condition on SSSIs identifies that 18,524 hectares of SSSI land are adversely affected by air pollution. However the impacts of air pollution and identification of air pollution as an adverse activity affecting site condition are currently considered to be under reported. Furthermore SSSI condition is not disaggregated to identify different sources of air pollution. Individual assessments of the impact from air pollution have been made in respect of specific sites.</p>

	<p pid="d.87W.5/1">The United Kingdom is a Party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES, which is implemented within the EU by the Wildlife Trade Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97), regulates trade in over 5,000 species of animals, including the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). Polar bears are listed under Appendix II as a species that is not necessarily now threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled. Under the EU Regulation the international trade in polar bears and other vulnerable species is strictly regulated to ensure that it will not be detrimental to their wild populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.87W.5/2">Currently, however, the chief threat to polar bears is the impact of climate change, which is felt particularly strongly in polar regions. If global temperatures continue to rise, Arctic summer sea ice could disappear almost entirely by the latter part of this century. The UK continues to take a strong lead internationally on climate change. In particular, we are working through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the G8 to secure agreement to a long-term international framework that can address dangerous climate change.</p>

	<p pid="d.87W.8/1">Under EU-wide Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-related feed ban controls, introduced in 2001, most processed animal proteins, including those derived from poultry, have been prohibited from use in any farmed animal feed. This builds on longer-standing controls on mammalian-derived processed animal proteins.</p>
	<p pid="d.87W.8/2">Separate controls, in place since 2002 under the EU Animal By-Products Regulations, prohibit processed animal proteins from being recycled back to the same species they are derived from. These controls mean that feeding poultry using recycled processed animal protein derived from dead poultry is not permitted, either in the UK or in any other member state. Additionally, no poultry feed containing processed animal protein derived from poultry may be imported either into the UK, or into any other member state.</p>
	<p pid="d.87W.8/3">Neither pigs nor poultry, as naturally omnivorous animals, have been shown in experiments to be orally susceptible to BSE, and no naturally occurring Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy have yet been identified in these species. Nevertheless, the principle of preventing intra-species recycling of processed animal protein in feed will continue to apply to all farmed animal species both now and in the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.88W.5/1">There are 182 protected areas in UK inshore waters with a marine element: 81 special protection areas with marine habitats for birds, 98 special areas of conservation with marine habitats or species, and three marine nature reserves. In total, these sites cover more than 1.8 million hectares, or 2.2 per cent. of UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="d.88W.5/2">Work is under way to identify further sites in UK waters. To date, 19 areas for marine habitats have been surveyed and there are plans for additional survey of a further 10 areas. Between them, these areas cover up to 9,550,000 ha or 11 per cent. of UK waters. Seven areas for marine birds have also been surveyed, with plans for 30 more. A selection of these surveyed areas are likely to be recommended as marine protected areas under the habitats and birds directives, but the number and size of these sites is not yet known.</p>
	<p pid="d.88W.5/3">The Marine Bill will also introduce a new mechanism to enable the designation of marine conservation zones. There have been a number of recommendations on what proportion of the UK marine area might be covered by such zones, including by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. However, there is currently insufficient scientific evidence to enable us to make an accurate assessment of the likely extent of a network of marine protected areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.88W.5/4">To inform the impact assessment for the Bill, we have undertaken research investigating the likely extent of a network of marine conservation zones in UK waters under a range of different scenarios. The network configurations generated as part of the exercise all resulted in 14 to 20 per cent. coverage of the UK continental shelf. These figures were based on a number of scenarios, although none of these are necessarily representative of how the final network will look. The findings of this research have been published on the DEFRA website.</p>

For that reason, my Department has had no other discussions with these or any other bodies specifically about water supply infrastructure serving Peterborough.</p>

	<p pid="d.91W.8/1">I opened the &pound;18 million River Quaggy Flood Alleviation scheme in Lewisham, London, with the chairman of the Environment Agency Sir John Harman. I asked people to mark World Environment Agency Day by identifying the one change they can make in their everyday lives to protect the environment and fight climate change. I also urged people to go to the Environment Agency's Mend the World online survey, which was the core component of the Environment Agency's campaign this year for WED. This has been asking people for the number one action they can do to tackle climate change, the one extra action they could take and what was stopping them from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="d.91W.8/2">I also announced that the Government are to hold a second competition for youth Climate Change Champions to communicate climate change across the country. The nine inaugural champions, aged between 10 and 18, have been active in speaking out about climate change. Their efforts have reached an estimated 18 per cent. of the adult population and have engaged a large number of young people in the debate about what needs to be done. The competition will kick off in the summer, and nine new champions will be appointed in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.91W.8/3">DEFRA also released a new booklet, &quot;Climate Change: Your Guide to Inspiring Action&quot; to help organisations communicate the ways in which people can make changes in their lives to help fight climate change. The first guide has been downloaded 40,000 times and 6,000 hard copies have been distributed. It is available on</p>

These included the launch of the Royal Society of Arts/Tesco Carbonator&mdash;an online CO2 calculator aimed at children aged 7-14 to raise awareness of climate change and the Royal Geographical Society's new website for 11 to 18-year-olds linking climate change to the geography curriculum. The fund provides financial support for communications projects seeking to achieve positive changes in public attitudes about climate change. The 83 projects cover a wide range of communications initiatives and media and are supported by &pound;8.5 million of funding.</p>

	<p pid="d.92W.5/1">Under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 the Secretary of State is required to specify detailed standards for zoo management that zoos are expected to comply with. The Secretary of State's Standards of Modern Zoo Practice are designed to ensure that the welfare of animals in zoos is adequately protected.</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/2">The current standards state that euthanasia in zoos is an acceptable procedure only if an animal cannot be provided with captive conditions which meet the Five Principles of animal welfare, or if it cannot be released into the wild. These Five Principles are based on the 'Five Freedoms' drawn up for livestock by the Farm Animal Welfare Council, and they comprise: provision of food and water; provision of a suitable environment; provision of animal health care; provision of an opportunity to express most normal behaviour; provision of protection from fear and distress.</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/3">The standards provide strict guidelines on circumstances where euthanasia is justifiable. These are:</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/4" class="indent">if, in the opinion of a vet, an animal is suffering from an incurable disease, or severe pain or suffering which cannot be alleviated.</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/5" class="indent">if a zoo has to close, euthanasia may be the only option for some animals and the most humane for others.</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/6" class="indent">if the animal poses a serious and unavoidable threat to human safety (e.g. because it has escaped);</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/7" class="indent">culling of surplus stock (including unacceptable sex ratios) where overcrowding compromises the welfare of the animals so that it is impractical to maintain them within the Five Principles.</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.5/8">The standards further recommend that zoos have a policy, with appropriate protocols, which should be made available to zoo inspectors during their regular inspection visits under the Zoo Licensing Act. This should also form part of the zoo's audit process. Zoos are also expected to have in place an ethical review process, which would address issues such as the establishment's culling policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.100W.5/1">Those service personnel who have received a serious physical injury are treated as a matter of priority, most often at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine and then at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre. As part of their hospital care, they will receive psychological assessment and, if necessary, treatment can commence. If required, patients can be referred later to a military Department of Community Mental Health (DCMH).</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.5/2">For those who do not have a serious physical injury, if their GP judges that they might be suffering from an operational related mental health condition (for example PTSD), then they will be referred to a DCMH for a detailed multidisciplinary assessment of their condition. If it is confirmed that the individual is suffering from a mental illness such as PTSD, they will receive specialist treatment at a DCMH or, if in-patient care is required, a Priory Group Facility.</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.5/3">Our mental health services operate in line with best practice to provide community-based mental health care. Our model for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment meets the standards set by the independent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.5/4">We have established 15 military DCMHs across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas) to provide out-patient mental health care. The MOD's performance indicators require urgent cases to be seen within 24 hours and others within 20 working days of referral. The DCMHs function within these requirements and we are not aware of, nor would we expect there to be, any patients who had to wait in excess of six months for a referral.</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.5/5">It remains the case that medical discharge from the UK armed forces due to psychological illness is low. Out of almost 180,000 Regular Service personnel only about 150, or less than 0.1 per cent. are discharged annually for mental health reasons, whatever the cause. Of these, only 20 to 25 meet the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD.</p>

	<p pid="d.101W.5/1">The expression 'full pension' is taken to mean a pension reflecting the maximum amount of reckonable service allowed under the pension scheme rules. As the majority of service personnel belong to either the armed forces pension scheme 1975 (AFPS 75) or the armed forces pension scheme 2005 (AFPS 05) my answer is in respect of those schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.5/2">Under AFPS 75 the most an officer can accrue is 34 years reckonable service from age 21 and, for another rank, the limit is 37 years reckonable service from age 18. The earliest that a full pension can be paid is age 55 and this full pension is worth 48.5 per cent. of representative pay.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.5/3">Officers who leave having accrued at least 16 years reckonable service from age 21 under AFPS 75 and other ranks who leave having accrued at least 22 years from age 18 are entitled to a pension paid immediately upon discharge but this is a proportion of the full career pension. Those who leave with two or more years service but insufficient to qualify for this immediate pension are awarded a preserved pension payable at age 60 for service before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> and 65 for service after that date.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.5/4">Under AFPS 05 the most that a member can accrue is 40 years reckonable service with no minimum age limit. The normal full pension entitlement is age 55. A full pension under AFPS 05 is worth just over 57 per cent. of final pensionable pay.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.5/5">AFPS 05 members who leave before age 55 with two or more years reckonable service are entitled to a preserved pension payable at age 65. Those who have given at least 18 years reckonable service and attained age 40 are eligible for payments from the early departure payments scheme. Their pensions are preserved until age 65.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.5/6">Finally, members of the armed forces do not typically serve to age 55 or beyond. In 2005-06 approximately 10 per cent. of officers and approximately 7 per cent. of other ranks served long enough to receive a full pension.</p>

This applies to all course places whether they are part or fully paid for by MOD, or whether the country in question pays for the training itself.

Flowers can be provided only for OSRs as part of the cost of official entertainment.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.8/2">There is no requirement to hold information regarding official entertainment costs to the level of detail that would allow the cost of flowers to be identified, and the information requested is not therefore available for the Chief of the General Staff and the Commander in Chief Land. For the Adjutant General expenditure on flowers was &pound;72.12 and for the General Officer Commanding (Northern Ireland) it was &pound;190 during 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.115W.0/19">The precise value of each contract is commercially confidential but the approximate value of each contract is indicated in an extensive table which I have placed in the Library of the House. The number excludes small-value local purchase orders, contracts placed on behalf of other nations and other Government Departments and those where the suppliers are a subcontractor or a member of an industry consortium. The total cost to the public purse of each contract in each of the past five years is also commercially confidential. However, the scale of total payments made to the major divisions of each supplier, over the past five financial years on all direct contracts, as published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency, is shown as follows.</p>

	<p pid="d.126W.0/2"><i> </i>Depleted uranium is a heavy metal used in some anti-armour munitions. While there is no appreciable radiation health risk, it can pose a toxic hazard through inhalation of ingestion of depleted uranium dust, or contamination of open wounds. This risk is relatively low and does not require individual protective clothing to be worn unless personnel are working in contaminated areas for a prolonged period. Advice provided on decontamination during combat operations was that clothing that may have been in contact with depleted uranium should have the dust brushed off in a controlled site while the individuals concerned were still wearing oral-nasal protection and gloves. Once brushed clean, the clothing was to be washed as normal. Thereafter clothing could be worn or disposed of locally as required.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.0/3">Subsequent monitoring of several hundred UK troops has shown that this advice was effective. Tests have shown no detectable depleted uranium in anyone other than a very small number of troops injured directly by depleted uranium munitions.</p>

	<p pid="d.128W.2/1">During a post flight check on Nimrod XV227 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-22">22 November 2004</phrase>, it was discovered that a portion of Supplementary Cooling Pack ducting had failed. A unit inquiry was held which concluded that it was caused by pitting and cracking corrosion leading to failure. The unit inquiry made the following recommendations and the table identifies actions taken in response.</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="d.128W.2/5"> <td>The ruptured duct is replaced with new manufactured items on a fleet-wide basis as soon as possible.</td> <td>Recommendation closed. All such ducts fitted to in-service aircraft have been replaced with newly manufactured items.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.128W.2/6"> <td>A lifing policy is introduced for the ruptured duct and all similar ducts.</td> <td>See comments on maintenance policy recommendation. Action ongoing.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.128W.2/7"> <td>A maintenance policy should be instigated for the ruptured duct and all similar ducts.</td> <td>A study into the need for a preventative maintenance/lifing policy for this and similar ducts has been concluded by the Designer (BAE Systems). Their report, which is due to be issued imminently, is based on the results of a detailed analysis of a sample of ducts taken from a number of MR2 aircraft. This analysis has taken time to complete, but the report is expected to recommend that a lifing policy be introduced. Ducts due for replacement would be replaced during scheduled maintenance activities and it is anticipated that such a duct replacement programme would be in place by December 2007. Action ongoing.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.128W.2/8"> <td>The extent of the hot air leak warning system is reviewed to ensure that all possible duct failures are covered.</td> <td>Recommendation closed. A review of the aircraft warning systems revealed that the affected Supplementary Cooling Pack Duct was the only duct whose failure would not have been detected.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.128W.2/9"> <td>A hot air leak warning system is introduced for the ruptured duct and cross-air bleed ducts.</td> <td>Recommendation rejected. The duct failure was an isolated incident and was in the only part of the system where a leak would not have been detected. All of these ducts have been replaced with newly manufactured items that, based upon the previous 25 fault-free years that the original duct had been fitted, are expected to last well beyond the planned MR2 Out of Service Date (early part of the next decade). Moreover, fitting a discrete hot air leak warning system would be a complex modification that would have to be embodied across the fleet during its maintenance cycle and therefore take several years to embody. Considering the Out of Service Date of the Nimrod MR2, the fitting of such a system was not considered to be practicable. Action closed.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.128W.2/10"> <td>This incident is highlighted as a training point for Air Engineers.</td> <td>The incident was immediately publicised through the Air Engineer command chain at RAF Kinloss. Action closed.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.128W.2/11"> <td>The Aircrew Flight Reference Cards (FRC) regarding Supplementary Cooling Pack malfunctions are amended to reflect the information in the aircrew manuals.</td> <td>Amendments were made to Aircrew Flight Reference Cards and Aircrew Manuals to reflect the incident.

	<p pid="d.129W.11/1">The information is not held centrally in the format requested. Taking the eight ships as a whole, the approximate percentage of time spent at sea for Type 42 destroyers over the last 12 months and for 2006 is 30 per cent. at sea and 70 per cent. in harbour.</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.11/2">Time spent in harbour includes both time spent alongside in the ship's home port and time spent alongside while deployed elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.11/3">The percentage figures allow for time spent in refit or maintenance periods.</p>

	<p pid="d.130W.6/1">Currently, the major portion of biodiesel production in the UK comes from imported soya, palm and jatrophe oils, along with locally grown oilseed rape, with a smaller contribution from recycled waste vegetable oil and animal fats. Bioethanol is sourced primarily from imports. However, a number of companies have announced plans to increase production of biofuels, either by expansion of existing plants or through construction of new plants which will use UK grown crops such as sugar beet, wheat and oilseed rape as a feedstock. Such biofuel production plants are being stimulated by a mix of Road Fuel Duty reduction and the forthcoming Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. The Government are also keen to support &quot;second generation&quot; biofuels which use more advanced technologies and have the potential to use straw, wood and biodegradable waste as feedstocks and is supporting a number of projects through the Technology Programme in this area. However, the majority of these processes are currently not proven at commercial scale. There is also significant development of biofuels internationally.</p>

	<p pid="d.135W.11/14">Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) and the university of Warwick are major assets to the West Midlands and play a significant role in attracting inward investment into the region. WMG, in particular, is one of many assets within the region which form an integral part of an overall regional proposition presented to knowledge-driven business. It is rarely possible however to attribute the success in securing an inward investment project to one single factor, as often it is the result of a combination of issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.135W.11/15">For example, the Airbus decision to establish a systems engineering centre for fuel and landing gear systems in Solihull in 2006 was based on a combination of factors, including skills availability, access to existing Airbus centres in both north-west and south-west England and potential engineering links to regional universities including Aston, Birmingham and Warwick. WMG was nevertheless one of a number of factors which persuaded Airbus to locate in the region.</p>

It is for the planning process to consider if proposed upgrades are acceptable. In Scotland, those planning decisions rest with Scottish Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="d.137W.5/1">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires that distributors supplying electrical and electronic equipment to household end users provide facilities for WEEE to be returned free of charge. The UK's implementing regulations give distributors two options for meeting this obligation: they can offer in-store take back of old equipment when consumers buy a replacement item or they can join the Distributor Take back Scheme (DTS) which supports a network of primarily civic amenity site collection facilities where their customers can return their WEEE.</p>

We have established a number of Innovation and Growth Teams in key sectors which provide a good example of the way in which we work with industry. We also work with inward investors to the UK who create employment.

	<p pid="d.140W.3/1">In the Energy White Paper, the Government made clear their view that display devices could give gas and electricity customers information to help them make early reductions in their energy use. Further activity in respect of smart metering is being undertaken by the Government, in partnership with gas and electricity suppliers. In setting out their White Paper proposals on display devices, the Government indicated that they would consult on the implementation of these proposals in the context of their ambitions to see a roll-out of smart meters within 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="d.148W.8/1">No specific research has been commissioned by DTI on flexible working and skill shortages in the UK. However, to the extent that flexible working helps employers both to recruit and retain skilled staff, it will help to reduce skill shortages in the UK. DTI research has found that many employees consider the availability of flexible working to be important when deciding to work with their current employer.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.8/2">With regard to the percentage of men who would like to work more flexibly the DTIs Third Work-Life Balance Employee Survey found that almost half (46 per cent.) either were currently working flexibly, or had done so in the past year. When men who had not made a request to work flexibly were asked why, more than three-fifths said they were happy with their current arrangements or gave other personal reasons. Overall, 86 per cent. of male employees said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their current working arrangements, compared with only 5 per cent. who were dissatisfied and 1 per cent. who were very dissatisfied.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.8/3">The relationship between various workplace practices and productivity is a complex one, mediated by a host of other variables; studies often find no statistically significant relationship. The relationship between work-life balance and labour productivity was investigated in Chapter 10 of the DTI-sponsored report, 'Inside the Workplace: Findings from the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey' (Routledge 2006). It was found that work-life balance practices were not jointly significant when added to the baseline labour productivity model. A forthcoming DTI research report, however, has found that in private sector workplaces an increased incidence of family-friendly provisions is positively associated with managers' perceptions of improved financial performance.</p>
	<p pid="d.148W.8/4">In terms of raising awareness of the business case for flexible working among employers, the DTI has recently worked with Carers UK, ACAS, British Chambers of Commerce and British Gas to produce an employer's pack which illustrates the business case for flexible working. The Business Link website provides advice and guidance on flexible working and highlights the business case and benefits to employers of working flexibly.</p>

	<p pid="d.150W.10/1">Local authorities have an important role in securing new affordable housing. They should work in partnership with housing associations and developers, using their planning and other powers, to identify need and support development. But we are encouraging more direct development by authorities where it offers value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.150W.10/2">We have changed the bidding process for social housing grant this year which will make it easier for arms-length management organisations (ALMOs) or local authority special venture vehicles to satisfy pre-qualification tests of financial standing and technical capacity which has hampered previous ALMO bids; and ensure that when an authority brings forward land in a bid, this is likely to score well in meeting the criteria of deliverability and strategic fit.</p>
	<p pid="d.150W.10/3">We are exploring with six local authorities, three of which have ALMOs, the benefits of their coming out of the housing revenue subsidy system. The pilots have shown that being self-financing creates a number of benefits, one of which is the opportunity for councils to have a more direct role in building homes for rent. The work of the pilots is currently being assessed.</p>

Forty local authorities have already cut their costs in anticipation of home information packs (HIP) because they know that, for the first time, the charges and the length of time taken will be transparent to the consumer and to HIP providers.</p>

	<p pid="d.156W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.8/2">Local authorities are required to report quarterly data on municipal waste (encompassing household waste) to WasteDataFlow. When reporting data, authorities should specify the amount of waste collected for recycling that is subsequently rejected, at the point of collection, at a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF), or at the gate of the reprocessor. The data reported to WasteDataFlow are used by the Environment Agency and DEFRA to monitor the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.8/3">The agency has also carried out a survey on household waste materials reclamation facilities in England and Wales. They identified and visited about 80 candidate sites to ascertain recovery and reject levels at each site, verifying this information via a visual inspection of bale quality and the overall state of each facility. The overall typical spread of reject rates for MRFs was from 5-25 per cent. with 10-15 per cent. being the average. Around 1 million tonnes of municipal waste were reported to WasteDataFlow as being processed by an MRF.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.8/4">Analysis by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, based on a range of data sources, suggests that a conservative estimate of the amount of household waste collected for recycling which is not recycled is around 5-10 per cent. In 2005-06, a total of 6.87 million tonnes of waste from household sources was collected for recycling.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.8/5">I am not aware of any research carried out by the Audit Commission in this area. However, the Audit Commission has published a number of guidance documents containing advice to local councils on how they can meet their statutory requirements with regards to waste by improving their waste management and adopting best practice. The Audit Commission also examines the performance of councils and the services they provide, including waste, through the Comprehensive Performance Assessment, and provides recommendations for improvement.</p>

Any such impact was likely to have been small compared with the normal fluctuations in listings.

	<p pid="d.171W.11/1">The percentage of local government revenue expenditure financed by specific grants in England in each year since 1997-98 and the estimated figures for 2006-07 and 2007-08 are tabled as follows.</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.11/2">The table is produced on a non-Financial Reporting Standard (FRS 17) basis to 2003-04 and on an FRS 17 basis from 2003-04 onwards. The main implication is that the costs of entitlements to retirement benefits (pensions) in FRS 17 are accounted for in the year in which employment gives rise to the entitlement, rather than the year in which cash payments of contributions or pensions take place. On an FRS 17 basis, revenue expenditure is now financed by appropriations from pension reserves, in addition to appropriations from other reserves, revenue support grant, redistributed non-domestic rates, police grant and council tax.</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.11/3">The large change in specific grant from 2006-07 onwards is largely due to changes in the way the expenditure on schools is funded. Local authorities now receive dedicated schools grant, included in specific grants, replacing funding previously included in formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.11/4">The definition of local government revenue expenditure used here is expenditure funded from aggregate external finance (AEF), council tax and authorities' reserves. AEF is central Government revenue funding that comprises formula grant (revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and police grant), general Greater London authority (GLA) grant and specific grants inside AEF, i.e. revenue grants paid for council's core services. The specific grants used here are the specific grants inside AEF. Comparisons across years may not be valid owing to changing local authority responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="d.174W.8/1">The relevant code in the 2003 Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy specified a rate of return of 3.5 per cent. real in respect of calculating benefit scheme liabilities. The relevant code in the 2004 SORP changed this. It specified the use of an equivalent current rate of return to that of a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities rather than a specific percentage figure. This reflects the Financial Reporting Board Standard 17 issued by the Accounting Standards Board, part of a general move for local authorities to comply with standard accounting practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.178W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.178W.6/2">No additional funding has been provided by my Department. However, the Government have prepared for possible consequences of England going Smokefree on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, including the potential increase in smoking-related litter.</p>
	<p pid="d.178W.6/3">In May this year, the Government published guidance for local authorities on smoking litter prevention, which was sent to all authorities in England. DEFRA has also funded four smoking litter campaigns for the current financial year. These campaigns have been organised by Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS), the organisation that runs the Keep Britain Tidy campaign.</p>
	<p pid="d.178W.6/4">Central to this work is the issue of behaviour change. If smokers refrained from discarding their cigarette butts on the street, smoking-related litter would not be a problem. This is why, through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, we took the opportunity to clarify that smoking-related litter is in fact litter. As a consequence, anyone disposing of a cigarette butt is committing a littering offence, punishable with a fixed penalty notice fine or prosecution in the magistrates court. The Government continue to encourage local authorities to use their powers in this regard to take action, where appropriate, against those discarding smoking-related litter.</p>
	<p pid="d.178W.6/5">We are also in the process of amending the Street Litter Control Notices Order 1991 to extend the types of premises currently falling within the scope of the Street Litter Control Notice provisions. This will enable them to be used against places which may attract outside smokers, including pubs, clubs, restaurants, cafes and other eating and drinking venues. It is intended to commence this power on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>. When there is a suitable opportunity, we also intend to amend both primary and secondary legislation so that Street Litter Control Notices can also be used in respect of offices.</p>
	<p pid="d.178W.6/6">In instances where a partnership approach to deal with a litter or refuse problem has failed, Street Litter Control Notices can be used by local authorities to set out what can reasonably be required of the occupier of the premises in question to minimise the detrimental impact of their operation&mdash;for example, providing bins and keeping a defined area clear of litter, including smoking-related litter.</p>

	<p pid="d.181W.0/2">Latest figures, for <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>, show that there were 1,871 dependent children in bed-and-breakfast style accommodation and 129,341 in all forms of total temporary accommodation. These figures also include expected children when a pregnant woman is part of the household.</p>
	<p pid="d.181W.0/3">The Government have made significant progress in tackling the use of inappropriate temporary accommodation for families assisted under the homelessness legislation. In March 2002, the Government set a target that no family with children should have to live in bed and breakfast provided as temporary accommodation under the homelessness legislation for more than six weeks. At that time, there were 6,960 families living in bed and breakfast as temporary accommodation, of which it was estimated that between 3,500 and 4,000 had been in bed and breakfast for more than six weeks. The target was met by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> and, to ensure it would be sustained, the Government made the Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. The effect of the order is that, under the homelessness legislation, bed and breakfast cannot not be regarded as suitable accommodation for families with children unless alternative accommodation is not available, and even then cannot be regarded as suitable for more than six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="d.181W.0/4">In addition, in January 2005 the Government announced in &quot;Homes for All&quot; its commitment to halve the number of all households in temporary accommodation by 2010, and more recently on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-14">14 November 2006</phrase>, a further commitment that by 2010, no 16 or 17-year-olds should be placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation by a local authority under the homelessness legislation, except in an emergency.</p>

	<p pid="d.182W.2/1">The total population of the Cheltenham borough area given in the 2001 Census was 110,013. For the urban area, which excludes rural parts of the borough but includes the contiguous urban area, which crosses local authority boundaries, the Census figure was 110,320. The most recent population projections published by the Office for National Statistics for the local authority area indicate a population increase from 111,900 in 2006 to 120,100 in 2026. The projections are trend-based and policy neutral. They do not illustrate either the implementation or the non-implementation of any strategy but indicate a continuation of existing trends. Unfortunately these projections are not published for the contiguous urban area.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/2">The proposed housing figures contained in the draft RSS were submitted by the South West Regional Assembly based on proposals put to it by Gloucestershire county council. The hon. Member for Cheltenham would need to ask those bodies what assumptions they have made about the likely population of the Cheltenham area and the implications of the implementation or non- implementation of those RSS proposals. Following the end of the current Examination in Public of the RSS in July this year and the subsequent submission of the Panel report, the Government will then consider the recommendations in it, and the most up-to-date evidence, before considering the need to accept the RSS or propose changes to it.</p>

	<p pid="d.184W.13/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Ministry of Defence regularly discuss the role of British forces in Afghanistan. These discussions are central to the UK's joint civilian-military approach there. The current mandate for our troops, who are in Afghanistan at the invitation of the Afghan Government and as part of the UN-mandated, NATO-led international security assistance force, expires in 2009. We expect, however, that UK forces will be needed in Afghanistan beyond this. The size and duration of the UK military presence will depend on a number of factors including the ability of Afghan security forces to take greater responsibility for the security of their own country.</p>

	<p pid="d.188W.2/23">Our existing corporate credit card scheme began an expansion at the beginning of 2006. One of the main reasons for the expansion was the need to reduce the burden on our overseas posts who had up to this point been required to provide subsistence and pay for hotels for officers visiting overseas posts on official duty. The corporate credit card is used by the vast majority of officers for travel costs and costs associated with official entertainment. The increased expenditure on both the corporate credit card and the procurement card is a result of encouraging FCO staff to make increased use of these cards. We see these cards as a cost-effective and efficient way of paying for lower value goods and services.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.3/1">Over the years, Famagusta and the Port of Famagusta have been the subject of a series of proposals for confidence building measures. A 2004 proposal from the Government of Cyprus linked preferential Turkish Cypriot trade with the EU through the port of Famagusta, with the return of the closed city of Varosha. Since then, other attempts have been made by a number of EU presidencies to broker a deal. None has been successful. The apparent Turkish Cypriot position is that Varosha will only be returned as part of a comprehensive settlement. Such issues highlight the necessity of a comprehensive and durable settlement to the Cyprus problem.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February 2007</phrase>, they will remain in Iraq for as long as the Iraqi Government wishes us to be there and there is a job to be done. We remain committed to our strategy of building the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, so that lead responsibility for security can progressively be transferred to them.</p>

We have also been active in international fora. In 2005 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office provided the UN Office on Drugs and Crime with &pound;240,000 for a three year project to strengthen the capacity of the EFCC. We were instrumental in securing European Commission support for US$ 24.7 million for the EFCC to provide equipment and technical support as well as to strengthen the capacity of the judicial system to prosecute in cases of economic and financial crimes, including e-mail fraud.</p>

	<p pid="d.209W.0/1">The Government are not able to prevent property development in northern Cyprus. We believe that the difficult and complex issue of property is only likely to be fully resolved in the context of a comprehensive settlement. In our contacts with the Turkish Cypriot leadership, we recognise the Turkish Cypriots' need for economic development in support of reunification. But we urge them to ensure that any property development that does take place does so in a manner that is both environmentally sustainable and does not complicate an eventual solution.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.0/2">Similarly, we call on the Turkish Cypriot administration to show sensitivity to Greek Cypriot churches and cemeteries in the north. Our high commissioner in Nicosia visited the Karpas region on <phrase class="date" code="">22 June</phrase> and raised such issues with his Turkish Cypriot interlocutors.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.0/3">The <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-08">8 July 2006</phrase> agreement between the leaders of the two communities presented an opportunity to make progress towards a resumption of full settlement negotiations. Despite attempts since by the UN to implement this agreement no real progress has been made. We continue to urge both sides to show the political will and flexibility required to bridge the gap between words and deeds, and engage constructively with the efforts of the UN. Negotiations on a final political solution have been at an impasse for too long.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.0/4">We consider that confidence-building measures, such as the opening of Ledra Street, and other crossing points, would help bring the two communities closer together. This message was reinforced in the resolution adopted by the UN Security Council on Cyprus on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>. The Security Council's resolution also expressed concern about the diminishing opportunities for bicommunal activity within Cyprus. As such, we hope that the announcement by the Republic of Cyprus of a package of measures to address this will promote reconciliation between the communities.</p>

	<p pid="d.214W.5/1">The British Council has been present in Russia for many years,, during which it has enjoyed the support of federal ministries, local authorities and officials for activities in the fields of education, language training, scientific co-operation, culture and the arts. Hundreds of thousands of people across Russia have been able to benefit from the activities of the British Council network.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.5/2">More recently the British Council in Russia has experienced a number of legal., administrative and practical difficulties. The British Council has sought to comply with the demands of the authorities, for example in respect of taxation and other regulations, despite difficulties caused by the lack of clear legal status, Most recently a series of tax inspections in Moscow and across the network was launched and the British Council are providing information requested by the inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.5/3">We have pressed the Russians to resolve uncertainties about the legal status of the British Council in Russia by concluding a new Cultural Centres Agreement, taking the place of a 1994 Agreement on Co-operation in the Fields of Education, Science and Culture. The absence of an updated Agreement is causing difficulties for some regional British Council centres established in co-operation with local partners and authorities. A text was agreed at official level with Russia in 2001. In March 2006, Russia submitted a revised text. Productive negotiations with the Russian Foreign Ministry in January brought the text of a new Cultural Centres Agreement very close to conclusion. However, the Russian authorities have been reluctant to guarantee consent, under the terms of the Agreement, for the British Council to establish centres (which already exist as their current network of offices), outside Moscow. We await the Russian authorities' reply to our outstanding proposals for finalising the text, which we hope can lead to a quick and satisfactory outcome.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.5/4">These issues are raised frequently with the Russian authorities at both Ministerial and official levels. Our Embassy in Moscow keeps EU colleagues informed of developments in the course of regular meetings in Moscow.</p>

	<p pid="d.221W.6/1">When the UN Human Rights Council was established in March 2006, it was tasked with reviewing its tools and mechanisms, including its so-called Special Procedures (for example Special Rapporteurs and Independent Experts dedicated to specific country situations). On <phrase class="date" code="">18 June</phrase>, the Council agreed a package of measures at the conclusion of this review. Throughout the review the UK consistently took a strong position, nationally and with the rest of the EU, in favour of maintaining all the existing country-specific and thematic Special Procedures. There was a great deal of opposition at the Council to the continuation of country-specific Special Procedures. I was profoundly disappointed that, because of this opposition, the mandates of the Special Rapporteurs on the human rights situations in Cuba and Belarus were not renewed. The situations in both those countries continue to be of deep concern and we will continue to monitor the situation in each closely. I was, however, pleased that the mandates of all the other country-specific Special Procedures (including the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Burma and Sudan, and the Independent Expert appointed by the UN Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in Somalia) were renewed.</p>
	<p pid="d.221W.6/2">The Council inherited an Independent Expert on the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, created through the confidential complaints procedure under the old UN Commission on Human Rights. At its fourth session (12-<phrase class="date" code="">30 March</phrase>) the UN Human Rights Council discontinued consideration of the specific file relating to Uzbekistan under its confidential complaints procedure. The confidential nature of that procedure prevents us from commenting on any details of the cases and on the position taken by the UK. We do, however, emphasise strongly our deep concern over persistent violations of human rights in Uzbekistan.</p>
	<p pid="d.221W.6/3">The Council also agreed on <phrase class="date" code="">18 June</phrase> a new system of universal periodic review, which will look at every state's individual work on human rights implementation, including Cuba's and Uzbekistan's.</p>

The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point) and the results so far show exposures are well within internationally accepted (ICNIRP) guidelines. Based on current knowledge and experience, radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones. Also, the frequencies used in WiFi are broadly the same as those from traditional RF applications.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="d.231W.2/1">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities to analyse their local situation and develop plans, in liaison with their local national health service trusts and primary care providers, to deliver high quality NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/2">PCTs are under a legal requirement to fund the provision of treatments within three months of a positive National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) appraisal being finalised.

If it is possible for PCTs to make the necessary arrangements without using the full three month period then they should do so.</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/3">Where treatments and services fall under payment by results, this activity is paid for at the national tariff price. Funding for services outside the scope of payment by results is agreed locally between commissioners and providers. Under payment by results any cost implications of NICE guidance for the NHS are taken account of in two main ways:</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/4" class="indent">Through an adjustment within the national tariff uplift (dealing with pay and prices, pay reform and technical issues); and</p>

	<p pid="d.231W.2/6">Practice based commissioning (PBC) gives practices and primary care professionals the freedom to develop innovative, high-quality services for their patients. It enables them, working across boundaries with secondary care clinicians and others, to redesign services that better meet the needs of their patients. By giving practices the ability to develop new services for patients within a framework of accountability and support, PBC will improve access, extend patient choice and help restore financial balance.</p>

	<p pid="d.232W.2/1">The detailed regulation of the provision of care for older people in residential care homes is governed by the Care Standards Act 2000 and regulations made under it. The relevant statutory instruments which govern the regulation and inspection of care homes, as defined in that Act, are the National Care Standards Commission (Registration) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3969) and the Care Homes Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3965).

Enforcement of the regulatory conditions is through criminal sanctions and mandatory inspection of homes by CSCI. In exercising its powers of inspection, CSCI must take into account the relevant national minimum standards issued under the 2000 Act, which apply across the country and are intended to ensure consistency in the quality of services. It is an offence for anyone who carries on or manages a care home, as defined in the 2000 Act, not to be registered.</p>

	<p pid="d.234W.3/1">The resource allocations for primary dental care services awarded to primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2006-07 were based on expenditure on general dental services and personal dental services pilots in each PCT area during the reference period October 2004 to September 2005. This captured payments for both general dental services and specialist services such as orthodontic services. The allocations also included adjustments to reflect nationally agreed increases in dentists' remuneration, provision for growth plans previously submitted to and approved by the Department, and some margin to accommodate any new services that may have started during or after the reference period but could not be fully reflected in the calculation of reference period earnings.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.3/2">The resource allocations for 2007-08 included additional funding to allow for factors such as 2007-08 increases in dentists' remuneration and adjustments in the expected levels of patient charge income. Hartlepool PCT received a 7.1 per cent. increase in its 2007-08 dental funding allocation, net of income from patient charges.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.3/3">PCTs are responsible for developing dental services in their area to reflect local needs and priorities. Subject to honouring existing contracts, PCTs are free to vary the balance of resources committed to general dental services and to specialist services such as orthodontics. PCTs may also make additional investment in services from within their total national health service resources, if they consider this an appropriate local priority. The Department has provided a range of guidance and support to PCTs to support effective commissioning of orthodontic services and help promote access to high-quality services.</p>

Additional meetings were held with the Netherlands in November 2006 and with German officials in March 2007. Officials have regular contact with the Commission and most recently met with Commission officials in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/2">The meetings were held to highlight the United Kingdom's (UK) position on supplements and discuss the outcome of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Board discussions on setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals. Member states were receptive to the ideas presented by the FSA but had not developed their own definitive positions in the absence of proposals from the Commission. The Commission welcomed the UK Government's response to the discussion document published in June 2006 on issues for setting levels of vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs and commented that previous work taken forward by the UK in 2003 on establishing safe upper levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be a key factor in developing future proposals. Ministers of other member states have not been engaged on the issue of setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements to date, but were receptive to the UK's views and wished to learn more about the UK's position.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/3">A meeting has not been held with Commissioner Markos Kyprianou to discuss the impact on consumer choice and the specialist manufacturing and retail sector of the implementation of the food supplements directive and the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in supplements under article 5 of that Directive. A future meeting has not been planned.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/4">Representations have been received from consumers on the interpretation and implementation of the food supplements directive, highlighting their concerns regarding the possibility that the Commission intends to propose restrictive daily dose levels for vitamin and mineral supplements and the potential consequent loss of consumer choice. The UK's key objective is for levels to be set based on a risk assessment, and for any controls to ensure safety for consumers and allow them to make informed choices. FSA officials will continue dialogue between the Commission and member states on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/5">Officials based in British embassies to other European Union member states have not indicated that they are taking action regarding promotion of the Government's objectives for the interpretation and implementation of the food supplements directive.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/6">Staff of the UK permanent representative in Brussels have been briefed on the Government's stated objectives for the interpretation and implementation of the food supplements directive and are speaking to the Commission directly.</p>

	<p pid="d.254W.5/1">Arrangements and charges for car parking on health care premises are a matter for individual national health service bodies, taking account of all the relevant local factors. This includes what, if any, concessions, exemptions or permits to offer staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.254W.5/2">NHS bodies have income generation powers which allow them to raise additional income by marketing any spare capacity resulting from a non-core function, or by exploiting intellectual property rights. Certain rules must be followed, including the fact that profits raised must be used to improve health services. Charging for car parking is a common example of an income generation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.254W.5/3">The Department issued revised and updated guidance on car parking schemes to the NHS in December 2006. This guidance includes recommendations that any scheme should take into consideration the needs of staff, including whether to provide subsidised or free parking for particular categories of staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.257W.9/1">Part one of the renal national service framework (NSF), which was published in 2004, sets out the Department's view of likely trends in the population requiring renal replacement therapy in the medium term. In the NSF, we estimated that numbers of people with end stage renal failure and requiring renal replacement therapy would increase to around 45,000 over the 10 years ending 2014. The projected overall annual growth rate in the population requiring renal replacement therapy averages 4.5 per cent. to 5 per cent. per year. A higher rate of growth (6 per cent. to 8 per cent.) is expected in the number of patients needing hospital-based haemodialysis, and in the number of elderly kidney patients.</p>

	<p pid="d.260W.8/1">The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) holds contracts with a number of companies for the supply of official veterinarians (OVs) and meat hygiene inspectors. The contracts specify the qualifications and level of technical competence required by the MHS. When deployed to approved establishments, the technical competence of all contract staff is assessed and monitored; in-depth initially and periodically thereafter. Each month the technical competency of contract staff is assessed by the MHS as part of contract performance management against a range of key performance indicators. Contractors will also periodically assess the technical competence of their staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.8/2">In addition to the above management checks, the MHS Internal Audit Unit undertakes audits in approved establishments to assess whether MHS teams, which may include contract OVs and meat hygiene inspectors, are carrying out their duties in line with written instructions and regulatory requirements. The Internal Audit Unit also audits contractors' procedures, including the recruitment, induction, training and development, and appraisal of contract OVs and meat hygiene inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.8/3">In cases where a contract veterinarian or meat hygiene inspector is assessed as not meeting the required level of technical competence, the employing contractor is instructed to remove the individual and provide a technically competent replacement.</p>

	<p pid="d.261W.5/1">The primary purpose of the national health service care records service (NHS CRS) is to support the delivery of care to patients. However, the aim is that data extracted from NHS services supporting direct patient care, including the NHS care records service, choose and book and electronic transmission of prescriptions, will be made available either in aggregate form or, where detailed information is provided, in anonymised or pseudonymised form, via the so-called secondary uses service. The use of consistent pseudonym enables individual cases to be tracked.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.5/2">Identifiable information will be available only where patient consent has been formally given or where specific permissions apply. Permission is required from the Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG), set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2001. The PIAG assesses each application to test that the use of patient information is justified, taking into account issues of confidentiality and consent.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.5/3">Access to the secondary uses service requires each user to be formally registered and to use individual smart card access, just as for other systems in the national programme for information technology. Each user is allocated a role which determines what reports, and what organisations or geography of data they may access. Key user activities, including logon and extraction of data, are recorded.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.5/4">The Secondary Uses Group set up by the Care Record Development Board to advise on the ethical use of patient data and how the potential for research, statistics and management can be realised without compromising confidentiality or security, is due to report shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.262W.0/1">Since the start of the national programme for information technology, the Department and NHS Connecting for Health have worked closely with individual, and groups of general practitioners (GPs), including the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Health Informatics Standing Group. At the outset, the aim was to ensure that the wealth of some 20 years experience in clinical computing, in particular clinical noting and medication management, was distilled into the output based specification (OBS) for the integrated care records service. The OBS, which was published in July 2003, set the template for the subsequent procurement of all the clinical systems. Week-long design workshops were held to clearly define complex areas of functionality, in which the input of many GPs, both individual, and as representatives from RCGP and British Medical Association committees, was key.</p>
	<p pid="d.262W.0/2">Since that time, representatives of around 60 professional organisations, including 14 Royal Colleges, among them the RCGP, have participated on national advisory groups which provide a forum for debate on development and implementation of the national programme, and the sharing of specialist expertise and experience of organisations that are already benefiting from IT implementation. Of NHS Connecting for Health's eight National Clinical Leads&mdash;senior figures representing different areas of the health service&mdash;two are for general practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="d.262W.0/3">NHS Connecting for Health continues to engage on a daily basis with clinicians throughout England, and as a direct result of feedback from clinicians, improvements continue to be made across the range of programmes. This involvement is impossible to quantify precisely, but equates to hundreds of staff years of input.</p>
	<p pid="d.262W.0/4">With regard to patient confidentiality, while no system can be 100 per cent. secure, we believe that the procedural and technical safeguards surrounding the new electronic care record service provide an unprecedented degree of assurance of security for national programme systems and services, and confidentiality of the personal data they will contain. With regard to specific evaluation arrangements, a ministerial taskforce was established in 2006 specifically to consider matters relating to confidentiality and patient consent. This taskforce reported in December 2006 and the follow-up actions are being overseen by an advisory group chaired by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. In addition, a contract for independent evaluation of the summary care record early adopter programme, now under way in the north- west, has been awarded to a team at University College London. The evaluation will involve extensive fieldwork to capture the views and experiences of GPs, practice managers, nurses, other NHS clinical and management staff, and, of course, patients. The final report of the evaluation will be published in summer 2008, but emerging findings will influence the continued rollout of the summary care record.</p>

Following the publication of the musculoskeletal services framework in July 2006, the 18 week orthopaedic project is working closely with the NHS to support the implementation of the good practice set out in the musculoskeletal services framework.</p>

As part of this, the NBS will consolidate blood processing and testing activity into fewer, modern, more flexible buildings.

	<p pid="d.272W.3/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have issued several items of guidance and technology appraisals that are pertinent to the delivery of psychological therapies, including guidelines on the management of depression and schizophrenia which both identified the effectiveness of psychological therapies. To support the local delivery of NICE Technology Appraisal TA097, we issued implementation guidance for computerised cognitive behavioural therapy in March 2007. In November 2005, the Department launched its improving access to psychological therapies programme. This programme is being extended to a further 10 sites (to add to the two original demonstration sites in Doncaster and Newham) in 2007-08. It is also working with primary care trust commissioners to examine how NICE evidence-based psychological therapies can be offered for patients with depression and anxiety disorders.</p>

	<p pid="d.279W.2/1">Information about the uptake of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and meningitis C vaccines, along with other childhood immunisations, is published annually in the Department's statistical bulletins. The latest bulletin, NHS Immunisation Statistics, England: 2005-06, has been placed in the Library and on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.279W.2/3">Information on uptake of pneumococcal vaccine in children is not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/4">The impact of vaccination on diseases has been immense. Before vaccination was introduced, there used to be over 500,000 cases of measles in some years. In recent years, the number of cases has been under 1,000. I would like to see the rise in MMR uptake to continue so that the number of cases of this serious but preventable disease decline significantly.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/5">The impact of the pneumococcal vaccination programme is already being seen through disease surveillance carried out on our behalf by the Health Protection Agency. The number of cases of serious pneumococcal infection caused by the strains of bacteria that the vaccine protects against is already declining in young children.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/6">The Meningitis C vaccination programme has been a great success, with the rates of the disease falling by over 97 per cent. in all age groups vaccinated.</p>

We monitor the overall use of ASBOs on an ongoing basis and adjust policy in response. We will continue to build on that and extend existing ASBO legislation as appropriate. For example, we announced that we would be seeking to put on a statutory footing the existing good practice, as set out in our comprehensive guidance, that juveniles' ASBOs should be reviewed after one year.</p>

We would not return any individual to a country where it was considered that there was a real risk that he/she would be tortured or made to suffer inhuman or degrading treatment.

	<p pid="d.289W.8/1">The Department used an independent contractor, Ufi, to conduct the pilot tests. Ufi have indicated that in respect of the pilot group as a whole, 73 per cent. of the 245 candidates who completed pilot tests achieved a pass.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.8/2">In seeking to establish the information requested on the average test results for British citizens, I can also provide further clarification to the hon. Gentleman about the figure of 25 per cent. given for British citizens participating in the pilot test given in my previous answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-16">16 April 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 470W. This figure of 25 per cent. referred to a benchmark figure of how many native speakers of English (of which British Citizens could be included) the Department asked Ufi to take part in the pilot scheme and not the nationality of participants.</p>
	<p pid="d.289W.8/3">Although the information collected cannot be broken down by nationality, this does not affect the usefulness of the pilot to developing the test proper. The test is not designed to compare whether citizens and non-citizens are achieving similar results and nor was the pilot conducted in that spirit.</p>

To manually examine files across all areas of the Department for specific procured items in each of the last five years would incur disproportionate cost, however, the total expenditure for promotional material for the financial year 2006-07 was &pound;110,000 and for 2005-06 &pound;101,000. Expenditure information for these two years is available following the implementation of the Department's Adelphi Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system Accounts Payable Module.</p>

	<p pid="d.302W.2/2">The Fixated Threat Assessment Centre (FTAC) was established in order to better protect the public and vulnerable individuals in response to evidence that a significant proportion of people who engage in bizarre communications or contact with prominent people in public life are severely and acutely mentally ill and urgently need professional help. A small but significant number of such individuals can pose a risk to the public, the prominent person, and themselves, particularly in environments where there are armed police officers. The Home Office, the Department of Health and the Metropolitan Police Service agreed to establish a joint police/mental health unit, on a pilot basis, to assess and manage the risk posed by such individuals. Where appropriate, FTAC will introduce (or reintroduce) the individuals into existing community mental health care through established pathways. If offences are disclosed, and the circumstances warrant such intervention, consideration will also be given to a criminal investigation.</p>
	<p pid="d.302W.2/3">Since its creation in October 2006, FTAC has dealt with 168 cases. FTAC does not detain people in psychiatric hospitals. When it encounters an individual in need of mental health care it alerts their general practitioners and psychiatrists, who then provide appropriate help under existing legislation. FTAC may make use of police powers under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to take a person who appears to be suffering from mental disorder, and in immediate need of care or control, to a place of safety. When people are removed to hospital under section 136, they are examined by a registered medical practitioner and interviewed by an approved social worker, not associated with FTAC, in order to make any necessary arrangements for their treatment or care. To date, FTAC personnel have used this power on nine occasions.</p>

	<p pid="d.305W.3/29">Since the merger of the Home Office Identity Cards Programme and the UK Passport Service to create the Identity and Passport Service on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, projects to deliver biometric passports, identity cards and other improvements have been necessarily combined. As much of the functionality needed to implement identity cards is also required for the implementation of biometric passports, this is the most cost-effective way to deliver these initiatives (e.g. both the implementation of biometric passports and identity cards will require a very similar application procedure as well the procurement of biometric recording equipment, data storage capability for biographical and biometric information and offices to facilitate enrolment).</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.3/30">As a result, much of the work conducted by Identity and Passport Service cannot be categorised, both financially and operationally, as contributing towards either the introduction of biometric passports or identity cards alone. The work is accounted for as future development projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.3/31">Equally, contracts with external organisations are signed on the basis of providing services to project or activities which can apply to both existing passport operational business as well as the future development of biometric passports, identity cards and future improvements. As a result, a breakdown of payments made to such organisations for the purposes of the development of identity cards or the National Identity Register in the financial year 2006-07 cannot be provided.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.3/32">However, the following provides a list of external organisations from which the Identity and Passport Service has obtained either consulting services and/or contracted staff in the financial year 2006-07 and the level of payment which has been attributed to the future development of both biometric passports, identity cards and associated improvements in that financial year. The list excludes payments attributed to organisations providing legal and professional services.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.3/33">Even without the introduction of identity cards, a significant proportion of this expenditure would have been required in order to prepare for the introduction of second biometric passports. Overall, it is estimated that around 70 per cent. of the total cost of the scheme would need to be incurred in order to introduce the second biometric passport incorporating fingerprint biometrics.</p>

	<p pid="d.320W.8/15">The system for financing police pensions changed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Under the new system, police authorities no longer have to meet the cost of pensions in payment out of their operating accounts. Police authorities now have a separate pensions account for this purpose, into which are paid officers' contributions and a new employer's contribution. Where the pensions account does not have enough funds to meet the cost of pensions in any year it is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. A key benefit of this change is that it takes away from police authorities the responsibility for meeting the rising cost of pensions in payment as a result of an increase in the number of pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="d.322W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.322W.5/2">The use of radio frequency identifiers (RFID) is regulated by Ofcom under the terms of the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Licenses may be granted setting out permitted power levels, frequency bands and antenna configurations to reduce the likelihood of interference with other radio spectrum users.</p>
	<p pid="d.322W.5/3">Harmonised standards maximise the benefits of RFID use in global supply chains. In January 2006 Ofcom responded to a recommendation from the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) making harmonised spectrum available for RFID use in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.322W.5/4">The need for further harmonisation was noted in the April 2007 European Commission Communication (7544/07) 'Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in Europe: steps towards a policy framework'. The Government support this approach.</p>
	<p pid="d.322W.5/5">RFID is an important business technology in food production, logistics, supply chain and retail. Information derived from it is used for quality assurance and audit and for efficient management of shipping, supply chain, warehousing and stock. It is used increasingly in documents, banknotes and ticketing to reduce counterfeiting. Millions of RFID enabled cards are used by commuters, easing access to transport systems. RFID is starting to be used in health care where it can significantly enhance patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="d.322W.5/6">Information derived from RFID normally describes objects. Where information pertains to, or is associated with, persons that information is subject to the terms of the Data Protection Act. The Government believe the current regulatory regime is adequate but keeps it under review in light of future technological and market developments.</p>

In the light of this, the Secretary of State and I reviewed the case and made the decision to grant Mr. Pun a settlement visa. Our decision was not taken lightly and reflected the extraordinary nature of this case, in particular Mr. Pun's heroic record in service of Britain which saw him awarded the Victoria Cross. Full account was also taken of Mr. Pun's current medical condition.</p>

	<p pid="d.352W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice will be making a contribution of &pound;2.4 million towards the implementation costs, the legal profession should fund the start up costs associated with establishing the proposed Legal Services Board and the Office for Legal Complaints. Legal service providers enjoy exclusive access in the provision of reserved legal services, which often leads to the commission of ancillary legal services. In addition the professions stand to benefit from the increased consumer confidence that these reforms will generate. It is, therefore, totally appropriate that they should meet both the implementation and running costs associated with legal services reform.</p>

	<p pid="d.366W.2/4" class="indent">How many deaths there have been following recorded injuries of children aged (a) 0 to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years which have taken place (i) in the home, (ii) at school, (iii) in hospital, (iv) on a sports ground or other place where sporting activities occur, (v) in public parks and (vi) in other places in each year since 1997; (144259)</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/5" class="indent">how many deaths there have been following recorded injuries of children aged (a) 0 to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years in each year since 1997; (144262)</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/6" class="indent">how many fatalities there were of children aged (a) zero to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years in each year since 1997; (144278)</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/7" class="indent">how many fatalities there were of children aged (a) zero to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years where the cause of death occurred in (i) the home, (ii) at school, (iii) in hospital, (iv) on a sports ground or similar space where sporting activities occur, (v) public parks and (vi) other places in each year since 1997. (144277)</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/8" class="indent">Not all of the information you requested exists. The Office for National Statistics does not collect information on recorded injuries but does collect data on all registered deaths, including those with an underlying cause of injury, categorised by coroner's verdict&mdash;accident, intentional self-harm, homicide, and injury of undetermined intent. Information on place of occurrence of death is collected at registration for all deaths.</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/9" class="indent">However, information on place of occurrence of the cause of death (i.e. where the person was when they were injured or became ill) is only collected on coroner's certificates of cause of death after inquest for deaths from injury and poisoning with a verdict of accident (including misadventure). The coroner is asked to select one often pre-specified categories of 'place where the accident occurred'.</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/10" class="indent">The place of accident is then coded by ONS according to the revision of the International Classification of Diseases in use at the time (Ninth Revision 'ICD-9' from 1979 to 2000, and Tenth Revision 'ICD-10' since 2001). 'Home' and 'place of sport or recreation', are specified categories in both revisions, but school and hospital are not. They are subsumed in much larger categories: both are in 'public building' in ICD-10, but hospital was classified in 'resident institution' in ICD-9. Place of occurrence of injury is not coded in the same way for deaths from transport accidents, but the vast majority of these are motor vehicle accidents, and for most the place of accident would be street or highway. We have shown transport accidents separately in attached tables.</p>
	<p pid="d.366W.2/11" class="indent">The tables below show the number of deaths in children by age group for all deaths, and deaths with a coroner's verdict of accident by place of occurrence of accident, between 1997 and 2005 in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="d.369W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.369W.8/2">The Government are working closely with the Design Council to ensure that the five key recommendations of Sir George Cox's Review of creativity in business are implemented effectively. Good progress is being made in all five areas:</p>
	<p pid="d.369W.8/3">Raising the awareness, understanding and performance by making widely available a Design Programme for Business&mdash;Regional Development Agencies are committed to implementing the Design Council's Designing Demand Programme and a full roll out across UK regions is expected by end 2007-08. The programme has already been rolled out in South Yorkshire, South East and West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="d.369W.8/4">Educating the next generation of business leaders, creative specialists and engineers while in higher education&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is appraising applications from six Higher Education Institutions to act as Centres of Excellence for the development of multidisciplinary courses. In May 2007 HEFCE awarded funding towards &pound;5.8 million for the first centre of excellence, in London. Design-London at RCA-Imperial will create an 'innovation triangle' between design (represented by the Royal College of Art), engineering and technology (represented by Imperial College Faculty of Engineering) and the business of innovation (represented by Imperial's Tanaka Business School).</p>
	<p pid="d.369W.8/5">Improving effectiveness of R and D Tax credits&mdash;Specialist units within HMRC launched in November 2006 are improving the consistency and certainty for firms claiming the R and D tax credit. Furthermore, in Budget 2007 the Government announced that it intends to increase the support available under R and D tax credits. The rate of relief for large companies will increase to 130 per cent. of qualifying R and D expenditure. In the case of the SME R and D tax credit scheme, the rate of relief will increase to 175 per cent. for companies claiming enhanced deductions against profits. The value of the payable credit available will remain broadly at its current value (24 per cent. of qualifying expenditure). The SME credit will also be extended to companies with 250-500 employees. Changes to the SME scheme are subject to State Aid clearance by the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.369W.8/6">Raising the profile of the UK's creative capabilities through a network of Centres of Creativity across the UK&mdash;A feasibility study by the London Development Agency (LDA) concluded that there is a strong case for an International Design-Business Exchange to act as an international market place for design led innovation, ideas and expertise. The Design Council is working with the LDA on how a prototype programme might operate.</p>
	<p pid="d.369W.8/7">Maximising the power of public sector procurement by encouraging more imaginative solutions from suppliers&mdash;The Office of Government Commerce is leading on this recommendation and there has been positive activity on early procurer engagement with suppliers, simplifying pre-qualification and forthcoming guidance on finding and procuring innovative solutions.</p>

	<p pid="d.371W.2/1">My right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="">10 May</phrase>, setting out actions the Government are taking to tackle the problem of so-called vulture funds. As he made clear, we are deeply concerned by the extent to which aggressively litigating creditors deplete the resources of developing countries, that might otherwise be used for productive social expenditures and poverty reduction. We are also concerned that these creditors are free-riding on the efforts of the international community, including through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), to cancel the debts of the world's poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.371W.2/2">Along with debt relief, the UK provides direct bilateral development assistance and multilateral development assistance, including through the EU, to the world's poorest countries. These countries also have other sources of revenue&mdash;not least from domestic taxation. In these circumstances, it is not possible for us to quantify a loss to the UK public purse. However, I share my hon. Friend's concern about the diversion of the limited resources of these countries away from productive social expenditures.</p>

	<p pid="d.389W.6/1">The Government view public service pensions as a key part of the remuneration package of public servants, aimed at attracting and rewarding the skills and professionalism required to maintain a high quality public sector work force. Like other employers, the Government have to manage the increasing pension costs associated with rising longevity. Public service pension schemes have been reformed or are undergoing reform in order to make them affordable and sustainable in future. Following the Public Services Forum agreement in 2005, the reforms being introduced in the three major unfunded public service pension schemes&mdash;the NHS, teachers and the civil service schemes&mdash;include increases in the normal pension age for new entrants and mechanisms that ensure that any future increases in cost will be shared fairly between employers and employees. In addition, there will also be an upper limit on the cost to the taxpayer, should costs increase.</p>

	<p pid="d.392W.6/1">The unfunded public service pension liability as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> was estimated to be &pound;530 billion, and a technical paper explaining the methodology underlying this estimate is in the House Library. A new estimate will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="d.392W.6/2">The total liability estimate covers all the pensions due to be paid to current and future pensioners in unfunded pension schemes, which will be paid at different times over the next eight decades, and which have been earned by around 10 million current and former public servants and their dependants over the last eight decades.</p>
	<p pid="d.392W.6/3">The cash payments needed to service these payments remain stable and fully affordable. In 2004-05, around &pound;18 billion was spent on paying unfunded, public service occupational pensions. This compares with around &pound;17 billion in 2003-04. Both of these figures are in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="d.392W.6/4">And as the latest Long Term Public Finance Report demonstrates, these annual cash payments are projected to remain completely affordable in the long-term, rising gradually to only 2 per cent. of GDP in 50 years time, contributing to the strong position the UK economy is in to meet the fiscal challenges of the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.413W.0/1">Section 3 (3) and (7) of the Tax Credits Act 2002 provides a general requirement for all claimants to be in the UK to be eligible for the child and working tax credits, unless prescribed exceptions apply. HMRC have a range of checks in place to determine the overall risk of a claim, both pre- and post-payment, and intervene where they suspect a claim may be wrong or fraudulent. These checks apply to all claimants, irrespective of nationality.</p>
	<p pid="d.413W.0/2">Claims by EU migrant workers for family benefits in the UK (child benefit and child tax credit) under the co-ordinating rules in EC Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 are subject to checks between HMRC and the competent authorities of the other member state on the composition of the worker's family resident in the other member state and whether family benefits are in payment in that other state. In addition, claimants may be required to provide a birth or adoption certificate for the child in question or a certified copy.</p>

A liability order is a document obtained from the court showing that they legally recognise that the debt is owing. This is the same in both England and Wales and Scotland. This is required before the Agency can use litigation powers (Diligence in Scotland).<br/> 3. Distress actions refers to bailiff actions in England and Wales. This is where, once the debt has been legally recognised, the Agency has passed the debt to a bailiff company for collection (or equivalent).<br/> 4. County court judgment orders apply only to England and Wales. Registers the person with a county court judgment order, which remains on their credit record for six years.<br/> 5. Third party debt orders in England and Wales instruct a third party to pay any funds owed to, or held on behalf of, the non-resident parent to the Agency instead. In practice, this is typically used for banks and building societies.<br/> 6. Charging orders in England and Wales are where a county court order for the legally recognised debt is attached to the equity in the non-resident parent's property. They are then unable to re-mortgage or sell the property without satisfying the debt. If they satisfy the debt by other means, the charge is removed.<br/> 7. Attachments refer to actions taken by sheriff officers in Scotland on the Agency's instruction to attach certain goods and remove for auction if the debt is not settled.<br/> 8. Arrestments refer to actions taken by sheriff officers in Scotland on the Agency's instruction to serve an arrestment on a third party holding funds owed to, or held on behalf of, the non-resident parent to pay to the Agency instead. In practice this is typically used for banks and building societies.<br/> 9. Bills of Inhibition in Scotland do not attach directly to the non-resident parent's property, but are a personal prohibition preventing heritable property being transferred, alienated or disposed of by the non-resident parent.<br/> 10. Note that the figures for the most recent months are provisional, and may be subject to retrospective revisions.<br/> 11. Figures are rounded to the nearest five.<br/> 12. The figures included in this table do not themselves have National Statistics status, but are included in this publication in order to give a fuller picture of the Agency's performance.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.428W.5/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.428W.5/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how long on average parents with care in receipt of benefits awaited payment in (a) old scheme and (b) new scheme Child Support Agency cases in each month since January 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.428W.5/6" class="indent">Such information as is available can be found in the attached table, which shows both the number of months that parents with care in receipt of benefits and with a positive liability, to whom maintenance is due have been awaiting payment from the non-resident parent and the median average wait experienced by all parents with care on benefits. Figures for the new scheme should be taken in the context of that for a new caseload, and that for the old scheme in the context of an ageing caseload that is no longer receiving any new cases. In addition, any increase in the total number of non-compliant cases should be viewed in the context of an increase in the overall caseload over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="d.428W.5/7" class="indent">It should be noted that, in establishing whether a parent with care was in receipt of benefit, the Agency has to match its data to DWP benefit data. The DWP information is only available on a quarterly basis; the latest available is for August 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.428W.5/8" class="indent">As you will be aware, the Agency has committed in its Operational Improvement Plan, published in February 2006, to improve performance, including that 80 per cent. of new applications will be cleared within 12 weeks of receipt by March 2009 and helping 200,000 more children to benefit from maintenance payments, equating to an additional &pound;140 million in maintenance collected, by March 2008, growing to &pound;250 million by March 2009.</p>

Where a deduction from earning order continues in force once liability has ceased, the Agency aims to reimburse such payments of child maintenance to employers, with ten working days following a request to reimburse. The Agency does not calculate interest accrued on individual payments. However the Agency is able to consider redress where the non-resident parent has suffered financial loss as a result of an error made by the Agency.</p>

	<p pid="d.431W.5/8" class="indent">In addition, although Magistrates are not able to consider the accuracy of the Agency's debt calculation, the Courts can dismiss an Agency Liability Order application following representation from the Non-Resident Parent.

	<p pid="d.433W.2/8" class="indent">The cost of publishing this information is negligible; information on successful prosecutions is currently gathered as a matter of course and publishing names on our website will take place as part of regular maintenance activity, any remaining cost relates to our decision to consult parents with care which places little burden on our resources.</p>
	<p pid="d.433W.2/9" class="indent">The number of names published on the Agency website is dependent on the numbers of non compliant non-resident parents found guilty in open court of refusing to provide information to enable child maintenance assessment to be made.

However we hope that even those who are most determined to avoid their legal responsibilities will respond positively, such that this measure is not required in the future.</p>

The table 1 of the QSS shows the reported caseload of the Child Support Agency between May 1999 and March 2007. The caseload before this date is not reported by the Quarterly Summary Statistics as changes in the calculation methodology mean that the numbers are not comparable.

	<p pid="d.439W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many unprocessed cases in each London borough were held by the Child Support Agency in each of the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.0/5" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. Any applications that have not yet been cleared can be regarded as outstanding. The amount of work required to achieve clearance and the elapsed time it involves varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.0/6" class="indent">I have provided the available information on uncleared cases in the attached table. It should be noted that that an uncleared application is not necessarily the same as an unprocessed one. Uncleared applications will be at varying stages in the application processes, with very few being completely unprocessed.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.0/7" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

We have excluded cases that have not yet reached the stage in the process where the postcode information has been confirmed, as it is not possible to associate them to a local authority. At March 2007 there were 35,200 cases with an 'unknown' Local Authority. This equates to 17% of all cases in March 2007.<br/>  5. The figures are subject to revision and therefore may differ slightly from previously released figures.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.449W.2/5" class="indent">The amount of child support maintenance assessed depends on the income of the non-resident parent and will therefore differ from case to case. The Agency believes parents on benefit have as much of a responsibility for their children's upkeep as those who are working. Child Support Reforms introduced in 2003 required non-resident parents on benefit to pay child support maintenance at a flat rate of &pound;5 per week. The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill will, subject to Parliamentary approval, increase the flat-rate amount payable to parents with care, from &pound;5 to &pound;7 per week.</p>
	<p pid="d.449W.2/6" class="indent">Parents with care who are also unable to work are of course eligible to claim benefit. Those on Income Support or income based Jobseekers Allowance will benefit from the Child Maintenance Premium which allows parents with care on benefit to keep a higher proportion of child support maintenance, up to &pound;10 each week without it affecting their benefit.</p>

	<p pid="d.472W.5/1">In the last five years, the Government have significantly improved the protection afforded to disabled people, including people with hearing impairments, under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). For example, from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>, we extended the employment provision of the Act to cover all employers and all previously excluded occupations with the exception of service in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="d.472W.5/2">The DDA requires employers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees or job applicants where the disabled person would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage compared with a non-disabled person. For a deaf person, this may include installing induction loops or visual warning displays in place of, or in addition to, audible warnings.</p>
	<p pid="d.472W.5/3">Provision of assistance for people with a hearing impairment is available through Access to Work. As well as giving advice and information to disabled people and employers, grants are available towards the approved costs that arise because of an individual's impairment. For example, Access to Work can help pay for communication support for people who are deaf or have a hearing impairment. Funding for Access to Work has increased from &pound;51 million in 2002-03 to &pound;64 million in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="d.472W.5/4">Updated and strengthened guidance on the provision of support workers, including communication support for deaf and hard of hearing people, was issued to all Access to Work Business Centres in December 2006. The guidance describes the types of support that may be suitable, for example sign language interpreters, lip speakers and palantypists, as well as the steps to take to establish the type and level of appropriate support.</p>

	<p pid="d.479W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning individuals undertaking voluntary work who wish to claim jobseeker's allowance (JSA). This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/4" class="indent">The Department recognises that not only does voluntary work make an invaluable contribution to society and local communities, but it can also help improve an individual's readiness for employment. In particular, those jobseekers who have been away from the labour market for some time will find a period of voluntary work not only develops important skills but also helps develop behaviours valuable to prospective employers.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/5" class="indent">For these reasons, arrangements are in place to ensure benefit recipients are not discouraged from undertaking voluntary work. Volunteers receiving any benefits can continue to perform their voluntary activity for as many hours as they wish, without affecting their benefit entitlement in any way. For JSA recipients, this is subject to the underlying conditions for JSA being met. These conditions include:</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/6" class="indent">being available for, and</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/7" class="indent">actively seeking work each week; and</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/8" class="indent">having a Jobseeker's Agreement in force.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/9" class="indent">JSA recipients are required to be able to take up employment immediately of up to 40 hours per week. Jobcentre Plus arrangements, however, provide an important exception to this rule for people undertaking voluntary work. These volunteers must be willing and able to take up employment on being given one week's notice and to attend a job interview within 48 hours. These arrangements allow volunteers to continue to receive benefits while being engaged in voluntary work.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.0/10" class="indent">In addition, Jobcentre Plus advisers treat involvement in voluntary work as one of the steps a jobseeker can take to improve their chance of securing work. The steps are recorded on the Jobseeker's Agreement, used to monitor jobsearch activities and to inform any additional help that the jobseeker may require.</p>

	<p pid="d.479W.3/5">For our income child poverty threshold we take the value of 60 per cent. of this median&mdash;the fact that we have cut this means that we have moved children from below 60 per cent. of median income to over this threshold.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.3/6">The mean income is the average of all individuals and is much higher than the median, this is because of the very high incomes at the top of the income distribution moving the average upwards; the mean is largely driven by the highest incomes.</p>
	<p pid="d.479W.3/7">By contrast, fraction-of-median poverty lines are unaffected by the highest incomes. Instead they focus, as is appropriate for a poverty measure, on the gap between the poorest and typical families, so they are very clearly measures of poverty rather than inequality.</p>

	<p pid="d.484W.2/1">New deal for young people is a mandatory programme for participants. Those who have not found work and left jobseeker's allowance after completing the Gateway part of the programme are required to participate in one of four Options: the Employment Option; the Full Time Education and Training Option; the Voluntary Sector Option or the Environment Task Force Option. Participants will discuss and agree the most appropriate Option with a Personal Adviser, taking into account their specific needs. Although it is compulsory for participants to choose an Option, it is not compulsory for them to undertake training or choose the Full Time Education and Training Option, whether joining the programme for the first or subsequent time.</p>

	<p pid="d.492W.6/1">The three surveys have different sample populations and provide alternative perspectives and information on pension provision and membership.</p>
	<p pid="d.492W.6/2">The Employers' Pension Provision (EPP) survey examines pension provision among private sector employers in Britain. Results focus on pension provision (occupational pension schemes, group personal pensions and stakeholder pension) analysed by size of employer. The survey also provides some information about the characteristics of employers that had no pension provision. This survey does not provide robust estimates of numbers of pension schemes and memberships as the interaction between employers and pension schemes is complex: some employers, particularly larger employers may have several pension schemes and some pension schemes are multi-employer schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.492W.6/3">The Occupational Pension Schemes Survey (OPSS) is now conducted by the Office for National Statistics and provides information about occupational schemes for both public and private sector employers. This survey provides more robust information about the number of schemes and scheme memberships than is available from the EPP. There will be double counting of scheme members within the OPSS results as an individual employee could be an active member of one scheme, but be a deferred member or in receipt of a pension from another scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.492W.6/4">The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) provides detailed information about job details, hours and earnings and employer-sponsored pension arrangements for employees. Results are used primarily to provide National Statistics estimates of average earnings, minimum wage and gender pay gap. Results from this survey provide analyses about demographic and socio-economic characteristics of pension scheme members (age, sex and income level) by scheme type which is not available from the other two surveys. This survey also provides valuable information about the characteristics of employees who are not active members of a pension scheme.</p>

This document contained further analysis on the personal accounts contribution limit and concluded that an annual limit of &pound;3,600 would be an appropriate figure. Such a figure will ensure that Personal Accounts will stay focused on the target market, complementing rather than competing with existing provision, while still providing moderate to low earners with sufficient room to meet benchmark replacement rates.</p>

	<p pid="d.495W.2/1">The processing of Pension Credit was delivered on an existing system, namely the Income Support Computer System. However to support the requirement for an enhanced customer experience and a targeted marketing campaign, a new Electronic Customer Relationship Management application was developed&mdash;Pension Credit Front End (PCFE). PCFE enabled the customer to provide the information required to make a Pension Credit application via the telephone, which resulted in a pre-completed application form being issued to the customer for them to return to the Pension Service.</p>

ASHE collects for individual employees their pensionable pay and the pension contribution amounts made by them and their employer for a pay period in April, and no apportioning to individuals is therefore necessary. For the 2005 survey special contributions were not explicitly excluded from the data collection. However, such payments made as lump sums that cover more than one employee cannot be easily attributed to an individual and so are not in scope of the ASHE survey. In addition as the survey collects data for a specific period in April it does not cover pay exclude the majority of special contributions made in that year.</p>

Pathways to Work will be rolled out nationally by April 2008, primarily via the private and voluntary sectors in 60 per cent. of the country. Contracts will not specify exactly what programme of support should be available, enabling providers to offer innovative work-focused support which is tailored to the needs of individual customers and could potentially include self employment training.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/2">Further assistance may also be available from Jobcentre Plus, which offers a wide range of practical and financial help to assist customers, such as career development loans. Specially trained personal advisers are available to discuss with customers any barrier that is preventing them from starting self-employment. They also provide a booklet 'Work For Yourself' which gives advice and information on starting a small business or arranging a franchise.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/3">They are also able to give advise on further sources of support; including The Prince's Trust, Business Link, Training for Work in Scotland and Work Based Learning in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/4">In addition, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) offers a wide range of small business support information and packages, including a small suite of grants, loans guarantees and subsidised consultancy to address a range of business issues. They also have information about finance and grants for starting up and developing a small business and can provide practical support for the key stages of innovation or research and development and helps businesses to become more efficient, competitive and profitable.</p>

	<p pid="d.511W.0/1">The one cabin bag per passenger is part of a package of measures to manage the current very real threat to aviation in the UK. The resulting reduction in the number of x-ray images per passenger ensures that the security checks are undertaken to the highest possible standard. The current security regulations are kept under constant review; and we have made clear throughout our readiness to remove the one bag limit once industry&mdash;collectively&mdash;is confident of its ability to deliver security effectively without it.</p>
	<p pid="d.511W.0/2">The Secretary of State and officials have discussed the current cabin baggage restrictions with industry representatives at formal meetings such as the National Aviation Security Committee, and also during informal discussions with airline and airport operators. Since security measures are discussed, minutes of meetings are classified Restricted, and it would not be appropriate to publish them.</p>

	<p pid="d.514W.8/1">The Department does not hold this information. Local authorities in England deliver a range of types of cycle training including Bikeability and other, less comprehensive, training such as the cycling proficiency test. Approximately a third of Year 6 pupils receive cycle training.</p>
	<p pid="d.514W.8/2">The Department has worked with over 20 organisations including local authorities, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the CTC to develop a new national cycle training Standard to update the old style cycling proficiency test to provide the on-road skills needed to handle modern traffic conditions. In March, we launched Bikeability&mdash;the award scheme for cyclists in England trained to the new standard. During the six month pilot phase, 5,000 children completed Bikeability training up to level 2: the level required to enable most children to cycle to school.</p>
	<p pid="d.514W.8/3">We are encouraging local authorities to deliver Bikeability training and have grants available to help both instructors with the cost of being trained to deliver Bikeability and local authorities to adopt national standards. Grants totalling &pound;1.25 million have also been made available this year to local authorities in England to provide additional training places.</p>

In addition the police now have powers to seize and dispose of any vehicles being found driven uninsured. Separately the Road Safety Act 2006 provided for a scheme of continuous insurance enforcement with significant penalties, including seizure of vehicles being used uninsured. The Department is currently preparing detailed implementation plans for this scheme. Once this scheme is operational we will be reviewing the full range of penalties and sanctions available to tackle uninsured driving, and to see what further actions might be needed.</p>

	<p pid="d.519W.8/1">Any limit is aimed primarily at persuading people not to drink and drive in the first place, rather than at a target for convictions, and so no specific assessment has been made of the effect of a 50mg legal limit on drink driving convictions. A change in the legal limit would require public consultation and the making of a statutory instrument subject to negative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="d.519W.8/2">Such a statutory instrument would require an impact assessment, which would include an assessment of the likely cost impact of a lower limit. An assessment of the estimated effect on road traffic casualties of lowering the legal alcohol limit was made in the Department's consultation paper &quot;Combating Drink Driving: Next Steps&quot; (February 1998), a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>

In the case of local pollutants, emissions depend greatly on the age of the vehicle and hence the emissions standards it was designed to meet. The following data are based on the vehicle emissions factors used in the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory which are derived from Department for Transport (and other) vehicle emissions test data. The figures quoted relate to average emissions over all UK roads for the year 2005 fleet. Emissions may be significantly different for specific sections of road and will decrease for subsequent years as vehicles meeting the latest emissions standards enter the fleet.</p>

Motor insurers are also required to keep information about the persons, or classes of person, entitled to drive a vehicle under any particular policy. For most private policies the drivers are specified on the policy. However fleet policies often cover the use of many hundreds or thousands of vehicles and drivers and in these cases the policy merely specifies a class of driver, for example, any authorised employee. Any requirement for insurers and others to record by individual name all drivers covered by a large fleet policy, and to process all changes to the lists of authorised drivers, would potentially be a large and onerous administrative burden which would have limited value to the enforcement authorities. It is not proposed to change the current arrangements, at the present time.</p>

The annual independent evaluations of the national safety camera programme show that conspicuous enforcement is proven to reduce speeding and accidents. The Department has not commissioned or reviewed research on the relative effectiveness of conspicuous and covert cameras at reducing the number of speeding motorists, but has always made clear that it remains open to the police to conduct covert enforcement of speed limits. The Department introduced high visibility speed enforcement in 2001 as part of the Government's decision to make the camera netting-off scheme available nationally.</p>

	<p pid="d.530W.2/1">On aircraft noise, the Government's objective is to strike a fair balance between the local and national benefits that can be gained from airport expansion and the local environmental costs that might be imposed on people who live nearest to airports.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.2/2">One of the aims of the 2003 Future of Air Transport White Paper was that the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise should be limited and, where possible, reduced. In helping airports deliver this aim, the Civil Aviation Act 2006 strengthened airport operators' powers to control noise at airports.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.2/3">The Environmental Noise Directive requires the production of strategic noise maps for large urban areas, major roads, major railways and major airports. The maps will be used to prepare noise action plans during 2008 setting out how environmental noise, including that from transport sources, will be managed. To inform the development of these plans, the Department for Transport will work closely with DEFRA and transport stakeholders in reviewing how transport noise is currently managed and what additional mitigation measures might be needed.</p>
	<p pid="d.530W.2/4">In assessing the impact of new road proposals on the environment, noise annoyance is taken into account in scheme appraisal. Road construction projects will include high standards of environmental mitigation to ensure that, so far as reasonably possible, the impact of noise is minimised in accordance with this policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.532W.8/1">The Secretary of State has made no assessment of the support services provided by local authorities. This is the responsibility of the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted).</p>
	<p pid="d.532W.8/2">In November 2006, the then inspectorate of children's services, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, published &quot;Adoption: messages from inspections of adoption agencies&quot;, which includes a chapter on supporting children in their new families. This report can be downloaded from the publications page on the Ofsted website:</p>

	<p pid="d.532W.8/4">In addition, as a part of its Adoption Research Initiative, the Department for Education and Skills has commissioned a study into the specialist support services available for birth parents in adoption cases and the services for supporting contact between birth parents and their children. The study is due to complete in June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.532W.8/5">In relation to fostering, the National Minimum Standards for Fostering Services require fostering service providers to have in place a clear strategy for working with and supporting their carers, including training and development, out of hours support and arrangements for reviews. The Fostering Services Regulations 2002 place an explicit duty on providers to provide carers with such training, support and information as appears necessary in the interests of the children placed with them. Fostering service providers' compliance with these Regulations and the National Minimum Standards is assessed by Ofsted as part of its inspections of fostering services.</p>

	<p pid="d.536W.3/2"><i> </i>Programme Led Pathways (PLPs) were introduced in 2004/05 for young people on courses of further education in colleges including study towards qualifications that form a mandatory part of an approved apprenticeship framework.</p>
	<p pid="d.536W.3/3">In 2004/05 the number of programme led pathways recorded was 40,510 (rounded to the nearest 10) or 18.7 per cent. of total starts.</p>
	<p pid="d.536W.3/4">PLPs were replaced by programme led apprenticeships (PLAs) in 2005/06. PLAs include those which would previously have been known as PLPs as well as apprenticeships, funded through the work based learning funding route, where the learners concerned are not yet employed. This change was made to provide a clear means to determine eligibility for education maintenance allowance (EMA). PLAs are not a substitute for employer led apprenticeships, which remain the preferred route for apprentices. They exist to enable young people who are not yet able to start an apprenticeship to study those elements of an apprenticeship that are able to be achieved outside an employed situation.</p>
	<p pid="d.536W.3/5">In 2005/06, using the criteria for PLAs under EMA, data from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) show 24,580 (rounded to the nearest 10) learners starting a programme led apprenticeship&mdash;12.3 per cent. of total starts on apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="d.536W.9/1">Bookstart, which delivers free packs to babies and children aged between 6-9 months, 18 months and 3 years, is not being extended. However, the Department is funding two new free book offers&mdash;Booktime and Booked Up. Booktime, the free book scheme for every 5-year-old, will be delivered in the autumn term 2007. Booktime aims to involve parents and carers in their child's reading and promote reading for pleasure. The free book, carefully selected by a panel of experts will be 'FunnyBones' by Allan and Janet Ahlberg.</p>
	<p pid="d.536W.9/2">Booked Up is the free book scheme for every 11-year-old and this will also be delivered in the autumn term 2007. Every child will be able to choose a free book from a choice of 12 titles, selected to encompass a wide range of reading abilities and interests. Booked Up aims to encourage independent reading and personal choice of material as well as reading for pleasure.</p>
	<p pid="d.536W.9/3">Booktrust is administering both Booktime and Booked Up and the Department is funding the organisation &pound;4 million to deliver both offers.</p>

Through work with Pathfinder and Wave 1 local authorities the level of PFI credits has been set at a rate whereby authorities may be expected to provide an additional contribution to their PFI projects, which DFES expects to be affordable. Each BSF project is unique and some local authorities seek to include elements/services outside of the scope of what DFES will fund for BSF. As a result, the contribution made by individual local authorities varies by project and the proportion of the total contract value which is expected to be funded through PFI credits will vary.</p>

	<p pid="d.537W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer<i> s</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.537W.5/2"><i> </i>All organisations that work with children share a commitment to safeguard and promote their welfare, and for many organisations that is underpinned by a statutory duty or duties. Local authorities that are children's services authorities have a number of specific duties to organise and plan services and to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Children's trusts are local area partnership arrangements, underpinned by the Children Act 2004 duty to cooperate, for bringing together key agencies which deliver services for children, young people and their families.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.5/3">Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 places a duty on key people and bodies to make arrangements to ensure that their functions are discharged with regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The application of this duty will vary according to the nature of each agency and its functions.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.5/4">Councils with local authority children's social services functions have particular responsibilities towards all children whose health or development may be impaired without the provision of services, or who are disabled (defined in the Children Act 1989 as children 'in need'). They should agree, with LSCB partners, criteria with local services and professionals as to when it is appropriate to make a referral to local authority children's social care in respect of a child in need. They should also agree the format for making a referral and sharing the information recorded.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.5/5">Professionals who phone local authority children's social care should confirm referrals in writing within 48 hours. The Common Assessment Framework provides a structure for the written referral. At the end of any discussion or dialogue about a child, the referrer (whether a professional or a member of the public or family) and local authority children's social care should be clear about proposed action, timescales and who will be taking it, or that no further action will be taken. The decision should be recorded by local authority children's social care and by the referrer (if a professional in another service). Local authority children's social care should acknowledge a written referral within one working day of receiving it. If the referrer has not received an acknowledgement within three working days, they should contact the local authority children's social care again.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.5/6">Local authority children's social care should decide and record next steps of action within one working day. This information should be consistent with the information set out in the Referral and Information Record (Department of Health, 2002). This decision should normally follow discussion with any referring professional/service and consideration of information held in any existing records, and involve discussion with other professionals and services as necessary (including the police, where a criminal offence may have been committed against a child). This initial consideration of the case should address&mdash;on the basis of the available evidence&mdash;whether there are concerns about the child's health and development or actual and/or potential harm that justifies and initial assessment to establish whether this child is possibly a child in need. Further action may also include referral to other agencies, the provision of advice or information, or no further action.</p>
	<p pid="d.537W.5/7">All child protection conferences, both initial and review, should have a dedicated person to take notes and produce a record of the meeting. The record of the conference is a crucial working document for all relevant professionals and the family. Cases where s47 inquiries do not result in the substantiation of referral concerns should be retained in accordance with agency retention policies. These policies should ensure that records are stored safely and can be retrieved promptly and efficiently.</p>

	<p pid="d.540W.3/2">The Department undertook analysis to find out whether ethnicity, after controlling for other factors, still had predictive power in explaining degree attainment. The 'Ethnicity and Degree Attainment' report, published in January 2007, concluded that much of the attainment gap between students from minority ethnic communities and their White peers could be explained by factors other than ethnicity (e.g. gender, prior attainment, disability, deprivation, subject, term-time accommodation, and age). However, even after controlling for these other factors, coming from a minority ethnic community was still found to have a statistically significant and negative effect on degree attainment. The research also showed that women are more likely to obtain a higher degree classification than men, except when it comes to attaining a first.</p>
	<p pid="d.540W.3/3">These findings do not automatically imply that there is some form of ethnic or gender bias within the HE system, and there are a number of other reasons which could explain the results obtained.</p>

That is why we undertook this research and why we have asked the Higher Education Academy and Equality Challenge Unit to work with Higher Education Institutions, to investigate these results further. This work is supported by Universities UK and GuildHE and will build upon existing good practice. We have to ensure that every student regardless of race or sex is given equal opportunity to succeed within Higher Education. The full report can be accessed here:</p>

	<p pid="d.572W.2/1">This is a matter for the Learning and Skills Council, who operate learner support schemes for 16 to 19-year-olds on behalf of the DfES and hold information on the costs involved in the schemes. Mark Haysom, the Council's chief executive, has written to the hon. Member with the information requested and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-23">23 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Question that asked, &quot;What the cost was of Learner Support Funds for 16 to 18 year olds in (a) 2005-06 and (b) 2006-07; and what the cost is expected to be in 2007-08&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/4" class="indent">The amount of Discretionary Learner Support Fund used to support students aged 16-18 (16-18 Hardship, School Sixth Forms Hardship and 16-18 Residential Bursaries) is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/5" class="indent">2005-06 &pound;40.6m (Actual Spend; 2005-06 Annual Accounts)</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/6" class="indent">2006-07 &pound;23.8m (Provisional Outturn)</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/7" class="indent">The over all Discretionary Learner Support Fund budget is available to support learners in both the 16-18 and 19 and over age groups. There is a high degree of flexibility in the budget and we are at an early stage in the year. We would not anticipate establishing the expected spend on discretionary LSF for learners aged 16-18 in 2007-08 until after the start of the academic year 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="d.572W.2/8" class="indent">I hope that you find that this information answers your question.</p>

However, we have consistently recognised that Chinese is an important subject and HEFCE has allocated an additional &pound;1 million a year as special funding to support Chinese between 1999-2000 and 2003-04 as a special initiative for Chinese studies to ensure that we maintain capacity in this subject.</p>

	<p pid="d.586W.6/1">The information requested is not collected centrally. Local authorities&mdash;in consultation with their School Forums&mdash;are responsible for deciding how best to apply their total school and early years funding across all age groups and between different types of provider, based on an assessment of local circumstances. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the levels of funding for providers in their area. The Schools, Early Years and 14-16 Funding consultation which closed on <phrase class="date" code="">1 June</phrase> set out a number of proposals for changes to the way the early years funding system operates. Ministers expect to announce final decisions over the summer, in the light of responses to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="d.588W.0/1">Schools must have regard to the SEN Code of Practice (2001). The Code recognises four main areas of Special Educational Need (SEN). These include (i) cognition and learning (ii) behavioural, emotional and social development (iii) communication and interaction and (iv) sensory and/or physical needs. Pupils with a range of difficulties including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) fall within the overall descriptor of BESD.</p>
	<p pid="d.588W.0/2">The monitoring of individual children's progress is set out in the Code through the graduated approach. This is a model of action and intervention in schools and early years education settings to help children who have SEN. The approach recognises that there is a continuum of special educational needs and that, where necessary, increasing specialist expertise should be brought to bear on the difficulties that a child may be experiencing. The graduated approach is applicable to the identification, assessment and provision for children and young people with BESD. Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Code explain in detail this approach and the additional support that may be needed at School Action and School Action Plus.</p>

The HPA reports that there is no consistent evidence of health effects from RF exposures below guideline levels. Becta therefore believes that there is no reason why schools and others should not use wi-fi equipment to benefit from the flexibility these technologies can provide.</p>

	<p pid="d.593W.2/1">The formula used to calculate the contextual value added (CVA) measures was developed over a number of years, initially taking advice from leading academics in the field and then refining the models through close consultation with schools, local authorities and teacher unions. All supported the introduction of CVA and we continue to maintain close links with schools, local authorities and their unions on the use of CVA and how the model might be further refined. Many of the changes made to the model through the development years were brought about thanks to the contribution of schools and their representative bodies.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/2">This has produced a formula which estimates the contribution each school makes to its pupils' attainment, taking account of each pupil's starting point and a broad range of contextual factors which are shown to affect progress and for which consistent national data are available. The formula is widely accepted by schools as providing a fairer basis for comparison of schools than either raw statistics of attainment or un-contextualised value added.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/3">The formula for each key stage is calculated each year based on the actual attainment of the entire national cohort of over half a million pupils, and has been found to be very stable year-on-year in terms of the effects of particular factors such as deprivation, which indicates its robustness. A paper produced by the DfES for the OECD Project on the Development of Value-Added Models in Education Systems discusses some of the more technical aspects of the model and addresses both the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen approach. This is available on the Department's Research and Statistics website.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/4">Development work continues each year to refine the models, including implementing any necessary changes arising from the evaluation of each pilot and taking account of improved sources of data as they become available.</p>

	<p pid="d.594W.6/1">In May 2007 the governing body of St. Thomas of Canterbury Primary School received the Secretary of State's consent to dispose of part of its detached playing field. Approval was given on condition that the land was sold for a price of not less than &pound;1.2 million and all of the sale proceeds were to be used to improve the school's remaining outdoor and indoor sports facilities. A further condition of approval was that a community user of the playing field subject to the application was guaranteed access to the school's remaining improved sports facilities.

	<p pid="d.595W.2/1">The Department does not have or collect any data on teachers who are diagnosed with any specific medical condition. However numbers of deaths from mesothelioma and asbestosis are published annually by HSE's Epidemiology and Medical Statistics Unit. They have also published an analysis of deaths from these diseases, between 1980 and 2000, which identifies teaching as a profession.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/2">We recently updated our Department's guidance on the management of asbestos in schools<sup>(1)</sup>. In addition, the HSE also recently updated its notice to governors, proprietors and head teachers of schools in England and Wales about the duty to manage the risk from asbestos in school buildings<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/3">There is no requirement to remove asbestos from buildings during refurbishment. The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations, as amended in 2004, do not require the automatic removal of Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM's). If the material is in good condition and will not be disturbed then it does not pose a health risk and it is usually safer to leave it in place and manage it. If the material is damaged or is likely to be disturbed and it cannot be repaired or protected, it should be removed.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/4">Anybody undertaking any sort of work on ACM's must be competent and adequately trained. Licensed contractors must be used for most work with asbestos insulation, asbestos insulating board and asbestos coatings.</p>

	<p pid="d.597W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to respond to questions you posed regarding what evidence is collected on the performance of Train to Gain skills brokers, what assessment has been made of the satisfaction levels of those using such brokerage services, Level 3 Trials and any assessment that has been made in the North West.</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/4" class="indentitalic"> Train to Gain: evidence collected on performance and satisfaction levels</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/5" class="indent">The performance of Train to Gain skills brokers against set targets is monitored and reported on a monthly basis. Monthly management information evidence includes employer engagement, employer size, sector data; skills broker referral destinations; learner profile, and employer satisfaction with the service provided by skills brokers. Performance against these targets has been reported each month since April 2006 and the information is used to manage the skills brokerage contractors.</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/6" class="indent">An independent survey of the skills brokerage service has been in place since the launch of Train to Gain in April 2006. The survey measures employers' satisfaction levels with the independence, impartiality and responsiveness of the skills brokerage service The current national satisfaction level with the service provided by skills brokerage organisations is 85.7%.</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/7" class="indentitalic"> Train to Gain: Level 3 Trials</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/8" class="indent">The Level 3 Trials have been running in the region since August 2006. In the first six months of operation the Trials did not perform well, with negligible learners on programme. As a consequence an early assessment of the Trials was carried out with providers within the region.</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/9" class="indent">The assessment of the Trials resulted in the Department for Education and Skills and the Minister for Skills agreeing to allow the LSC to amend the policy. This has reduced policy conflicts that existed between mainstream Further Education and the Trials.</p>
	<p pid="d.597W.9/10" class="indent">The LSC spent the early part of 2007 working with providers and Skills Brokers to both re-contract and communicate the policy changes. The changes are now implemented and the learner numbers in all Trial regions are increasing steadily month on month. Performance is still lower than we had anticipated but monitoring and further research is ongoing to ensure that issues relating to performance are understood.</p>

	<p pid="d.599W.0/1">Train to Gain is a major new service that will raise skill levels and the quality of training across England. It commenced in the 20 Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas covered by the former Employer Training Pilots (ETPs) from April 2006, and reached full coverage across England in August 2006. Full operational capacity will not be reached till the end of 2007-08 from which point we expect it to deliver 175,000 first full Level 2 achievements per year. As at the end of April 2007 over 40,000 employers had engaged with Train to Gain, 154,290 employees had commenced training and 32,800 learners had achieved a first full Level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="d.599W.0/2">Train to Gain offers employers a holistic service. Independent and impartial skills brokers help employers understand and meet their business needs. In some cases this can mean directly helping the employer in upskilling their workforce to gain basic skills and a range of qualifications from basics skills, such as literacy and numeracy to higher education qualifications. Skills Brokers also help employers identify potential sources of public funding, but also any likely contribution from employers, including paid time off for the individual to undertake the training. If the business need goes much wider than LSC funded provision, the Skills Broker will refer the employer to other services such as Jobcentre Plus, Investors in People, and Business Link for more general business advice as well as business to business networks. To date, more than 12,000 such referrals have been made to non training destinations.</p>
	<p pid="d.599W.0/3">It is therefore not possible to calculate a per capita cost per qualification that takes account of this added value of the Train to Gain service. We will, however, continue to develop more accurate methods of determining the gross added value of the service as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="d.599W.3/1">Train to Gain is a major new service that will raise skills levels and the quality of training across England. It commenced in 20 Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas covered by the former employer training pilots (ETPs) from April 2006, and reached full coverage across England in August 2006. Full operational capacity will not be reached until the end of 2007-08. In its first year of operation, it has already engaged more than 40,000 employers with some 70 per cent. of those defined as hard to reach (i.e. not recognised as an Investors in People and no recorded investment in training).</p>
	<p pid="d.599W.3/2">Independent and impartial Skills Brokers work with the employers to identify how skills might help them meet their business goals, including increased productivity. The Skills Brokers also help the employer identify possible sources of public funding available, as well as identifying the need for employer investment, in both funding for training and in paid time off for employees to study for the relevant qualification. Train to Gain continues to be evaluated on an ongoing basis and we already know that 85 per cent. of employers are satisfied with the service they are receiving. While it is too early to measure at a national level, we already know of many employers at regional and local level who have realised the benefits of investing in the skills of their work force and have returned to their Skills Broker for additional advice and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="d.599W.3/3">Train to Gain was developed from the employer training pilots and a full evaluation of those pilots was published in 2006. One of the findings was that 71 per cent. were more convinced that training less skilled employees can benefit the business. A copy of the report has been placed in the House Library.</p>

For those employees who do not already have a full level 2 qualification, the Government will provide funding to help them gain basic literacy and numeracy skills as well as their first full level 2 qualification.</p>

	<p pid="d.602W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your four recent questions about deaths of children listed here:</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/5" class="indent">How many deaths there have been following recorded injuries of children aged (a) 0 to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years which have taken place (i) in the home, (ii) at school, (iii) in hospital, (iv) on a sports ground or other place where sporting activities occur, (v) in public parks and (vi) in other places in each year since 1997; (144259)</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/6" class="indent">how many deaths there have been following recorded injuries of children aged (a) 0 to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years in each year since 1997; (144262)</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/7" class="indent">how many fatalities there were of children aged (a) zero to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years in each year since 1997; (144278)</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/8" class="indent">how many fatalities there were of children aged (a) zero to four, (b) five to eight, (c) nine to 12 and (d) 13 to 16 years where the cause of death occurred in (i) the home, (ii) at school, (iii) in hospital, (iv) on a sports ground or similar space where sporting activities occur, (v) public parks and (vi) other places in each year since 1997. (144277)</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/9" class="indent">Not all of the information you requested exists. The Office for National Statistics does not collect information on recorded injuries but does collect data on all registered deaths, including those with an underlying cause of injury, categorised by coroner's verdict&mdash;accident, intentional self-harm, homicide, and injury of undetermined intent. Information on place of occurrence of death is collected at registration for all deaths.</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/10" class="indent">However, information on place of occurrence of the cause of death (i.e. where the person was when they were injured or became ill) is only collected on coroner's certificates of cause of death after inquest for deaths from injury and poisoning with a verdict of accident (including misadventure). The coroner is asked to select one often pre-specified categories of 'place where the accident occurred'.</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/11" class="indent">The place of accident is then coded by ONS according to the revision of the International Classification of Diseases in use at the time (Ninth Revision 'ICD-9' from 1979 to 2000, and Tenth Revision 'ICD-10' since 2001). 'Home' and 'place of sport or recreation', are specified categories in both revisions, but school and hospital are not. They are subsumed in much larger categories: both are in 'public building' in ICD-10, but hospital was classified in 'resident institution' in ICD-9. Place of occurrence of injury is not coded in the same way for deaths from transport accidents, but the vast majority of these are motor vehicle accidents, and for most the place of accident would be street or highway. We have shown transport accidents separately in attached tables.</p>
	<p pid="d.602W.2/12" class="indent">The tables below show the number of deaths in children by age group for all deaths, and deaths with a coroner's verdict of accident by place of occurrence of accident, between 1997 and 2005 in England and Wales.</p>
