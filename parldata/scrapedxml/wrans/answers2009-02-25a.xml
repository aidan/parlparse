	<p pid="a.773W.7/14">Awarding body data on GCSE examination entries is analysed by the Department for Children, Schools and Families as part of the School and College Achievement and Attainment Tables publication. However, this work only covers qualifications entered for by 16-18 year olds. Therefore, we do not have information readily available on adults being entered for GCSE Mathematics examinations.</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.7/15">Due to the increased number of pupils taking and successfully passing a Maths GCSE at school, we would expect the volume of learners studying this qualification at a Further Education College to fall. In 1997, there were 534,700 15 year olds (academic age) attempting GCSE Mathematics and 250,300 achieving a C grade or higher (around 50 per cent. of those attempting the subject). In 2004, 606,000 pupils attempted GCSE Mathematics at the end of Key Stage 4 with 318,900 achieving a grade A*-C (around 53 per cent. of those attempting the subject). In 2008, 609,700 pupils attempted GCSE Mathematics at the end of Key Stage 4, with 361,100 achieving a grade A*-C (59 per cent. of those attempting the subject).</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.7/16">Over the last few years the Government have prioritised funding towards longer and fuller programmes such as full level 2 qualifications (equivalent of 5 A*-C GCSEs or vocational equivalent) away from a higher number of shorter courses. This has increased the number of adults achieving the broad platform of skills for entering and progressing into employment, but has necessarily resulted in an overall reduction in the number of LSC funded adult learners over this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.773W.7/17">A GCSE may not necessarily be the most appropriate learning outcome for many learners and colleges have been encouraged to advise learners to study the most relevant qualification to them. In 2007-08, learners on apprenticeship programmes (all ages) undertook over 156,000 Key Skills qualifications in Application of Number.</p>

	<p pid="a.775W.3/1">As stated in 'Innovation Nation', the revised format for SBRI has been prototyped with pilot competitions by the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health. Each Department ran two competitions in 2008, and each competition elicited a number of innovative responses from industry, demonstrating that the programme, in its revised form, has considerable potential to benefit departments as well as innovative companies. Experience from these pilots is being used to define the standard process, documentation, and support infrastructure needed for broader deployment, and to demonstrate the value of SBRI as a powerful innovation mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.3/2">The Technology Strategy Board, which manages the SBRI programme, is engaging with Departments to identify and define further opportunities for the use of SBRI over the next three years. A &pound;10 million competition with the Department for Communities and Local Government will be launched in March. The competition will encourage companies to demonstrate ways of improving the environmental sustainability of existing buildings. The Ministry of Defence, the Department of Health, and the Department for Transport also have advanced plans for SBRI competitions in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.2/1">Reading university has recently announced that it plans to cease providing social work degrees in order to strengthen other areas, from September 2011. However, Reading is only one of about 100 institutions providing social work courses for about 60,000 students nationally. We will be working across Government and in partnership with all those institutions which provide such courses to help them produce a social care workforce which is well trained for the extremely demanding jobs undertaken by social workers.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.5/1">There are no plans to suspend repayments for graduates earning less than &pound;30,000. Repayment terms are already generous, and heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. Borrowers with income-contingent student loans repay at a rate of 9 per cent. of earnings above the repayment threshold of &pound;15,000.

	<p pid="a.785W.2/1">Under current plans the sanctions that will apply will be similar to those in place for refusing to take the steps necessary to tackle other barriers to work. Currently, for failing to comply with a Jobseeker Direction, the claimant will incur two weeks benefit loss in the first instance, followed by four and 26 weeks loss for repeated failure to comply. Those on employment and support allowance can lose up to half of the work related activity component of their benefit for four weeks if they fail to meet with conditionality requirements. If they still fail to cooperate they can lose their work related activity component in full.</p>

Our expectation is to have a funding model based on 80 per cent. (outcome) and 20 per cent. (fee based) as originally announced.

Prior to that date, fraud was managed by regional directors as part of the overall business in Jobcentre Plus and directly comparable figures are not available. Additionally in April 2006, customer compliance teams were set up within each customer service region to look at those cases where there is an apparent irregularity that does not warrant a criminal investigation.

	<p pid="a.793W.2/1">Information is not available on the number of families in receipt of benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/2">Active intervention is key and at no time is this more important than in economic slowdowns. If it is becoming harder to find work, it is right that we do more to help, not less. This is why we are moving people from inactive benefits to the active regime of jobseeker's allowance if this will help them, even if this means an increase in the jobseeker's allowance count in the short term.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/3">We strongly believe that the welfare state should combine rights with responsibilities. Our welfare reforms have been built on this foundation, that in order to receive support during periods of unemployment people should be actively seeking work or making efforts to move closer to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/4">Our reforms have resulted in high numbers of people in work throughout the country, and have put an end to the rise in the number of people claiming incapacity benefits. We remain committed to further reform to reduce welfare dependency and support more people into work, provide greater support and control for disabled people and strengthen parental responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/5">Previous experience has taught us that the worst thing we can do in a downturn is to write people off, consigning them to a lifetime on benefits. We are investing an additional &pound;1.3 billion over the next two years to support Jobcentre Plus and our employment programmes; and a further &pound;0.5 billion to guarantee more support to people unemployed for six months or more by providing incentives for firms to hire, access to help in setting up a business, extra funding for training and opportunities for work-focused volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/6">Our Welfare Reform programme will allow us to bring about the most radical reform of the welfare state for generations. Our reforms promise greater support for people on benefits and a more flexible, personalised system to help them find sustainable employment. In return we expect people to take up this help, and work with us to help themselves. The Welfare Reform Bill will take the primary powers needed to complete the transformation of the welfare state, turning it from being essentially passive to profoundly active.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.2/2">The Government are doing everything it can to help those who become unemployed back into work as quickly as possible. We recognise that extra support is needed during the downturn, and a range of new help is being made available to jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/3">We are investing an extra &pound;1.3 billion to ensure that through Jobcentre Plus we can continue to provide personal help and advice to everyone who needs it&mdash;help in finding a job, filling in job applications and writing a CV plus advice on re-training and acquiring new skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/4">We also know the scarring effects of long-term unemployment both on individuals and on communities. It is important that the Government learn from the mistakes of previous recessions and by doing everything we can to prevent people who lose their jobs slipping inevitably into long-term unemployment. To address this we are investing a further &pound;0.5 billion to ensure the support available to people who lose their jobs increases the longer a person is unemployed. The package of support for people who are still unemployed after six months includes: employer &quot;Golden Hellos&quot; of up to &pound;2,500 to recruit and train people; support to set up a new business along with funding for the first months of trading; additional training places to help people develop work-related skills; and more opportunities to volunteer where this will help a person move towards work.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/5">And we are pressing ahead with our welfare reforms from this year that will increase support for unemployed people as their claim to benefit continues. We are creating a new contract for job seekers, promising help with skills and with employability.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.2/2">The Government already provide back-to-work support for those wishing to re-enter the labour market, including those aged 50 and over, through Jobcentre Plus, Local Employer Partnerships, the New Deal and Pathways to Work. We intend to extend this as detailed in the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/3">However, in response to the current economic downturn the Government have already committed &pound;0.5 billion additional support to help prevent people out of work from becoming long-term unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/4">We have doubled the resources available to the Rapid Response Service. The service offers support across the country for those people facing redundancy with immediate help and advice, including skills assessments and retraining, to ensure that people get back to work as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/5">From April, financial incentives of up to &pound;2,500 will be available to employers that recruit and train people who have been unemployed for six months or longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/6">In addition we have introduced extra funding for training places to help unemployed people get new skills to maximise their chances of getting jobs from the 500,000 vacancies in the economy, opportunities to volunteer to help people back into work habits and help to start a business with advice on creating a business plan, plus funding for the first months of trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.796W.2/7">A major factor in the employment of older people is employer behaviour. In addition to providing generic good practice guidance to employers, the UK's Age Positive initiative is working in partnership with business leaders to develop sector-based models of flexible retirement to support the increased employment and retention of older workers and the removal of fixed retirement ages.</p>

	<p pid="a.799W.2/1">The &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives&quot; strategy, published in January 2008, set out the Government's plan to reduce obesity, initially focusing on children. Every child should grow up eating well and enjoying being active and we want parents to have the knowledge and confidence to make this happen. There is no single, simple solution to reducing rates of overweight and obesity and therefore Government are taking action on a number of fronts.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.2/2">At a national level, the Government are promoting healthy eating and physical activity. The updated Child Health Promotion Programme was published in March 2008. It prioritises obesity prevention and physical activity by promoting positive parenting during pregnancy and the early years of children's lives. We are working to support as many mothers as possible to breastfeed and to continue to breastfeed for longer&mdash;helped by children's centres, health and other services, all promoting healthy weight. The Healthy Start initiative provides free vitamin supplements, vouchers for milk, fruit and vegetables for low-income pregnant women and children up to age four.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.2/3">The introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage for 0 to five-year-olds means that all early years education providers must promote the good health of children, by providing healthy, nutritious food and active play. The Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, sets out how Government will invest &pound;235 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 to develop play facilities for children of all ages. Ofcom have introduced restrictions on advertising foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) to children.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.2/4">At a local level, primary care trusts, working with local authorities, are responsible for co-ordinating work to tackle childhood obesity. PCT plans, developed alongside local authority children and young people's plans, will feed into local area agreements agreed with the Government offices. Local areas will develop and implement their own initiatives based on local needs and circumstances. 130 LAs have chosen to include in their local area agreement at least one child obesity indicator from the National Indicator Set.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.2/5">All this is supported by the Change4Life movement at a national and local level which aims to help families eat well, move more and live longer and which is initially focused on families with young children.

That is why the Government are investing nearly &pound;73million over the next three years in a package of proposals to improve social workers' capacity and skills. As part of this package, we have just announced plans to establish a social work taskforce to lead a nuts and bolts review of frontline social work practice that will inform further improvements in social worker training, recruitment and leadership.</p>

If some of a school's pupils whose home is not within walking distance of the school get to school by transport that is provided by the school or a local education authority, and that transport is not available because of adverse weather conditions, then if the school stays open, those pupils should be marked using code Y (forced and partial closure). Code Y does not count as absence in the statistics. All other children should be expected to attend and should be recorded as present/absent as normal. Our data do not enable us to alter the formula in any way that would isolate the absences due to inclement weather, or even for the days concerned&mdash;we only have total numbers of absences for each term and cannot isolate particular days (or even weeks). This does mean that the absence percentage for a school that stays open may be higher than if it had closed if significant numbers of pupils are unable to attend. However, our main focus is on persistent absence (which we define as missing 20 per cent. or more of possible sessions). It is unlikely that persistent absence would be significantly affected by short periods of adverse weather. Moreover when looking at attendance, Ofsted inspectors look at trends over time. When looking at registers, if there appear to be specific days or periods of time when there is high absence inspectors will discuss with the school the reasons for it. Similarly the national strategies will take account of such circumstances in their support and challenge work on persistent absence with LAs and schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.5/1">Schools are under a legal duty to promote race equality and it is compulsory for schools to have measures in place to prevent and tackle all forms of bullying, whatever the motivation. In March 2006 we published specialist guidance on bullying around race, religion and culture which focused on preventing and tackling racist and religious bullying in schools and included specific material on bullying related to anti-Semitism. We are funding the Anti-Bullying Alliance and national strategies to ensure the guidance is effectively embedded in local authorities and schools, and are monitoring the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.5/2">We have also published a toolkit to help schools contribute to the prevention of violent extremism. The toolkit includes advice on how to protect pupils from violent extremism, manage risks and respond to incidents locally, nationally or internationally that might have an impact on the school community.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.5/3">We do not collect data on bullying or incidents of intimidation centrally although we are aware that Jewish pupils can be particularly vulnerable to bullying. We intend to introduce a new statutory duty on schools to record all incidents of bullying between pupils later this year, and will specifically consult on whether schools should be obliged to record racist incidents.</p>

	<p pid="a.813W.3/1">Currently all schools should teach pupils about the effects of smoking and alcohol abuse, as part of drug education, through a well planned programme of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education. The Department's guidance, &quot;Drugs: Guidance for Schools&quot; (DfES 2004) sets out in broad terms what should be covered in each key stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/2">We announced our intention to make PSHE education statutory in October 2008, in recognition of the key role it plays in equipping children and young people with the knowledge and skills they need to lead healthy and successful lives. At the same time we launched an independent review of how this might be achieved in the most effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, the headteacher of Morpeth school in Tower Hamlets, is conducting the review and will report in April 2009. Proposals for the statutory implementation of PSHE will be the subject of a full public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/3">We cannot expect drug and alcohol education on its own to &quot;solve the drug problem&quot; in this country. That is why we are also increasing our focus on intervening with families at risk and continue to improve the support and treatment that the vulnerable young people who are most likely to develop a problem need.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/4">We need parents and Children's Services to join with schools and colleges to raise awareness amongst young people of the risks and impacts of drug and alcohol use.</p>

For that reason, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-29">29 January 2009</phrase>, we launched a consultation on 'Children, Young People and Alcohol' alongside the chief medical officer's guidance on 'safer drinking' to find out what information and advice parents and young people would find useful to inform their decisions about young people's drinking and to help reduce harms caused by it.</p>

	<p pid="a.815W.3/2">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is currently agreeing with school sixth forms the funding allocations for 2009/10. Those allocations will take account of the number of pupils schools recruited and retained in 2008/09 and whether this was above or below planned expectations. We anticipate that where numbers exceeded plans in 2008/09, this above planned growth will be consolidated into 2009/10 allocations. However, this will be subject to affordability.</p>
	<p pid="a.815W.3/3">Under the current system, grant funded providers (schools and further education colleges) do not have their funding allocation varied during the year unless they can demonstrate their allocation causes them financial difficulty. Where this is the case the LSC will consider, on a case by case basis, the need for extra funding in exceptional circumstances. However, as announced in the LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities, published in November 2008, the DCSF and LSC are currently considering whether a more flexible system of funding is needed to best ensure that funding matches learner choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.815W.6/2"><i> </i>Exceptional funding for a school sixth form is only available on a case-by-case basis either from a local authority (LA) or from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).</p>
	<p pid="a.815W.6/3">The financial viability of a sixth form cannot be distinguished from the overall financial viability of the school, which is the responsibility of the local authority. Local authorities have the discretion, through the School Finance (England) Regulations 2008, to support schools in financial difficulty providing that they have agreed with their schools forum the arrangements for implementation of such support. Where a school gets into a deficit it must agree a deficit recovery plan with the LA.</p>
	<p pid="a.815W.6/4">The only circumstances in which the LSC would consider exceptional financial support to a school sixth form would be if one year's funding allocation caused the school a particular financial difficulty. The LSC would consider such exceptional action only in relation to the individual circumstances arising in the school's sixth form.</p>

	<p pid="a.821W.3/1">We are greatly encouraged that, along with many other towns and cities across the country, Plymouth city council are planning to hold an Armed Forces Day event on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-27">27 June 2009</phrase>. Armed Forces Day builds on the success of previous Veterans Day events and is intended to provide an opportunity for the whole nation to celebrate our armed forces, past, present and future. We expect that the veteran's community, which includes all those who have served in the armed forces, widows and bereaved relatives of those who served and Merchant Mariners who saw duty on military operations, will remain very much at the centre of events.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.3/2">Plymouth city council applied to the Ministry of Defence for a grant of &pound;10,000 to assist towards the cost of their armed forces and veterans week and this has been awarded, together with the provisional allocation of a military band and a fly past from a DC3 of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight to support an memorial event planned for <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-28">28 June</phrase> on Plymouth Hoe.</p>

One strand of this work related to risk management, which was the subject of the discussion at the Burial and Cemeteries Advisory Group. A number of initiatives were undertaken by individual Departments, including the production of guidance by the Health and Safety Executive on simplifying risk assessments, and this Department facilitated workshops aimed at improving understanding of issues relating to risk, involving other Departments, insurers, local government, the voluntary sector and other sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.2/1">The information is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.2/2">Centralised police national computer (PNC) data only goes back to 2000, with incomplete data available for 1997-99 and no centralised data available from before 1997. As prison sentences of over six months remain unspent for 10 years, and prison sentences of over 30 months never become spent, the data available would not provide an accurate indicator of the total number of individuals with unspent convictions in England today.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.2/3">Moreover, data on whether convictions are spent or not is not routinely collected. It is only obtained when required for operational purposes (e.g. when a disclosure certificate is being prepared, or an individual is calculating whether they have to disclose a conviction). To produce a response to the question, even limited to the years for which there is central data, could therefore be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.840W.5/1">Sections 10 and 10A of the Representation of the People Act 1983, in combination with regulations made under that Act, require an application to be added to the electoral register to be made in writing and signed by the applicant. This applies whether the application is made in response to the annual canvass or at any other time. The effect is that a fresh application for registration cannot be made by telephone.</p>
	<p pid="a.840W.5/2">By virtue of section 10A(5)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983, once a person is registered, he is entitled to remain on the register until such time as the registration officer is unable to satisfy himself that the person is resident at the address&mdash;either because the annual canvass form was not returned or because insufficient information was obtained as to whether the elector was resident at the address at the conclusion of the canvass. There is nothing in this provision to prevent a registration officer from satisfying himself that a person is still resident at the address on the basis of information provided by telephone by the person. As a result, it is possible for registration officers to accept telephone confirmation of a person's continued entitlement to registration and, in such a case, the person's entry could remain in the register.</p>

	<p pid="a.842W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice does not hold information centrally concerning how many times hearings in each district have been postponed due to prosecution casework being incomplete or misdirected and this could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.3/2">However, figures for the prosecution's administrative lack of readiness in relation to vacated and ineffective trials are shown in the following table by Local Criminal Justice Board area. The data are gathered as part of the joint ineffective and vacated trial monitoring exercise and relies on the accurate recording of reasons that may, over time, be subject to amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.3/3">Nationally, the data for January to December 2008 shows that 4.3 per cent. of all vacated trials were vacated because of reasons associated to the prosecution's administrative lack of readiness. In relation to ineffective trials, the reasons associated to the prosecution's lack of readiness led to 1.7 per cent. of all trials being ineffective.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.3/4">Despite these relatively low figures, the Crown Prosecution Service has introduced a number of significant changes to its working practices to improve the effectiveness of its work in the magistrates' courts. These are under an initiative known as the 'Optimum Business Model' (OBM). The OBM comprises nine recommendations, the key element being the introduction of proactive case progression teams that ensure cases are ready in advance of the court hearing. OBM has focused on eliminating waste and duplication, streamlining processes and improving timeliness. It has been implemented across 40 of the 42 CPS areas to date and considerable benefits have been gained not least in the improved timeliness of the prosecution review of cases, in better rates of readiness for trial and responses to correspondence. A system has been introduced to record numbers of adjournments and the reasons why they occurred which is currently under review. Early indications show a reduction of adjournments overall in line with the introduction of criminal justice simple speedy summary (CJSSS) processes and the contribution of OBM.</p>

	<p pid="a.847W.5/1">The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005 to 2007 to replace the old F2052SH system.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/2">Any death in custody is a tragic event. The Government are committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in state custody. We are implementing many of the recommendations of Robert Fulton's Review of the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody. From April 2009, a new three tier Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody will replace the existing forum and the Ministerial Roundtable on Suicide.</p>

	<p pid="a.869W.5/1">The number of disclosure applications received by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in 2007-08 and 2008-09 to date is detailed in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.869W.5/4"> <td><i> Financial year</i></td> <td><i> Disclosure applications received (million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.869W.5/5"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>3.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.869W.5/6"> <td>2008-09 to date</td> <td>3.3</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.869W.5/9">The CRB has continued to receive a higher than anticipated volume of disclosure applications. There are a number of reasons for this, but the volumes have put a great deal of pressure on both the CRB and the police forces. Forces have been responding effectively and positively to these high intakes and this has enabled record numbers of disclosures to be issued in recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.869W.5/10">Unfortunately, it is taking more time for some local police forces to recruit and train the extra staff that they need to be operating at full capacity. Consequently, some applications are taking longer to deal with. That said, over 85 per cent. of all disclosure applications received by the CRB are being completed within the 28 day target figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.869W.5/11">For those forces which, for a variety of reasons, have been having greater difficulty with the increased demand, the CRB has been working very closely with them to address what additional help and support they may need. The CRB has provided assistance and support to them in the form of IT and workflow management expertise, accommodation and a 10 per cent. increase in staff resources. The CRB has also increased its own staff resources by 11 per cent. to provide support for the police disclosure units and the bureau continues to monitor their performance regularly.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.6/1">The Government are committed to reducing mixed sex accommodation to an absolute minimum. This means that men and women should not share sleeping accommodation unless this can be justified by their need for treatment. In mental health units, this should never happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/2">We have recently announced a package of measures as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/3" class="indent">a &pound;100 million 'Privacy and Dignity Fund' to support improvements&mdash;with changes using this money expected to be implemented by no later than June this year;</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/4" class="indent">tough financial penalties for those hospitals who do not deliver, (to be introduced from 2010-11); and</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/5" class="indent">the establishment of improvement teams to go into those hospitals that need more support, to help them focus on improving patient experience in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/6">We know from our success in driving down health care associated infections (HCAIs), that the improvement team approach has a good track record in delivery. We are therefore setting up a short-term central improvement team for mixed sex accommodation with an expected life of around six months. The intention is that thereafter responsibility will be devolved to the NHS. The fine details of who will be employed in the teams, and how they will be deployed will depend on local needs, and are currently being developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/7">Funding from the privacy and dignity fund will not be specifically attached to improvement teams, rather it will be distributed against detailed plans drawn up by each SHA. Distribution of resources within SHAs will be based on those schemes that demonstrate the greatest return for the planned investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/8">Our existing definitions in respect of the environment are still relevant, and are set out below. However, we have expanded this to move towards a definition based on individual patient experience, rather than on buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/9">It is not acceptable for people to share sleeping accommodation unless it can be clinically justified for each patient. Some of the circumstances in which this might apply are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/10" class="indent">patient needs very high-tech care, with one-to-one nursing (e.g. ICU, HDU);</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/11" class="indent">patient needs very specialised care, where one nurse might be caring for a small number of patients and cannot safely leave the room other than for very short periods (e.g. immediately following major surgery); and</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/12" class="indent">patient needs very urgent care (e.g. rapid admission following a heart attack)</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/13">Inevitably, applicability of the above circumstances calls for a fine judgement that needs to be made on an individual basis. For instance, in a four-bed bay, it means that mixing must be justifiable for all patients, not just one. It is also a judgement that needs to be revisited regularly&mdash;for example, in the very early stages following a stroke, when the patient has reduced consciousness and needs regular observation, then mixing might be justifiable. However, in the later stages of recovery, when the patient is receiving rehabilitation (or palliative care), then we would expect greater segregation.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/14">Men and women should not normally have to share sleeping accommodation or toilet facilities. Irrespective of where patients are, staff should always take the utmost care to respect their privacy and dignity.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/15">Single-sex accommodation can be provided in:</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/16" class="indent">single-sex wards (i.e. the whole ward is occupied by men or women but not both);</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/17" class="indent">single rooms with adjacent single-sex toilet and washing facilities (preferably en-suite); and</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/18" class="indent">single-sex accommodation within mixed wards (i.e. bays or rooms which accommodate either men or women, not both; with designated single-sex toilet and washing facilities preferably within or adjacent to the bay or room).</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/19">In addition, patients should not need to pass through opposite sex accommodation or toilet and washing facilitates to access their own.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.6/20">There are no exceptions to delivering high standards of privacy and dignity. The exceptions established under 'Mixed-sex accommodation: Health Service Circular 1998/143' were reporting exceptions only, and no longer apply.</p>

	<p pid="a.876W.2/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in partnership with professional bodies and other stakeholders, including patient groups and representatives of the national health service (NHS), has developed a national strategy to significantly reduce the incidence of multiple births resulting from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and related treatments. This strategy is known as the One at a Time campaign and includes promoting greater use of single embryo transfers (SET) where this is clinically appropriate for individual patients, leaving scope for the exercise of clinical discretion. The Department has observer status on the group that has determined the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.2/2">The HFEA policy aims to lower the average national multiple birth rate from the current rate of just under 23 per cent. of all live birth events following IVF and related treatments to 10 per cent. For 2009, HFEA licensed treatment centres are expected not to exceed the 24 per cent. figure, a figure determined by the HFEA, on the basis of national average at the time the Year 1 target was agreed. This target will be progressively lowered towards a 10 per cent. national target. The HFEA will carefully monitor the impact of its policy, including any impact on fresh embryo treatment cycle pregnancy rates, to ensure that all the target rates set are appropriate. The HFEA will set a Year 2 maximum multiple birth rate in the light of progress during 2009. The HFEA wrote to all directors of public health in primary care trusts about this on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-04">4 February 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.2/3">The HFEA has required all licensed treatment centres to have in place a documented multiple births minimisation strategy, setting out how they intend to reduce their annual multiple birth rates and to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum rate set. These strategies must include criteria for SET. Centres are required to send copies of their strategies to the HFEA.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.2/4">The Department has established an expert group on commissioning NHS infertility provision to identify the barriers to the implementation of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) fertility guideline in England and to help NHS commissioners to progress towards full implementation of the guideline. The expert group produced an interim report in August 2008, which recognised that patients are more likely to accept SET if they are assured that provision of services is established in line with the NICE guideline.</p>

Educational resources were distributed to all community pharmacies in March 2007, to help them provide healthy lifestyle advice in a consistent manner. They are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.881W.0/1">Good progress is being made in implementing the White Paper &quot;Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths&mdash;delivering the future&quot; to achieve the Government's future vision for pharmaceutical services in this country. The two national clinical directors for pharmacy have been appointed to champion the development of pharmaceutical services and help deliver the White Paper's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/2">As chapter 3 of the White Paper sets out, we are keen to improve the way medicines are accessed and used. Research has been commissioned from the universities of York and London to examine the scale and cost of medicines wasted, as well as the complex and varied reasons why people do not take their medicines as intended. The findings are expected later this year and will inform policy development for influencing both health professionals and members of the public to reduce the amount of unwanted medicines and provide value for money for the national health service. The figure of &pound;100 million for the costs of unwanted and unused medicines in the White Paper is no more than a cautious estimate. The 2000 Spending Review stated that &quot;various small scale studies have suggested that the value of medicines returned to pharmacies amounts to 1.5-2 per cent. of the overall drugs bill&quot;, which was &pound;5,160 million in 2000-01. No estimate has been made of this cost in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/3">The research on the extent and reasons why medicines are not used will also inform measures to support adherence to medicines. These measures will be subject to discussions with key stakeholders and interested parties, taking into account guidance, such as the recently published report from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) &quot;Medicines adherence: Involving patients in decisions about prescribed medicines and supporting adherence&quot; published in January 2009, as well as local enhanced services already being commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs).</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/4">Information on the services PCTs commission from community pharmacies to stock medicines that people may need at the end of their life is a local enhanced service termed 'on demand availability of specialist drugs' is contained in table 6 of &quot;General Pharmaceutical Services in England and Wales 1998-00 to 2007-08&quot; and a breakdown by PCT is in its online appendix&mdash;both of which were published by the Information Centre for health and social care in November 2008. Copies of the documents have already been placed in the Library. Home delivery services are commissioned by PCTs according to patients' needs locally. Many pharmacies voluntarily provide such a service.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/5">Pharmacists have been established reporters to the yellow card scheme since 1998. They have a particularly important role in detecting and reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in association with over the counter medicines including herbal products and newly reclassified medicines. By the end of January 2009, the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had received in excess of 20,000 reports from the profession, contributing 13 per cent., of all yellow cards annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/6">The MHRA recognises that pharmacists have a crucial role to play in pharmacovigilance, not just in the submission of suspected ADR reports, but also in raising public awareness of patient reporting. Following a successful national campaign to raise awareness of the yellow card scheme in community pharmacies during 2008, there was a 50 per cent. increase in patient reporting and a doubling in online reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/7">The MHRA is now exploring further use of the pharmacy network in conjunction with the chief pharmaceutical officer for England. To recognise the important role pharmacists play in pharmacovigilance, specific information pages for pharmacists are being launched on the MHRA website at the end of February 2009. These will provide up to date information and guidance on ADR reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/8">A wider range of services is being commissioned from pharmacies according to local need. Some PCTs are commissioning community pharmacies to provide seasonal influenza vaccination following training and accreditation, to help GPs attain their targets. Information on the proportion of all pharmacies providing this service is not collected centrally. In many parts of the country, pharmacies are one of the main sources of access to emergency hormonal contraception, either through over the counter sales or through the use of patient group directions. In addition, a total of &pound;26.8 million of additional funding has been allocated in 2008-09 to special health authorities (SHAs) and PCTs to improve women's knowledge of, and access to, the full range of contraception, to help reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and abortions. It is for SHAs and PCTs to determine how to use this funding most effectively to meet the needs of their local populations. SHAs have been working with PCTs to agree local action plans to develop innovative schemes, including pharmacy-based schemes, to improve awareness of and access to all types of contraception. The extent to which pharmacies have been included in local schemes to help reduce unintended pregnancies has not been assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/9">Many pharmacies are already providing services to people with diabetes&mdash;ranging from blood glucose testing and carrying out blood pressure measurements to providing healthy lifestyle advice. The Department is working with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the National Pharmacy Association to develop resources to support the further integration of pharmacy into the care of people with diabetes, which will be endorsed by the national clinical director for diabetes and the chief pharmaceutical officer for England. These resources, expected to be completed by autumn 2009, will identify how pharmacy can play its part in the integrated care of people with diabetes to help ensure that patients get seamless care.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/10">Pharmacists also have an important role in raising awareness of symptoms of cancer. The Department has funded leaflets containing key messages on lung cancer awareness, which will be distributed to all community pharmacies shortly. The Department will be discussing with key stakeholders and interested parties, how best to incorporate referral systems for people with symptoms indicative of cancer, within the community pharmacy contractual framework. The Department is also considering how to engage pharmacists further in raising awareness of other cancers and referring on to other healthcare professionals, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/11">The introduction of a support service for people who are newly prescribed a medicine to treat a long-term condition will be informed by ongoing discussions with key stakeholders and interested parties, as will the incorporation of minor ailments schemes within the community pharmacy contractual framework. Both services will take account of local enhanced services already being commissioned by PCTs, research into public awareness and knowledge, and will be subject to further negotiation. Similarly, the use of directed enhanced services within the community pharmacy contractual framework is subject to further discussions and negotiations taking into account local enhanced services already being commissioned by PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/12">No estimate has been made of the proportion of pharmacy consultations, which result in referrals to other healthcare services, as this information is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/13">In keeping with the NHS next stage review, pharmacy has an important role in prevention, as well as treatment. The public health leadership forum for pharmacy has identified its work programme for 2008-09 as the development of educational resources on sustainable development, sexual health and mental health for distribution to all community pharmacies in England. Resources for sustainable development were published and distributed in September 2008. The resources for sexual health and mental health are expected to be published by the end of 2009. The Forum has agreed that its programme of work for 2009-10 will consist of:</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/14" class="indent">developing a model for healthy living centre pharmacies, which will identify the services that might be provided as well as what such pharmacies might look like;</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/15" class="indent">taking steps to enable pharmacy staff to become health trainers; and</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/16" class="indent">facilitating the development of a plan to develop leadership training for senior pharmacists working within PCTs so they can influence commissioning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/17">Initial scoping of the extent of the provision of specialist pharmacy services across England has been completed and advice is being sought from the specialist commissioning group directors network and the national specialist commissioning group on the commissioning of these services.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/18">These developments need to be underpinned by effective professional relationships, communications and information technology. The Department asked NHS employers in 2008 to convene and lead a working group of pharmacy, medical and public representatives to formulate a series of actions to promote more effective professional relationships. Further details of the working group are held by NHS employers. One aspect of the group's remit was to identify and agree mechanisms that can support further incremental implementation of repeat dispensing. In January 2009, the working group published &quot;Guidance for the implementation of repeat dispensing&quot; for general practices, to support this. A copy has been placed in the Library. In addition, the working group have published guidance for general practices on the medicines use review service, and have issued a joint letter to community pharmacists, general practitioners and their local representatives to help facilitate discussions between general practitioners GPs and pharmacists on key work areas including repeat dispensing.

	<p pid="a.881W.0/20">To support communication planning the Department commissioned an extensive qualitative research programme in September 2008 that was completed, as scheduled, in December. The research identified key segments within the population and gave insight into their differing uses of, and attitudes towards, pharmacy. The Department is considering the implications of these findings for the communications programme and expects to publish the research together with an outline communications plan later this spring. Further qualitative research is being commissioned by the Department on the opinions of the pharmacy profession towards delivering the services outlined in the White Paper. This research will be completed by this summer. &pound;65,000 has been spent in 2008-09 to date on the research to support the communications programme. Estimates for future years' expenditure are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/21">A pharmacy information technology programme is being established by the Department and NHS Connecting for Health. One of its first responsibilities will be to progress the White Paper commitment to electronically capture information about interventions made and advice given, by pharmacists.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/22">Structural and legislative reform is also needed and the Department consulted on a number of proposals in autumn 2008, including PCTs assessing pharmaceutical needs. A preliminary report of the outcome of that consultation on those elements which require changes to the primary legislation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-16">16 January 2009</phrase> alongside the Health Bill 2009. The Bill proposes placing a requirement on PCTs to undertake and to publish their assessments of pharmaceutical needs. Subject to parliamentary approval, regulations would then set out the structure and content of these assessments, how PCTs should carry them out and the requirements for publication. The Department expects to work closely with interested parties, including NHS and contractors' representatives, on drafting the regulations. At this stage, the Department does not propose to pilot these requirements, but to roll them out across PCTs with appropriate support and training programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/23">The Department asked NHS Employers to set up a short-term working group in 2008 to review the structure of, and data requirements for, PCTs pharmaceutical needs assessments and to develop a support programme so that these assessments will be an effective and robust commissioning tool, which support local decisions. NHS employers published the first element of this support programme&mdash;&quot;Guidance for PCTs on pharmaceutical needs assessments (PNAs) as part of world class commissioning&quot;, which has been prepared to dovetail with the world-class commissioning programme&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-07">7 January 2009</phrase>. A copy has been placed in the Library. It is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/24" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nhsemployers.org/PNAguidance">www.nhsemployers.org/PNAguidance</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/25">Further resources will be published later this spring. These will include guidance on how to commission pharmaceutical services and more detailed advice on the information these needs assessments should contain. These resources are designed to provide a comprehensive support programme for PCTs to achieve the necessary capability to be world-class commissioners of high quality pharmaceutical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/26">The Department is committed to continuing to work with the NHS and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee to devise proposals to ensure that effective arrangements are in place to address unwarranted variations in standards and quality of pharmaceutical service delivery. Following consultation last autumn, provisions in the Health Bill 2009 will, subject to parliamentary approval, introduce new powers to enable PCTs, through regulations, to issue remedial notices to contractors or to withhold payments due to them. These new powers will form part of the Department's programme to ensure appropriate discretionary levers are available to PCTs to secure quality pharmaceutical services and to manage contractors' performance. Subject to discussions with key stakeholders and negotiation, this will be supported by strengthening the clinical governance requirements of the contractual framework which already require amongst other things, contractors to carry out an annual patient survey and one pharmacy-based and one multi-disciplinary audit. These audits are undertaken locally and no data is held on them centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/27">Research to inform future developments and an appropriate pharmacy workforce are also important. Research into pharmaceutical services is a relatively new area. Its focus has largely been on the acceptability and uptake of services by the public and on perceptions of the profession and their job satisfaction. Measures to date have largely been expressed in terms of inputs and outputs, rather than in terms of service quality, outcomes and relative cost effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/28">Therefore, chapter 6 of the White Paper sets out action by the chief pharmaceutical officer for England to convene an expert panel to advise on research priorities to improve the evidence base underpinning the value and effectiveness of pharmacy services.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/29">This will be informed by:</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/30" class="indent">the extensive and ongoing qualitative research programme commissioned through the pharmacy White Paper;</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/31" class="indent">the ongoing composite review of the relevant research literature on the contribution of community pharmacy to improving the public's health, covering the period 1990-2007, which will be completed and published in due course; and</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/32" class="indent">the outcome of an event hosted by the Pharmacy Practice Research Trust, held on the 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-06">6 November 2008</phrase>, to which the chief pharmaceutical officer for England contributed. The event was designed to begin to develop a UK wide research strategy for pharmacy and brought together key stakeholders across pharmacy and academia to initiate discussions around the concept of an overarching profession led UK wide research strategy for pharmacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.0/33">Pharmacy workforce planning forms part of the arrangements to strengthen workforce planning for all professions set out in &quot;A High Quality Workforce&quot;, published in July 2008. A copy has been placed in the Library. The chief pharmaceutical officer for England has established the modernising pharmacy careers programme board to provide professional advice and scrutiny on workforce plans where these concern pharmacists and other pharmacy staff (for example pharmacy technicians) providing NHS services. The pharmacy professional advisory board will work closely with Medical Education, England, which will provide professional, high level scrutiny of and advice on the quality of workforce planning at a national level for doctors, dentists, pharmacists and healthcare scientists. Arrangements are in place for the modernising pharmacy careers programme board's first meeting in February 2009</p>

Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 2. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years {particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 4. Number of admissions in which the patient had a 'poisoning (improper use) by steroids'<sup>(1)</sup> primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of admissions where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each admission episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.890W.2/1">As with all medicines authorised in the United Kingdom, the safety of Vioxx (a selective COX-2 inhibitor for the treatment of arthritic conditions and acute pain), the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants and salmeterol (a long-acting adrenoceptor beta agonist, or LABA, used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are kept under close and continuous scrutiny by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using a wide variety of data sources. These include spontaneous adverse drug data from the UK and worldwide, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, worldwide published medical literature, data from the manufacturer and information from worldwide regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/2">If a new safety issue is identified, the MHRA thoroughly evaluates all relevant data with input from UK and European Expert Advisory Committees, as necessary. Action is taken where appropriate to minimise risk to patients, optimise safe use and issue updated prescribing advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/3">Vioxx (rofecoxib) was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturers in 2004 when the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events became apparent. Although no formal research was undertaken directly by the Department, all available safety information was continuously evaluated by the MHRA as it emerged. Throughout these reviews, additional data and analyses were requested from the company where necessary to facilitate thorough assessment. Product information for prescribers and patients was updated during the course of these reviews, in line with expert advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/4">In response to public concern, in May 2003, an Expert Working Group was established to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the available data relating to the safety of SSRI antidepressants, in particular, the risk of suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The Expert Group considered the findings of laboratory, clinical and observational studies along with information relating to reports of patient experiences. In relation to the risk of suicidal behaviour, the MHRA conducted a study using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Full information on the data considered as part of this review has been published in the group's report which is available on the MHRA's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON1004259">www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON1004259</a></p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/6">A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/7">Since completion of this review, every effort has been made by the MHRA to evaluate new data as it has arisen and issue updated prescribing advice as appropriate. This has included updated advice regarding safety of use of paroxetine in pregnancy following findings from new international studies that certain birth defects are more common in babies whose mothers took paroxetine early in pregnancy. Further advice has also been issued regarding the risk of suicidal behaviour to reflect the findings of review of data from clinical trials conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/8">The MHRA has evaluated the risk of side effects associated with use of salmeterol on a number of occasions, leading to updates to product information and communications to remind health care professionals of the appropriate use of LABAs in the treatment of asthma. The balance of risks and benefits of LABAs was recently reviewed and considered to be favourable in the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents, provided they are used with inhaled corticosteroids.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/9">The MHRA have not received any applications for marketing authorisations for complementary or alternative medicines for the treatment of major conditions such as osteoarthritis or asthma, therefore the MHRA has not undertaken or evaluated any research in this area. The MHRA do not have any specific plans to undertake such research but would assess all data associated with any application, should one be received in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.2/10">Some years ago, the MHRA considered a number of applications for marketing authorisations for products containing St. John's Wort ('Hypericum perforatum' L.) for mild to moderate depression. The data submitted by the companies intending to market the products, including any UK and international research, was thoroughly reviewed. However, the applications were refused due to lack of adequate evidence of safety and efficacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.892W.10/1">The capital adequacy ratio is the ratio of a bank's capital expressed as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.10/2">The regulatory minimum ratio derives from the Basel 2 Accord, implemented in the European Union via the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> (Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC). The framework consists of three pillars. Pillar 1 sets the minimum capital requirements required to meet credit, market and operational risks. Pillar 2 requires firms and supervisors (in this case the Financial Services Authority&mdash;FSA) to take a view on whether a firm should hold additional capital against risks not covered in Pillar 1. Pillar 3 requires firms to publish certain details of their capital and risk management.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.10/3">Full details of these capital requirements can be found in FSA &quot;GENPRU&quot; and &quot;BIPRU&quot; rulebooks, available via the FSA's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.10/4">The regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratio under Pillar 1 is 8 per cent. of total capital; of which a minimum of 4 per cent. must be tier 1 capital, which includes ordinary shares and reserves. In practice firms' regulatory capital may be higher than this, and firms may also decide to hold more capital than the regulatory minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.10/5">As the FSA made clear in its statement of <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January</phrase>, the purpose of the recent bank recapitalisation exercise was to ensure that participating institutions held sufficient capital to ensure a buffer against challenging economic conditions. This did not constitute creating new statutory capital requirements for the UK banking sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.895W.0/2">HMRC uses the term 'security incident' to relate to a wide range of security breaches, including unlocked cupboards or drawers within a locked building as well as losses, theft, suspicious behaviour and vandalism. These incidents also include near misses, which are monitored to identify potential weaknesses so that they can be put right. HMRC takes every security incident report seriously and deals with each one in accordance with its departmental guidance and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/3">Since HM Revenue and Customs' creation in April 2005 there have been a total of 11,266 reported security incidents among approximately 90,000 staff. HMRC has improved centralised control mechanisms and raised staff awareness about the importance of data security and the need to report all incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/4">All incidents relating to personal data are investigated by senior managers within the responsible business area and incidents designated as serious are elevated to director level and to relevant external authorities if this is required. This system was introduced in August 2007, since when only 3.6 per cent. of all security incidents have been classified as serious.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.3/1">Yes. The summer opening programme has to break even over a three-year period, during which time prices are held; the current period is 2007-09. Full price adult tickets sold for the 2008 summer opening cost &pound;12. With the reduction in VAT rate, in 2009 these will cost &pound;11.70. Other ticket types will be similarly reduced.</p>
