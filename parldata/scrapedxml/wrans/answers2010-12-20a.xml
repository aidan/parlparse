The reception will be held in Eland House. Individual divisions within the Department may hold Christmas lunches paid for by staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.941W.10/6">Last year, the Department spent &#163;2,855 of taxpayers' money on Christmas cards. This year the departmental Christmas card, now with appropriate Christian imagery, has been produced at no cost to the taxpayer and will be sent electronically. Recognising the need to look after the vulnerable at this time of year, we are also supporting the homeless charity Shelter in the card. We will ensure that the right hon.

	<p pid="a.944W.2/1">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly PIE returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library of the House and via the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/3">Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/4">During the July to September quarter 2010, 2,630 households were accepted as owed a main homelessness duty in London. At the end of September 2010, there were 36,960 households in temporary accommodation in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/5">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night, of which 317 were in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/6">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the DCLG website:</p>

	<p pid="a.944W.2/8">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>

	<p pid="a.948W.6/1">DFID aid in Afghanistan is safeguarded as far as possible given the security situation. Money allocated to the Government of Afghanistan is channelled through a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank and monitored by an external agent. It is provided on a reimbursement basis and only released once proof of legitimate expenditure has been provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.948W.6/2">DFID has rigorous systems and procedures in place across all its programmes to ensure effective financial oversight of its funding and to ensure that aid achieves maximum value for money and both reaches and delivers results for its intended recipients. This Government will take the strongest action where such abuse of UK funds is proven. DFID's Counter Fraud Unit takes a robust approach to investigating and pursuing allegations of unintended use.</p>

Over the next year we will evaluate the evidence from FEF, communicate the lessons learned within DFID and to the wider development community and then explore how these results can support further financial education initiatives in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.952W.0/1">The UK Government have supported significant research into the impacts of cotton subsidies on African farmers, including US cotton subsidies. These subsidies have a significant negative impact on farmers in developing countries and their removal is a key objective of the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.0/2">We will continue to press the US bilaterally on this issue. However, successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) will be the key driver of reform. In 2005, WTO members committed to treat cotton subsidies &quot;ambitiously, expeditiously and specifically&quot; within the DDA. The UK is at the forefront of countries pressing for conclusion in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.955W.2/1">Following the commitment made in Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), the Government will publish a Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS) by spring 2011. The National Security Strategy (NSS) makes clear our commitment to a dialogue with a broad range of stakeholders to build a shared understanding of the security challenges we face and what we are doing and need to do to tackle them. Officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Department are currently planning detailed consultations, to be held early in the new year to ensure that the Building Stability Overseas Strategy is developed with key partners, including parliamentarians.</p>

	<p pid="a.955W.5/1">The Government are aware of the strength of feeling in the UK about the killing of pilot whales (a term which also includes Calderon dolphins) in the Faroe Islands. Our position on the hunting of cetaceans (marine mammals) is clear in that we support the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling and oppose all forms of cetacean hunts, other than limited whaling operations by indigenous people for subsistence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.5/2">I have not yet had any contact with my Danish counterparts on this issue. However, we raise the issue of whale hunting in the Faroe Islands with Denmark on a regular basis at official level. This was discussed at the annual meeting of the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas in October, at which Denmark was represented. At this meeting, the UK raised concerns over the increasing frequency and diversity of these hunts.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.5/3">We will continue to make our opposition to whaling known to Denmark at every appropriate opportunity. We will argue that the actions of the Faroe Islands undermine the credibility of the IWC as an effective organisation for the conservation of cetaceans worldwide.</p>

	<p pid="a.956W.8/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)'s historical library collection was transferred to Kings College London in 2007 following an internal review conducted in 2003, the establishment of an Advisory Committee in 2006 which oversaw a tender exercise to assess the merits of the bids received, and the laying of a Departmental Minute before both Houses of Parliament regarding the &quot;gift&quot; of the FCO historical collection to Kings College London. The FCO and King's College London set up a limited company-in effect a charitable trust-to hold title to the collection. The decision to close the physical library was taken in 2007 following a review conducted by external consultants. Consequently the remaining 20,000 volumes in the physical library were transferred to Kings College London and the physical library closed in March 2008. The FCO is confident that Kings College London is proving to be an excellent custodian of the historical library especially as it is now the most heavily used of King's special collections and has never before been made accessible to the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.958W.3/15">We cannot separate costs prior to 2004 without incurring disproportionate costs. The FCO is also obliged to purchase an annual licence fee from the Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA) in order to deliver electronic press cuttings. Prior to 2007, the FCO had a paper cuttings service. When we moved to the more environmentally friendly digital service, the NLA increased its fee as the digital information can now be provided across the whole of the FCO's worldwide network rather than just in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.959W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) incorporated the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) guidance document 'Promoting Skills through Public Procurement' into its Procurement Guidance and uses FCO UK-based construction procurement to promote the use of apprentices as part of supplier work forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.2/2">FCO Services, a trading fund of the FCO, also supports the OGC guidance. The nature of the work means that fully qualified staff are sent to locations overseas which limits the scope for suppliers' apprentices. However, FCO Services, as a supplier of the FCO currently has 40 apprentices.</p>
	<p pid="a.959W.2/3">Wilton Park and non-departmental public bodies such as the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and the Great Britain China Centre are small organisations who do not undertake procurement of this nature. The British Council follows the guidance but rarely enters into construction contracts in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.962W.2/1">The UK remains deeply concerned by both Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programmes. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) network of proliferation activities, including to countries such as Iran, are a threat to regional and international security. The UN Panel of Experts to the 1718 Sanctions Committee published a midterm report in November 2010, which indicated that Iran and the DPRK were co-operating in the development of ballistic missiles.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/2">We strongly support the tough sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, which are designed to curb the range of weapons of mass destruction and conventional arms related proliferation activities undertaken by the DPRK. UN Security Council Resolution 1929 also requires countries to take steps to ensure that shipments of weapons and proliferation sensitive goods en route to Iran are stopped. We continue to work closely with international partners to ensure that these measures are robustly implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.963W.5/1">The political situation in Iraq has been largely uncertain since the March 2010 elections. However, the appointments on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-11">11 November 2010</phrase> of the Speaker of the Council of Representatives Usama al Nujaifi, President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki constitute an important step towards stability.

There remain those opposed to progress and intent on stirring up sectarian tension, but the March 2010 elections and the recent progress towards Government formation have demonstrated the determination of the Iraqi people to follow the path of dialogue and democracy over violence and destruction.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.2/1">As well as our concern for the internal stability of Cote d'Ivoire as a result of the current political crisis, there are risks to the wider region. There are large communities of Burkinabe and Malian nationals living in Cote d'Ivoire. There is a possibility that there would be a large flow of refugees to those countries should the current situation in Cote d'Ivoire deteriorate into widespread conflict. The Liberian authorities have also expressed concern that former rebels might seek to become involved in the situation in Cote d'Ivoire. The British Government will continue to stay in close touch with the governments of the region as well as the Economic Community of West African States to monitor regional concerns.</p>

The current Permanent Representative's posting is scheduled to last for four years from 2007. But a number of factors, such as the need to ensure continuity and the availability of any replacement, could affect the exact timing of their departure.</p>

	<p pid="a.965W.11/1">The vast majority of capital expenditure by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) occurs outside the United Kingdom in order to support our global network of more than 250 posts overseas. These funds help ensure that our staff operate effectively and safely around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.11/2">Her Majesty's Treasury produced a Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses Command Paper (PESA 2010, CM 7890) earlier this year which is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.965W.11/4">According to the methodology used in that paper (which allocates departmental spending to regions based on who benefits from that spending, rather than where the spending takes place), per capita capital spending by the wider FCO family, including the BBC World Service but excluding the British Council in the financial years 2005-06 to 2009-10 was calculated as &#163;0.10, &#163;0.09, &#163;0.11, &#163;0.05, and &#163;0.06 in both London and the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.11/5">On the same basis, the proportion of overall capital FCO spend in London in the financial years 2005-06 to 2009-10 was successively 0.5%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.2%. In the north-west, it was 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.2%.</p>

The General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December</phrase> welcomed Turkey's continued commitment to the negotiation process and the political reform agenda. Turkey has opened 13 of the 35 accession chapters and has provisionally closed one chapter. Turkey faces challenges to its accession process as a result of its failure to open its ports to Cyprus and in the context of the wider Cyprus problem.</p>

The independent Office for National Statistics (ONS), along with the national statistical offices of other European member states are working with the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), to assess the most appropriate approach for including an index of owner-occupier housing costs in the CPI in the future. Alongside this international agenda the CPI Advisory Committee, which is considering the issue of housing costs in the CPI, recommended to the UK Statistics Authority in its annual report on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-03">3 November</phrase> that ONS should develop housing cost indices using the net acquisitions and rental equivalence approaches.</p>

	<p pid="a.975W.10/1">Biomass has a greater range of uses than just energy production. For example it can also be used to provide a wide range of renewable raw materials and therefore has a significant role to play in the development of a low carbon economy. However, sustainable biomass is likely to be an important contributor to our renewable energy ambitions. Analysis undertaken last year suggested that heat and electricity from biomass could provide nearly a third of UK needs from renewables by 2020 (about 4.5% of overall energy demand). Delivering our ambition for renewables will not be easy, we will need to ensure that the available mix of biomass feedstocks, both imported and domestically sourced, is sustainable and secure if we are to meet these ambitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.975W.10/2">The Department has not assessed the UK's ability to be self sufficient in the production of biomass. However, estimates provided by E4Tech in 2009 considered the technical potential for domestic biomass production for bioenergy and suggested a maximum technical UK supply of almost 700PJ in 2020, raising to 900PJ in 2030.</p>
	<p pid="a.975W.10/3">Analysis undertaken suggested that we could need around 350-400PJ of solid biomass to meet the deployment trajectories in the heat and electricity sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.975W.10/4">Security of biomass and sustainability are very important. Together with domestic biomass feedstocks, sustainably sourced imported biomass is expected to play a key role in helping to meet our renewable energy targets. Through our proposals on the renewables obligation and electricity market reform we are providing the transparency longevity and certainty that industry requires to allow it to establish robust, sustainable and efficient supply chains; with long term supply contracts, sourcing from more than one country and ensuring that domestic production is maximised where it is sustainable and feasible.</p>

	<p pid="a.976W.2/2">However, in the case of biomass that is sustainably grown the carbon dioxide released on combustion will be removed over several decades by replanting and regrowth.

	<p pid="a.984W.3/1">Wood fibre in the form of wood chip, pellet or log is one of several forms of biomass that can be used to produce renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.3/2">Based on an IEA study, estimates of global supplies of woody biomass have been provided by E4Tech. This indicates that current supplies available for bioenergy are around 7,000 PJ, doubling to about 14,000 PJ by 2015. This report is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.984W.3/4">The Department is currently updating this information, aiming to publish revised figures early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.3/5">Information is also published by the UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section, providing forest resource analyses and forestry sector outlooks.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.3/6">The Department has not carried out an analysis of global demand for wood fibre. However, the IEA 2009 report: Bioenergy a Sustainable and Reliable Energy Source, summarises available analyses on biomass availability to 2050. This reports that currently biomass supplies some 50,000PJ (1.2Gtoe) of energy globally per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.3/7">Current estimates suggest that in the UK, there is 784 MW of new bioelectricity capacity under construction; 1,710 MW of new capacity that has been through planning consent and is awaiting construction; and 3,535 MW of new capacity is under planning consideration. This information is taken from the Renewable Energy Planning Database which is regularly updated.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.3/8">Assuming all this capacity became operational, this would result in a maximum total demand for biomass of around 600PJ, equivalent to 32Mt wood, including demand from existing generators. However, these plants would use a variety of biomass feedstocks, including wastes, sewage, straw, energy crops and forest products including residues.</p>

	<p pid="a.989W.3/2">The overriding factor in deciding between removing either the Tornado GR4 or Harrier was the ability to support operations in Afghanistan. A fleet of 50 Tornado and 50 Harrier aircraft would have been unable to maintain continuous support to operations in Afghanistan at current levels and maintain the ability to support concurrent operations. In addition, withdrawal of an aircraft type delivers greater savings than partial reductions, due to the fixed costs associated with supporting an aircraft platform; therefore running two smaller fleets would not have been cost-effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.989W.3/3">When the 15 Harrier GR9 aircraft returned from their deployment to Afghanistan, the funding to support their urgent operational requirements ceased and as such this equipment was removed from the aircraft. If Harrier had been required to redeploy to Afghanistan, these capabilities would need to have been re-activated, either with new funding streams or replacements where they had been superseded and could have taken up to 18 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.991W.12/3">The NWTPS study was commissioned in 1983 and three successive analysis projects have been completed by the NRPB researchers. Details about the study and the three analysis projects have been published in peer-reviewed journals and as NRPB reports. References for each of these papers and reports can be found through the website link shown.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.12/4">The criteria for inclusion in the NWTPS study are described in detail in the NRPB reports but, in summary, the study group consisted of men who were recorded as having attended at least one of the sites used in the United Kingdom atmospheric nuclear weapon tests during the relevant periods and whose details were confirmed from contemporary records.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.12/5">The British Nuclear Test Veterans Association (BNTVA) and the former British Atomic Veterans Association as well as the British Legion were consulted during the first NRPB analysis project and contacts with BNTVA continued through to the third analysis. In particular, a BNTVA representative was included, as an observer, in the third analysis Project Management Group. Pre and post-publication presentations relating to the NRPB studies have been made to veterans' audiences, including a BNTVA AGM, by NRPB researchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.12/6">Further information about the NWTPS study can be found on, or through references from, the HPA website at:</p>

No overnight accommodation costs were incurred by Ministers solely as part of the SDSR process. A significant number of civilian staff were engaged at various stages, and it is not possible to identify what element of detached duty costs incurred by civilian staff during the period of the SDSR was required specifically as part of the review process.</p>

The MOD received over 6,000 responses from MPs, members of the armed forces, public servants within and beyond Defence, industry, academics and the public, together with over 1,000 letters and e-mails.

	<p pid="a.1005W.6/1">Franchised train operators are required by the Department for Transport to undertake passenger counts as part of their franchise agreements. These are requested from all relevant operators twice yearly in the spring and the autumn, focusing on the morning and evening peak demand into major cities, counting arriving train passengers between 0700 and 0959 and departing passengers between 1600 and 1859. The most recent surveys were undertaken during spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.6/2">The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) publishes statistics on &quot;passengers in excess of capacity&quot; in National Rail Trends (NRT) which is available on its website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk">www.rail-reg.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.6/4">These figures were updated in July 2010 for London commuter services, based on autumn 2009 data, and will be published for other regional centres when this information is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.6/5">Train operating companies submit morning and evening peak train plans to the Department for Transport for May and December timetable changes each year. Overcrowding levels are assessed by comparing counts of passengers against the plans. The assessments inform the plans for the next timetable iteration and the deployment of train capacity. These assessments contain commercially confidential information and are not published, but the Department uses the data as the base for strategic forecasts of peak demand change. The latest assessment for each of the franchised operators was for the May 2010 timetable change.</p>

There will be a substantial increase in the number of long distance trains calling at Stevenage-27 per day instead of 19 per day-and although Stevenage will have fewer through trains to stations north of York, good connections will be available at Peterborough, Doncaster or York.</p>

The Department moved to a new pay and grading system for staff below senior civil service in 2006 with much less reliance on allowances.</p>

A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.

	<p pid="a.1024W.5/1">More and more people across England are getting access to psychological therapies for the most common mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders or depression. About 140 new psychological therapy services are now up and running around the country and by March 2011 60% of primary care trusts will have an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service. 900,000 extra people with depression and/or anxiety disorders will have been seen in the first three years of the programme. Some 3,600 more therapists will have been employed in the same period, already meeting the programme's March 2011 target.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/2">The Health settlement in the spending review included funding to expand access to talking therapies. The money will complete the roll-out of the nationwide training programme and services which began in 2008 and begin to extend the benefits of talking therapies to the young, the elderly, those with serious mental illness and those who have anxiety disorders or depression alongside long-term physical health conditions like diabetes, heart or lung disease. By March 2011, the roll-out will achieve 60% geographical coverage of England. The spending review settlement will complete this by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/3">With regard to social support, the coalition programme committed the Government to reforming the system of social care in England to provide much more control to individuals and their carers. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November 2010</phrase> we published 'A Vision for Adult Social Care: Capable Communities and Active Citizens', which sets the context for the future direction of adult social care in England and a copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/4">The Vision focuses on the Government commitments to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/5" class="indent">break down barriers between health and social care funding to incentivise preventative action;</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/6" class="indent">extend the greater rollout of personal budgets to give people and their carers more control and purchasing power; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/7" class="indent">use direct payments to carers and better community-based provision to improve access to respite care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/8">We want to make services more personalised, more preventative and more focused on delivering the best outcomes for those who use them. The document also states that councils should provide personal budgets, preferably as a direct payment, for everyone eligible, by 2013, and develop the Big Society, with more local preventative activity to support people's independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024W.5/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November 2010</phrase>, the social care sector published 'Think Local, Act Personal: Next Steps for Transforming Adult Social Care', which sets out the sector's commitment to moving forward with personalisation and community-based support.

	<p pid="a.1035W.2/1">The matter raised is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which is accountable to Parliament rather than Ministers. According to Ofcom, the competition issues relating to the merger between T-Mobile and Orange that resulted in the formation of Everything Everywhere were looked at by the European Commission, involving Ofcom in the process. This considered all potential impacts that the merger might have in the various affected markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1035W.2/2">A particular potential concern was the joint venture's holdings of spectrum and the potential impacts these would have on future competition in mobile broadband services. The Commission also focused on the impact that the merger would have on the network sharing agreement held between T-Mobile and Hutchison 3G. The Commission accepted undertakings to divest spectrum holdings in the 1.8 GHz band and the merging parties' commitment to maintain the network sharing agreement to enable competition in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047W.6/3" class="indent">The development of business opportunities in high growth markets such as Singapore and India. The Prime Minister, for example, led a major visit to India, including a business delegation, earlier this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047W.6/6">UKTI also works where appropriate with Commonwealth institutions, particularly the Commonwealth Business Council, on maximising the business benefit from high profile events where these are in line with UKTI's strategic priorities. Examples of such activities include the Commonwealth games; the business elements of visits to the UK by Commonwealth Heads of State from high growth markets; and business events in the margins of Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings (e.g. in November 2009, UKTI's team in Trinidad and Tobago hosted the Commonwealth Business Forum-UKTI Business Breakfast, in the margins of the CHG meeting).</p>

	<p pid="a.1048W.5/1">Regional development agencies (RDAs) will continue to manage the European regional development funds (ERDF) until new arrangements are in place. New arrangements will be announced next March. The programmes remain open with projects continuing to be appraised and approved. Going forward, we expect that local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) will be beneficiaries of EU funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.2/1">The transition plans, which are still being developed, are owned by individual regional development agencies (RDA). RDAs have significant assets and liabilities, and the plans for their disposal will be commercially sensitive. The plans will also contain details of how staffing numbers are proposed to be reduced in the run up to closure, anticipated in March 2012. I do not therefore believe publication will be possible though the RDAs will continue to adhere to the normal transparency requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.5/1">The Regional Growth Fund is a challenge fund that is open to bids from the private sector, or public private partnership from any part of England. Bids will be expected to demonstrate how they meet the Fund's two published objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/2" class="indent">stimulate enterprise by providing support for projects and programmes with significant potential for economic growth and create additional sustainable private sector employment; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/3" class="indent">support in particular those areas and communities that are currently dependent on the public sector make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/4">To help applicants, BIS has produced guidance that details the criteria that bids will be assessed against to meet the two objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.5/5">BIS has also published an outline of the Fund's appraisal process, part of which includes an assessment by an independent Advisory Panel chaired by my noble Friend Lord Heseltine. All of these are available on the Regional Growth Fund web page:</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.5/7">At all stages in the appraisal and approval process, the only criteria applications will be judged against are those that are published. A ministerial decision-making panel will consider bids recommended by the advisory panel, and will take into account in their decision, the extent to which different areas are reliant on public sector employment by looking at a range of evidence, including official statistics, evidence supplied in bids and the work of the DWP labour market group.</p>

Enhanced user privacy is a key element of the new measures and will enable users to exercise more control over their personal data. Additionally, rules concerning privacy and data protection will be strengthened ensuring that internet users are better informed about applications such as &quot;cookies&quot; and similar devices, as well as what happens to and the use made of, their personal data. The general principle of the law not differentiating between an illegal act committed online and an illegal act committed offline, applies in all cases.

We do not however believe there is a need to review the specific provisions in the Children Act 1989 with regard to the taking of children into care against their parents' wishes. The law is clear that children should live with their parents wherever possible. However, action must be taken if a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. Where a child is taken into care on a care order the court is required to treat the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.3/2">The coalition Government's programme for government makes clear our intention to encourage shared parenting. One of the principles governing the work of the Family Justice Review is that the positive involvement of both parents should be promoted post-separation. The Review Panel will be issuing an interim report in the spring on its proposals for reforming the Family Justice System, ahead of a national consultation. The panel will issue its final report in autumn 2011 and we shall consider at that point how best to respond to its conclusions, including the potential need for changes to legislation to promote shared parenting.</p>

	<p pid="a.1069W.9/2">Precise local and national data on the number of young carers are not held centrally. However the 2001 census estimates that there are approximately 139,000 children in England aged 17 or under offering some care to a family member, neighbour or friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.9/3">Helping to care for a family member is something that many young people are happy and proud to do. These young people do play an absolutely vital role both for their families and society as a whole and they deserve our recognition and support. The Department for Education with the Department of Health is absolutely committed to supporting local services including many voluntary organisations which have been set up to support these young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.9/4">However in some cases these young people need protection from excessive or inappropriate caring that puts their education and/or health at risk. I attended the Young Carers Festival last summer as I have done for a number of years and have heard directly about their concerns. They told me that services supporting their parents or other family members all too often do not consider their views or identify and respond to their support needs. Even though these might be critical to the care they are providing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.9/5">The Government recently published 'Recognised, valued and supported: next steps for the Carers Strategy'. They recognise that there are a number of 'hidden' young carers and encourage front-line services including schools, GPs, mental health and substance misuse to put in place systems to identify and respond to young carers needs. They also encourage local authorities to consider adopting the 'Working together to support young carers' published jointly by the Association of Directors of Adult and Children's Services which is unambiguous in stating that no care package should rely on a young person taking on inappropriate caring roles.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071W.3/1">Individuals who have reached women's state pension age, will receive a winter fuel payment to help meet the cost of their winter fuel needs. Households with someone aged up to 79 will receive &#163;250 while those households with someone aged 80 or over receive &#163;400.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.3/2">Cold weather payments of &#163;25 a week are paid in periods of very cold weather to those in receipt of pension credit or income related employment and support allowance who receive the support component or the work-related activity component. Recipients of income support, income related employment and support allowance or income-based jobseekers allowance may also be entitled to a cold weather payment if they have a pensioner or disability premium included in their benefit, or they have a child who is either disabled or under the age of five in the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.3/3">Disabled people can face extra heating costs but, by and large, these needs arise all year round. Benefits such as incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance provide additional weekly payments and are related to the individual's circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.3/4">The Department for Work and Pensions also works closely with other Government Departments on the 'Keep Warm Keep Well' campaign, which is aimed at vulnerable households in England and gives information on the health benefits of keeping warm in winter and details of the grants and benefits available.</p>

We have also taken note of the views and concerns of stakeholders in relation to the implementation of the 2011 changes to Local Housing Allowance rates. As a consequence we are bringing forward the timing of the reduction of rates to the 30 percentile from October 2011 to April 2011. This avoids people being affected twice, first by the cap from April and then again after October. We are giving existing customers more time to adjust to any reduction in entitlement by giving them up to nine months transitional protection from the anniversary date of the claim. In addition we are providing a further &#163;50 million over the spending review period towards the provision of housing advice and other practical support to help customers during the transition period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.5/1">We have discussions from time to time with the Council of Mortgage Lenders about support for mortgage interest. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has told the Department that it expects lenders to continue to exercise forbearance where it is fair to do so for the borrower, and the borrower has a chance of paying off any arrears in the future. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has told us that where arrears levels increase for some borrowers as a result of the change in the standard interest rate this does not necessarily translate into an immediate possession risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/2">It would not be appropriate for my Department to issue specific or detailed guidance to mortgage providers about how they should manage accounts which have shortfalls.

Under the Pre-Action Protocol, lenders must prove they have considered all other options before trying to repossess a property. For example, they may agree to change or lengthen the term of the loan, accept reduced payments in the short-term, or add the debt to the amount borrowed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1081W.0/1">It was necessary for the Government to put support for mortgage interest on a more sustainable footing, and to better reflect mortgage costs, which is why we set the standard interest rate at a level equal to the Bank of England's published monthly average mortgage rate from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase>. The rate is currently 3.63%. The previous rate of 6.08% was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers. The plans of the previous Government would have meant that the standard interest rate would have reverted to a formula-the Bank of England Base Rate plus 1.58%-which, at present, would produce a rate of 2.08% from January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081W.0/2">The Department is in the process of developing a model to estimate the impact of changes to support for mortgage interest on the number of repossessions. However any estimates will always be limited since detailed case-by-case information, such as arrears at the start of a claim, is not collected by the Department. Furthermore, the relationship between arrears and continued home ownership is a complex one dependant on more than the level of support for mortgage interest payable. The Department will consider whether the results can be used publicly, and the findings placed in the Library, once this work is complete, which we would expect to be early in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082W.5/2">The service is regularly reviewed as part of the Government's Gated Review process. In addition, in September 2010 a further review of the contractual arrangements required to deliver the service confirmed that Tell Us Once is a valuable service that will deliver improved customer service at lower cost for both the customer and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.5/3">The service is currently offered on a face to face basis at local authorities and over the phone via a national telephony service provided by my Department. It is also planned to make it available on line by the end of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.5/4">Currently 85% of all local authorities have committed to offer the service. By devolving power to the local level authorities are able to tailor the service so that it supports the needs of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.5/5">As of today there are 42 local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales offering the Birth and Bereavement Service and in total almost 29,000 customers have chosen to use it since testing began. Customer feedback has been extremely positive and has been used to help design how the service will operate in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.5/6">The priority for Tell Us Once will be to successfully roll out its Birth and Bereavement Service and then to increase the number of partner organisations and benefits and services in addition to the 24 it currently works with so that benefits for the customer, taxpayer and Government are maximised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.5/7">In addition, working with the private sector will be crucial so that we can provide additional services that our customers have told us they want, such as telling utilities and banks about a death. By taking this forward on a commercial basis it will enable the costs to the taxpayer to be minimised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.5/8">Tell Us Once also has the mandate to develop a Change of Address service in partnership with the private sector so that citizens no longer need to do this multiple times themselves and so that the taxpayer does not carry the cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.8/2">There are a number of reasons why people move off benefits but do not move into employment, for example, many people leave benefits to take up a course of education or training. We are working closely with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to encourage the take-up of skills provision through the development of appropriate training that meets the needs of both individuals and local employers to help move unemployed people into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.8/3">Under our commitment to reassess all existing customers currently in receipt of incapacity benefit to ensure they get the right help and support to find work, we expect many people will be found fit for work and moved off incapacity benefit. They will be able to claim jobseeker's allowance rather than leave benefits altogether. When on jobseeker's allowance they will receive enhanced personal support and flexible provision to help improve their employability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.8/4">The Work Choice programme, which provides intensive support for disabled people with more complex barriers to finding and staying in employment, is available to disabled people-provided they are both eligible and suitable-regardless of any benefits being claimed.

We are constantly seeking to improve the quality of our decisions and appeal responses and are currently testing a range of new measures to improve the dissemination of best practice and ensure more decisions are right first time. An example of this is our arrangements for representatives of the three organisations to meet at a regional level on a quarterly basis. This will enable an exchange of views and information which Jobcentre Plus managers will use to review and improve the quality of decision making, including those involving Work Capability Assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089W.2/5" class="indent">In addition to this, we are building on existing good practices to develop more effective working relationships through a number of joint initiatives. These include quarterly meetings at regional level between representatives of the three organisations, the regular provision by Atos healthcare professionals of advice and support to Jobcentre Plus Decision Makers and Appeals staff and the use of feedback from the Tribunals Service to improve decision making.</p>

Alongside this, a strategy to procure services to replace those that were due to be delivered under the original e-Borders contract has been developed. The programme is currently examining options for contracting with new suppliers and expects to be able to set out agreed next steps in the new year.

Where conferences do take place the Home Office constantly seeks to ensure that any conferences that it organises are both necessary, and provide good value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094W.2/1">The Home Office has put in place strict new policies for reducing sickness absence, which has produced month by month falls in the levels of sickness absence over the last 16 months. The total cost of sickness absence is therefore coming down, and the latest estimates of cost for the 33,000 employees of the Home Office and its agencies was &#163;28.16 million for the 12 months ending June 2010. That remains, however, too high and the plan is to reduce it further.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.2/2">In respect of unauthorised absence, employees who are absent from work without authorisation and fail to report their absence within 24 hours will be classed as absent without leave (AWOL). Employees who fail to make contact within five working days will have their salary withheld until further notice and are dealt with under the misconduct procedure. The number of staff classed as AWOL is small and we do not hold data relating to this type of absence centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.1096W.2/2">The OGC guidance has been issued to the Home Department's entire procurement community including its agencies and NDPBs advising them that there are opportunities to embed skills and apprenticeships at all stages in the procurement process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096W.2/3">As part of the Department's Supplier Relationship Management programme, workshops have been held with key suppliers to discuss various initiatives including work force skills.

	<p pid="a.1096W.2/4">Additionally, the Department uses a web-based toolkit known as CAESER. The toolkit is used to assess the risk within the supply chain and includes the collation of information on suppliers' policies and practices with regards to work force skills. Suppliers are asked to complete the assessment toolkit on an annual basis and the data is made available to commercial managers. The current exercise concludes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1106W.2/1">The Home Office commenced a new travel booking contract in December 2008 and since early 2009 all first class rail travel can be identified. Air travel at fares other than the cheapest available can also be logged. Aggregated spend information on first class rail travel is provided to directorates to enable them to manage the cost of travel. All those contractually entitled to first class travel are expected, given the Department's commitments to reducing costs, to consider carefully whether first class travel is justified in the light of the specific business need for the journey and the example it sets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.2/2">The need for travel at all is considered against using more cost-effective options like teleconferencing or videoconferencing, which are increasingly available throughout the agency. Managers have been asked to ensure that any claim for first-class travel is balanced with a clear business justification. There are times when travelling in a higher- fare seat is justifiable; for example on long-haul flights, especially where managers have engagements on arrival at their destination. Similarly, when travelling by rail, if seating is unavailable in economy carriages then travelling first class might be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.2/3">In the financial year 2009-10, UK Border Agency staff made 4,163 hotel bookings at a total cost of &#163;1,775,000. These booking should be set in the context of the Agency being a global organisation employing 24,000 staff working in 137 countries, which will necessitate some travel as part of managing our business.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110W.3/1">The Department did not fund any services aimed specifically at supporting victims of domestic violence prior to 2007. Since 2007, a proportion of the proceeds from the Victim Surcharge, administered by the Ministry of Justice, has been used to fund independent domestic violence advisers (IDVAs) attached to specialist domestic violence courts. These IDVAs provide specialist, one-to-one support for victims of domestic violence as they progress through the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110W.3/2">Funding was allocated on a three-year cycle and on the basis that local areas would mainstream funding into local budgets within this time. In 2010-11, &#163;840,000 was allocated to fund 42 IDVAs. The allocation in previous years was as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.1113W.6/1">The publication of the comprehensive spending review gave the high level funding settlements for Government Departments. Following on from the publication the Ministry of Justice and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) have been undertaking detailed modelling and planning in order to produce budgets with the required level of detail to enable the allocation of funds across their areas of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.6/2">This process is an iterative one and although we have identified and agreed the majority of the funding allocations there are still some areas where further work is required before all the figures can be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.6/3">As a consequence it is anticipated that the final allocation for NOMS will not be known until the end of December, although even then, this figure may be subject to some amendment should there be a shift in priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.6/4">The future structure of the National Offender Management Service is under review at present and as such the way in which funding for offender services across England and Wales is allocated will follow a different route, hence an allocation for NOMS Cymru as a whole will not be made for 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.6/5">For the individual business units covered by the National Offender Management Service, which includes the Wales Probation Trust, negotiations are ongoing and it is planned that the financial delegations will be issued in March 2011. The allocation made to Wales Probation Trust will be to deliver probation services across the whole of Wales and so will include the geographic area formerly covered by the North Wales Probation Board.</p>

The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. Health and Education).
