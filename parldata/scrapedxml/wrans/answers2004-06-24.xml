This separately identifies figures for opthalmic opticians, nurses and midwives. There are no plans to change the analysis of people in employment from the LFS, although it is planned that the LFS itself will be incorporated in the Continuous Population Survey in 2008. At a later date, it is likely that a new classification of occupations will be introduced.</p>

At the end of March 2004, there were 59,000 households in temporary accommodation. Projections for London's population suggest an increase of 336,000 households by 2016. The Mayor's London Plan sets an overall baseline target for the capital of 23,000 new homes per annum (in all sectors and from all sources) and an aspirational target of 30,000 homes per annum.

	<p pid=".1480W.3/1">DFID is facing a humanitarian emergency in Darfur, where the provision of assistance is absolutely vital. In this context, hindrances to the delivery of humanitarian supplies are unacceptable. The UK has been working to facilitate humanitarian access to Darfur, and our Embassy in Khartoum is engaged on a daily basis with the Government of Sudan, although we are making progress, there is still more that needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".1480W.3/2">I raised the question of issuing visas to Sudan with the Sudanese Foreign Minister in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-11">11 May</phrase>. He gave me a firm commitment that visas for humanitarian personnel working in Darfur would be issued within 48 hours. There has been a marked improvement as a result of this commitment. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-20">20 May</phrase>, the Sudanese Government announced the change to a 48 hour notification system for travel to Darfur, replacing the previous requirement for a travel permit. This improvement has also allowed progress on the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".1480W.3/3">I raised the question of humanitarian access with the First Vice President the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, and the State Minister for Finance in Khartoum on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June</phrase>, where I was given firm commitments that the Sudanese Government would fast-track customs clearance for humanitarian goods within seven days, and that new international NGOs applying for registration to work in Darfur would be fast-tracked in 10 days. This has resulted in new international NGO registrations. They also agreed that medical supplies that were on an approved list did not need testing before being brought into Sudan. I raised with them the specific complaint from Medecins Sans Frontieres-Holland that 200MT of food and 30MT of medical supplies had been held in Port Sudan for three months. Both Ministers assured me that this would be released within days. This has now taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".1480W.3/4">Following my visit, the British Ambassador has continued to raise on a regular basis the question of humanitarian access to Darfur, including through letters to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs and the State Minister in the Ministry for Humanitarian Affairs highlighting specific instances of ongoing bureaucratic difficulties. These included outstanding applications for registration from new international NGOs, the need to give 72 hours notice for passengers on UN flights, the need for clarity about the requirements for testing medical and food supplies, the urgency of releasing radio and communications equipment from customs and the need to issue promptly visas for international health staff. We are calling on the Government of Sudan to consider suspending all regulations relating to humanitarian access to Darfur for a period of three months. The Higher Committee on Darfur will meet on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June</phrase> to discuss humanitarian access where we will raise all the outstanding issues. In addition, I intend to speak to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs this week.</p>
	<p pid=".1480W.3/5">The UK Government has been in constant dialogue with UK NGOs working in Darfur since September 2003. DFID has held regular meetings with the Disasters and Emergency Committee in London on Darfur. In Khartoum, the Ambassador has taken the lead in establishing regular meetings with the Government of Sudan, NGOs and donors to discuss the question of access to Darfur. It would require disproportionate work to answer the question of how many complaints were received by NGOs in each of the last eight months.</p>
	<p pid=".1480W.3/6">DFID has received reports that radios and communications equipments have been held in customs by the Sudanese authorities. Given the essential nature of this equipment for ensuring the safety and security of humanitarian personnel, this is unacceptable. It was raised in the letter from the British Ambassador to the State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs. I intend to follow up closely on the implementation of all the commitments given by the Government of Sudan about humanitarian access to Darfur and will continue to raise specific instances as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".1481W.2/1">DFID is helping to expand and strengthen civil society in Afghanistan by supporting civil society's engagement in the political process. DFID supported the development of the new constitution in 2003 (&pound;500,000). This included an outreach programme to make the wider community aware of the purpose of the Constitution and providing a reasonable understanding of its key features. DFID are now funding Swiss Peace (&pound;500,000) to provide civic education for the Afghan elections and supporting the development of an independent media through our contributions to the Global Conflict Prevention Pool.</p>
	<p pid=".1481W.2/2">The UK is funding Action Aid (&pound;157,680) to help increase both knowledge and awareness of the rights of women and women's participation in local governance in Afghanistan. Community level women's groups are being established and small grants made available to help build the resources and confidence of women to work together to seek solutions to common problems. These activities are being supplemented and supported by training and information sharing at the provincial level and a nationwide research project looking at the role of women in local governance in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".1481W.2/3">DFID also funds Government led national development programmes, which are being facilitated by a range of local and international non-governmental organisations. An example is the National Solidarity Programme (&pound;3 million in 2003&ndash;04 with additional funding planned), which is building the capacity of hundreds of village development councils across Afghanistan and providing the resources they need to identify and address their own development priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1481W.2/4">DFID also supports the British Agencies in Afghanistan Group (BAAG) here in the UK. This funding helps BAAG act as an effective umbrella group for non-governmental organisations, registered in the UK and working in Afghanistan and also facilitates information sharing and access to Whitehall Departments.</p>

	<p pid=".1482W.2/2">Until the installation of the Transitional National Government in July last year, most of our assistance had been directed towards meeting the immediate humanitarian needs in DRC, as the table shows. The nature of humanitarian assistance is such that DFID did not pledge an overall amount but delivered assistance as and when it was necessary. Our overall aid framework for DRC in 2003&ndash;04 was &pound;23 million&mdash;of which over &pound;20 million was delivered, including &pound;3 million as monetary aid.</p>

	<p pid=".1483W.2/2">Following the recent reports of the humanitarian impact of the instability and fighting in Eastern DRC, DFID has sent a humanitarian assessment mission to Goma and Bukavu, which arrived on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-22">22 June 2004</phrase>. This mission intends to assess and respond to the growing humanitarian problem, working alongside our partner UN agencies and NGOs to assist the most vulnerable populations.</p>
	<p pid=".1483W.2/3">With NGOs and the UN only just getting access into the affected parts of Eastern DRC, there are no verifiable reports on the current numbers of internally displaced people or of refugees in neighbouring countries, or their present locations and requirements. The DFID humanitarian assessment mission hopes to determine both the scale of the problem, and how UK funds can best be used to alleviate this.</p>

	<p pid=".1485W.8/1">The Government of Iraq established the public food distribution system in 1990. This system of untargeted rationing has proved to be hugely costly to the Government and has undermined the country's domestic agriculture. DFID hopes to work with the Iraqi Interim Government and other donors to help reform this system, to the benefit of both Iraq's consumers and farmers, as soon as conditions allow.</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/2">The amount of wheat actually purchased by the Government each year depends on the content of the &quot;ration basket&quot;, which is decided by the Ministry of Trade (MOT) each month, depending on domestic production and existing stocks within the country. Published MOT budget information does not show the breakdown of the costs of individual public food distribution items but it is estimated that 3.5 million metric tonnes of wheat flour is required annually for the standard ration basket. Over the 12 months since the creation of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), if all of Iraq's public distribution system needs had been met from imports at world prices, the cost would have been around $700 million. This is likely to be an over-estimate since there would be some domestic purchases and use of stocks.</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/3">The major suppliers of wheat to Iraq are Australia and the US.</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/4">International export prices for wheat vary greatly depending on grade and freight distances but an average figure for 2003&ndash;04 is about $200/tonne.</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/5">The MOT is responsible for purchasing grain from overseas and from domestic producers, for organising the milling contracts and the transport of the milled wheat flour to food agents.</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/6">The following process describes how the food ration is distributed:</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/7" class="indent">1. The MOT announces the food basket for the month and calls forward food agents to collect the ration;</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/8" class="indent">2. Food and flour agents collect the coupons from households and go to the sales centre of warehouses/mills, where they receive an invoice;</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/9" class="indent">3. Food agents collect foodstuffs from the warehouses/distribution centres;</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/10" class="indent">4. Wheat flour is transported to flour/food agents, which is paid for by the MOT;</p>
	<p pid=".1485W.8/11" class="indent">5. Households then collect the ration from the food/flour agents and pay the nominal fee.</p>

	<p pid=".1491W.2/1">DFID is facing a humanitarian emergency in Darfur, where the provision of assistance is absolutely vital. In this context, hindrances to the delivery of humanitarian supplies are unacceptable. The UK has been working to facilitate humanitarian access to Darfur and we are making progress, although there is still more that needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.2/2">I raised the question of issuing visas to Sudan with the Sudanese Foreign Minister in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-11">11 May</phrase>. He gave me a firm commitment that visas for humanitarian personnel working in Darfur would be issued within 48 hours. There has been a marked improvement as a result of this commitment. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-20">20 May</phrase>, the British Ambassador met with the Sudanese Foreign Minister, following which he announced the change to a 48 hour notification system for travel to Darfur, replacing the previous requirement for a travel permit. This improvement has also allowed progress on the ground, although there have been some outstanding issues regarding local level implementation and the rules pertaining to notification of passengers on World Food Programme (WFP) flights.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.2/3">I raised the question of humanitarian access with the First Vice President, in Khartoum, the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, and the State Minister for Finance on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June</phrase>, where I was given firm commitments that the Sudanese Government would fast-track customs clearance for humanitarian goods within seven days, and that new international NGOs applying for registration to work in Darfur would be fast-tracked in 10 days. This has resulted in new international NGO registrations. They also agreed that medical supplies that were on an approved list did not need testing before being brought into Sudan. I raised with them the specific complaint from Medecin Sans Frontieres&mdash;Holland that 200MT of food and 30MT of medical supplies had been held in Port Sudan for three months. Both Ministers assured me that this would be released within days. This has now taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.2/4">Following my visit, the British Ambassador wrote to the Minister for Humanitarian Affairs and the State Minister in the Ministry for Humanitarian Affairs highlighting specific instances of ongoing bureaucratic difficulties about access to Darfur faced by NGOs. These included outstanding applications for registration from new International NGOs, the need to give 72 hours notice for passengers on UN flights, the need for clarity about the requirements for testing medical and food supplies, the urgency of releasing radio and communications equipment from customs and the need to issue promptly visas for international health staff. An inter-agency technical committee on Darfur meets regularly to discuss questions of humanitarian access and is attended by the British Ambassador. The next meeting will take place on 23rd June, where all these outstanding questions will be raised. Following the outcome of that meeting, I intend to speak to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.2/5">On my return from Sudan, I spoke to the UN Secretary General about the need for humanitarian access in Darfur. I have also been in correspondence with the Heads of UN agencies and have spoken to Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF and James Morris, Executive Director of WFP about the experience of their agencies in delivering assistance in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.2/6">The UK Government has been in constant dialogue with UK NGOs working in Darfur since September 2003. We have held regular meetings with the Disasters and Emergency Committee in London on Darfur, and have been in frequent contact with the Sudanese Embassy. In Khartoum, the Ambassador has taken the lead in establishing regular meetings with the Government of Sudan, NGOs and donors to discuss the question of access to Darfur.</p>

	<p pid=".1494W.9/2">The Motorsport Competitiveness Panel, co-chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Mr. Paul Barron, made an assessment of all factors influencing the success of the UK motorsport industry. It concluded that retention in the UK of &quot;world-class motorsport events&quot;, including the Formula One Grand Prix, the Motorcycle Grand Prix and the Wales Rally GB was important both economically and in maintaining the public profile of the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".1494W.9/3">The panel's assessment of the direct economic impact in the event that the Formula One Grand Prix were to be lost to the UK was a net loss of &pound;3.4 million income and 230 jobs. This estimate does not take into account any secondary effects on the UK motorsport industry. However, the panel concluded that such effects would be significant. UK-based teams have confirmed that the presence of world-class events and the associated marketing opportunities are important reasons for locating in the UK and the loss of any of these events would lead to a loss of business for UK motorsport companies.</p>
	<p pid=".1494W.9/4">The Motorsport Panel's full report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-11">11 July 2003</phrase> and is available at: <a href="http://www.autoindustry.co.uk/docs/motorsportpanelreport.pdf">http://www.autoindustry.co.uk/docs/motorsportpanelreport.pdf</a> No additional assessment of the issues raised has been made since that time.</p>

	<p pid=".1495W.8/3">In 2003, the Motorsport Valley brand was used as part of a high-profile inward investment promotion by the four regions concerned (East and West Midlands, South East and East of England). These agencies put forward a united message under the Motorsport Valley banner at the Performance Racing Industry trade show in Indianapolis, USA. The promotion was well received and further plans are being taken forward with the relevant industry bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".1495W.8/4">The brand is also used to promote motorsport tourism through a website: <a href="http://www.visitmotorsportvalley.com">www.visitmotorsportvalley.com</a> and an associated national motorsport map. These activities aim to reach a broader audience than traditional motorsport enthusiasts. This initiative is once again being taken forward on a collaborative basis by the four regions.</p>

	<p pid=".1496W.2/1">The Department has not carried out a formal assessment of the economic impact of obsolete EU regulation. In part, this obsolete legislation consists of a number of legal acts with time-limited application (e.g. the fixing of agricultural prices in a given harvest year, or the grant of a particular time-limited status, derogation or financial support to a member state or other entity). This type of obsolete legislation would therefore not have an economic impact once it is no longer applicable. The European Commission is currently taking steps to remove such legislation,, along with other measures to secure a reliable, up-to-date and user-friendly body of EC law as described in its February 2003 Communication, &quot;Updating and Simplifying the Community Acquis&quot; (COM (2003) 71).</p>

	<p pid=".1496W.5/1">The overall prospects for UK steel production look encouraging. According to the Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau, UK steel production rose by 4.9 per cent. in March 2004 and by 7.2 per cent. to reach 3.3 million tonnes for the first quarter of 2004. The UK monthly total was the second highest in over two years. World demand is strong largely as a result of the expansion of the Chinese economy. In terms of the UK steel market, the most recent CBI Business Survey shows manufacturing in a more positive light with output expected to increase over the next three months at its fastest pace since 1999.</p>

	<p pid=".1502W.0/1">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) is a statutory independent body established under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (MDA 1971) to advise the Government on drug related issues within the UK. Two of the ACMD's subcommittees&mdash;the Technical Committee (TC) and the Statistics, Information and Research Committee (SIRC) held several joint meetings in relation to discussing the reclassification of cannabis. The TC has the broad remit of reviewing the MDA 1971 and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations. As part of this it has responsibility for advising the full Council as to the appropriate classification and scheduling of drugs. SIRC, which was dissolved on completion of the cannabis work, was responsible for monitoring and providing advice on research bearing on drug misuse in the UK and drawing attention to the full Council features which appeared most significant. Included at Annex A, is a list of all SIRC members between 2001 and 2003 with their backgrounds and the organisation which they represented. Also included is a list of all Technical Committee Members during the discussions on cannabis reclassification and their respective background and the organisations that they represented.</p>

The published report&mdash;&quot;The Classification of Cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&quot;, published in 2002 represents the considerations and conclusions of the TC, SIRC and the full Council on the reclassification of cannabis. This includes a list of published research material which was taken into consideration. As indicated above, SIRC was disbanded on completion of the cannabis work. However, the articles featured in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-23">23 November 2002</phrase> were closely considered by Professor David Nutt (chair of the ACMD Technical Committee), Sir Michael Rawlins (chair of the ACMD) and Department of Health officials who were content that the advice given by full council to reclassify cannabis was not compromised by the content of the articles.</p>

	<p pid=".1504W.11/1">The Government reclassified cannabis as a Class C drug earlier this year following advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, to allow the police to focus on Class A drugs which do the most harm. The Home Office is working closely with police forces to monitor the policing of drug offences since cannabis was reclassified and early figures are encouraging. As more robust data becomes available a more thorough assessment of the impact of reclassification will be undertaken.</p>

However, as outlined in the current consultation exercise &quot;Burial law and policy in the 21st Century: the need for a sensitive and sustainable approach&quot;, sustainability is an important issue. We understand that the system of freeze-drying remains is still awaiting approval for use in Sweden, where the system was created. Nevertheless, the development of alternatives to the traditional choices of burial or cremation, and particularly alternatives which are more environmentally friendly, should be given careful consideration.</p>

	<p pid=".1512W.2/1">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) launched in March new guidance for the management of pursuits. I welcome this.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.2/2">The ACPO guidance, produced in consultation with the Police Complaints Authority (now the Independent Police Complaints Commission), is designed to help ensure that pursuits can be resolved quickly and safely for everyone involved. It will help ensure development of a coherent policy that maximises safety for all those involved. Its guidelines stress the importance of considering each pursuit individually, according to the developing circumstances, with decisions being made on the basis of the changing information available. The guidance fully recognises that there may be occasions when it is better to discontinue a pursuit on the grounds of public safety.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.2/3">Work continues to ensure that the correct training is provided in the police service, that there are adequate management controls, and that robust risk assessments are in place to ensure that safety is maintained at all times.</p>

	<p pid=".1512W.5/1">The information requested about self-inflicted deaths and self-harm is provided in the following table. Suicidal intent is not easy to establish. The reasons why people self-injure are highly complex, and it is difficult to distinguish between acts of self-harm that were attempts at ending life, and those that occurred for other reasons. It is not possible, therefore, for the Prison Service to determine from the general figures recording incidents of self-harm those acts that could be described as attempts at suicide. The figures for self-harm in the table therefore include all acts of self-harm, however serious.</p>

	<p pid=".1512W.5/14"><sup>(10)</sup> The Prison Service employs the term &quot;self-inflicted death&quot; rather than suicide. This includes all those deaths where it appears the person acted intentionally to take his/her own life.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/15"><sup>(11)</sup> The figures provided are number of incidents of self-harm, not number of individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/16"><sup>(12)</sup> In December 2002, a new form for reporting self-injury (the F213SH) was introduced across the prisons estate in England and Wales, which is known to have improved reporting practices. Please note therefore that much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from the change in reporting procedures rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/17">In 2004 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-16">16 June</phrase>, there have been two apparently self-inflicted deaths at Holloway; the number of incidents of self-harm is not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/18">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, visited Holloway in April 2004, and I visited the establishment in October 2003. We both had the opportunity to talk with the Governor, with a number of prison staff from a variety of disciplines, and with groups of prisoners. It was clear from our wide-ranging discussions that Holloway is dealing with a large number of vulnerable women, many of whom enter custody already struggling to cope with a wide range of difficult issues that increase their likelihood of suicide and self-harm. These include mental health, drug and alcohol problems; histories of abuse, troubled relationships and social exclusion; as well as past experiences of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/19">Both my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I were impressed with Holloway's First Night in Custody Project, which focuses on the needs of women at the vulnerable stage of entry into prison. The Project was set up in October 2000 and is run by the Prisoner Advice and Care Trust. It employs a full-time project worker and two link workers to help identify women at risk of self-harm or suicide. The project sees over 100 prisoners a month and makes referrals to services in and outside the prison on housing needs, mental health problems, drug or alcohol problems.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/20">Holloway is also one of the three prisons currently piloting Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), an innovative programme developed for women with 'borderline personality disorder' who also self-harm or engage in suicidal behaviours.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/21">20 safer cells are to be installed at Holloway by October 2005. Safer cells, which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, have been found effective in preventing impulsive suicide attempts.</p>
	<p pid=".1512W.5/22">Across the prisons estate, women prisoners are to benefit from a specifically targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy being developed for them. This draws upon specialist knowledge of suicidal behaviour among women prisoners, and builds upon a number of interventions including: individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of DBT; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in women's prisons; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well-being of women prisoners. &pound;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to women's prisons to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses.</p>

	<p pid=".1515W.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/2" class="italic">Police and Judicial co-operation</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/3">Further to the European Council Declaration on Terrorism the JHA Council noted a number of papers, including a draft report to the European Council on the implementation of previously agreed instruments; a draft Action Plan listing the actions to be taken by who within the EU and by when; and two discussion papers by the Counter Terrorism Co-ordinator, Gijs de Vries. The Council also adopted Council Conclusions noting action taken since the European Council and requesting further work.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/4">Along with the majority of other member states I supported the report on intelligence capacities by the Secretary General Javier Solana. In addition I set out the UK's five priorities on practical Counter-terrorist co-operation. Firstly, that all member states should be able to exchange information through the Visa Information System. Secondly/that there needed to be interoperability between EU and national databases. Thirdly, that all member states should be actively involved with the European Borders Agency. Fourthly, that all member states need to include biometrics in passports and, finally, that the EU needs to find a way of taking action on security measures on ID cards.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/5">Commissioner Vitorino then presented the Communication on the implementation of measures agreed at the Tampere Council in 1999 and highlighting the positive work done, notably on migration and counter-terrorism. Emphasising that the new College and JHA Commissioner would have their own views on the future JHA programme, Vitorino identified integration of the new member states into Schengen, and action at the EU's external border to combat illegal immigration and trafficking as important areas for future JHA action. He also saw a need for further work on common standards for criminal procedural law, on data protection and on rules on evidence in cross-border prosecutions. Finally, he identified the need for better evaluation and implementation of adopted legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/6">A minority of member states then gave initial reactions to the document and set out some of their priorities. The Netherlands indicated that they expected the June European Council to task the JHA Council with developing an appropriate response to the Commission's Communication. They therefore asked for written comments from member states and indicated that there would be further Ministerial discussion of the Communication at the July JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/7">The Council reached a general approach on the Framework Decision on mutual recognition of confiscation orders. The Presidency commended work done so far to prepare the future EU drugs strategy 2005&ndash;12. There was no decision on who should be the director of Europol.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/8">Under Any Other Business Germany noted that all member states were welcome to join the recent common declaration by Germany, the Benelux countries and Austria on efforts to improve practical law enforcement co-operation. Immigration and Asylum</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/9">Following agreement, welcome to the UK, that it could be used by member states to support resettlement schemes the Council reached agreement on the Council Decision to establish the European Refugee Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/10">In addition, the Council adopted the Council Decision establishing the Visa Information System and Council Conclusions setting out the elements for establishing preparatory actions for a financial instrument for managing returns. A General Approach was reached on the Council Recommendation on facilitating the admission to the EU of scientific researchers.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/11">The Commission presented two Communications. The first on the links between legal and illegal migration focused on economic migration, bilateral labour agreements and regularisation measures but concluded that the impact of legal migration measures on illegal immigration was impossible to quantify.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/12">The Commission indicated that, later this year, they planned to issue a Green Paper on the extent to which the admission of economic migrants should be regulated at EU level, but noted that there was no consensus on the (Italian Presidency's) idea of an EU migration quota.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/13">The second communication on the entry to the EU of people in need of international protection focused on enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin and resettlement in the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/14">I welcomed the Communication and made clear that although our earlier proposals on zones of protection had been a useful contribution to the debate, our thinking had moved on and we were no longer pushing them. Two other member states intervened: one to support the communication and the second to oppose. The Presidency therefore concluded that there would be further debate at the July JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/15">During the Mixed Committee the Presidency sought views on whether the draft Regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in passports should require one or two mandatory biometric identifiers, and whether the second identifier&mdash;be it mandatory or optional&mdash;should be fingerprints. I pointed out that the UK is currently running trials of the different technologies and that it would be better to wait for the results before deciding what the second identifier should be. Although two other member states supported me, a majority supported fingerprints as a second indicator although there was no consensus as to whether this should be mandatory. The Presidency concluded that further work should proceed on the basis of one mandatory biometric identifier, the facial image, and a second optional indicator, namely fingerprints.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/16">In the margins of the Council Ministers agreed an intergovernmental resolution calling for certain linguistic changes to be made to member states' passports to take account of EU enlargement and calling on the new member states to start issuing EU formatted passports from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1515W.2/17">Finally, the list of A points as in 10120/04 PTS A 28 was adopted. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1520W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1520W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> In the August 2004 edition of the Codes it is proposed to remove the legislative requirement for an officer of Inspector rank to be in charge of searches under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Schedule 1 or the Terrorism Act 2000, Schedule 5. This change will provide consistency with other parts of the Codes whereby the officer in charge of the search is the senior officer present (See Code B, 2F). Searches in the categories specified will not always require supervision by an officer of Inspector rank and judgements about the necessary level of supervision need to be made in each individual case.</p>
	<p pid=".1520W.2/3"><i>(b)</i> It is proposed that the following paragraph be inserted into Code C, paragraph 3.4: &quot;If the arresting officer is not physically present when the detainee is brought to a police station, the arresting officer's account must be made available to the custody officer remotely or by a third party on the arresting officer's behalf&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1520W.2/4">This new provision will enable officers to remain on front-line duties without being taken &quot;off the street&quot; to travel to and from the police station. It will also enable greater use of designated detention officers under sections 38 and 39 of the Police Reform Act 2002. The Code does not currently require the arresting officer to be present at the point at which the suspect is brought before the custody officer.</p>

	<p pid=".1521W.11/3">Integrated case management is a key feature of ECP. It requires there to be structured communication between the people involved in delivering the different components of an order. This structured liaison and integration has been approved by the Accreditation Panel.</p>

The views of participating states varied widely, particularly over the balance to be struck between freedom of expression and combating hate speech. We expect the final report of the conference to issue within a month. The report will be discussed at the OSCE's Human Dimension Implementation Meeting in October, along with the reports of the Anti-Semitism Conference held in Berlin in April and the Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination Conference held in Brussels in September. OSCE participating states are then likely to reach a decision on political commitments on tolerance at the Ministerial meeting due to be held in Sofia in December.</p>

	<p pid=".1536W.5/1">We have investigated the difference and unfortunately found that the number of pupils taking free school meals in Surrey secondary schools in January 2002 as previously published by the Department was not accurate.</p>
	<p pid=".1536W.5/2">The available statistics are based upon returns from the Annual Schools Census. These returns provide the number of pupils who had a free school meal at lunchtime on the Census day itself. One secondary school in Surrey recorded an incorrect total in the 2002 Annual Schools Census. This was the first year of a change from paper forms to electronic returns and this error was not noticed at the time. The published statistics reflect the data as returned by the school; hence the Surrey total was erroneously higher than the number of pupils who were eligible for a free meal. I have instructed officials to highlight this error on the Department's statistical website where the 2002 figures are published and to check other related publications.</p>
	<p pid=".1536W.5/3">Numbers of pupils eligible to receive free school meals are also derived from the Annual Schools Census. The eligibility information is collected at pupil level and is subject to more detailed validation checks. The pupil level returns are aggregated to form school and LEA statistics that are widely used within the Department and beyond. There are no known concerns about the accuracy of the eligibility statistics.</p>

The implementation of the Licensing Act 2003 will further tighten these laws by extending their scope, increasing penalties, removing existing anomalies and making licences more instantly at risk of forfeit where offences take place.</p>

Friend, The Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-11">11 June 2004</phrase> that the Home Office police standards unit, working in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers, will be inviting forces and other partners from across the country to take part in a co-ordinated programme of enforcement and initiatives to tackle alcohol fuelled violence. The campaign includes targeting the irresponsible few who encourageunderage and binge drinking and targeting drunken behaviour. This takes forward one of the recommendations in the Government's alcohol harm reduction strategy for England.</p>
	<p pid=".1541W.2/4">The Department produces a number of leaflets for young people and their parents setting out the risks of alcohol misuse. The Department also plans to develop a range of new health promotion messages for binge drinkers, many of whom will be teenagers. The Government's alcohol harm reduction strategy for England set out the framework of a voluntary social responsibility scheme for alcohol producers and retailers. The Department and the Home Office will work with the drinks industry to develop this scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".1545W.5/1">Initial application fees for new drugs cover the work associated with the assessment and evaluation of an application prior to granting a marketing authorisation. Fees for post-marketing surveillance of authorised drugs are charged through an annual service fee for each live marketing authorisation. This service fee covers a number of activities, including enforcement, renewals and post-marketing surveillance activities and it accounts for around 36 per cent., of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's annual budget.</p>
	<p pid=".1545W.5/2">The service fee is tiered according to the type of application, to reflect the increased post-marketing activity in newer drugs, compared to well established generic drugs. A newly authorised medicine attracts an annual service fee of &pound;14,768, compared to &pound;1,521 for an established prescription only medicine, or &pound;275 for a general sale list product. Because the service fee covers a number of activities, it is not possible to estimate the amount available purely for post-marketing surveillance for each new product.</p>

The NHSFT model allows trusts to tailor their proposals to meet the individual circumstances of their hospital and community, within certain parameters set out in legislation. There will be, for example, significant local variation on costs surrounding the creation and maintenance of a membership organisation. The cost of each election will also vary depending on the size of the electorate and the level of documentation provided. It would appear that typical costs for the elections for the first NHSFTs have come out at a little over &pound;1 per member. The costs of the governance arrangements will not necessarily be entirely additional as they will replicate some current activity that NHS trusts are already doing around informing the public, patients and staff about issues affecting the trust.</p>

It would appear that typical costs for the elections for the first NHSFTs have come out at a little over &pound;1 per member. The costs of the governance arrangements will not necessarily be entirely additional as they will replicate some current activity that NHS trusts are already doing around informing the public, patients and staff about issues affecting the trust.</p>
	<p pid=".1548W.2/2">The Department has provided &pound;250,000 direct financial support to each wave 1 applicant and, to date, &pound;175,000 to wave 1A applicants to assist them in their preparations for their application and establishment as a NHSFT. It is for each trust to determine how this resource is best spent.</p>

	<p pid=".1551W.2/1">In line with the recommendations of the committee on medical aspects of food and nutrition policy (COMA), Healthy Start will provide vouchers to qualifying pregnant women and families that can be exchanged for fresh fruit and vegetables as well as milk and infant formula. Advice and support will be offered to beneficiaries to help them establish healthy diets that contain appropriate vitamins and minerals.</p>
	<p pid=".1551W.2/2">Additional vouchers will be given to qualifying families with children aged 0&ndash;12 months from estimated date of delivery if later than their first birthday. This reflects COMA's concern that low birth weight babies have an increased risk of developing iron deficiency. Healthy Start will also provide vouchers to all women under 18 who become pregnant, regardless of their family income, because of their increased nutritional vulnerability.</p>

	<p pid=".1551W.5/1">The Department undertakes regular surveys to monitor the diet and health of children. The national diet and nutrition survey (NDNS) indicated that the reported prevalence of anaemia varies markedly between populations studied. The NDNS showed that more than 10 per cent, of children aged 1.5 to 2.5 years were anaemic. This fell to 6 per cent. for children aged 2.5 to 3.5 years. Iron intakes are also considerably lower in young women with 50 per cent. of 15 to 18-year-olds with intakes well below the recommended amounts, which can put them at risk of iron deficiency anaemia.</p>
	<p pid=".1551W.5/2">There are no significant regional differences or differences by household benefit status for men or women in iron deficiency anaemia, although it is more common among certain ethnic groups such as those from an Asian and Afro-Caribbean background. However, lower intakes of both iron and vitamin C, which helps in the adsorption of iron, were associated with manual groups.</p>

The code of practice sets out the types of interests that should be declared and also provides a framework for ensuring that conflicts of interests are avoided in the course of the advisory bodies' work.

	<p pid=".1559W.8/1">Figures for sickness absence in the national health service in England were not collected by the Department between 1997 and 1999. We do not collect or produce information for number of days or the average number of days lost per NHS employee but publish the figures as a percentage lost of the time they should have been available for work. General practitioners and their staff are not included in these figures. The Department does not collect separate information for doctors or nurses.</p>
	<p pid=".1559W.8/2">The national NHS sickness absence level for 2003 is 4.7 per cent. This is slightly higher than the figure for 2002 of 4.6 per cent., but is lower than the figure for 2001 of 4.8 per cent. The overall NHS sickness absence rates have changed little over the last five years. The continued importance given to the management of sickness absence by NHS employers should show further improvements in the absence levels. The table shows the figures published for sickness absence in the NHS in England and its regions and covers the period from 2002 to 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1560W.8/1">Guidance on prescribing and use of Zyban, including possible side effects, is provided in the authorised summary of product characteristics for health professionals and patient information leaflet. Key prescribing information is also included in the British National Formulary which is sent by the Department to doctors and pharmacists within the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.8/2">Since marketing, the safety of Zyban has been closely monitored by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM has looked at the accumulating evidence from Yellow Card reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), received in association with its use. In accordance with their advice, a number of steps have been taken to optimise the safe use of Zyban and to minimise the risk of side effects, particularly seizures. This includes advice to general practitioners and smoking cessation clinics, which was issued in March 2001, reminding them of the safety profile of Zyban and of information posted on the CSM website.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.8/3">In May 2001, the CSM issued new guidance strengthened warnings particularly about potential interactions with other medicines and advised a slower increase in the dose of Zyban in order to minimise the risk of side effects, the lower 150mg dose should be prescribed for the first six days, increasing to 150mg twice daily on day seven rather than day four. This new guidance was issued in order to allow more time for the drug levels to stabilise, to help minimise the risk of adverse reactions, particularly seizures. Since this guidance was issued, the reporting rate of suspected ADRs has fallen significantly.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.8/4">A total of 8,466 reports of suspected adverse reactions have been received via the Yellow Card scheme in the United Kingdom. The most commonly reported reactions are urticaria, insomnia, rash, headache, dizziness and nausea, which are recognised reactions and are listed in the product information provided to prescribers and patients. It is important to note that these suspected reactions are not necessarily caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as nicotine withdrawal, other illnesses or other medicines taken concurrently.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.8/5">The safety of Zyban continues to be monitored closely by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority/CSM. The CSM has advised that the balance of the effectiveness of Zyban in helping people to stop smoking, and the health benefits that this brings, compared with the risk of adverse effects remains favourable.</p>

	<p pid=".1562W.5/1">Implementation of the Patten Report's proposal to create an enlarged part-time police reserve rests currently with both the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board. The enabling legislation has been fully implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".1562W.5/2">A pilot recruitment exercise in four District Command Unit areas (Lisburn, Coleraine, Newtownabbey and Banbridge) has taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".1562W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-17">17 October 2003</phrase>, Denis Bradley, Vice Chairman of the Policing Board, issued a press release stating that all vacancies for part-time reserve officers in the four pilot districts would be filled. The first 10 officers from the pilot entered training in February 2004 and were attested on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-05">5 March</phrase>. However, the press release also announced the decision to evaluate the pilot recruitment exercise before a further recruitment exercise would take place to improve the process for subsequent rounds of recruitment. Following the outcome of the evaluation it will be a matter for the Policing Board and PSNI to decide the next phase of the recruitment of part-time reserve officers.</p>
