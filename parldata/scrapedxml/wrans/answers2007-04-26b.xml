	<p pid="b.1204W.12/1">The Traffic Officer Service is a 24 hour- 365 day operation covering all the motorways in England and certain key interlinking trunk roads. Given the nature of the service it is essential that the vehicles which are provided for patrol activities are able to safely operate in adverse weather conditions such as snow and slippery surfaces, hence four wheel drive is considered to be essential. This drive provision also enables the vehicles to be used for certain carriageway clearance operations. There is also a further requirement for a high payload in order to carry the crew, essential kit and, where appropriate, passengers, which means that only vehicles of a particular size can safely be used.</p>

There are practical difficulties with this and unless a name and address of the keeper of the foreign vehicle is provided the Agency is unable to pursue these cases. The Agency is able to utilise other enforcement action such as the wheel clamping and impounding of a vehicle. Vehicle keepers are required to provide evidence of registration in the UK and licensing before the release of the vehicle. The number of prosecutions of foreign vehicles under this legislation in each of the last five years is not collated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206W.0/2">It is not possible to confirm which of the remaining 47 sites will be operational by October 2008. This is because acquisition and construction are subject to market availability, planning consent, brownfield remediation, and other factors outside DSA's control.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is the matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary for Work and Pensions, what action he is taking to speed up execution of arrest warrants in cases of persistent failure to pay child support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/5" class="indent">and;</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/6" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the target time is for the period between the issuance and execution of arrest warrants in cases of persistent failure to pay child support; and what the average time was in the last period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/7" class="indent">The priority for execution of child support warrants is set by each Magistrates' court who will arrange for the execution of warrants through either their own civilian enforcement officers or the Police. The Agency cannot set a target for the executions of warrants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/8" class="indent">The Agency is working with the Office for Criminal Reform and the Department of Constitutional Affairs on an ongoing basis to improve the current time taken to execute arrest warrants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/9" class="indent">The current management information system cannot provide the average period between the issuance and execution of warrants. As at the end of January 2007 the Agency had 278 outstanding warrants in England and Wales. The average period for which these have been outstanding is approximately 50 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/10" class="indent">I hope you find this response helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about the closure of Swaffham and Downham Market Jobcentres. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/4" class="indent">You are already aware that we are currently consulting on the closure of both these sites, and no decision will be made on the closure of either Swaffham or Downham Market until the consultation is complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/5" class="indent">Both these offices currently deliver the full range of Jobcentre Plus services including Fortnightly Jobsearch Reviews for customers in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance. The only exception to this is when customers require New Jobseeker interviews; these are delivered from Dereham for Swaffham customers, and Kings Lynn for Downham Market customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/6" class="indent">Both Jobcentres also provide Jobsearch facilities through our Job Point technology. Additionally customers can access these services via the internet and our Contact Centre Jobseekers Direct Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/7" class="indent">If closure of these Jobcentres does go ahead, we intend to provide all advisory and Fortnightly Jobsearch Reviews in other locations. For Downham Market customers this would usually be at Kings Lynn, unless transport links make it easier for them to travel elsewhere. The majority of Swaffham customers would use Dereham Jobcentre, again unless transport links make it easier for them to travel to another Jobcentre. However we will also consider the provision of alternative ways for customers to access our services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/8" class="indent">As part of the consultation we are already considering how we could provide these alternative services. In Downham Market we have opened discussion with the Local Authority regarding the feasibility of delivering Fortnightly Jobsearch Reviews from existing Local Authority premises. We have not yet been able to identify similar opportunities in Swaffham but are continuing discussions with our partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/9" class="indent">In addition to these specific proposals we will ensure that our Internet access and Contact Centre Jobsearch facilities are marketed to our customers. We are also looking at the feasibility of locating some of our Job Points in partner premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.5/10" class="indent">The financial savings that could be realised if these sites are closed would depend upon the potential alternative services provided.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213W.2/1">New contracts for the delivery of New Deal programmes commenced in May 2006 in Scotland, and in July 2006 in England and Wales. None of those contracts has to date been terminated.

	<p pid="b.1213W.2/2">One New Deal prime contract in Jobcentre Plus's South Tyne and Wear Valley District will end by mutual agreement in October 2007. This is because Jobcentre Plus has concluded that the arrangements in place do not deliver the outcomes and quality service expected for customers. Alternative arrangements are being established.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213W.2/3">Ineffective providers are dealt with through Department for Work and Pensions contract management processes. In the first instance, a performance improvement plan is agreed with the contractor. If performance fails to improve within a reasonable timescale, a formal breach notice is issued to the contractor. If contract delivery continues to fall below the required standard, the contract is terminated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1215W.3/1">Housing revenue account (HRA) subsidy is based on a notional measure of authorities' income (which is mainly rents) and expenditure. If need to spend is assumed to be greater than assumed income, then the authority is assumed to have a deficit and HRA subsidy is paid to the authority to make up that shortfall. If the assumed income is greater than the assumed need to spend, this negative subsidy is captured, recycled within the HRA subsidy system and used to help pay for the subsidy entitlement of the deficit authorities. Even with this recycling, in the most recent year for which audited data are available (2005-06), the Exchequer still made an annual contribution of over &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1215W.3/2">Surpluses (and deficits) are not related to the efficiency of a council in operating its HRA. Surpluses rarely, if ever, occur where the need to spend is greatest; if we were to allow those authorities that make surpluses to retain them this would, within the total funding levels agreed, mean reduced subsidies and therefore higher rents, for all those authorities with a deficit. The alternative would be higher taxes or cuts in services. We also need to recognise that the surpluses that are being generated by some authorities come from housing that has largely been funded by central Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1215W.3/3">The Department is currently working with a group of local authorities to investigate the potential benefits, in terms of asset management, efficiency and better outcomes, of allowing some councils to leave the subsidy system. Self financing would involve a one-off settlement to replace future subsidy or surplus payments. As such, it would not be a means for surplus authorities simply to retain a larger share of overall housing resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.1217W.2/1">The number of staff transferring from existing control rooms will not be known until the local authority controlled companies have formulated proposals on staff numbers and structure, and criteria have been developed that define the circumstances under which it would be unreasonable for staff to transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.2/2">The Department has published guidance on a wide range of issues relating to the transfer and many informal discussions with staff have been held. Formal consultation is a matter for the current employers and the regional control centre companies. For staff who are unlikely to be able to transfer, fire and rescue authorities have been encouraged to find alternative jobs, and where appropriate, to provide retraining. Costs of redeployment and retraining will be borne by the Department, within reason. The Department seeks to avoid compulsory redundancies where possible.</p>

Only a small number are rejected&mdash;the majority of those not approved will be still going through the application process. Of those applications approved, 716 were subsequently cancelled. This can be a result of applicants formally withdrawing from the scheme or, for example, detailed financial checks revealing county court judgments.

	<p pid="b.1221W.0/2">The time taken to commission gas infrastructure projects following the initial planning application can be affected by a range of factors&mdash;including commercial or technical issues which are for developers themselves to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.0/3">The Government have implemented measures to avoid unnecessary delays at the planning application stage in dealing with major infrastructure projects under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. These could, depending on individual circumstances, include gas infrastructure projects. Section 44 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 inserted new sections 76A and 76B into the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to allow the Secretary of State to designate a planning application a major infrastructure project if she thinks it is of national or regional importance. If such is done, the application would be processed via special procedures which are aimed at speeding up the decision making process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229W.5/1">DEFRA is aware of the press reports about the situation in the USA in respect of the widespread loss of bees described as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Reports of high colony losses have come from at least 22 states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/2">In the UK, scientists and inspectors at the National Bee Unit (NBU) are monitoring the situation, and are in contact with experts in the USA and in Europe to learn the latest results of research into abnormal colony mortality. The NBU has taken samples for further analysis from the few apiaries in England and Wales found this spring with unusually high colony loss for which there is no readily identifiable cause. This work will help the NBU ascertain whether there is a common cause for such losses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/3">The DEFRA budget for bee health research and development in 2006-07 is &pound;200,000, which is comparable to previous years, and covers work on all pests and diseases of bees. If findings in the US or elsewhere identify a research need in the UK, the necessary resources would be found as part of our contingency response to emerging new threats.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/4">Colony loss is known in Europe, but there is currently no reason to link high colony losses in the USA to the situation in Europe. Recent cases in Spain and Portugal seem likely to have been caused by <i> Nosema ceranae</i>, a spore-forming protozoan that invades the digestive tracts of bees, as well as the impact of varroa.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/5">If a common cause for high colony loss in the USA is identified and it is pest or disease-related, it is unlikely to be imported here, as long as the rules restricting imports from third countries are respected. It is illegal to import bees from the mainland of the USA.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.2/1">The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, commonly known as the tuberculin &quot;skin test&quot;, is the primary screening test for TB in cattle in Great Britain and other parts of the European Union (EU). The skin test is the internationally accepted standard for surveillance for infection with <i> Mycobacterium bovis</i>, and is considered the best screening test currently available for detecting TB in cattle. No diagnostic test is 100 per cent. accurate, but the current skin test is effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/2">In October 2006, the Government extended the use of the gamma interferon blood test, alongside the skin test, to improve the sensitivity of the testing regime for controlling disease in infected herds by identifying more infected animals more quickly. It is being applied mainly in herds disclosing TB infection in low risk areas to help ensure infection does not become established in cattle or wildlife. It will also continue to be available for use as a disease control tool in areas of higher incidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/3">In line with recommendations from the scientific community, DEFRA continues to fund further research into improved diagnostics for bovine TB.</p>

	<p pid="b.1233W.2/1">Scientific studies suggest that a ban on the landing of berried lobsters and an increase in the Minimum Landing Size (MLS), if equally complied with, would provide similar conservation benefits. However, a ban on the taking of berried lobsters would be almost impossible to enforce, and we know it is likely to be widely ignored. Its potential contribution to lobster conservation may therefore not be realized.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.2/2">As a MLS can be more effectively enforced and very difficult to ignore, I chose to investigate this option in the interests of getting effective conservation results. We have recently completed a consultation on proposals for increasing the MLS for lobsters and will announce the conclusions from it in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1233W.5/1">Energy efficient light bulbs contain a small amount of mercury (less than 5 milligrams per lamp) and are therefore classified as hazardous waste. They should be disposed of responsibly by local authorities (LAs) and in accordance with waste regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.5/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July</phrase> this year, long life bulbs, where collected with other waste electrical equipment, will need to be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations. LAs that register their civic amenity sites as designated collection facilities (DCFs) for WEEE will be entitled to free collection from those sites by producer compliance schemes. Once these bulbs are collected, producers will be responsible for their treatment and recycling. Guidance on the WEEE regulations, including on how LAs can register their sites as DCFs, is available from the Department for Trade and Industry. Guidance on the WEEE treatment requirements was issued by DEFRA in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233W.5/3">There is increasing evidence that the mercury in each energy efficient bulb is considerably outweighed by the mercury put into the atmosphere through the additional electricity generation required to operate a traditional bulb.</p>

	<p pid="b.1244W.10/1">Since the introduction of human trafficking offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 the number of prosecutions brought to court has increased from 16 in 2004-05 to 116 in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244W.10/2">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) can only prosecute those cases which are referred to it by investigators. The CPS is working with colleagues in the Home Office to strengthen and improve investigation, law enforcement and the prosecution process against those who commit human trafficking offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244W.10/3">The UK Action Plan on tackling human trafficking, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-23">23 March 2007</phrase>, recognises the need to ensure that human trafficking becomes part of 'core' police business by improving the capability of the police and their partners. Actions include the development of 'key diagnostic indicators' to measure performance and progress in dealing with human trafficking issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244W.10/4">The United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) is now recognised as the central point for the development of law enforcement expertise. The CPS is working closely with the UKHTC in developing .and taking forward training packages and courses for police, other law enforcement agencies and Crown prosecutors. Training, together with the development of an early victim identification toolkit for front-line police and immigration officers, will enable identification of trafficked victims at the earliest opportunity. This should prevent potential trafficked victims who have committed immigration offences from being removed before providing information or intelligence to investigators.</p>

	<p pid="b.1245W.5/1">My hon. Friend has drawn my attention to a recent case involving two constituents which raises issues about the way our current provisions for dealing with confiscation and compensate operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.5/2">The Fraud Review, commissioned by the Government in 2005, conducted a short survey of fraud victims from a random selection of City of London prosecutions. It was apparent from the survey that victims were predominantly concerned that fraud offences would not be repeated. Victims also hoped to be compensated for their losses, although they had no general expectation that this would happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.5/3">The Fraud Review recommended that the Crown court should have wider powers to deal with the consequences of fraud offences. The Government have agreed that these recommendations need to be considered further, and that consideration will include wider powers to compensate victims of fraud offences. In relation to wider powers the views and experiences of victims will be one of the main considerations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.5/4">In giving further consideration to these issues, the Government will consider any lessons we might learn from other jurisdictions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248W.6/1">The cost of providing third line contracted-out career transition partnership (CTP) services to service leavers using the Regional Resettlement Centre (RRC) at Aldergrove during financial years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 was &pound;286,000, &pound;397,000 and &pound;391,000 respectively. These sums cover only the per capita payments made to the CTP contractor, Right Coutts Ltd, for full resettlement service registrations and discharges, and employment support programme registrations and discharges. It does not cover the cost of providing the facilities of RRC Aldergrove to the CTP contractor, or his staffing costs, which cannot be disaggregated from contracted price standing charges for all CTP facility manpower across the UK and Germany.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.6/2">Neither do these figures include the cost of resettlement services provided in Northern Ireland by single service education and resettlement staffs: such information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Moreover, disaggregation of the proportion of time spent on resettlement provision by many who also deliver general education services to service personnel stationed in Northern Ireland would be subjective in the absence of recorded activity. The cost of resettlement training for the service leavers using RRC Aldergrove over this period, and their associated travel and subsistence costs, is not held centrally and could also only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, the maximum sum claimable by service leavers who discharged over this period in terms of individual resettlement training costs grant only would have been in the order of &pound;900,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.6/3">None of the per capita sums represents housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.6/4">Since all CTP services are provided under contract, and not directly by the MOD, no MOD personnel were directly involved in delivering services under the CTP contract. Information on the break-down of grade structure of MOD personnel involved in delivering resettlement services at unit or local level could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251W.9/1">Service in the Suez Canal Zone during the post-war years was recognised by the institution of the Naval General Service Medal 1915-62 and the General Service Medal 1918-62, with the clasp 'Canal Zone', for service between 1951 and 1954 and the clasp 'Near East', for participation in Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis of late 1956. There is no officially recognised 'Suez Medal'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251W.9/2">Similarly, no medal has been instituted for undertaking a period of National Service. National Servicemen could qualify for campaign medals under the same circumstances as their Regular colleagues. It would be divisive to offer National Servicemen a medal for being conscripted, when those who volunteered for service might not have received any award. Accordingly, there are no plans to introduce a new medal specifically for National Service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256W.2/1">The evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 includes a review of the statutory Guidance given to the licensing authorities; the independent review of licence fees, which has included some areas of licensing administration; the impact of the Act on the four licensing objectives; and the DCMS simplification plan published in December last year. The evaluation will not be complete until later this year. It should be noted that the administration of the 2003 Act is devolved by its provisions to local licensing authorities. Local licensing authorities have some discretion to respond to local circumstances and absolute consistency is not an aim of the legislation. Where inconsistency is generated by misunderstanding, the Government have attempted to provide clarification through the statutory Guidance. We expect to publish revised Guidance in the early summer.</p>

These guidelines were published in October 2006. Standards for the clinical care of children and adults with thalassaemia in the UK were published in June 2005. The guidelines were sponsored by the UK Thalassaemia Society and endorsed by the Department.</p>

The PEA is provided for care home residents to have money to spend, as they wish, on small items such as on stationery or personal toiletries. It takes into account the fact that people in care homes generally have fewer personal expenses than those living in their own homes. The PEA was increased to &pound;20.45 per week on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-09">9 April 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266W.8/1">No assessment has been made of the adequacy of the level of support offered to women with postnatal mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.8/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) postnatal care guideline, published in July 2006, recommends a fully personalised plan for each woman, which takes into account her and her baby's individual needs. The guideline also places great importance on healthcare professionals, taking into account the particular needs of individual families and on having the competencies required for each routine postnatal visit or appointment with the mother or baby, so that they can recognise any signs and symptoms of potentially life-threatening conditions. It recommends that all maternity care providers (whether working in hospital or in primary care) should implement an externally evaluated structured programme that encourages breastfeeding. NICE also made recommendations in its recent guidance to improve services for women who experience mental health problems during or after pregnancy. We expect mental health services available for such women to improve as local services implement the Department's and the Institute's guidance in light of their assessment of local need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.8/3">One of the key commissioning mechanisms of the framework for Commissioning health and wellbeing, which went out for consultation in March 2007, includes placing emphasis on the importance of primary care trusts and local authorities working together to develop practical and deliverable proposals for improving maternity services including the development of maternity, neonatal and perinatal mental health networks and Children's Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.8/4">Our framework document &quot;Maternity Matters: Choice, access and continuity of care in a safe service&quot; outlines our strategy to deliver and achieve our commitment to give women clinically appropriate choice over the maternity services they will receive. This was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April</phrase> and it includes outlining the roles that service providers and commissioners will have in the provision of woman-focused, family-centred maternity services, incorporating the need to commission high-quality, equitable, integrated maternity services as part of maternity, neonatal and perinatal mental health networks according to local need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.2/1" qnum="131877">To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the answer of 23 March 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1194W, on hospital waiting lists, what assessment she has made of the statistical significance of the moderate correlation between the secondary sector clinical targets and service initial positions in 2003-04 and the age-needs index.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.3/1">The distance between several secondary sector service targets and the service initial positions in March 2003-04 is moderately correlated to the age/needs index: the primary care trust health economies with low age/needs had modestly further to travel to achieve the targets. However, numerous parts of the country with low age/needs did not have far to travel in meeting these targets. The correlation is not a perfect one (with correlation co-efficients ranging from -0.28 in the case of distance to the accident and emergency four hour wait and age/needs to -0.13 in the case of distance to the out-patient booking targets and age/needs). The reasons behind the relationship are complex.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.3/2">Secondary sector under-performance in low age/needs areas is likely to have existed for some time prior to March 2003-04. By raising the quality of care to uniform national standards, the Government have significantly improved the services provided to patients in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.3/3">The age and need indices, and the interactions between them, are currently being reviewed by independent academic researchers under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation. A new age and need adjustment for weighted capitation may emerge from this research for resource allocation in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.2/2">Personality disorders are common conditions, with a considerable variation in the severity and degree of distress and dysfunction caused. An independent study, &quot;The Epidemiology of Personality Disorders&quot; by Dr. Paul Moran, in 2002 reported a prevalence rate of personality disorder amongst adults in the community of 10 to 13 per cent. However, this estimate is for all personality disorders, and a separate prevalence rate for dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) was not made in the Moran study.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/3">Approximately 250 to 300 people are being treated and supported by established specialist national health service personality disorder services, without any form of detention, and an additional 1300 people in new medium secure, community forensic and non-forensic pilot services. Of the latter, about 50 people at any one time will be undergoing in-patient assessment or treatment under sections of the Mental Health Act. There are 40 secure places within forensic mental health services for people with personality disorder who need treatment under detention. A further 400 male patients are detained on court orders under the legal category of psychopathic disorder in secure psychiatric hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/4">DSPD is not a clinical diagnosis but a description of a patient profile for those whose personality disorder is of an acuteness or severity and risk to indicate they are likely to be the most serious threat to others. There are an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 individuals in the prison population who meet DSPD criteria. Although there are no existing research data on the number of people with DSPD in the community, further work has been commissioned to provide prospective data about the size of this group, which are expected to be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.2/5">DSPD pilot services are provided within Rampton and Broadmoor high secure hospitals and Her Majesty's Prisons at Whitemoor, Frankland and Low Newton. The current figures for those receiving assessment and treatment within these services is 66 in the national health service and 143 in the prison estate. All are detained, with a majority serving current prison sentences.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.5/2">As part of the Saving Lives programme, which is designed to support national health service trusts in reducing healthcare associated infections like methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), high impact interventions have been developed. The high impact interventions are simple evidence based tools. They reinforce the practical actions that clinical staff need to undertake every time for key procedures in order to significantly reduce healthcare-associated infections including MRSA. They cover preventing the risk of microbial contamination (which includes hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, aseptic technique and safe disposal of sharps), central venous catheter care, peripheral line care, renal dialysis catheter care, preventing surgical site infection, care of ventilated patients and urinary catheter care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/3">The Department also published enhanced advice on screening, including decolonisation, in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/4">The Rapid Review Panel (RRP) has reviewed two hydrogen peroxide vapour products and recommended that both products have potential value and that in use trials are now needed. Trials have been undertaken within the national health service and these products have been utilised in outbreak situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/5">It is not known how widely hydrogen peroxide vapour is used in the NHS. The NHS does not collect data regarding the usage of products by individual trusts or collectively for the NHS. NHS trusts are free to choose which products to purchase and will maintain their own records.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.5/6">The Department is liaising with all the bodies which play a role in the assessment of innovative products about how the Department might best assist the take-up of products that have a favourable RRP recommendation. Discussions are at an early stage. Ultimately, they will include how innovative products are assessed for cost-effectiveness and their impact on services, thus creating a more streamlined process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290W.0/1">Within the last year, the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit (PMDU) has carried out eight reviews on different governmental delivery and reform priorities, which involved visits to 35 primary care trusts (PCTs). For each review a number of sites were chosen to ask front line staff about their experience of delivery and the issues they face. The sites were chosen on the basis of a PCTs characteristics (e.g. urban or rural populations) and local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.0/2">The final reports that were produced following each of these reviews were developed jointly with the Department of Health, and act as confidential advice to the Prime Minister, Department of Health Ministers and Secretary of State. Each report was circulated by the PMDU to the Prime Minister. In addition, the Department of Health lead official for each review also circulated the report to relevant senior officials within the Department of Health and to relevant Ministers and/or Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.0/3">Only one of the eight reviews involved three Government Departments, and as such was therefore shared with the senior officials, and Ministers/Secretaries of State, as appropriate from the Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills, and the Department for Culture Media and Sport.</p>

	<p pid="b.1293W.8/1">There are 47 academies now open. Information on the sponsor of each academy and the sponsors' donations received to date towards open academies' capital costs&mdash;rather than total sponsorship committed&mdash;is given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1293W.8/2">Sponsorship for the first academies has been provided in the form of a contribution to the capital costs of buildings. However, we have changed the sponsorship model and sponsors will now, as the norm, establish an endowment fund worth &pound;2 million (or &pound;1.5 million for the fourth or subsequent academy for sponsors of multiple academies), with a minimum of &pound;500,000 payable in the first year. Payment of the endowment will normally be over five years. To date, only one open academy, St Mark's academy in Merton, has this form of sponsorship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1293W.8/3">Sponsors' donations contributing to capital costs are normally made over the lifetime of the building costs of the project, so in some cases a number of payments towards capital costs remain to be made. In other cases, sponsors' payments have been made, but are not recorded in the table as auditors have not yet completed their checks on whether these were spent on capital or recurrent costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1297W.2/1">No formal discussions have taken place at the level of the United Kingdom or the European Union with a view to establishing a European Union-wide common school textbook. The Department would oppose such a textbook, should it be formally proposed, as it is an important part of schools' autonomy that they are able to decide which resources they use to reach their teaching objectives. Furthermore, the implementation of such an EU-level proposal would be entirely at the discretion of each member state, as there is very little European Community competence in the field of education and training.</p>

	<p pid="b.1297W.8/1">Since 2001, people enrolling on Learning and Skills Council (LSC) supported English for Speakers of Other Languages courses have been entitled to automatic fee remission provided that they meet the LSC's eligibility criteria for publicly funded further education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.8/2">Entry to a course by any learner will depend on an initial assessment which confirms that a Skills for Life ESOL course is the most appropriate way of meeting their learning needs. For au pairs, this is unlikely to be the case as Skills for Life ESOL courses are intended to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged learners in settled communities, not those who are temporarily in the UK possibly with the intention of learning English.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.8/3">However, if ESOL is appropriate, the following eligibility and fee arrangements apply:</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.8/4">Under the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) Funding Guidance for 2006/07, the general rule for public funding of further education (FE) is that the learner should have been resident in the UK for three years. Citizens of European Union (EU) countries are also generally considered to be eligible, as long as they have lived in the European Economic Area (EEA) for three years. This three-year residency requirement applies equally to UK citizens who have not been resident in the UK/EEA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.8/5">However, there are already a number of exceptions to this rule that take account of exceptional circumstances. For example, newly arrived spouses do not have to wait the normal three-year period. Provided they are married to a UK resident with settled status they become eligible for FE provision once they have been resident in the UK for one year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.8/6">These residency requirements reflect the Government's view that it is reasonable to expect a person to have established a relevant connection with the UK before being allowed to benefit from funding provided by UK taxpayers. These arrangements are long standing and have generally proved to be a fair measure for determining fee status. The eligibility rules must be met by all adults seeking to qualify under the 'home' fees criteria, including UK nationals returning to this country from outside the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.8/7">Although there is no change to the eligibility conditions set out above, changes announced to fee remission will apply to all eligible learners. From August 2007, there will be no automatic fee remission for ESOL courses. Learners who can afford to do so will be asked to make a contribution to the cost of learning at a rate of 37.5 per cent. of the course fee with the Government still paying the majority of the cost. Those who are on benefits or who can evidence very low incomes will be entitled to fee remission.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.2/2">All learners eligible for support from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and enrolling on Skills for Life ESOL courses are currently entitled to automatic fee remission. Because entitlement is automatic, the LSC does not require evidence related to concessionary fees to be collected on its Individualised Learner Records. Consequently, it is not possible to use this information either to calculate those who would be entitled to full fee remission under current arrangements or to predict accurately for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.2/3">However, some evidence has been gathered to help clarify the number of people who will continue to be entitled to full fee remission from August 2007 when ESOL courses will no longer attract automatic fee remission and free tuition will only be available to priority groups, such as people who are unemployed or receiving income-based benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.2/4">For example, the South London Learning Partnership carried out a questionnaire with 12 providers covering 2,615 learners. Of these 35 per cent. are employed, of whom 89 per cent. have an income of 15,000 or below, and 51 per cent. are in receipt of benefits. Of the remainder, 19 per cent. thought they would be able to pay. On this evidence, the majority of learners seeking ESOL courses would be entitled to full fee remission.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299W.5/1">Since 1997, head teacher vacancies have remained low and fairly stable. Provisional figures released today show a fall in the head teacher vacancy rate for the maintained sector from 0.8 per cent. in January 2006 to 0.6 per cent. in January 2007. However, we know that some types of schools such as church schools, schools in London and some small schools in rural areas find it harder to recruit senior staff than others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299W.5/2">Regarding the specific work highlighted in our response to the PAC report, we have made progress on a number of fronts. On vacancy filling, we have provided an additional &pound;10 million funding to the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) to extend its support to schools and local authorities on succession planning. The NCSL is also strengthening work with governor organisations including advice on recruiting school leaders. We have further developed initiatives on bringing on new talent, including the Fast Track and Future Leader programmes. Revised professional standards for teachers, from September 2007, will provide all teachers with a clear, coherent and progressive set of career pathways and help them to prepare for leadership. More broadly, the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) study identified a number of issues affecting recruitment to leadership positions and we will be working with key stakeholders, including the social partners, to make progress on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1301W.2/1">Practical food lessons are a statutory requirement within the primary National Curriculum. Pupils carry out practical tasks that develop their knowledge, skills and understanding, including the importance of healthy eating. For example, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority Schemes of Work include units on eating more fruit and vegetables and healthy sandwiches. The Department funds Food Partnerships where expert secondary food technology teachers train and support primary colleagues in practical food lessons.</p>

However, subjects like chemistry and physics are starting to become more popular and the measures we are taking to increase demand and the extra &pound;75 million announced last year should help to sustain capacity as demand increases. Physics and chemistry are also taught as major subjects at some 50 and 70 UK institutions respectively. We have consistently made clear that if a physics or chemistry department closes at one institution, the Higher Education Funding Council for England should seek to maintain capacity elsewhere and we announced last year that the council should report to us on how provision can be maintained in this way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306W.8/1">Data on those assessed as having a special educational need (SEN) is not captured on the FE individualised learner record (ILR) databases that underpin the success rate figures produced by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). However, learner self-assessment of whether they have a learning difficulty, disability and/or health problem is recorded on the LSC's learner data for learners participating in work-based learning, further education and adult and community learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.8/2">In 2004-05 the national success rate for learners in LSC-funded FE provision with a self-declared learning difficulty, disability and/or health problem was 73 per cent. compared to 74 per cent. for those without. Comparable success rates for those in work-based learning or adult and community learning have not been calculated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.8/3">The self-declared information captured on the ILR is very different from the SEN status attributed during compulsory education against a national legitimate and agreed framework, so an analysis using solely the LSC's learner data is deemed to be too inaccurate an approximation to provide a valid response to the question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306W.8/4">Learner data for school sixth forms is currently not collected on the LSC's ILR, so success rates can not be calculated. However, statisticians in the Department and the LSC are working to collect data which will enable the calculation of these success rates; a date for publication has not yet been agreed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.0/1">In general, the Government are always interested in securing the greatest value for money for the taxpayer. Government Accounting's General Principles (24.2.1) exhorts:</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Once surplus assets have been identified, they should be disposed of as quickly as possible subject to value for money considerations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.0/3">Value for money bears on nearly all aspects of deployment of public resources: procurement, asset management, disposals, administrative systems and financing arrangements such as leases and PFI transactions. It means finding solutions which achieve the best mix of quality and effectiveness for the least outlay.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.0/4">However, all aspects of a transaction or proposed transaction, financial or otherwise, should be first taken fully into account, comprising any potential auxiliary or tangential benefit, including possible social and community benefits that may be attendant upon the issue, before the terms of a disposal, or other physical conveyance, are concluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.0/5">The Surplus Public Sector Land Taskforce was set up as part of the Government's response to the Barker Review of Housing Supply to examine cost-effective options for accelerating the release of public sector land in order to increase housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.0/6">Specifically with regard to local authority disposals, the Government's policy is that local authorities and other public bodies should dispose of surplus land wherever possible. Generally it is expected that land should be sold for the best consideration reasonably obtainable. But it is recognised that there are circumstances in which a local authority may consider it appropriate to dispose of land at an undervalue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.0/7">The General Disposal Consent issued in August 2003 in ODPM Circular 06/2003 enables local authorities to make land disposals which will contribute to the promotion or improvement of the economic, social or environmental well-being of an area at less than best consideration.</p>
