The criteria that can be used include quality, price, technical merit, aesthetic and functional characteristics, environmental characteristics, running costs, cost-effectiveness, after sales service, technical assistance, delivery date, delivery period and period of and for completion. This list is non-exhaustive and DEFRA as a contracting authority can choose other objective and non-discriminatory criteria linked to the subject matter of a contract to determine which offer is most economically advantageous.

	<p pid="b.860W.1/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme published the findings of new research into the quantity of household food and drink waste earlier this month. This revealed that 8.3 million tonnes of food and drink are thrown away by households each year, most of which (5.3 million tonnes) could have been consumed. This avoidable food and drink waste is worth &#163;12 billion, costing on average around &#163;480 for every household a year, increasing to &#163;680 a year for households with children. If we stopped wasting all this avoidable food and drink it would save at least 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to taking one in four cars off UK roads.</p>

A levy is chargeable on the disposal by the port authority of the securities of the successor company. We would consider the allocation of sale proceeds at the time that any voluntary privatisation scheme was submitted to the Department for Transport.

	<p pid="b.878W.9/2">The EU's assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan is substantial and has been steadily increasing. Assistance to date has achieved much, including better access to health provisions; support to rural livelihoods; support to Afghan refugees; rebuilding infrastructure and support to the reestablishment of public services, including paying the salaries of key public workers (teachers, nurses and doctors). But it is right that we, the EU, look to see how we can deliver even more.</p>

	<p pid="b.879W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has received no independent reports about the behaviour of pupils at North Naples Middle School in Florida in November, but he is aware of the press coverage. We believe that any instances of anti-Semitic and discriminatory behaviour-particularly by children-are a cause for common concern. We note that the school has treated the matter very seriously and has been reportedly quick to take action to address the issue. This includes through an address to students by the Assistant Principal covering the student code, an explanation of why what happened was wrong, the in-school suspension of the offending students and the summoning of their parents to school conferences.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.0/2">Anti-Semitism is a cause of common concern for the US and UK, and we continue to work closely with the US Administration and other partners to combat anti-Semitism wherever it occurs. For example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been a strong supporter of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism since it launched in 2006, working in partnership with the All-Party Group, colleagues across Government and Jewish non-governmental organisations to drive forward recommendations made in the inquiry. Our embassies have also supported inquiry members in their overseas visits, spreading the All-Party Group's unique approach to dealing with anti-Semitism to other countries, such as the US, Germany, Canada, Latvia and Argentina.</p>

This would include the hearing for an offender sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, having been convicted of murder.

	<p pid="b.885W.5/2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) gives a count of criminal offences experienced by adults resident in households in England and Wales. For the crime types that it covers, the BCS provides a better guide to the level of crime as it includes those that are not reported to the police, or recorded by them. As such, the BCS asks victims whether an incident had been reported to the police, or whether the police came to know about it another way, and is therefore able to estimate reporting rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.5/3">The 2008-09 BCS estimates that there were approximately 10,687,000 crimes. The survey estimated that the police came to know about 41 per cent. of such incidents and conversely, 59 per cent. went unreported. The BCS does not cover civil offences and thus comparable figures are not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.886W.2/1">The most recent and most robust assessment of the international evidence on the impact of CCTV was a 2008 systematic review published by the Campbell Crime and Justice Group. The review was part funded by the Home Office. The review found that CCTV has a modest but statistically significant crime reduction effect; is most effective in reducing crime in car parks; is most effective when targeted at vehicle crimes (largely a function of the successful car park schemes); and is more effective in reducing crime in the UK than in other countries. The review concludes that CCTV is an effective crime prevention measure in public spaces, but, in contrast to its current broad application, should focus only on the specific targets against which it is shown to be most effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.2/2">Further work is under way to strengthen the evidence base including work by the National Policing Improvement Agency and Cheshire Constabulary to provide a qualitative analysis of recorded crime data and case files in Cheshire to determine the value of CCTV to investigations.</p>

The police have powers to order the removal and storage of vehicles under different provisions, whether as the result of a specific operation, observation of a relevant offence in the normal course of their duties, or to deal with a particular situation that has arisen. If such vehicles are not reclaimed, the police may dispose of them as they see fit. This can include by crushing. To meet the costs of removal and storage in individual cases, a person seeking to reclaim a vehicle has to pay prescribed charges.

	<p pid="b.894W.11/1">Information held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is available on the basis of the police force which added the DNA profile, not the address of the person sampled. Information is therefore not available on the number of men and women residing in each local authority area in the South East who have had a DNA profile added to the NDNAD. However, information is available on the number of profiles added by police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.11/2">The following table shows the number of subject profiles for men and women held on the NDNAD by police forces in London and the South East as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-23">23 November 2009</phrase>. The figures have been separated into males currently aged under 18 and aged 18 and over, and females currently aged under 18 and aged 18 and over. The police forces have been grouped by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) region and a total figure has been given for each region.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.11/3">Profiles held by any one police force include people who have been sampled by that police force but are not resident within the police force area, and will exclude people who are resident in that police force area but have had their sample taken by another police force.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.11/4">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, for example, a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles from the SGM to the SGM Plus profiling system. It is estimated that 13.8 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals are not given for particular police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.11/5">The data presented are based on a snapshot of the NDNAD as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-23">23 November 2009</phrase>. The data are management information and have not been formally assessed for compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

	<p pid="b.897W.8/1">Temporary staff are being employed to carry out administrative tasks, freeing up existing, trained, case resolution directorate (CRD) staff so they can concentrate on decision making. CRD have outsourced the administrative functions only and have therefore allowed their permanent experienced staff to focus on decision making. SERCO is required to recruit and maintain sufficient staff to complete this function and has challenging targets for quality and throughput that align to bring the SERCO element of work to conclusion before the contracted end date.</p>

	<p pid="b.912W.5/1">Objectives of the home access grant: the home access programme will support those low-income families that need Government intervention to obtain a computer and connectivity as well as benefit parents and learners; it will do this through three targeted approaches:</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/2" class="indent">a. reducing the barriers of cost for families with low incomes</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/3" class="indent">b. maximising the benefits of home access for families who are eligible for a grant</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/4" class="indent">c. increasing the perceived value of home access by parents who are eligible for a grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/5">Specifically, the home access grant will provide financial assistance to address the first of these. In the national roll-out of the programme there will be one grant per household.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/6">The average amount <i> (a)</i> disbursed to each family through the grant is forecast to be around &#163;500, with the maximum amount <i> (b)</i> (excluding assistive technology add-ons) being &#163;528 for the full package. Where a full package is not required, the grants will be for &#163;400 for the device with on board software and support only; or &#163;180 for one year's broadband internet connectivity only.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/7">270,000 families are expected to benefit by March 2011, which equates to over 500,000 students in these eligible households. This breaks down to around 30,000 students in calendar year 2009, including the pilot, and the remaining 470,000 in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/8">The monies from the grant will enable parents to purchase a choice of equipment using one of six approved suppliers. All packages can include broadband connectivity if this is needed.</p>

This is exploring ways of securing better services through &quot;whole area&quot; efficiencies. 13 pilot projects are operating linked to particular themes and DCSF officials have been supporting workshop and other activity associated with those projects concerned with services to children and young people. The work is ongoing and final recommendations are expected to inform the 2010 Budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.0/3">Many of the projects announced by the Operational Efficiency programme (OEP) were already built into the CSR07 VfM programme and Department's 2010-11 settlement. For instance, the Better Use of Resources in Schools initiative includes making available a schools financial benchmarking site which enables schools to compare their patterns of expenditure with schools operating in similar circumstances and identify where resources might be reallocated plus free VfM consultancy, tailored to the needs of the school to help them identify where savings can be made on, for example, collaborative procurement.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.0/4">Additional OEP projects are still in their early stages of development and because of the nature of OEP in changing the structure and strategy of delivery, have longer time frames for delivery; many of the projects in question will come to fruition within the next spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.0/5">Achievement towards the DCSF &#163;5.14 billion target, including elements relating to OEP, will be reported when data are available over the coming years in both the autumn performance reports and the departmental annual reports each year.</p>

The seminars compliment and build on the success of last year's Home Office seminars at which 1,300 licensing professionals received high quality and comprehensive training in the effective use of alcohol-related tools and powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/4">The current round of seminars are being held in the Home Office's priority areas and are focused more directly at operational police officers and those that are involved in the legal issues concerning the Licensing Act 2003 and other alcohol-related enforcement legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.928W.6/6" class="indent">Change the offence of persistently selling alcohol to children from three strikes within three months, to two strikes within three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/7" class="indent">Amend the police's power to confiscate alcohol from young people in a public place so that they no longer need to prove that the individual 'intended' to consume the alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/8" class="indent">Extend the police's powers to issue Directions to Leave so that they can be issued to persons aged 10-15.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/9" class="indent">Introduce a new offence of persistently possessing alcohol in a public place.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/10">Young people under 18 can be prosecuted for this offence if they are caught with alcohol in a public place three times within a 12-month period.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/11">We have also brought in an enabling power for a Mandatory Code of Practice for Alcohol retailers as part of the Policing and Crime Act. This code aims to crack down on irresponsible promotions and practices that fuel alcohol-related disorder and will include a small number of mandatory licensing conditions (up to nine) which could be applicable to all licensed premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/12">To ensure that people aged under 18 are unable to purchase alcohol from legitimate retailers, the Home Office endorses schemes such as Challenge 25. This is a scheme run by retailers themselves, where the basic premise is that all individuals who look as though they are under the age of 25 are asked to prove their age when purchasing any age-restricted products, thereby preventing an offence being committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/13">An alcohol confiscation campaign took place in February 2008 following a pilot in October 2007. 23 out of the 227 basic command units (BCUs) took part in the campaign and the result was that over 3,700 litres of alcohol were confiscated from children under 18 who were found drinking alcohol in public places.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/14">A larger campaign involving 165 BCUs took place during February 2008 when 21,000 litres of alcohol (70 per cent. beer) was confiscated in over 5,000 separate seizures from individuals and groups of more than 23,000 young people. Activity in both campaigns focused on school holidays and weekends when young people were most likely to be engaged in this activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/15">The Government launched a nationwide crackdown on teenage binge drinking during the summer holidays, with up to &#163;1.4 million of new cash for 69 youth crime priority areas. This is in addition to the &#163;350,000 that each area is receiving this year to tackle antisocial behaviour and youth crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/16">The campaign was based on the following three-point plan:</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/17" class="indent">Tough enforcement: confiscating alcohol; using dispersal powers to break up groups of young people getting drunk and causing trouble, and behaviour contracts to hold them to account;</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/18" class="indent">Early intervention and support: giving young people one-to-one support, and youth services working with families to address underlying reasons for young people's behaviour, using parenting contracts and orders to support parents;</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.6/19" class="indent">Communicating to the local community: making it clear to the public what is being done to tackle drunk and disorderly behaviour by young people.</p>

The NCSP has issued specific guidance on maximising testing through these community and primary care core services, and uptake is monitored on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.932W.5/2">PCTs may also extend access by offering screens through a range of other testing venues including remote testing via websites/postal kits, educational establishments and targeted outreach events. The NCSP has issued specific guidance on maximising testing through remote testing.</p>

	<p pid="b.934W.5/1">The Department's 'Guide to Buying Services and Goods' states the need to develop value for money principles thus:</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;Buying goods and services in the public sector is not judged on getting goods or services for the lowest possible price, but on value for money. This includes the quality and other relevant areas of the resulting service or goods. It is a judgement based on the best combination of the cost of a product or service, spread over its whole lifetime, and its ability to meet, but not necessarily do better than the needs of the user. They normally achieve this by comparing suppliers' bids, and by generally testing the market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/3">This principle is included within the 'Public Contracts Regulations 2006', which outlines the need to either set the award criteria at the lowest price, or at the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT). The award criteria using MEAT is linked to the subject matter and may include quality, price, technical merits, aesthetic and functional characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/4">The Department's procurement policy is to apply this approach to all procurements above &#163;10,000. Procurements at &#163;90,319 or above are subject to the 'Public Contract Regulations 2006' where further information relating to weightings for criteria are applied.</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/5">Using the free electronic portal 'Information System for European Public Procurement', the cost of advertising tenders is kept to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/6">There may however be occasions when, due to the specific nature of a procurement, the Department uses paid-for advertising. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Until July 2008, when a new business management system was introduced for the Department, such information was not held centrally.</p>

The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.949W.11/2">Under the Ports Act 1991 a trust port privatising must form a successor company and make a transfer scheme for the Secretary of State's approval after a public consultation. A levy is chargeable on the disposal by the port authority of the securities of the successor company. We would consider the allocation of sale proceeds at the time that any voluntary privatisation scheme was submitted to the Department for Transport. We would also consider the desirability of encouraging allocation of equity to managers and employees of the port.</p>

	<p pid="b.951W.3/44" class="indent">(xii) The provisional targets for the 2011 Census are that the overall response rates should be at least as high as that for the 2001 Census (94 per cent), and that the response rates in the lowest 5 per cent of local authorities in 2001 should be increased to at least 80 per cent. These will be reviewed in the light of the 2009 Census rehearsal and reported in the business case for the Census to be published in spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.951W.3/45" class="indent">Value for money has been assessed in terms of the financial impact that, in the absence of a census, errors in population statistics would have on the national decision making process that the census information supports, including resource allocation from central government to local authorities and primary care trusts, and the investment decisions made by commercial companies relating to store location and product ranges.</p>
	<p pid="b.951W.3/46" class="indent">The financial benefits realised by the Census significantly outweigh its costs. This is detailed in the Census business case, which has been reviewed by HM Treasury and the Office for Government Commerce.</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the Authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Jil Matheson, dated December 2009:</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent questions regarding the 2011 Census. I have grouped together the responses to those questions where there are common themes.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/4" class="indent">(i,ii,iii) Information on the evaluation of the 2007 Census test is already available from the ONS website at</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-project/2007-test---summary-evaluation-report.doc">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-project/2007-test---summary-evaluation-report.doc</a></p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/6" class="indent">and is thus available to the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/7" class="indent">ONS has not published an overarching communications strategy or plan. Instead, many smaller more detailed plans are currently used within the census programme to deal with specific issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/8" class="indent">However, Chapter 2 of the Government's White Paper Helping to shape tomorrow (Cm 7513), published in December 2008, deals with the programme of consultation at paragraphs 2.1-2.12. Paragraphs 4.45-4.53 in Chapter 4 cover local authority and community liaison, and paragraphs 4.67-4.73 summarise the publicity and marketing work being undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/9" class="indent">The 2011 Census business case, which has already been scrutinised by HM Treasury and the Office for Government Commerce, is still a working document until final decisions on census operational issues have been made following a full analysis of the Census Rehearsal.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/10" class="indent">As noted above in answer to Question 302273, the business case is scheduled for publication in the spring 2010 and will be placed in the House of Commons Library at that time. It was made available to the Public Administration Select Committee in June 2009 for its hearing on the Census (but not put into the public domain because of the commercial in confidence information it contains), but a precis was made available to the Lords Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments when it considered the draft Census Order in October and published in its 29th Report of the 2008-09 Session on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-05">5 November</phrase>.(302274, 302294 and 302431)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/11" class="indent">(iv) The content and layout of the questionnaires are scheduled to be finalised in mid December 2009 after the Draft Census Order has been approved. Contractors will start the initial printing of the 30 million or more forms in mid-March 2010 and complete this in July. This timetable enables sufficient time for the data capture system, designed on the basis of the printed forms, to be competed and fully tested. (302275)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/12" class="indent">(v) Some 35,000 temporary field staff will be employed:</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/13" class="indent">to deliver the 5 per cent of census questionnaires that will not be delivered via the postal service;</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/14" class="indent">to visit households to remind then to return their questionnaire and to offer any assistance; and</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/15" class="indent">to collect questionnaires from communal establishments. (302276)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/16" class="indent">(vi) Yes. Every commercial contract agreed in respect of the 2011 Census programme contains break clauses. This is normal public procurement practice. As the majority of contracts are fixed price, ONS would incur financial penalties if these break clauses were invoked for reasons other than poor contractor performance. (302277)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/17" class="indent">(vii) In 2003, the Office for National Statistics undertook a strategic review of a number of possible alternative ways of collecting the type of information traditionally provided by a census to meet users' needs. ONS concluded that there were no sufficiently comprehensive or proven alternative sources of such information and that conducting a traditional census in 2011 was the only viable way to collect and provide the range of information required to the level of quality demanded. The findings of the review can be found at</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/18" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=10784">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=10784</a></p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/19" class="indent">ONS are currently investigating alternative approaches to collecting such information beyond 2011. (302278)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/20" class="indent">(viii) No estimate has been made of the number and proportions of illegal immigrants who completed the 2001 Census. The final results were adjusted to take account of the estimated non-response across all population groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/21" class="indent">Similarly, the 2011 Census will make no attempt to identify specifically people who are living here illegally.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/22" class="indent">ONS has assessed the potential impact of inclusion of the citizenship and intended length of stay questions through a postal test including 10,000 households sampled from areas with high number of migrants, and through focus groups and interviews with recent migrants commissioned from the National Centre for Social Research. No impact on response rates was found The results of the research can be found at</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.0/24">(302279)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/25" class="indent">(ix) Participation in the Census rehearsal is voluntary, which suppresses response rate considerably. The operation is not yet complete. As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November 2009</phrase> response rates were as shown in the table below:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.954W.0/28"> <td><i> Areas</i></td> <td><i> Number of questionnaire returned</i></td> <td><i> Percentage of questionnaires returned</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.954W.0/29"> <td>Lancaster</td> <td>23,127</td> <td>39</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.954W.0/30"> <td>Newham</td> <td>7,424</td> <td>21</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.954W.0/31"> <td>Anglesey</td> <td>14,081</td> <td>42</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.954W.0/32"> <td>Combined total</td> <td>44,632</td> <td>35</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.954W.0/33"> <td>Birmingham</td> <td>3,570</td> <td>21</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/36" class="indent">Birmingham was not formally a part of the rehearsal, but questionnaires were distributed to households in Birmingham in order to test different field operation management structures.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/37" class="indent">The numbers of people included in returned questionnaires will not be known until the questionnaires have been processed, which is due for completion in spring 2010. (302280)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/38" class="indent">(x) As detailed in the Government's White Paper Helping to shape tomorrow, published in December 2008, the 2001 Census questions on household amenities and professional qualifications are not being included in the 2011 Census.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/39" class="indent">The previous long-standing census question on whether or not households have exclusive use of either a bath/shower or toilet amenities, or both, is no longer regarded as providing a sufficiently discriminative indicator in the allocation of resources for housing development and regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/40" class="indent">Nor will the 2001 question on whether people have specific professional qualifications such as teaching, medical, nursing and/or dental qualifications be included. Consultation indicated that sufficient information to meet users' needs could be collected by the inclusion of a single tick-box for 'professional qualifications' to be recorded in the qualifications question.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/41" class="indent">In addition, the 2001 questions on lowest floor level of the household's accommodation and the number of people employed at the person's place of work are also not being retained. Consultation with users has indicated that there is less of a requirement for this information compared with other Census topics being proposed. (302282)</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/42" class="indent">(xi) It is not possible to identify the specific cost of including those questions that are new to the Census in 2011. The cost of adding a fourth page of questions per person to the household questionnaire is &#163;24 million. This does not equate to the direct cost of the new questions, as the previous three pages per person questionnaire on which the comparison is based contained a mix of 2001 and new questions, but it is the best available estimate.

In these previous censuses the same set of information as collected from usual residents has been required from such visitors; for 2011, however, only the limited set of four questions will be asked to reduce the burden.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/12" class="indent">The minimum duration of stay that will require an individual to be recorded as a visitor is the night of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-27">Sunday 27 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/13" class="indent">Subject to Parliamentary approval of the secondary legislation for the 2011 Census, the householder is legally liable to ensure that a complete return is made in respect of every resident and visitor present on census night. However, it would be an offence for anyone present in a household on census night to refuse to provide the relevant information to the householder.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/14" class="indent">Managers of hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, and guest houses that can only accommodate fewer than ten guests are required to record the visitor information for overnight guests. However, managers of such premises that can accommodate ten or more guests are required only to record the number of any visitors staying overnight. No details of such visitors will be recorded. (302427, 302454)</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/15" class="indent">iii) The household form for the 2011 Census in England and Wales will comprise four pages of questions relating to the household itself, four pages of questions for each household member with space for up to six household members, and an additional page available to record some information about visitors. The form also contains three pages of notes and instructions to assist the form filler, amounting to 32 pages in total.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/16" class="indent">The form is thus the same length as used in the Census Rehearsal, and is 12 pages more than the 2001 form. While the inclusion of some of additional questions has lengthened the form, a more significant factor in its increased size is its redesign in order to:</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/17" class="indent">accommodate an additional household member so as to reduce the number of continuation forms required for larger households; and</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/18" class="indent">make it easier to complete, specifically by introducing two columns of questions per page instead of the three adopted in 2001 and an additional page of notes and instructions.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/19" class="indent">The 1991 household form comprised 12 pages but was in a completely different matrix format and printed in a smaller font.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/20" class="indent">The individual person form for 2011 contains four pages of questions plus three pages of notes and instructions, compared with three and a half pages of questions and half a page of notes in both the 2001 and 1991 Censuses.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/21" class="indent">The census is a devolved matter in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but I understand from the respective Registrars General that the intention is that the 2011 Census questionnaires there should be of a similar length, except that, because of the smaller average household size the household form in Scotland will accommodate only five household members.(302428)</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/22" class="indent">iv) In a postal test including a random sample of 10,000 households in Spring 2009 the question on number of bedrooms was completed by 98.1 per cent of respondents. Testing of the question with individual respondents has not raised any significant quality concerns about their ability or willingness to complete this question accurately.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/23" class="indent">Data at the individual household record level will not be disclosed or cross-referenced with any other data sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/24" class="indent">Statistics from the question on bedrooms will be used by the Department for Communities and Local Government as a measure of overcrowding to support the measurement of one of its strategic objectives &quot;to improve the supply, environmental performance and quality of housing that is more responsive to the needs of individuals, communities and the economy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/25" class="indent">There are two standards previously used to inform whether or not a home is statutorily overcrowded, the 'space standard' and the 'room standard', Government amendments to the 2004 Housing Act provide for the standards to be amended to include a 'bedroom standard'. Its use in helping to measure the number of people living in overcrowded accommodation is set out in the 2007 CLG Action Plan Tackling overcrowding in England, which can be found at</p>

	<p pid="b.956W.2/27" class="indent">(302429)</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/28" class="indent">v,vi,vii) As published in December 2008 in the Government's White Paper Helping to shape tomorrow, the total estimated budget for the 2011 Census is &#163;482 million, of which &#163;450 million has already been agreed, and &#163;32 million is still subject to future spending reviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/29" class="indent">All of the budget that is already agreed has been allocated, with around 20 per cent already spent and a further 50 per cent committed to fixed price contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/30" class="indent">The cost of the 2011 Census has been analysed in the full business case referred to above. The difference between this and the cost of the 2001 Census is mainly due to:</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/31" class="indent">inflation</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/32" class="indent">growth in population and the number of households</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/33" class="indent">the development of a comprehensive national address register</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/34" class="indent">the development of a questionnaire tracking system</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/35" class="indent">the inclusion of an additional page of questions per person</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/36" class="indent">the development of an online questionnaire completion system</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/37" class="indent">more intensive follow-up in areas with low initial response</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/38" class="indent">The total costs of the 1991 and 2001 Censuses were &#163;117 million and &#163;207 million respectively. To create costs for the 1991 and 2001 Censuses that are comparable to the 2011 Census it is necessary to take into account:</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/39" class="indent">the growth in the population</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/40" class="indent">general inflation</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/41" class="indent">wage inflation for field staff salary costs</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.2/42" class="indent">Taking these factors into account, equivalent comparators to the 2011 Census cost of &#163;482m are estimated to be &#163;305m for the 1991 Census and &#163;350m for the 2001 Census. (302281, 302283, 302489)</p>

	<p pid="b.959W.2/8" class="indent">v) With reference to the Explanatory Note to the Draft Census (England and Wales) Order 2009, what data were taken into account in determining that the provisions of the order would not have an impact on the private or voluntary sector. (302268)</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/9" class="indent">i) In its response to the Treasury Committee's 2008 report on its enquiry into Counting the population, the Government noted that it did not consider it necessary or appropriate to consult the US authorities on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/10" class="indent">ONS has put in place rigorous organisational and contractual arrangements for data capture and processing to ensure that personal Census data will remain secure and confidential. The measures in place include:</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/11" class="indent">all Census data is owned by ONS and both Census employees and contractors working on the Census sign a declaration of confidentiality to guarantee their understanding and compliance with the law;</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/12" class="indent">contractual arrangements with Lockheed Martin UK Ltd ensure that only sub-contractors registered and based in the UK and either UK or EU owned will have access to any personal Census data;</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/13" class="indent">no Lockheed Martin staff (from either the US parent or UK company) will have access to any personal Census data; and</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/14" class="indent">all data will be processed in the UK and remain in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/15" class="indent">Further details of the arrangements can be found on the National Statistics website at the following links:</p>

	<p pid="b.959W.2/19" class="indent">As has become the practice for previous censuses an independent review of the security and confidentiality arrangements covering the collection and processing of census questionnaires will be carried out before the Census. (302487)</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/20" class="indent">ii, iii) The measures that it has put in place to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of personal census information (and which are set out in Chapter 6 of the Government's White Paper Helping to shape tomorrow) comply fully with the recommendations of the Data Sharing Review and, at the same time, the relevant legislation to protect such confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/21" class="indent">All personal census information is protected generally from unlawful disclosure by the provision of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, and there is a long-standing policy, reaffirmed in the White Paper to make this available for public access only after 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/22" class="indent">No government departments or agencies will have access to non-anonymised census data. (302488 &amp; 302485)</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/23" class="indent">iv) ONS has agreed a national data sharing agreement with Local Government Information House (the National Land and Property Gazetteer supplier), the Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey as well as checking the resulting address list against Valuation Office Agency data.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/24" class="indent">ONS will cross-match the address lists received from the respective bodies and ask the address list suppliers and local authorities to help to resolve any mismatches and queries.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/25" class="indent">The data sharing agreement covers uses only for the 2011 Census. However, in developing the matching and verification processes, ONS has been mindful of the need to try to ensure that these processes could be reused in other circumstances. (302490)</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/26" class="indent">v) No specific data were analysed in coming to the decision that the census would not impact on the private or voluntary sector. ONS explained the reasoning for this decision in section 10 of the Explanatory Memorandum, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/27" class="indent">&quot;The impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies of this legislation is considered to be minimal. This is because the purpose of the Census is not to collect business data, and the only impact on business will be asking persons in charge of commercial communal establishments, to make a return in respect of the establishment and of any residents or inmates residing within their premises, who are unable to make a return for themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/28" class="indent">As no business or voluntary body is required to undertake any duty that ONS believes might prove either detrimental to their work, might significantly delay their normal day-to-day business or place any additional cost upon them, other than asking the manager of any commercial establishment to hand out and collect questionnaires to any usual residents and then complete a short questionnaire in respect of their establishment, ONS believes that the 2011 Census impact on the private or voluntary sector will be minimal.</p>
	<p pid="b.959W.2/29" class="indent">ONS took advice from the Better Regulations Unit, now part of the Department for Business, Innovations and Skills on this matter. (302268)</p>

	<p pid="b.976W.3/1">The Government believe that application of the levy will have no significant effect on the affordability of broadband. Ofcom figures show that the average bill has fallen by more than 50p per month in each of the last three years.

	<p pid="b.976W.6/1">There is no single definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise. The Companies Act 1985 and its 2006 successor Act defines small and medium firms for the purpose of qualifying for simplified accounting requirements. A company must meet two of the following criteria for two years in a row to qualify:</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.6/2" class="italic"> Small</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.6/3" class="indent">A turnover of not more than &#163;6.5 million</p>

	<p pid="b.976W.6/10">These definitions are specific to company law. However, BIS use the number of employees when compiling official statistical publications such as the SME statistics for the UK. So for statistical purposes, a small firm would be defined as a firm with between 0 and 49 employees and a medium enterprise would have between 50 and 249 employees.</p>

The EU definition is based on headcount, turnover, balance sheet and independence criteria. More information on the EU definition can be found at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="b.982W.5/1">The available statistics for <i> (a)</i> insolvencies in the &quot;Land Transport&quot; industry are shown under Table 1. The main constituents of the haulage industry fall under this category; which also includes all other types of industrial activity relating to land transport-it is not possible from information collated centrally to separate out haulage in isolation. These statistics only cover England and Wales, as similar figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland are not available centrally at this level of detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.982W.5/2">Responsibility for statistics relating to business start-ups and closures (&quot;births&quot; and &quot;deaths&quot;) has moved from the Department for Business to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Tables 2 and 3 record statistics received from the ONS in response to <i> (b)</i> and <i> (c)</i> above. These represent those figures which are both readily available and most similar in coverage to the figures for insolvencies, but they should not be treated as being entirely consistent and, in particular, the ONS' figures will include some businesses that are not registered companies.</p>

	<p pid="b.992W.2/2">The Better Regulation Executive does not deal with the definition of heating systems, but the Building Regulations (England and Wales) do address the installation of heating systems in buildings. Building Regulations guidance already calls for the application of water treatment cleaners and inhibitors when heating systems are installed in new and existing dwellings. The guidance does not extend to non-domestic buildings because the industry view is that water treatment in non-domestic buildings is already standard practice and regulation is unnecessary.</p>
