	<p pid="a.318W.8/3">Rule 289A was introduced to enable an applicant who has limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse, unmarried partner, registered civil partner or same sex partner of a British citizen or person present and settled in the UK and whose marriage or relationship breaks down during the two-year probationary period as a result of domestic violence, to be granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. This offers the victim the security of achieving settled status and access to benefits without the need to complete the two-year probationary period.</p>

	<p pid="a.323W.8/1">The Government and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) established the Nations and Regions Group to ensure UK-wide engagement and to maximise the legacy from London 2012. This group works directly with representatives from each of the nations and English regions to realise the sporting, economic, and cultural benefits of the 2012 Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/2">Northern Ireland stands to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the 2012 Games through businesses winning Games-related work, increased tourism and cultural celebrations. Some examples of how Northern Ireland will benefit from the Games are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/3">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) has awarded contracts to five direct suppliers in Northern Ireland. For example, Lagan Construction was awarded the contract to construct 'central park bridge' in the Olympic Park that links the Basketball Arena, the Aquatics Centre and the Olympic Stadium.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/4">Information on businesses in Northern Ireland that have directly supplied the ODA is available in the business section of the London 2012 website at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/oda-suppliers/index.php">http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/oda-suppliers/index.php</a></p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/6">This information does not include contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. Examples of companies based in Northern Ireland further down the supply chains include McGrath Brothers from Belfast supplied architectural metalwork for the Olympic Village and Macrete Concrete from County Antrim have worked on support structures for bridges and highways.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/7">So far 1,561 companies in Northern Ireland have registered on Competefor (the website where London 2012 contract opportunities are advertised), and four contracts have been awarded to Competefor suppliers in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/8">Over 16,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for LOCOG's London 2012 education programme Get Set, 220 schools and colleges are registered in Northern Ireland. 10 schools in Northern Ireland have also developed links with nine schools and one youth centre in Jordan as part of the London 2012 International Inspiration Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.8/9">Over 1,000 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark, 31 of these are in Northern Ireland. One example, Active8-a SportNI-led participation programme with the Olympic Values at its core-is engaging pupils aged seven to 11 in sport and physical activity. Activ8 Eatwell is a recent programme which promotes active and healthy lifestyles for children by teaching them about physical activity and healthy eating.</p>

	<p pid="a.324W.2/1">It is important that children and young people from across the UK are actively encouraged to participate in the wide range of opportunities created by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/2">Over 16,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games' (LOCOG) education programme Get Set, with 487 schools and colleges registered in Hertfordshire. LOCOG launched the official London 2012 mascots last year, which are now inspiring children and young people. LOCOG hosted a 'Get Set to make your mascot' school competition. The winning primary and secondary schools win a visit from Wenlock or Mandeville in the summer term-ideally to their school sports day.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/3">Over 1,000 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark, with 84 of these in the East of England. One example, which schools in Hertfordshire including St Albans are participating in, is Supporter to Reporter (S2R). S2R gives young people sports reporting opportunities at national and local events. Participants receive training to produce audio, video, text and image reports with content then published on the youth-led website.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/4">Young Ambassadors is a London 2012 programme managed by Youth Sport Trust which has been running in England, Scotland and Wales. It was the first initiative to receive the London 2012 Inspire mark for education. It involves young people being recruited to be ambassadors, working in their schools and communities to champion sport and the values of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/5">The School Games will give every school the opportunity to get involved. Sport England has commissioned the Youth Sport Trust to test how to deliver School Games in nine pilot areas. In June or July 2011, these sites will host the first 'School Games' Days in 500 schools and the first nine 'Festivals of Sport'. All schools will be given the opportunity to participate from September 2011 with the first national finals taking place in the Olympic Stadium in May 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.2/6">In addition, I announced the 'Places People Play' programme in November, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring people to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy.

The figures do not include the value of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.5/1">There is no need for any monitoring by, or cost to, the Department. The Big Lottery Fund (BLF) asks applicants to identify where its funding will be used. This information is collected and analysed at minimum cost. BLF regularly monitor these data to ensure that communities receive a fair share of lottery money. It is freely accessible throughout the organisation and therefore the BLF does not monitor its cost. Sport England does not hold a regional breakdown of funding, and while I have not made an estimate, it would exceed the disproportionate cost limit considerably to commission the work, and that is without considering the cost of monitoring.</p>

One of the objectives of the reforms to the ATOL scheme that I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-03">3 February 2011</phrase> is to reduce the Air Travel Trust Fund's deficit and return it to financial sustainability. It is expected that the Fund will be in surplus within three years of the reforms being implemented. The precise timing depends on a number of factors including the frequency and cost of travel company insolvencies.</p>

However, it is possible that regulations sponsored by the Department for Transport have been revoked by instruments for which other Departments have policy responsibility. In the last few months, the Department has launched a review of employment law and is conducting a fundamental review scrutinising the overall stock of Department for Transport regulation, alongside legacy measures inherited from the previous Administration.

	<p pid="a.338W.2/2">In the case of the specific road safety capital grant this is because the capital funding streams paid by the Department for Transport to local authorities have been simplified radically. The number of these transport capital funding streams has been reduced from 26 to four.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/3">This is to assist increasing local control, participation and accountability in the use of resources by enabling local communities to decide their own priorities and set their budgets according to local, not national, priorities. More details about local transport capital funding are on the Department for Transport's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/4">In the case of revenue funding, the local transport elements of the former area based grant have been rolled into the general formula grant for the comprehensive spending review period. These local transport elements were the resource funding streams for road safety, the maintenance of de-trunked roads and rural bus subsidy grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.2/5">The general formula grant paid to local authorities has been increased for 2011-12 and subsequent years by an adjustment of &#163;112 million in the 2010-11 baseline. This adjusted figure for 2010-11 is then used in the calculation of the 2011-12 revenue support grant settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.339W.6/2">I regularly receive representations about adoption from Members of Parliament, adopters, adoption professionals, voluntary organisations, councillors and members of the public. I also receive valuable feedback and advice from my Ministerial Advisory Group on Adoption and from the Department's Adoption Stakeholder Group, both of which include representatives from local authorities and the voluntary sector. I also recently held a roundtable event with a group of adopters to hear their views on what is working well and what needs to improve, and plan shortly to hold a similar event with a group of adopted children.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.3/1">In the Schools White Paper &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot;, published in November 2010, we said that we will rely on schools to work together with voluntary, business and statutory agencies to create an environment where every child can learn, and can experience new and challenging opportunities through extended services. This includes academies and free schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/2">The comprehensive spending review 2010 announced that the amounts of extended services funding currently provided through the Department's Standards Fund will form part of the overall schools revenue baseline from April 2011. There will be no specific amounts earmarked for extended services. Schools, including academies and free schools, will have freedom and flexibility to spend their budgets to support their pupils in the ways they judge best.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/3">The Department does not collect data on how many school pupils attend (a) breakfast clubs, (b) after-school and homework clubs and (c) other forms of extended hours schooling. However, two recently published surveys give an indication of the proportion of children using various services.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/4">The Department's Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents for 2009, published in 2010, entailed interviews with a sample of just over 6,700 parents with children aged under 15. This found that one-third of the sample of families used a breakfast or after-school club on a school site and 7% used a breakfast or after-school club off-site. The most common activity that children took part in was sport (60% of those using before or after school provision) and just under one-third took part in play/recreational activities, or other creative activities (31% and 28% respectively). 30% were undertaking study, homework, computer activities or learning languages. Some children were engaging in more than one type of activity.</p>

On capital funding up to &#163;50 million has been set aside in 2010-11 to meet the capital needs of Free Schools. Beyond that, provision forms part of the overall spending review settlement for schools. Allocations for free schools have yet to be decided and will be dependent in part on the conclusion of the capital review which we intend to publish shortly.</p>

International GCSE (iGCSE) achievements were also included in the 2010 secondary school (key stage 4) performance tables for the first time, and will continue to be included from now on. As with all other qualifications included in the tables, iGCSEs are first accredited by Ofqual. This gives schools, parents, pupils, universities and employers an independent guarantee of quality. As soon as iGCSEs are accredited, the predecessor qualifications can be included in the performance tables. Some iGCSEs were not accredited in time, so could not be included in the 2010 tables. However, we fully expect that the most popular iGCSEs will be included in the 2011 performance tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.349W.2/2">The Government believe that their new approach to encouraging competitive sport, including the changes to the funding of posts that were part of the previous Administration's strategy (such as competition managers), will result in more pupils playing more competitive sport. We can do much better than the two out of every five pupils that play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and the one in five pupils that plays regularly against other schools, reported last year. The national curriculum for physical education already requires schools to provide competitive sports for all pupils in maintained schools, aged five to 16, and we will make this clearer through the review of the national curriculum. We envisage schools and teachers taking greater control over what is taught in schools, innovating in how they teach it and developing new approaches. At the same time, we are encouraging the world of sport to improve and expand the competitions that are offered to schools, through the creation of a new School games.</p>

A final payment will be made to partnerships in Warrington at the end of February 2011, which covers the period to the end of the summer term. After that, it is up to the schools in Warrington whether they work in partnerships to organise physical education and competitive sports and how they fund this from their dedicated school grant. We envisage schools and teachers taking greater control over what is taught in PE, innovating in how they teach and developing new approaches. The Secretary of State also announced in December 2010 that the Department will provide &#163;65 million in the new spending review period for secondary schools to release a PE teacher for a day a week to help local schools embed good practice and organise competitive sports. Secondary schools in Warrington will be eligible for a share of this funding. The Department is developing the arrangements for this and will notify schools in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.360W.2/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency is not able to provide the figures requested because it only records that a person is a non-resident parent. It does not record whether they are adoptive parents or not. Child support legislation establishes that, where a child is adopted, responsibility for the child, should they qualify for child maintenance, rests with the adoptive parent (section 26(2) of the Child Support Act 1991). The liability of a biological parent to maintain her/his child ends on adoption and the parent by adoption becomes the only person liable to maintain the child. This approach supports the principle expressed in the Adoption and Children Act 2002, namely that someone who is adopted should be treated in law as the natural born child of the person who has adopted them.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.2/1">Since 1998 a number of measures have been introduced by the United Kingdom blood services to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vGJD). These measures include the introduction of leucodepletion (the removal of white blood cells), the importation of fresh frozen plasma for children and the deferral from donation of transfusion recipients. In addition, the use of plasma from UK donors for fractionation purposes has ceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/2">For national health service blood and transplant the highest costs associated with these measures are the estimated loss of income from the sale of plasma from UK blood donors (&#163;325 million) and the introduction of leucodepletion (&#163;182 million). Further measures bring the estimated total cost to &#163;540 million since 1998, with an estimated current annual cost of approximately &#163;40 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/3">There is no separate assessment of such costs for the NHS outside the blood service. However, synthetic (recombinant) clotting factor for the treatment of bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia, has been provided to all patients for whom it is suitable since 2005, and to those under the age of 16 since 1998, at a current annual cost of approximately &#163;200 million.</p>

The provision of interpretation and translation services by national health service bodies is a matter for local determination. Such bodies are not required to report their planned or actual spending on interpretation and translation services to the Department. When planning such services, NHS bodies should take due account of their legal duties, the composition of the communities they serve, and the needs and circumstances of their patients, service users and local populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.5/1">Each primary care trust (PCT) is responsible for ensuring the standards of services provided to patients under their existing contractual arrangements. From April 2012, it is proposed that all providers of primary medical care services will be required to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). In order to be registered, providers have to meet registration requirements, which set essential levels of safety and quality in the provision of care to patients. The CQC has a range of enforcement powers that it can use where providers do not meet the registration requirements.</p>

The Bill also proposes to make the NHS Commissioning Board responsible for securing continuous improvements to the quality of the services provided to patients by national health service bodies, including GP practices and therefore the board will directly monitor the standard of care and services provided by all primary medical care providers. Alongside this it is proposed that commissioning consortia must assist and support the board in securing continuous improvements in the quality of primary medical services with a view to ensuring that the board and the commissioning consortia will work together to monitor the quality of the services provided by all primary medical service providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.379W.2/1">The purpose of the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme is to protect against cervical cancer. There are two HPV vaccines licensed in the United Kingdom-Cervarix(r) and Gardasil(r). Both provide protection against HPV strains 16 and 18 that cause over 70% of cervical cancers in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.2/2">Efficacy trials of Cervarix published in <i> The Lancet</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-07">7 July 2009</phrase> show that as well as protecting against HPV type 16 and 18 that cause around 70% of cervical cancer, Cervarix also provides cross-protection against HPV types 31, 33 and 45 which are the three most common cancer-causing virus types beyond 16 and 18. <i> The Lancet</i> suggests that this could translate into approximately 11-16% extra protection against cervical cancer<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.2/3">Gardasil also protects against HPV strains 6 and 11 that can cause genital warts.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.2/4">Following a tendering process in 2008, a three-year contract was awarded to GlaxoSmithKline for Cervarix(r) in 2008. This contract is due to come to an end this year and the process for retendering the contract has begun.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.2/5">In order to select which vaccine to purchase and use, the Department follows European Union procurement legislation and uses a rigorous process for the selection. The tender documents will be finalised soon and an advert will be placed across Europe to invite tenders from vaccine manufacturers.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.2/1">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) considered the expected cost-benefits from a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme against cervical cancer, which included assessment of the impact of vaccination on genital warts. A summary of the evidence considered is set out in the JCVI statement on HPV vaccines published in the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/dh_094739.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/dh_094739.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/3">A copy of the JCVI statement has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/4">The economic evaluation used by the JCVI was published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2008 and is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj">www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj</a>.a769.full</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/6">The cost of the HPV vaccine procured by the Department for the national health service vaccination programme is commercially confidential. Financial savings made in the procurement of Cervarix HPV vaccine meant the catch-up vaccination programme could be extended to offer the vaccine to an extra 300,000 girls. The Department provides HPV vaccine to the NHS free of charge for use in the childhood immunisation programme. The cost of administering the HPV programme was estimated to be the same regardless of which vaccine was used.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/7">Following a tendering process in 2008, a three year contract was awarded to GlaxoSmithKline for Cevarix in 2008. This contract is due to come to an end this year and the process for re-tendering the contract has begun.</p>

Individual trusts make their own decisions on which tests or combinations of tests to use depending on their clinical case mix and workload. The local clinical need will determine test selection. Rapid and more sensitive methods have been available to the NHS for a number of years and trusts make their own decisions on matching the technologies to their service needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.384W.11/1">As part of the spending review, national health service funding rising to &#163;1 billion per annum by 2014-15 will be spent on measures that support social care and also benefit health. The &quot;Operating Framework for the NHS in England for 2011-12&quot; sets out that primary care trusts (PCTs) will need to transfer this funding to local authorities to invest in social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. The Department has also made available an extra &#163;162 million from efficiency savings this financial year for local health and care services. The money should be spent on helping people to leave hospital more quickly, re-ablement and the prevention of unnecessary admissions to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.11/2">At the local level, the NHS and local authorities should work together to improve the health and wellbeing of their local populations. As outlined in the Operating Framework 2011-12, NHS organisations should be working with partners on implementing the National Dementia Strategy. Moreover, the Carers' Strategy also identified that &#163;400 million will be made available for carers' breaks over the next four years (2011-12 to 2014-15) and required that PCTs should agree policies, plans and budgets to support carers with local authorities and local carers' organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.11/3">Supporting people to live independently at home following hospital discharge sits at the interface between health and social care and relies on effective discharge planning, access to re-ablement services and both systems working in the interests of the individual. To underpin this, the Department will amend the 'Payment by Results' tariff from April 2012 so that the NHS pays for re-ablement and other post discharge services for 30 days after a patient leaves hospital. From April 2011, trusts will not be reimbursed for unnecessary re-admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.11/4">To prepare for the changes to the 'Payment by Results' tariff, we have allocated &#163;70 million in 2010-11 for PCTs to spend on re-ablement. This has been further supported by the spending review with &#163;300 million of the &#163;1 billion NHS support for social care being made available for re-ablement services by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.11/5">The Health and Social Care Bill (subject to parliamentary approval) outlines how the Government will seek to encourage joined up working. The Bill stipulates that local authorities would take a key role in joining up local NHS services, social care and health improvement via the Health and Wellbeing Boards. A relevant commissioning consortium must co-operate with the Health and Wellbeing Board in the exercise of the functions of the Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.384W.11/6">Additionally, Health and Wellbeing Boards will have a statutory duty to produce Joint Strategic Needs Assessments and have regard to these in developing a Health and Wellbeing Strategy for their local area. Alongside this, the NHS Commissioning Board must, for the purpose of advancing the health and wellbeing of the people of England, exercise its functions with a view to encouraging commissioning consortia to work closely with local authorities in commissioning local services. To support the creation of effective quality standards the remit of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will be extended to social care.</p>

	<p pid="a.385W.2/1">We have no plans to publish an updated strategy on organ donation and transplantation. We are currently in the third year of a five year implementation programme to increase organ donation rates by 50% by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.2/2">The Organ Donation Taskforce Programme Delivery Board was established in July 2008 to oversee the implementation of the Organ Donation Taskforce recommendations published in January 2008. The board noted at their final meeting in January 2011 that organ donor rates had increased by 25% since the implementation process began and agreed that the taskforce recommendations, largely, had been implemented. The board also agreed that the focus in the future should be on ensuring that the new infrastructure and support mechanisms, developed under the board's leadership, become embedded as a usual part of healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.2/3">This will be achieved through a variety of means including through the clinical leads for organ donation, donation committees and donation chairs in acute trusts driving improvement locally; and ongoing work to raise the profile and benefits of organ donation and transplantation with the national health service, professional groups and with the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.2/4">Leadership will continue to be provided through the Department's national clinical director for transplantation, the Organ Donor Organisation within NHS Blood and Transplant and the relevant professional bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.395W.5/1">I will address 2014-15 in addition to the years quoted in the question, because departmental plans encompass the full spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice will make savings of 33% in real terms from its administrative budget by the end of the spending review period. Departmental administration budgets for the period were published in spending review 2010, and the Ministry of Justice's allocations are as follows:</p>

This figure includes savings against front line operations, 'support for delivery' functions and administrative spend. Savings plans for individual years in the spending review period are currently being developed.</p>

A large proportion of these savings come from a reduction in staffing levels but we also assume a number of savings through a reduced overhead and removal of duplication (for example through reduced numbers of agency non-executive directors). We aim to manage the reduction in staffing levels through redeployment, natural wastage, and voluntary early departures. There will be costs associated with this over the spending review period.</p>

	<p pid="a.410W.2/1">It is the Government's policy to extend or negotiate new prisoner transfer agreements (PTAs) with as many countries as possible. PTAs provide one part of the solution to achieving our objectives of significantly reducing the foreign prisoner population in UK detention and so the burden on the UK taxpayer. In line with our normal practice, wherever possible we seek to negotiate PTAs that do not require prisoners to consent to transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.410W.2/2">In consultation with the FCO, we have reviewed our global policy for the negotiation of new or amended prisoner transfer agreements. This policy reflects both the need to secure agreements with those countries that have the largest nationality groups serving sentences in UK prisons; and those where British nationals are imprisoned abroad, in particular where we have concerns about their welfare. We also seek to take advantage of opportunities where another country is seeking a PTA with the UK: even if the total number of prisoners from that country serving sentences here is small and there is no pressing consular need. Finally, agreement in one country can create momentum for approval in a neighbouring state. We therefore may work on a regional basis if a dynamic allows for progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.410W.2/3">The UK currently has prisoner transfer arrangements with over 100 countries and territories. A prisoner transfer agreement with Rwanda was ratified on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November 2010</phrase> and in addition to Nigeria, negotiations have begun with other countries including Jamaica, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in line with the policy above. Preparations are under way for the implementation of the EU prisoner transfer agreement which enters into force in December 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.3/2">Following the survey in 2002-03 it was not necessary to remove all identified occurrences of asbestos. However, a programme of removal of high-risk asbestos at the prisons detailed in the following list was implemented by local works managers under the supervision of the regional estates manager. This was completed in 2005 at a cost of around &#163;1.4 million. We are not aware of any significant delay or cancellation in this programme to remove asbestos from prisons.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.3/36">Prison Service Order 5901, 'Maintenance of Prison Service Buildings', requires asbestos to be re-inspected and photographed at a time indicated by a risk assessment and at least once every year. Any disturbance or deterioration of the asbestos must be reflected in the reviewed risk assessments. If the asbestos is identified as posing an unacceptably increased risk, a proposal for its removal should be submitted as part of the prison's maintenance strategy. Asbestos judged as being low-risk will not be routinely removed, as disturbing it may put staff at greater danger than if it were to be left in situ.</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.5/1">The following table shows the quantity of beds and mattresses purchased for use by prisoners in each of the last three years. The beds are manufactured by prisoners through the prison industries operation. The table references the cost of such purchases in each of the last three years. Using an average of 85,000 prisoner places, the average cost of providing a bed is approximately &#163;8 per annum and the average cost of providing a mattress is approximately &#163;24 per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice is unable to provide figures for the private prisons as they source these items directly by themselves. The 2008-09 procurement initiative to introduce the &quot;Zero Waste Wipe Clean Mattress and Pillow Solution&quot; has increased the life span of a mattress to an average of 22 months. It has also reduced the cost and environmental impact of disposing of the mattress. This contract is for the supply, collection and recycling of highly flame retardant, robust wipe clean prison mattresses and pillows.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.5/1">The chief executive, on behalf of the President, Deputy President and Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom sought advice about flag flying from the Flag Institute. The institute's guidance is set out in its joint publication with the Flags and Heraldry Committee (an All Party Parliamentary Group) titled &quot;Flying flags in the United Kingdom-A guide to Britain's flag protocol&quot;. The guide permits double flagging on one flagpole provided that the senior flag is flown at the top of the pole.</p>

	<p pid="a.418W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice is involving diverse civil society organisations when developing its policies and in delivering services across the Department's business.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.5/2">We are committed to further opening up our services to independent providers and we are working with civil society organisations to identify and remove barriers to their engagement. We are helped in this by the refreshed Compact and wider Government reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.5/3">The Ministry's Reducing Reoffending Third Sector Advisory Group (RRTSAG) is an important forum for providing advice to my colleagues and officials on policy and strengthening the sector's role in reducing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.5/4">We have worked closely with the RRTSAG and other civil society partners to develop the Green Paper 'Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders', and we are consulting widely as well as through targeted approaches-for example we are co-ordinating a cross-sector symposium on payment by results which I will attend.</p>

	<p pid="a.418W.5/6">There are a number of areas in the legal aid review which we are considering closely with not-for-profit advice providers and we have sought their views during the consultation process.

	<p pid="a.419W.2/1">I and my ministerial team support and encourage volunteering in many ways, in their ministerial roles and as constituency members. They actively support initiatives by participating in visits, attending community events and raising awareness of volunteering through media activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/2">The Ministry's reform programme and business plan are underpinned by the Big Society principles. This includes increased competition of our services; moving to payment by outcomes commissioning; publishing data so that the public can hold us to account; lifting the burden of bureaucracy by reviewing top down performance arrangements; and increasing community access to and involvement in local criminal justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/3">We have already made some commitments and we are exploring and consulting on a range of relevant approaches, including through our Green Paper 'Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders'. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/4" class="indent">Testing out local Neighbourhood Justice Panels to give communities greater responsibility for tackling some low-level crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/5" class="indent">Giving communities a choice in the work undertaken by offenders through Community Payback.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/6" class="indent">Exploring restorative justice approaches that empower communities in seeking reparation for crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/7" class="indent">Improving the links between courts and communities by further developing local multi-agency problem solving models.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/8" class="indent">Promoting and reducing barriers to volunteering and broader participation in the Justice System over time. The Green Paper commits us to building on the extensive volunteering already taking place and bringing forward further plans on community involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/9" class="indent">We will no longer provide rehabilitation services directly without testing where the private and voluntary sectors can deliver more efficiently and effectively. We will publish a strategy for competing offender services by June 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/10" class="indent">We launched the Social Impact Bond pilot in Peterborough Prison last year-social investors are paying up front for intensives services and mentoring delivered by the voluntary sector. We will pay solely on the results they deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/11" class="indent">We will run at least six new payment by results projects, which will be open to a diverse range of providers of rehabilitation services. Two of these will test a local financial incentives model in Manchester and selected London boroughs. We will share savings with the local area if they are successful in reducing demand and reoffending, which can then be reinvested in further crime prevention activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/12" class="indent">Through the Family Justice System review we are exploring the potential for family mediation to be delivered by local independent mediation services.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/13" class="indent">We are investing nearly &#163;30 million over the next three years through the voluntary sector to support victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/14" class="indent">We are consulting on introducing a single reducing reoffending measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/15" class="indent">We are proposing reducing the central burden on local youth offending teams through lighter touch performance management and more risk based inspection. We have already removed the ring fence from the YOT grant to allow more flexibility in how they use their funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.419W.2/16" class="indent">We have published sentencing data since October 2010 and we are consulting on proposals to further increase the accessibility and transparency of justice data and outcomes including by area.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.2/1">Cost effectiveness is one of a number of important criteria Government must take into account when considering policy options-both in the short term and long-term.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/2">An economic appraisal of the costs and benefits is a mandatory part of assessing the impacts of all policies, and allows consideration of the relative merits of different policy options. This must be carried out in line with HM Treasury's Green Book and, where policies have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, with the supplementary guidance on the valuation of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions published by DECC.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/3">Considerations of the long-term pathway to the UK's target to reduce emissions by at least 80% on 1990 levels by 2050 is also part of the evidence base to inform decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/4">Across the package of policies and measures put in place to deliver the savings required to meet the UK's Carbon Budgets there is a wide range of cost-effectiveness: Conservation and energy efficiency measures typically represent more cost-effective options in the near term, while decarbonising the power generation sector is key to place the UK on track with its long-term target-and to do so at least-cost, avoiding locking in to costlier alternatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.424W.3/1">DECC does not produce a projection of the electricity mix between now and 2030. The generation mix to 2020 and 2030 will be driven by commercial decisions taken within the policy framework for the electricity market. However in the course of analysis undertaken for various policies we run scenarios that result in different generation mixes depending on the assumptions used.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.3/2">For example, the analytical work for the Electricity Market Reform consultation document, published on the <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-16">16 December 2010</phrase>, included modelling by Redpoint Energy of the electricity system out to 2030. The modelling work used an indicative carbon emissions target for the electricity system of 100gCO2/kWh by 2030, which was consistent with advice from the Committee on Climate Change at the time. This modelling showed that unabated power stations operating on fossil fuels would provide approximately 54% of electricity supplied in 2020 and approximately 24% of total electricity supplied in 2030.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.3/3">Following this analysis, in December 2010, the Committee on Climate Change suggested that a carbon emissions intensity of 50gCO2/kWh by 2030 would be required to meet longer term carbon goals. This scenario would result in less electricity being supplied from fossil fuel generation in 2030 than under the 100gCO2/kWh scenario.</p>

	<p pid="a.427W.12/1">The Government have not made such an assessment. However, the Electoral Commission in its March 2010 report &quot;The completeness and accuracy of electoral registers in Great Britain&quot; found:</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.12/2" class="indent">&quot;...it is likely that the accuracy of the registers remains broadly similar to past decades&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.12/3">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.12/4" class="indent">&quot;...the major source of inaccuracy remains electors moving home and not informing the relevant Electoral Registration Officer (ERO).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.12/5">It is clear that more can be done to support accuracy. To this end, the Government have announced the implementation of individual electoral registration from 2014, which will ensure that only those entitled to vote will get on the register, so bringing greater protection against electoral fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.2/1">The Government do not disclose their legal advice. Disclosure of legal advice could prejudice the Government's ability to defend their legal interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/2">The Government have requested that the court's judgment in the &quot;Greens and MT&quot; case be referred to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)-the highest tier of the ECtHR. If the Grand Chamber agrees to the referral, they will look again at the judgment and issue their opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/3">The basis of the Government's referral request is that we believe that the court should look again at the principles in &quot;Hirst&quot; which outlaws a blanket ban on prisoners voting, particularly given the recent debate in the House of Commons. The referral request also points out the need for clarity in the ECtHR's case law in this area.</p>

This includes: all central Government spending over &#163;25,000 online on a monthly basis, providing details of over &#163;80 billion of Government spending; organograms for all central Government Departments, with salary details for the most senior civil servants; and all new contract opportunities.</p>

This includes &#163;76 billion of new lending to SMEs, which is a 15% increase on the amount lent in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more. For the purposes of the lending targets in Project Merlin, SMEs are broadly defined as businesses up to &#163;25 million turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/2">The Bank of England will report, on a quarterly basis, the banks' total new lending to all businesses (and within that, to SMEs) under the definitions used for Project Merlin. The Bank of England will not be not working with PricewaterhouseCoopers to monitor lending targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/3">For the first time chief executive remuneration will reflect lending. The calibration of performance metrics of chief executive remuneration is a matter for each individual bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/4">The Bank of England, in their January 2011 &quot;Trends in Lending&quot; report, estimated the average monthly aggregate levels of net lending to UK businesses by UK financial institutions to be: &#163;7.9 billion in 2007, &#163;3.9 billion in 2008, minus &#163;3.9 billion in 2009, minus &#163;3.2 billion in Q1 of 2010, minus &#163;2.1 billion in Q2 of 2010 and minus &#163;2.2 billion in Q3 of 2010. The Treasury does not make estimates of the levels of lending to UK businesses by individual institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/5">In addition to this commitment to increase lending to businesses, the Government continue to support SMEs seeking finance in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/6">The Government have agreed with the British Bankers' Association that the Business Growth Fund will be increased by &#163;1 billion to a total of &#163;2.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/7">The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme will be extended until 2014-15, providing up to &#163;600 million of additional lending to around 6,000 SMEs next year alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/8">The Government are continuing the programme of Enterprise Capital Funds. We have increased our commitment by &#163;200 million over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/9">The Regional Growth Fund will provide &#163;1.4 billion of investment over three years; to help those areas and communities that are currently dependent on the public sector make the transition to sustainable private-sector led growth.</p>

The UK bank levy, a permanent tax that came into effect from the beginning of this year, has been introduced as a complement to wider regulatory reforms. The levy ensures that banks make a fair contribution reflecting the risks they pose to the financial system and wider economy and is intended to encourage banks to have less risky funding profiles.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.2/3">The June Budget took immediate action to restore tax competitiveness with a phased reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.2/4">At the same time, the UK is leading the argument in the EU and internationally for robust, internationally consistent regulatory standards that will benefit the economy in the long run. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February</phrase>, the Government published a further consultation &quot;A new approach to financial regulation: building a stronger system&quot; which expands on the proposals set out last summer to establish a new system of specialised and focused financial services regulators. It marks a key step in delivering the coalition Government's commitment to reform financial regulation by providing the Bank of England with control of macro-prudential regulation and oversight of micro-prudential regulation. These reforms will promote greater financial stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.0/2">The Government recognise the importance of young people developing the capability they need to make informed decisions about their personal finances. The current economic well-being and financial capability strand of Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE), at key stages 3 and 4, provides a framework for students to learn about financial decision-making and how to use a range of financial tools and services. We announced, in the recently published Schools White Paper, 'The Importance of Teaching', our intention to conduct an internal review of PSHE education. We want to determine how we can support schools to improve the quality of PSHE teaching, including giving teachers the flexibility to use their judgment about how best to deliver PSHE.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.0/4">The LSIS see financial capability, numeracy and maths as key priorities for the sector. We are currently discussing with LSIS their 2011-12 programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.437W.0/1">The interim report of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission, chaired by Lord Hutton, former Work and Pensions Secretary, set out that there is a clear rationale for increasing employee contributions to public service pensions. The report found that the value of public service pensions been increasing following dramatic increase in life expectancy at retirement. Current pensioners are expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to 30% for pensioners in the 1950s.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.0/2">Members of all of the public service pension schemes have benefited from the increase in the value of their pension and most of these extra costs have fallen to employers and taxpayers. Increases in employee contributions will rebalance contributions, and ensure a fairer distribution of costs between members and other taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.437W.0/3">The share of the total savings to AME of &#163;2.8 billion expected from each scheme has been distributed proportionately to the size of scheme's paybill. The range of savings reflects the opportunity to agree some central parameters for the increase, for example protection of low earners, through a process of engagement with trade unions.</p>

	<p pid="a.439W.5/1">The Government are committed to helping small and medium-sized businesses manage their cash flow and to transforming the culture of late payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/2">Firstly, we think that it is important that the public sector sets a strong example here; this is why through the prompt payment initiative, central Government Departments are required to aim to pay 80% of undisputed invoices within five days. To ensure the benefits of prompt payment are felt through the supply chain and benefit smaller businesses, all Departments have also included a clause in their contracts that requires main contractors to pay their suppliers within 30 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/3">To encourage the private sector to come on board, we have also developed a prompt payment code with the Institute of Credit Management (ICM). Voluntary private sector take-up of this code has been strong, with Experian calculating that code signatories now represent over 60% of the total UK supply chain value.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/4">To educate businesses on cash flow management, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has also produced with the ICM a series of 10 checklists on all aspects of cash flow management, which have been endorsed by all the leading representative organisations and which have had nearly 200,000 downloads. The guides can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.creditmanagement.org.uk/bisguides.htm">http://www.creditmanagement.org.uk/bisguides.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/6">The Government also recognise that invoice financing, including supply chain finance, can allow greater flexibility in payment terms and can constitute an important source of working capital for businesses. This is why in the &quot;Financing Business Growth&quot; Green Paper, published in October 2010, the Government committed to support and raise awareness of supply chain finance through bringing together potential private sector providers of supply chain finance and encouraging its use by local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.439W.5/7">The tax system already has inbuilt cash flow advantages for business because of the way payment dates are set out in legislation. In addition, HM Revenue and Customs are also able to provide temporary assistance, through time to pay (TTP) agreements, to viable businesses which are experiencing genuine difficulties in paying their debts.</p>
