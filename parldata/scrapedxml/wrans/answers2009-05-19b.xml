These are in line with planned dates for such contracts to be let.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.0/3">Further to those packages already at an advanced stage of procurement, there will be many more opportunities for landscaping and horticultural suppliers registered on the London 2012 CompeteFor website in areas, including the supply of thousands of younger woodland trees, shrubs and other plants scheduled for planting nearer games-time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.0/4">In consultation with landscaping industry expertise (including the British Association of Landscape Industries, the Horticultural Trades Association, Greening the Games&mdash;an industry-wide lobby group&mdash;as well as expert industry contractors and suppliers) the Olympic Delivery Authority has given careful consideration to the number of growing seasons available for the plant stock proposed across the park and is confident that there is sufficient time to ensure an excellent games-time park.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261W.3/1">The Government Olympic Executive has not made a specific assessment of the economic effects of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics on Essex or Southend West. However, the East of England stands to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the London 2012 games. These include businesses winning games-related work, increased tourism and improved skills and employment opportunities. The games, including pre-games training camps, will enable regions to attract inward investment and showcase themselves on an international stage, and UK Trade and Investment are helping businesses to use 2012 as a springboard for export.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.3/2">We are already seeing progress in a lot of these areas, for example 23 of the Olympic Delivery Authority's suppliers are businesses registered in Essex. Additionally, 66 facilities from the region, including Southend Leisure and Tennis Centre in Essex are included in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide.</p>

	<p pid="b.1264W.8/1">Sport England has commissioned the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) to deliver outcomes against Grow, Sustain and Excel. The ASA has been offered an award of &pound;20,875,000 over the period 2009 to 2013 to drive these outcomes. Sport England is awaiting acceptance of this offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264W.8/2">The ASA award agreement specifies that the ASA will grow the sport by 270,000 additional participants swimming for 30 minutes once a week (increasing the total of one x 30 16+ swimmers to 3,514,400) by 2012-13. It should be noted that Sport England's overall growth target is to get 1 million more people playing sport for 30 minutes three times a week by 2012-13. Recognising that most people who achieve three x 30 minutes per week do so through a combination of different sports, the individual National Governing Bodies have therefore been given goals expressed in terms of one x 30 minutes per week that will aggregate together.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264W.8/3">In addition, the ASA award agreement sets out that the ASA will increase the total number of young people (five to 19) participating in swimming clubs from 136,327 to 159,483 by 2012-13. These figures for young people refer to the number of young people participating in swimming clubs, not the number of young people participating in swimming more generally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271W.10/21">Styrofoam items were being phased out of use during 2008-09 but were re-introduced briefly during two periods due to technical issues with the replacement products. An estimated 300,000 cardboard cups were used during the year in replacement of Styrofoam cups previously used.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271W.10/22">Work has also been done to reduce the environmental impact of plastic food service items used by the catering department. Over 40 per cent. of the plastic food containers listed above were made from recycled plastics and the total number of plastic food containers used in 2008-09 was reduced by an estimated 140,000 by switching to bio-degradable containers manufactured from a by-product of the sugar refining industry. The House of Commons catering service is continuing to test more environmentally-friendly disposable products as new products become available and hopes to reduce even further the remaining usage of oil-based plastics.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.2/2" class="italic"> Capital expenditure</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.2/3">The parliamentary estates directorate (PED) has not carried out any new projects providing cooling for server rooms during the last three years. During this period however PED has provided additional cooling to rooms which house communications and computer equipment associated with servers.

	<p pid="b.1272W.2/4" class="italic"> Electrical energy consumption</p>
	<p pid="b.1272W.2/5">Due to fluctuating energy prices and the complexities of the individual buildings' tariff structures it is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of energy used by all of the cooling equipment associated with server rooms. However PED has used an estimated average electrical energy cost of 10p/kWh to calculate an approximate cost associated with electrical energy of &pound;124,000 per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.2/7">PED maintenance engineers routinely carry out cyclical maintenance works and attend call outs involving the repair and replacement of defective cooling plant. The cost of these works is included within general maintenance contracts which cover large items of cooling plant, some of which serve more than one location. This makes it difficult to accurately assess the cost of maintenance directly attributable to server room cooling alone. PED however estimate the cost of maintenance tasks associated with server cooling equipment to be approximately &pound;9,000 per year<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1274W.5/1">The aim of armed forces day is to honour Britain's armed forces, past, present and future and it is hoped that all former and currently serving members of the forces will fully embrace the concept of the day. The Historic Dockyard Chatham will host the inaugural armed forces day national event on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-27">Saturday 27 June 2009</phrase>. The event will include a parade through Chatham town centre, a drumhead service, flypasts of military aircraft and a range of other activities in the Dockyard throughout the day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.5/2">To enable communities across the UK to be involved in this inaugural year, we have also invited all local authorities to fly a flag for our armed forces. Over 460 of the 480 borough, city, district and county councils across the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man that have been invited to participate in the fly the flag event have registered to take part, as have the Governors in Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. The intention is that this ceremony will be repeated across the country at 1030 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-22">Monday 22 June</phrase>, synchronised with similar ceremonies where we have forces deployed overseas, and that the flags will be flown until after armed forces day itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.5/3">The MOD is also supporting over 80 community events across the country with major events in every region. A full list of events can be found at the armed forces day website at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="b.1278W.2/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme's (WRAP's) home composting campaign used central funding to subsidise the sale of home composting bins for five years. In that time two million home compost bins were sold and 40 per cent. of households with gardens are now home composting. It is estimated that, as a result of WRAP'S programme, more than 300,000 tonnes of organic waste have been diverted from the waste stream each year, resulting in significant waste management and disposal cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278W.2/2">Having demonstrated the benefits of promoting home composting, it was appropriate for local authorities to decide how home composting should fit within their waste strategies and for them to take responsibility for deciding on a suitable level of subsidy. WRAP stopped subsidising compost bins at the end of March 2009. As a result, the full cost of bins to consumers rose by an average of &pound;8, except where the local authority decided to offer its own subsidy. A total of 37 waste disposal authorities are currently offering varying degrees of subsidy. WRAP will continue to promote home composting to the public and provide practical advice and support as part of a wider waste reduction programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284W.9/2">Pets entering the UK under the Pet Travel scheme must meet certain rules, including the need for a rabies vaccination and a blood test.

These animals are under the control of authorised quarantines or travelling agents at all times and are subject to regular veterinary inspections.</p>

	<p pid="b.1287W.8/1">Swine influenza is not a notifiable or statutory disease and it is not listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). International standards for trade in animals and animal products do not impose any restrictions in respect of swine influenza virus infection for the protection of either animal or human health. Accordingly, the EU does not prohibit the import of live pigs or pig meat as a result of the presence of swine influenza in an approved third country from which they may legally be imported to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.8/2">The European Commission's Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health considers that from the evidence available from the recent outbreak of influenza in a pig farm in Canada restrictions in trade of pigs and their products would not be justified. As the World Health Organisation has made clear, this situation does not pose a food safety risk to consumers. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products is perfectly safe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.8/3">We will continue to work with international organisations to understand whether there is any unusual disease in pigs and whether any action to restrict trade would be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.8/4">All animals and meat can only be imported to the European Community from third countries approved as having equivalent health status as member states. They must be accompanied by veterinary certification that must confirm, among other things, that live animals have been examined by an official veterinarian within 24 hours of loading and showed no clinical signs of disease. Meat must have been derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.8/5">Animals and meat imported into the European Community from approved third countries must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they are also subject to veterinary inspections.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.0/1">The facilitated returns scheme was launched in October 2006 as an incentive to persuade foreign prisoners to return voluntarily to their own country. The scheme offers a package of reintegration assistance to the individual, however no financial incentives are offered. The only cash the individual receives is the standard &pound;46 discharge grant provided to all prisoners, including British nationals. The level of assistance offered is variable and is dependant upon the individual circumstances of each case. Around half of those who are removed under the provisions of the scheme receive reintegration assistance. There has been only one instance where an individual who has been transferred to a prison within the country of origin has been provided reintegration assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.0/2">Details of the scheme are available in all UK prisons where foreign national prisoners are serving their sentence. Although they are also verbally advised of the scheme, it is not possible to provide data on the numbers of individuals who have been offered the scheme. It remains open to them to make such an application. Once removed from the UK under the scheme's provisions, they are excluded from re-entering the UK. As such it is only possible to benefit from the scheme once.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.0/3">The chief executive of the UK Border Agency has written to the Home Affairs Select Committee on a regular basis in order to provide all of the most robust and accurate information on foreign national prisoners and deportation, including the successes seen through the use of the facilitated returns scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.0/4">In her letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-23">23 July 2008</phrase> she advised that the scheme, which has generated significant savings and accounted for around 25 per cent. of all foreign prisoner removals in 2007, has resulted in nearly 1,800 foreign prisoners being removed from the UK. In the first year of the scheme (October 2006 to October 2007) the agency spent around &pound;350,000, inclusive of administrative costs. For the same period around 880 removals were made under the scheme which generated considerable savings in detention costs alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.0/5">Copies of her letters are available in the Library of the House. The chief executive will continue to write to the Committee with further updates on the scheme and other data on the deportation of foreign national prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="b.1302W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions and its agencies deal with all complaints on an equal basis, however they are made. How they are dealt with will depend on whether the complaint is about a decision on entitlement, for which there is generally a right of appeal, or about the manner in which the service is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/2">For example, customers who are dissatisfied with any statutory decision made by Jobcentre Plus can appeal. In the first instance, the decision is reviewed by another decision-maker. If the decision remains unchanged after the review, Jobcentre Plus sends the case to the Tribunals Service as part of the appeal process. The Tribunals Service are responsible for administering the appeals process and contact customers about the hearing, which may be held in person or by correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/3">Jobcentre Plus treats decisions complained about in correspondence as an appeal and automatically reconsiders the decision. Where appropriate, Jobcentre Plus contacts the customer for further information to support the appeal process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/4">Most complaints about the service provided can be resolved straightaway by the person dealing with the customer and each of the Department's agencies seeks to achieve this. Each has a clear and simple process for dealing with customer complaints and details of this are contained in their leaflets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/5">Where failings are identified we provide appropriate redress, which might typically include an apology, correction of any error and, where appropriate, financial redress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/6">Where a customer is not satisfied with the response given to their complaint they can ask for a review of the complaint and any redress given. This will first be by a senior manager and, if the customer remains dissatisfied, by the chief executive of the agency concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/7">If the customer remains dissatisfied, he or she can ask the independent case examiner (ICE) to review matters. A request for ICE to investigate should be made within six months of the chief executive's response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/8">The ICE will consider complaints about service delivery, though not matters of law or Government policy. He will review the papers and attempt to mediate. If this is not possible he will report his findings and inform the customer of their right to ask a MP to refer the matter to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</p>

	<p pid="b.1309W.8/1">The UK Government continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in Abyei and Southern Kordofan closely. The population of Abyei (and surrounding areas) is fewer than 50,000, most living in displaced camps in Agok, with 650 in Southern Kordofan. United Nations (UN) sources indicate that the humanitarian system is stable, although the situation remains tense, with the coming rains posing an increased risk of disease and logistical challenges in the delivery of assistance. We are also expecting the results of a recent joint UN/Government assessment of the NGO expulsions impact on the transitional areas, which should provide a more comprehensive picture of any gaps in the humanitarian response and impact on future recovery programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309W.8/2">The UK Government provide humanitarian and early recovery support primarily through the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), which contributed $10.1 million for Southern Kordofan, and an additional $3.3 million for Abyei in 2008. Our 2008 share of the CHF was around 50 per cent. at &pound;40 million. For 2009, we have provided a further &pound;36 million.

	<p pid="b.1310W.5/1">Ministers from the Department for International Development (DFID) have met with Donald Kaberuka, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), on a number of occasions over recent months. Most recently the Secretary of State met him on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April 2009</phrase> at the G20 summit in London. DFID staff have also held regular meetings at senior level with African Development Bank officials, including most recently at the AfDB annual meetings in Senegal on May 13-14.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.5/2">In all of these meetings we have emphasised the importance of a strong AfDB role and country presence to provide early technical support to key institutions in the new Inclusive Government, to help co-ordinate donor engagement and, generally, to help build and maintain momentum for much needed reform efforts in Zimbabwe. However, further major support from the AfDB, from other institutions such as the IMF and World Bank and from the wider donor community will only be made available when we begin to see evidence of a commitment to political and economic reform. Establishing a track record on strong and competent fiscal management and tackling debt arrears will be key issues for the Inclusive Government in building confidence with the international community to support recovery.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313W.2/1">The number discharged from prison are dependent on a variety of factors, including the profile of the prison population in each establishment, the specifics of legislation or policies pertaining at the time, those received into the prison, movements between prisons and in the case of Lindholme the practicalities of removing foreign national prisoners to their home countries. No assessment has therefore been made on the number of releases, early or otherwise, from any specific prison.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313W.2/2">Estimates of the prison population as a whole are generally published annually. This gives the projected monthly prison population in England and Wales for the next seven years. Sub-population (such as gender) estimates are presented alongside the effects of legislation, sentencing activity, and other factors relevant to the prison population.

	<p pid="b.1328W.8/2">However, the UK has made written and oral representations to Spain regarding European Commission Decision 2009/95/EC. Under the decision, Spain has put forward a site of community importance under the Habitats Directive which encompasses BGTW, including an existing site designated by the UK under the same directive. As the UK is the only member state competent to propose a site covering BGTW, we do not recognise the validity of the adopted site. The UK is deeply concerned that Spain should seek to designate an area of BGTW and that this designation should have been approved.</p>

	<p pid="b.1329W.8/3">We remain concerned at the overall level of respect for human rights in Uzbekistan, and regularly raise these concerns through a critical, but constructive dialogue with the Uzbek authorities in Tashkent and in discussions with the Uzbek Embassy in London. In addition, the EU has a comprehensive human rights dialogue with Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on the need for further progress in Uzbek promotion and protection of human rights.

	<p pid="b.1332W.5/1">Since the Government designated Islamic studies as a strategically important subject in 2007, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), following a period of research and consultation, has been working with other funding agencies in the UK to develop a programme of work designed to address its strategic importance and to provide additional support for it as a subject in UK higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/2">HEFCE research and consultation showed that Islamic studies scholars are often relatively isolated experts affiliated to different departments, with weak links to scholars doing related work at other institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/3">HEFCE is, for this reason, funding a national network to bring the community of Islamic studies scholars closer together.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/4">This network aims to provide information on courses and staff, facilitate events, seminars and exchange of ideas, and enable academics to connect. The network will be managed through a website and complemented by a programme to digitise Islamic studies resources developed by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/5">The Higher Education Academy has been funded for a short development phase to plan and develop the national network, which we expect to be operational from the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/6">Although a national network, the web facility and international links within the UK academic community should further enrich this work and strengthen the UK's position as a leading centre for the study of the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/7">Further details can be found on HEFCE's website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/aboutus/sis/islamic/">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/aboutus/sis/islamic/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/9" class="italic"> UK network and digitisation programme</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/10">In January 2009, HEFCE awarded &pound;95,000 to the Higher Education Academy to work with the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) on the development of a full business case for an Islamic studies UK network. We expect that this work will inform a further three-year implementation phase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332W.5/11">HEFCE has awarded &pound;350,000 to the JISC Digitisation Programme to support two specific strands of work relating to the digitisation of resources for use in Islamic studies research and teaching. This is based on recommendations in Exeter University's 2008 &quot;Review of User Requirements for Digitised Resources in Islamic Studies&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1338W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/2">Since the Government designated Islamic studies as a strategically important subject in 2007, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), following a period of research and consultation, has been working with other funding agencies in the UK to develop a programme of work designed to address its strategic importance and to provide additional support for it as a subject in UK higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/3">HEFCE research and consultation showed that Islamic studies scholars are often relatively isolated experts affiliated to different departments, with weak links to scholars doing related work at other institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/4">HEFCE is, for this reason, funding a national network to bring the community of Islamic studies scholars closer together.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/5">This network aims to provide information on courses and staff, facilitate events, seminars and exchange of ideas, and enable academics to connect. The network will be managed through a website and complemented by a programme to digitise Islamic studies resources developed by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/6">The Higher Education Academy has been funded for a short development phase to plan and develop the national network, which we expect to be operational from the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/7">Although a national network, the web facility and international links within the UK academic community should further enrich this work and strengthen the UK's position as a leading centre for the study of the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/8">Further details can be found on HEFCE's website at</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/aboutus/sis/islamic/">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/aboutus/sis/islamic/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/10" class="italic"> UK network and digitisation programme</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/11">In January 2009, HEFCE awarded &pound;95,000 to the Higher Education Academy to work with the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) on the development of a full business case for an Islamic studies UK network. We expect that this work will inform a further three-year implementation phase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338W.6/12">HEFCE has awarded &pound;350,000 to the JISC Digitisation Programme to support two specific strands of work relating to the digitisation of resources for use in Islamic studies research and teaching. This is based on recommendations in Exeter University's 2008 &quot;Review of User Requirements for Digitised Resources in Islamic Studies&quot;.</p>

However to clarify, the purpose of the Register of Surplus Public Sector Land is to record sites for disposal that have been identified as surplus, vacant or under-used by Government Departments and their agencies which can be used for redevelopment including housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1346W.8/2">Information on the number of homes built on public sector land since 2004 is not held centrally as the Register does not capture such details. However, the Homes and Communities Agency estimates that since 2004 some 19,000 homes may have been built on sites formerly owned by the public sector. The cost of providing a more accurate figure would be disproportionate. This estimate will include a proportion of the 59,505 homes built since 1997, referred to in the previous answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-23">23 March 2009</phrase>. I should remind the hon. Member that these figures are likely to under-represent the number of homes built on land formerly owned by Government bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1346W.8/3">Our latest estimate, as at January 2009, is that about 51,000 homes could be built on public sector sites in the next three years. This will be subject to sites remaining surplus or underused and planning approval being obtained. This forecast is under review and may reduce in the future to reflect the challenging market conditions.</p>

However, where they are sent abroad to countries where there are no agreements then they will no longer be entitled to pay Class 1 National Insurance after 52 weeks.

Social security cover is vital as the nature of their work may be hazardous.
