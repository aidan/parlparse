	<p pid="b.703W.3/1">This Department is represented on the cross-government Ministerial Steering group which is promoting sensible risk management as part of its work on tackling perceptions of a compensation culture. Officials are working with colleagues from the Department for Constitutional Affairs, Local Government Employers, and the Health and Safety Executive, on a workshop &quot;Risk and Redress&mdash;The way Forward for Local Government&quot;, which will look at approaches to managing risk sensibly. The workshop will involve local government stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.3/2">In addition the Department is taking a number of specific steps to promote good risk management. The Department will shortly bring forward revised guidance under the How To programme, which aims to raise the quality of town centres, residential areas, and parks and green spaces by encouraging and supporting a climate of good practice. The new guidance will provide advice on how local managers of the public realm, and parks in particular, should assess and manage risk and the perception of risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.3/3">The Department has also tasked the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) with undertaking research and producing good practice guidance on how risk affects the design and management of the public realm. This work will be disseminated in partnership with other relevant organisations later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.6/1">There is no legislation preventing local councillors from discussing issues of concern with their constituents or other members of the public. However, in any such discussion about matters such as a land sale, councillors, if they are to be involved in the final decision, must avoid giving the impression of having a predetermined view, or otherwise risk that decision being challenged in the courts. It is a matter for each member to ensure that, in the circumstances of particular cases, such an impression is not given. Members may wish to seek advice on their position from their authority's monitoring officer. The Local Government Association has published guidance on avoiding predetermination in &quot;Probity in Planning: The role of councillors and Officers&quot;.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-04-19b.132613.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-04-19b.713W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="713W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070419/text/70419w0003.htm#070419115002519">
	<p pid="b.713W.8/1">The Independent European Sport Review was instigated under the UK Presidency following the expression of concerns about the state of football by both UEFA and FIFA. The Review, conducted by an independent review team, undertook an examination of the challenges to the future stability and success of the game posed by commercialisation and the place of sport within the wider EU legal framework. Its publication in final form in October has triggered a wide-ranging debate both within sport and at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/2">The Review contains recommendations aimed at football's governing bodies, the European Commission and member states. Sport is autonomous and much of the responsibility for taking forward the issues raised lies with sport itself. It is for football to agree what it wants to achieve, develop more detailed proposals and engage with the political authorities. My Department has been encouraging this process and there is a well developed debate taking place among the numerous clubs, leagues and governing bodies across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/3">UEFA has made good progress and already implemented a range of the Review's recommendations aimed at it. These include putting in place a new Strategic Council to involve clubs, leagues and players in top-level decision-making, a range of enhancements to its Club Licensing system, the launch of a feasibility study into a European Supporters Direct, based on the highly successful UK model, and enhancement of anti-racism disciplinary measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/4">The key issue the Review raises for the Commission and member states is how the 2000 Nice Declaration can be effectively implemented to ensure the special nature of Sport is recognised in policy-making and in the application of EU rules. Doing so will help overcome the current uncertainty facing those involved in the game and help enable them to find the right balance between its commercial and sporting sides.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/5">The UK has been working closely with the Commission and other member states to take this forward. The Commission will publish a White Paper on Sport this summer that will address this issue and respond to the Review's recommendations aimed at it. I would like to see this set out clearly how the Commission plans to &quot;sports-proof&quot; its decision-making and thus fulfil the commitments made in the Nice Declaration. I strongly welcome indications that it will also recommend the development of an ongoing structured dialogue between sport and the EU aimed at finding a way forward on the kind of issues raised by the Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/6">There is widespread support across Europe to help sport tackle the challenges facing it. The European Parliament issued a Report on the future of Professional Sport on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March</phrase> (the Belet Report) which welcomes the Review and asks the Commission to establish an action plan based upon its recommendations. The Council of Europe has, at the UK's instigation, agreed to consider the issues raised by the Review as part of its new Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/7">The Review is one of a number of recent initiatives that have acted as a catalyst to the wider debate that has been going on in football, and other sports, about where the right balance between its commercial and sporting sides lies and how it can best secure its future stability and success within the wider EU framework. I look forward to the Commission's White Paper as the next key milestone in taking forward the debate on how the political level can help football, and sport more widely, to achieve this within the wider EU framework.</p>

The Premier League, along with other stakeholders, were invited to set out their thoughts on the review in writing following its publication and took this opportunity to present a written submission to me.

	<p pid="b.716W.6/2">The assessment of all Defence accommodation is undertaken by grading boards consisting of a mixture of service officers and technical experts. The process of grading involves assigning deficiency points against a predefined checklist of assessment criteria. The number of deficiency points awarded, if any, then determines the grade for charge, on a scale of one to four, and hence the level of accommodation charge. Normally accommodation is graded on a four year rolling programme. A grading board may also convene on completion of a refurbishment or if the grade for charge is challenged by the occupant shortly after move in.</p>

As part of its ongoing quality and performance regime the MOD continues to actively monitor the performance of this system and explore ways of reducing the failure rate still further in partnership with the supplier.</p>

	<p pid="b.721W.0/1">The Department's SEN Strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; sets out our vision for giving children with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities the opportunity to succeed. Provision for children with SEN and disabilities, including support for those with a visual impairment is made by schools and local authorities through the SEN and disability frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="b.721W.0/2">In particular Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires schools and local authorities to plan to improve access to the curriculum and written materials for disabled pupils over time. Additionally the new Disability Equality Duty introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 requires all public bodies including schools and local authorities to promote disability equality more widely. We also continue to invest significant resources to support the education of children with SEN and disabilities, some &pound;4.5 billion in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.721W.0/3">To assist the provision of materials in accessible alternative formats for children with a visual impairment, the Government supported the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 which reduces delays in gaining copyright clearance to produce books and other printed materials in formats accessible to visually impaired people. The Department of Trade and Industry is also working on a feasibility study to look at opportunities for publishers to provide education material in accessible formats more quickly and the Department for Education and Skills is involved in the process.</p>

	<p pid="b.721W.3/1">The approvals process for prospective foster carers is set out in the Fostering Services Regulations 2002. Paragraph 13 of schedule 3 of the regulations requires that, before any person can be approved as a foster parent, an enhanced disclosure check must be obtained. Adult members of the prospective foster carer's household are subject to a standard disclosure check.</p>
	<p pid="b.721W.3/2">In assessing any person whom it considers may be suitable to become a foster carer, the fostering service provider is required to obtain the range of information prescribed in schedule 3 of the regulations as well as any other information it considers appropriate. On the basis of this information, the fostering service provider is required to prepare a written report which is referred to the fostering panel for consideration; the fostering panel then makes its own recommendation about the individual's suitability to foster. The final decision is made, taking into account this recommendation, by the fostering service provider. Subject to paragraph 27(6), a person would automatically be considered unsuitable to become a foster carer if he/she, or any other adult member of the household, had committed a specified offence under the terms of the regulations. If this is not the case, the decision as to whether or not to approve an individual as a foster carer is made by the fostering service provider in line with the process outlined above.</p>

The figures are taken from data collected by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) which are limited to students who apply to full-time undergraduate courses via the UCAS application system. The figures do not therefore cover part-time students, nor those full-time students who apply directly to Higher Education Institutions. Comparable data for students applying for autumn 2007 entry will not be available until January 2008, but early figures published by UCAS show that, by January 15, applicants from England had risen by 7.1 per cent. to 291,000, which is the highest ever number of applicants at this point in the application cycle.</p>

School-based SENCOs are selected and appointed by head teachers, and the expectation is that heads will appoint someone with a proven track record of working successfully with children with SEN and disabilities. Training arrangements for SENCOs are currently determined locally, having regard to the knowledge, skills and experience of the person concerned, and the range and complexity of SEN and disabilities represented within the school.</p>
	<p pid="b.728W.2/2">The Department's SEN Code of Practice, published in November 2001, contains guidance on the role and responsibilities of SENCOs. The Teacher Training Agency, now the Training and Development Agency for Schools, also published a set of National Standards for SENCOs in 1998.</p>

These regulations would be made pursuant to section 173 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.731W.0/1">The level of potential disallowance relating to all CAP schemes and all UK Paying Agencies is subject to ongoing review by officials and is based on an assessment of the payments process, communications received from, and negotiations with, the European Commission. These prudent, i.e. careful and cautious, assessments are brought together and reported to Ministers as necessary, as was the case for the provisions made in the Department's Resource Accounts for 2005-06 and for the claim on the reserve included in the Spring Supplementary Estimate for &pound;305 million estimate cover, which related to potential provisions in respect of SPS 2005, SPS 2006 and other CAP schemes dating back to 2004. In each case, the overall estimates were based on the latest assessment of potential disallowances at the time. An exercise will be undertaken in relation to the Department's Resource Accounts for 2006-07, at which time a revised assessment will be made of the level of provisions required and what disclosures need to be made in respect of contingent liabilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.735W.0/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office identifies Burma as a country of concern in our 2006 Annual Report on Human Rights. The Government's policy is to promote full respect for human rights in Burma encouraging the rule of law, democracy and good governance, and the freedom of association and speech in accordance with international human rights law.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/2">We have been at the forefront of international efforts over many years to bring pressure to bear on the military regime to re-establish democracy and to respect human rights. We take every opportunity to raise human rights issues with the regime and remind them of their obligations to adhere to international human rights law. Our Embassy in Rangoon also delivers capacity building assistance through our Global Opportunities Fund in support of these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/3">I have raised the human rights situation regularly with the Burmese regime and other Governments in the region. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June 2006</phrase>, I called in the Burmese Ambassador and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase> I wrote to the Burmese Foreign Minister, highlighting our many concerns. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-18">18 September 2006</phrase>, I raised the serious human rights situation with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ambassadors, including the Burmese Ambassador, and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase> with the ASEAN Secretary-General. I have also raised Burma with the Governments of China, India, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea. I have discussed the human rights abuses taking place in Burma with Juan Mendez, the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide. I discussed Burma in detail with Ibrahim Gambari, the UN Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November 2006</phrase>, following his visit to the country. Most recently, I raised the human rights situation in Burma in my address to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-13">13 March</phrase> and at the EU/ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Nuremberg on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>, in the presence of the Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/4">In addition, our Ambassador in Rangoon regularly raises human rights with the regime, most recently when he met the Burmese Ministers for Planning and Immigration and the Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/5">The UK works closely with the EU and other international partners, including the UN and ASEAN, to promote human rights in Burma, and fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma, Professor Sergio Pinheiro.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/6">We supported the efforts to have Burma added to the UN Security Council agenda in September 2006 and co-sponsored with the US a UN Security Council Resolution on Burma. This was put to the vote on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-12">12 January</phrase>. Nine members of the Security Council supported the Resolution. However, three States, including two Permanent Members of the Council, voted against and as such the Resolution was not adopted. While the result was disappointing, it is important to note that all Security Council members agreed that there were serious issues of concern in Burma. This, and the positive votes from the majority of Security Council partners, reflected the international community's deep concern over the plight of Burma's people. Burma remains on the UN Security Council agenda.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.8/1">The UK was deeply disturbed by the events in Gaur, southern Nepal on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase> during which 27 people were killed. This shocking display of violence is unacceptable in a democratic society and does not help Nepal or the peace process. Nor does it help address the legitimate grievances of the Madhesis and other disenfranchised groups in the Terai region who have been demonstrating for greater inclusion in the interim constitution and wider political process. We have urged the Government of Nepal to take prompt action to bring the perpetrators of this violence to justice and welcomed the statement by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, which also called for the Government of Nepal to launch an investigation into the killings in Gaur. The full text of the statement is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.8/4">The continuing violence in the Terai reinforces the urgent need for the Government of Nepal to address Madhesi grievances and to work towards a more democratic and inclusive system. During his visit to Nepal on 2-<phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase>, my hon.

	<p pid="b.738W.5/1">The United Kingdom will work with the EU, with its allies in the Western European and Others' Group and with the other nuclear weapon states towards strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and the wider nuclear non-proliferation regime. There are a number of issues on which useful work could be undertaken, many of which were set out in the EU Common Position agreed for the 2005 review conference and remain outstanding. It will be important to build consensus on these areas, and any new workstreams, in this and future Preparatory Committees. We hope that this process will culminate in a substantive final document being agreed at the 2010 NPT review conference.</p>

I understand that six additional bicycle parking spaces have been agreed on Victoria Embankment near Portcullis House and that Transport for London, the highway authority, has been requested to install them as soon as possible. Other potential sites for on-street cycle parking around Parliament are being investigated by Westminster City Council and other relevant authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.757W.2/1">The normal temperature setting for the Palace of Westminster is 21<sup>(&deg;)</sup> C, in line with guidance from the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) guide for office spaces, but this can be adjusted according to demand from the occupants. There are many heating zones in the Palace of Westminster which have their temperatures controlled independently, therefore temperature settings may differ from area to area. The existing controls are currently being replaced with more modern ones which should enable better control and energy efficiency to be achieved.</p>

However, at present this information is not broken down by building or by Department. The Refreshment Department is actively working with Works and Estates to increase the amount of cardboard and other waste sent for recycling and a proposal to run an environment champions programme on the estate is being considered.

	<p pid="b.758W.6/1">The millennium development goals (MDGs), including the fifth goal on improving maternal health, enables countries and international development partners, including DFID, to work together towards a common end. The United Nations produces an annual progress report &quot;the Millennium Development Goals Report&quot;, outlining the progress made against each of the MDGs, including maternal health, at global and regional levels. At country level, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) works with countries to track their progress against the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.6/2">DFID supports these global assessment processes and does not try to replicate them. However, DFID does track the progress of UK development investments. For example, we produce an annual report on progress in implementing our maternal health strategy &quot;Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action&quot;. The second annual progress report is due to be published shortly and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. The report will provide details on what we have achieved, areas where we have made less progress and what more we need to do. The report covers both our efforts in supporting Government and non-government efforts to improve maternal health (MDG 5) in countries, as well as what we have done internationally and at the policy level.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.6/3">In addition at country level, a framework for annual assessment of performance is included in DFID's country assistance plans (CAP). These CAPs set out details of how DFID aims to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.6/4">In 2006, the international community agreed a new target under the maternal health millennium development goal (MDG 5) for &quot;Universal Access to Reproductive Health by 2015&quot;. This is in addition to the existing target under MDG 5 to &quot;Reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015&quot;. The new target means that access to reproductive health information, services and supplies should be available to all who need it. And it means that Governments and the international community will be held accountable for providing them. We are proud that the UK fought hard for this target and has supported subsequent work to agree appropriate monitoring indicators. One of the new proposed indicators is 'unmet need for family planning' which is an important indicator because family planning is one of the most cost effective interventions we can make towards the achievement of not only the new reproductive health target, but to the achievement of all the MDGs.</p>

	<p pid="b.759W.2/1">DFID is committed to increasing access to reliable and affordable energy for reducing poverty and increasing economic growth in developing countries. Renewable energy has an increasingly important role to play in helping developing countries make progress towards the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/2">We are also encouraging the World Bank and other development partners to give renewable energy greater attention as part of their efforts to improve access to energy. At Gleneagles in 2005 the G8 called on the World Bank and Regional Development Banks to create a new Clean Energy Investment Framework. They have now developed their plans and are beginning to demonstrate progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/3">The World Bank has scaled up its financial support for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In August 2006, it announced a rise to $680 million in commitments in the year to June 2006, an increase of 48 per cent. compared to the previous year. This figure excludes large hydropower projects and covers solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and small (less than 10 MW) hydropower technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/4">These figures exceed the commitment they made in 2004 to increase their renewable energy and energy efficiency investments by 20 per cent. per annum over the next five years. We very much welcome this increased investment by the World Bank on clean energy. We now think that the bank needs to set out a high level of ambition for funds flowing through the Clean Energy Investment Framework over the coming years. At the recent spring meetings of the World Bank the UK called on the bank to set a range of new investment and outcome targets, including a higher target for renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/5">As announced in the 2007 Budget Statement, a new &pound;800 million Environmental Transformation Fund will finance overseas development projects that deliver both poverty reduction and environmental benefits in developing countries, and help developing countries respond to climate change. This fund will support climate change adaptation, provide access to clean energy and help tackle unsustainable deforestation.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/6">DFID is funding international networks such as the Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP) and the EU energy initiative (EUEI) to promote access to affordable energy services, drawing on the full menu of technology options, including renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/7">DFID has supported the creation of a new &euro;220 million EU energy facility, which will start funding projects this year. This fund aims to improve access to energy, especially in Africa, and encouraged viable renewable energy proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.2/8">DFID is also increasing research funding for the energy sector to reflect the growing interest in clean energy for development. This year DFID launched a new five year, &pound;3.75 million energy research programme on renewable energy and is currently scoping areas for further work.</p>

This approach is endorsed by the Stern Review on the economics of climate change which strongly supports carbon pricing to ensure that economic decisions fully reflect social and environmental costs.

	<p pid="b.771W.3/1">Total sales of biofuels in the UK in 2006 were around 264 million litres, of which around two thirds were biodiesel and one third bioethanol. The Government do not hold precise data on the country of origin of these biofuels. Our understanding is that the great majority of the biodiesel sold in the UK in 2006 was produced domestically, but all of the bioethanol was imported.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.3/2">The total amount of UK-produced biofuel is set to increase significantly in future years as a result of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). Once the RTFO comes into effect in April 2008, the Government will also have much better data on the provenance of all biofuels sold on the UK market. This is because in order to receive any credits under the RTFO suppliers of renewable transport fuels will be required to provide information, where possible, on, among other things, the country of origin of the feedstock used to produce their biofuels.</p>

	<p pid="b.772W.3/2">Under the Transport Act 1985 local authorities have power to secure by means of subsidy contracts the provision of bus services which are necessary to meet the transport needs of their area and which would not be provided other than by subsidy. It is for individual local authorities to decide which bus services should be provided in their area under this power. It is also for them to decide the terms of contracts, and to which operators they should be awarded, after undertaking any necessary competitive tendering exercise. There are no specific limits relating to minimum commercial returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.3/3">In best practice guidance for local authorities published in 2005 we have emphasised the importance of authorities having clearly defined criteria when procuring subsidised services, to ensure they achieve best value for money. This would include the need to take account of the overall market for bus services in their area, including services being provided commercially. A copy of this guidance is on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.779W.0/1">The Government have made clear its concern over the activities of so-called vulture funds and the problems they case for those countries that have received debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/2">The Government's action to date has focused on preventing vulture fund litigation through the elimination of commercial debts and on strengthening debt management in HIPCs. The Department for International Development (DFID) co-funds a debt management capacity building programme that, through better debt management, should help to avoid debts being sold on to potential litigators. DFID also supports the World Bank's Debt Reduction Facility, which provides grants to enable countries to buy back their commercial debts at very significant discount (on average over 90 per cent. reduction), thereby removing the potential for litigation. Since its establishment, this facility has helped eliminate around $8 billion of debt in low-income countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/3">The UK has assisted HIPCs in fighting aggressive creditors. We are also encouraging the African Development Bank to develop a Legal Assistance Facility, which will offer advice to HIPC countries facing litigation. DFID has also been working with partner Governments to tackle the corruption that can make it easier for vulture funds to purchase distressed debts in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/4">All Governments and companies have a responsibility to ensure that debts of vulnerable countries are not sold to vulture funds. The UK is working with our international partners to agree a Charter on Responsible Lending. The G20 agreed a set of Principles on Fair Debt Restructuring in 2004 and the UK fully supports this.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/5">The Paris Club group of sovereign creditors recognise the importance of tackling vulture fund activity against HIPCs and press for comparable debt relief treatment from all creditors. The UK is an active member of this group.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/6">HMG does not hold a record of the awards made against developing country Governments in UK courts or the identity and/or country of residence of the parties involved. Some information on existing lawsuits is published by the IMF in their HIPC Status of Implementation Report. This is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.783W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has a complete set of standards and guidelines on usability and accessibility on its websites. The standards are for information published on DWP internet and intranet sites. The guidelines are on strategic requirements, use of cascading style sheets, page length, the importance of accuracy, usability, accessibility and design when developing content.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.2/2">DWP is committed to improving the accessibility of its own websites. All its sites are working towards complying with the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (W3C WCAG) at Level AA, in line with Cabinet Office guidance. Guidelines have been developed for site managers, and a testing and improvement programme is now in place. In a recent audit, 45 per cent. of DWP's information sites passed automated checks for level AA.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.2/3">User testing of the DWP site <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk">www.dwp.gov.uk</a> will take place in May 2007 and the results will be fed into making further improvements to the site.</p>
