	<p pid="a.512W.8/2">Of these, some 24,000 are in receipt of Service pensions under the terms of the Gurkha Pension Scheme or the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. These provide a very good standard of living in Nepal. The rate of pension under the Gurkha Pension Scheme is kept under regular review and uplifted annually for inflation in Nepal, which ensures that the pension maintains its value in Nepal over the years. (The annual value of Gurkha Pension Scheme pensions that will be paid by the MOD in Nepal in 2009-10 is &pound;54 million.)</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/3">There are around 5,000 veterans/veterans' widows who do not qualify for a Service Pension but who receive a Welfare Pension from the Gurkha Welfare Scheme, which is the field arm of the independent charity, the Gurkha Welfare Trust. The Welfare Pension is paid from donations made to the Gurkha Welfare Trust which allows them a sustainable lifestyle. The Ministry of Defence grants the Gurkha Welfare Trust more than &pound;1 million per year, which covers most of its administrative costs in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/4">The remaining 7,000 personnel are veterans who did not serve for long enough to qualify for a Service Pension and who are not yet old enough or needy enough to qualify for a Welfare Pension. On leaving the Brigade of Gurkhas, they would have received a gratuity but no pension. If these veterans fall on hard times they too become eligible for a Welfare Pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/5">All veterans receive free primary health care and those without Gurkha Pension Scheme or AFPS payments receive free secondary health care, all through the Gurkha Welfare Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.8/2">The aim of the UK Government and the devolved Administrations, remains the eradication of fuel poverty in vulnerable households, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as far as reasonably practicable by 2010, with the overall aim that as far as reasonably practicable no household in the UK should live in fuel poverty by 2016 (2018 in Wales).</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.8/3">There is a wide range of policies and programmes in place which contribute to tackling fuel poverty. This includes Warm Front, CERT and the Decent Homes programme primarily addressing the energy efficiency of households, Winter fuel and cold weather payments to increase household incomes. However, rising energy prices have made achieving our fuel poverty targets more difficult and the current mix of fuel poverty measures is unlikely to eradicate fuel poverty among the vulnerable by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.8/4">Against this background, a review of our fuel poverty policies is under way which will be examining whether existing measures to tackle fuel poverty could be made more effective. It will also consider whether new policies should be introduced to help us make further progress towards our goals. The review is looking across all three drivers of fuel poverty, and particularly the key issue of how we can more effectively identify and target assistance at vulnerable households.</p>

	<p pid="a.515W.5/2"><i> </i>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans for such discussions. Decisions on street lighting levels are a matter for local authorities. They are required to report on their progress in reducing carbon emissions in the local authority performance framework. Local authorities have a broad range of means for reducing emissions from their own estates and from their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/3">Salix Finance, funded by DECC through the Carbon Trust, helps with street lighting projects. So far Salix Finance has made approximately &pound;900,000 available in the form of match-funded interest free loans for street lighting projects, which are estimated to deliver annual carbon savings of 1,875 tCO2.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/4">DECC is working to include street lighting in the Carbon Reduction Commitment. This will provide an incentive for local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of street lights. DECC is working closely with Communities and Local Government to develop the policy, in so far as it relates to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/5">The Government have also negotiated an implementing measure on street lighting under the Framework Directive for the Eco-design of Energy-using Products. This is expected to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and bring cost savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.520W.11/16">The trends are not measured against a baseline. Baseline information is not relevant to de-listing as the viability of the population would be considered rather than a baseline value to which current population levels would be compared.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.11/17">The criteria for delisting any species from the UK list of priority species is:</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.11/18" class="indent">Long-term or underlying decline has been halted and sufficient recovery achieved. This represents compliance with the European 2010 target to halt the loss of biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.11/19" class="indent">All criteria thresholds for selecting UK priority species have been exceeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.11/20" class="indent">Sufficient recovery has been undertaken to remove the risk of re-selection and immediate deterioration of state.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.11/21" class="indent">Some species are conservation dependant and will always require some conservation action even when desired state has been achieved. Where there is a realistic risk that removing a conservation dependant species from the UK list of priority species will result in the action or protection that the species is dependent upon coming to a halt, then the species will be identified as being 'BAP dependent' and will remain on the UK list of priority species until this is no longer the case, even if the other success criteria have been met.</p>

	<p pid="a.522W.2/1">Guidance was issued by the then Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 2000. This states that surface water drainage charges for non-household customers should be set in a way that is sensitive to the actual use of the service by different types of premises. Ofwat, as the independent economic regulator for the water industry, is required to have regard to this guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/2">United Utilities recognised that its switch to site area charging was not in line with this guidance, or Ofwat's more detailed 2003 guidance to water companies. Consequently United Utilities introduced a moratorium on its surface water drainage charges for 2009-10 for faith buildings, community amateur sports clubs (and similar clubs) and properties owned by Scout and Guide associations. This saw surface water drainage charges for these customers revert to 2008-09 levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.5/1">It is not possible to categorise goods and services purchased for energy efficiency reasons without incurring disproportionate costs. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has undertaken some measures for energy efficient reasons, such as upgrading lighting systems and lowering the office heating temperature.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/2">Other measures have sustainable benefits but were implemented in response to a range of drivers including health and safety and estate rationalisation, for example the installation of more efficient hand dryers and the demolition of energy inefficient modular cabins. Energy efficiency is monitored though the Environmental Management Plan which sets out the actions required to meet the Sustainable Operations in the Government Estate targets. Future energy efficiency measures include installing more water efficient fittings, introducing ground source heat pumps, and putting in smart metering. Sustainability is one of the considerations in the business case for developments on the FCO estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.527W.3/26">Technical issues relating to the coding of incidents in the HSE's database mean that there are some data discontinuities. A change during 2003-04 caused an artificial fall in that year in the number of injury reports coded to education and that affects the data series to 2006-07. A subsequent adjustment to the database from the start of 2007-08&mdash;to bring about a closer alignment with data prior to 2003-04&mdash;has introduced a further discontinuity. HSE statisticians are working to redress these known issues.</p>

			<tr pid="a.532W.8/30"> <td colspan="11"><i> Notes:</i><i> Ungrossed data</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  <i> Finished admission episodes</i> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.  This table does not provide a total number of cases of stroke since those dying before reaching hospital or not being admitted to hospital will not be counted. As well as this, anyone suffering from a stroke whilst already admitted to hospital will not be included in the count.  <i> Primary diagnosis</i><i> </i>The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.  <sup>(1)</sup> The following ICD-10 codes have been used:  160 Subarachnoid haemorrhage  161 Intracerebral haemorrhage  162 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage  163 Cerebral infarction  164 Stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction  <i> Data quality</i><i> </i>HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> PCT7 strategic health authority (SHA) data quality</i>  PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.  <i> Assessing growth through time</i>  HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.  Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  <i> Small numbers</i>  To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.  <i> 2006-07 data</i>  There is a decline in 2006-07 compared to previous years. This is due to an error made by Milton Keynes PCT when submitting their data for this year. Their submission was split into two parts, but unfortunately the second submitted file for the year overwrote the first, giving approximately half as many records as there should have been. For this reason it is advised not to compare this year to other years.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.535W.6/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) was established in 1995, when responsibility for the operational management of the NDNAD rested with the Forensic Science Service (FSS) on behalf of the police service.

The costs from 2006-07 are higher than for previous years, because of the complete separation of costs from the FSS, and because the increase in the number of forensic suppliers requires additional resources for accreditation and continuous monitoring. In addition, the costs for 2008-09 include the costs of transferring the physical operation and maintenance of the NDNAD from the FSS to the NPIA (&quot;NDNAD Transition&quot;).</p>

The average time from the date of application to making, not including time for production of an Environmental Statement where necessary, was three years and 11 weeks. The longest time was just under eight years, the shortest just over nine months. Our reforms to the planning process under the Planning Act 2008 and the Marine and Coastal Access Bill have been designed to reduce the time taken to determine such orders.</p>

	<p pid="a.551W.3/2">Based on current records, Table 1 lists research projects involving opinion survey (defined broadly here as any surveys of the public to acquire relevant information) commissioned by the Department from October 2007 and the GEO's expenditure on this research by financial year. Table 2 sets out research projects involving focus groups, commissioned by the Department and the associated total annual expenditure by financial year. Table 3 presents information on any other forms of market research commissioned by GEO and associated costs by financial year.</p>

Beyond this claimants will be able to access support through pathways to work voluntarily and will also be able to receive help from the new specialist disability employment programme, which is due to be launched in October 2010. This new programme will be for those disabled people who have complex barriers to employment and will ensure that they have access to the right level of support based on their individual needs, to help them prepare for, enter and/ or retain employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.3/2">As we set out in the White Paper, we will need to introduce further changes gradually and extend the work-focused interviews regime beyond current time periods as resources allow. This is consistent with the direction of travel set by David Freud in his report &quot;Reducing dependency, increasing opportunity: options for the future of welfare to work&quot; and further developed in the recent review by Professor Paul Gregg. The Invest to Save pathfinders, due to begin in five areas from spring 2011, will help to increase our understanding of how best to support long term claimants with a health condition or disability into work.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.6/1">DWP published the Commissioning Strategy in February 2008. This provides a set of principles to incentivise providers to support all customers on contracted employment provision. Longer and larger contracts will make provision attractive to a broader range of providers. This competition for and within contracts will incentivise providers to drive up performance offers, and the number of people they plan to get into work. Competition for flexible new deal contracts has been fierce, and preferred bidders have committed to get more people into work than the best of existing provision, employment zones.</p>

	<p pid="a.560W.3/2">Clause 9 of and schedule 3 to the Welfare Reform Bill confer a number of new regulation-making powers allowing for requirements to be imposed on people claiming jobseeker' allowance or employment and support allowance who are dependent on drugs or who have a propensity to misuse drugs. The regulations will include a range of safeguards to ensure that the requirements are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Government are considering including the following measures in particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.3/3" class="indent">before a benefit sanction is applied for failure to comply with a mandatory element of the policy, customers will have the opportunity to argue they had good cause for failing to comply with the new arrangements;</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.3/4" class="indent">the content of rehabilitation plans will be agreed with the individuals concerned, including any drug treatment that will be undertaken;</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.3/5" class="indent">the sharing of data with other organisations will be proportionate and administered in line with existing protocols; and</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.3/6" class="indent">drug testing will be used in a proportionate way to help establish problematic drug use in cases of dispute.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.3/7">The affirmative parliamentary procedure will apply to the regulations so, before they can come into force, they will have to be approved in draft by both Houses.</p>
