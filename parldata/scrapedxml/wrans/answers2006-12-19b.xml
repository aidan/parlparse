This has been the case since VAT was introduced. As such, no estimate has been made.

The guidance is aimed at minimising risks for all road users and does not segregate needs by vehicle types.</p>

	<p pid="b.1756W.9/2">Substantial research was completed by the Highways Agency in the 1990s on the use of non-slip road surfaces. This has been used to establish the Agency's current standards and policy on their use on trunk roads. At present, the Agency is carrying out research to establish whether the condition of non-slip road surface sites can be assessed by survey machines travelling at traffic speed. This research is expected to be completed in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1776W.16/1">The duty will not introduce any additional monitoring. However, local authorities' performance on biodiversity can be monitored using existing mechanisms. This includes the biodiversity action reporting system, the library of voluntary performance indicators and other performance indicators under development with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Audit Commission and local government partners. Information on indicators under development can be found on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1776W.16/3">Guidance being published in 2007, to support local authorities in implementing the duty, will also promote biodiversity indicators as a way to measure progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.16/4">It is intended that the biodiversity duty will encourage a culture change so that biodiversity is taken into account across the functions of local authorities, rather than being prescriptive. Due to the diverse nature of local authorities, the Government are keen to allow them flexibility in the approaches used to implement the duty. Therefore it is not feasible to ensure that local authorities use the exact same approach across the board.</p>

The data on emissions from all sources are the average of the central cases in the 2006 Energy Review, including the effect of emissions trading and the policies included in the UK Climate Change Programme. Projections for all sources on this basis are not available beyond 2020. The data for total emissions from all sources include emissions from domestic flights, which currently account for about 7 per cent. of emissions from aviation at UK airports.

Instead capital budgets are allocated and reported upon along functional lines to Directorates that oversee the policy area and to executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to sustain their asset base. For example, capital budgets are allocated to the DEFRA units responsible for the Departmental estate; IT; flood defence and waste management. Many of these individual projects are then carried out by third parties such as local authorities. Because capital expenditure is captured in this format the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1780W.0/25">The increase in emissions from deforestation is largely due to the delayed effect of soil disturbance in earlier years of the period since 1990, rather than a proportionate increase in the deforestation rate. Afforestation results in a net removal of carbon from the atmosphere and is therefore represented as a negative emission. There is a small initial emission from new planting due to the disturbance of the soil.</p>

	<p pid="b.1780W.3/2">Since DEFRA's inception in June 2001, we have provided significant funding for a wide range of schemes that aim to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.3/3">Headline programmes include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.3/4" class="indent">(i) those governed by the Carbon Trust, which leads in encouraging business and public sector energy efficiency and low carbon innovation</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.3/5" class="indent">(ii) the Energy Saving Trust, whose activities are aimed at increasing demand for household sector energy efficiency</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.3/6" class="indent">(iii) the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which reduces carbon emissions at least cost to industry</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.3/7" class="indent">(iv) the Climate Change Communications Initiative, which aims to change attitudes toward climate change within the general public, with a central focus on local, grass roots and regional engagement</p>

	<p pid="b.1780W.3/9">DEFRA is also active in the international arena, especially in relation to emerging economies including China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally, DEFRA contributes funding to a variety of research programmes, including the flagship Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.3/10">DEFRA is currently spending more than &pound;180 million each year on these headline activities to combat climate change and over twice as much as this on peripheral activities. Full and detailed historic figures for DEFRA's expenditure on all programmes that directly or indirectly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The table also shows the length of each contract over which the repayments will take place and the estimated total unitary charge payments for each scheme. The repayment of the capital value is an element of this unitary charge but it is not the only cost covered. Other elements of the unitary charge can include inflation and service provision. We are not able to specify the exact breakdown of the unitary charge payments into these different elements, but have indicated for each scheme the type of costs that are covered by the charge. In each case, the unitary charge payments are projections to the end of the contract and are conditional on the performance of the private sector contractor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1782W.2/2">As well as schemes undertaken by the core Department and its agencies, Defra also provides support in the form of PFI credits to allow local authorities to enter into PFI contracts to provide waste treatment facilities, and we have therefore included details of these schemes.</p>

This will not necessarily involve additional resources, as in many cases the delivery of support under the new Programme will use those resources that are currently delivering the existing Programme. The formal transfer to the Regional Development Agencies of responsibility for delivery of the socio-economic elements of the current and successor Rural Development Programmes in England involved a transfer of 65.5 full time equivalent posts from the Rural Development Service</p>

This commitment applies equally in rural and urban areas. The majority of my Department's programmes benefit both rural and urban areas. However, the cost of these programmes in rural areas alone could not be identified without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1786W.2/15">DEFRA also contributes &pound;74 million to the Regional Development Agencies' (RDA) Single Pot in 2007-08, for delivery against three of it's Public Service Agreement targets: sustainable development, rural productivity, and sustainable farming and food. While RDAs are required to address the needs of their regions' rural areas, they recognise there is considerable interdependence between cities, towns and rural areas. Rural needs are best secured by tailoring mainstream policy, with rurally specific programmes only being developed where market failure cannot be addressed through mainstream provision. As the majority of expenditure in rural areas is therefore likely to be through an RDA's mainstream activities (such as regional business support and skills development) it is difficult to identify precise rural spend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.2/16">The England LEADER+ programme, which assists rural communities in improving the quality of life and economic prosperity in their local area, will contribute around &pound;10 million in 2007-08 to the 25 local action groups selected to deliver the Programme in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.2/17">In addition, Objective 1 European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Funding, (EAGGF) administered by DEFRA, will provide around &pound;22 million in 2007-08 for the three areas (Cornwall and The Isles of Scilly, South Yorkshire and Merseyside) designated under the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1788W.0/1">The evacuation of staff from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme, and other humanitarian agencies due to insecurity has the potential to affect the protection of both refugees and internally displaced and the provision of life-saving assistance. In response to the situation, the World Food Programme has already distributed food rations to cover needs in December, and agencies have put in place measures to allow most basic services to be continued if there was a full evacuation. Maintaining water supply is a major concern, due to the depth of the groundwater. If systems in the camps were to break down and agencies were unable to repair them, refugee and IDP populations would be forced to seek water elsewhere. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will consider providing further support to the humanitarian operation if required.

	<p pid="b.1788W.6/1">For development, all states need to fulfil certain basic functions, such as protecting their people and providing an economic framework to enable people to support themselves. In fragile states, our approach is to provide support for basic government administrative capacity building such that we do not overburden already weak state structures by attempting governance improvements on all fronts. Alongside this fundamental support, we also prioritise security, access to justice, conflict prevention, peace-building, the protection of human rights and basic service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.6/2">For example in Sierra Leone, DFID assistance in building up civilian policing has helped reduce instability and increased the safety of citizens. Human development indicators are improving because citizens are better able to earn a living safely. In DRC DFID has supported the first democratic elections there for 40 years. And in Afghanistan DFID has helped the Government to collect revenue and plan their budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.6/3">In our 2006 White Paper, we set out our commitment to use a new 'quality of governance' assessment which will be done as part of our published Country Assessment Plans. We will use this assessment along with others to make choices about the way in which we provide UK aid and help improve the capability of state institutions and strengthen their accountability to the poor.</p>

	<p pid="b.1790W.3/1">Over the last few months, attacks on humanitarian agencies have led to the evacuation of staff and the suspension of their operations in a number of locations throughout the Darfur states. This has reduced the area in which humanitarian assistance can be delivered, and poses a severe threat to an already fragile situation. The ability of agencies to return to these areas is contingent upon an improvement in security, which in turn requires finding a political solution to this crisis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1790W.3/2">The UK remains at the forefront of efforts by the international community to achieve this. Recent meetings in Addis Ababa mapped out a way forward, including the need for an immediate and strengthened ceasefire; a renewed political process to bring in the non-signatory rebel groups to the Darfur Peace Agreement; and a hybrid Africa Union&mdash;United Nations (AU-UN) peacekeeping force.</p>
	<p pid="b.1790W.3/3">We welcome the fact that the African Union Peace and Security Council extended the mandate of the AU force and endorsed the Addis Ababa conclusions. The staged deployment of UN support packages to the AU force leading to a joint operation needs to happen without delay in order to restore security, protect civilians, ensure humanitarian access and implement security aspects of the Darfur Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1790W.3/4">The UK Government has been in regular discussion with the Government of Sudan on the requirements to end the conflict. We are pressing them to take forward these agreed steps in full co-operation with the AU and UN and, in doing so, proving that it is taking its responsibilities seriously.</p>

The changes were originally introduced on a trial basis from the return of the House in October.

A reporter voice-over is also now permitted during divisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1791W.3/4">Two new interview points have been identified within the precincts: in the south west corner of Westminster Hall once the current works there have been completed, and on the Green in New Palace Yard, subject in the latter case to a permit from the Serjeant at Arms. Filming pieces to camera of a presenter walking across Central Lobby are also permitted before 9 a.m. on non-sitting days, similarly subject to a permit from the Serjeant at Arms.</p>

Friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, visited Bangladesh on 22-<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-23">23 November</phrase> and met the head of the caretaker government and leaders of the main political parties. In his meetings, my right hon. Friend urged the caretaker government to act in a non-partisan manner to deliver free, fair, peaceful and accepted elections. He emphasised the need for responsible leadership and restraint from the parties in Bangladesh.

However, in some circumstances, such persons may also be subject to the laws of other states, particularly their state of nationality.

	<p pid="b.1797W.5/1">It is a condition of employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have the legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) provisions for children's education are intended to help staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.5/2">We expect children who accompany their parents on postings overseas to use free state schooling if it is available locally and suitable. If suitable schooling is not available free of charge locally, but is available at fee-charging schools, we refund fees to enable children to receive the education they would be entitled to in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.5/3">With staff and their families having to move at regular intervals, sometimes at short notice and at times which may disrupt schooling for their children, and education facilities at posts overseas varying, continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO's continuity of education allowance addresses this problem by enabling children to board at schools in the UK while their parents remain subject to the world-wide mobility obligation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1799W.2/1">The election in May 2005 marked a step change in the democratisation process in Ethiopia. The degree of political freedom and debate in the run up to the election was unprecedented. We were disturbed that subsequent disputes over the election results led to civil unrest and violence which resulted in the tragic death of many people. There were also widespread arrests and allegations of human rights abuses. The main Opposition leaders and some civil society representatives remain in detention facing serious charges including genocide and treason. Since the election there has been a closing down of political space for the Opposition, the independent media and civil society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.2/2">We continue to encourage both the Government of Ethiopia and Opposition to move forward with the democratisation process and to work towards political reconciliation. We have a regular dialogue with the Government on governance and human rights issues and the Government are now beginning to take steps to create space for opposition parties to contribute and participate in the House of Peoples' Representatives. We continue to urge the Government to open up political space and encourage open debate with all parts of society.</p>

The ODA committed to identifying, sourcing and using environmentally and socially responsible materials in its draft Sustainability and Progress Report published in July 2006.

	<p pid="b.1813W.8/1">The Local Government White Paper announced an independent review of the incentives and barriers to serving on councils in England. The review will look at a range of issues which affect whether or not people decide to stand for election, including the time commitments expected of frontline councillors and cabinet members. The review will be established in early 2007 and we expect it to report in the autumn. The local government sector will be fully involved in the review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1832W.2/1">The installation of cameras at the Diamond in Portstewart is part of the wider CCTV Challenge Fund competition for the expansion of town centre CCTV schemes. The award of the contract for installation of the cameras was conducted as a two stage process. The first stage was to ask for expressions of interest. This was followed by a shortlisting exercise. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase> those successful at shortlisting were then invited to submit tenders. The closing date for tender applications was <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April 2006</phrase> with the successful applicant being awarded the contract on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-27">27 July 2006</phrase>. A second contract to provide the fibre optical cabling was awarded. This contract was not subject to a tendering process as technical advice was that there was only one supplier with the capacity to meet the specification requirements across Northern Ireland. All decisions throughout the CCTV Challenge Fund Competition have been guided by expert technical advice from PSNI.</p>

An individual person claiming discrimination under Part III of the DDA may bring civil proceedings in the county court.</p>
	<p pid="b.1837W.2/2">Currently, private clubs which do not offer goods or services to the general public are not covered by the existing DDA duties on service providers.

	<p pid="b.1840W.8/15" class="indent">&quot;I know that concern has been expressed in this House and elsewhere about the length and cost of some public inquiries. In particular, there are concerns about the cost of the Bloody Sunday inquiry&mdash;&pound;129 million to date, with a predicted final cost of &pound;155 million. I understand that unhappiness, but setting up that inquiry was the right thing to do, and I commend the work of Lord Saville and his team. Having been established, the inquiry must run its course if it is to be fair to individuals and if the truth is to emerge. We will, of course, take all reasonable steps to control costs in the inquiries that I have announced today, including capping legal costs where appropriate. We will ensure that the inquiries have the maximum powers, as well as aiming for better, quicker inquiries. Even so, these inquiries will inevitably mean the commitment of significant resources. The Government recognise people's desire to see public funds spent on delivering better public services and effective policing. I recognise public concern about further expenditure on inquiries into the past.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/16">Since the establishment of the Robert Hamill,Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson inquiries, the Government have worked with the inquiries to put in place a number of measures to ensure that, while they have the resources necessary to fulfil their task, costs are kept to a reasonable level. The specific steps that have been taken are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/17" class="indent">agreeing a management statement that includes a financial memorandum with the inquiries. The management statement sets out the broad framework under which any public funds are paid to the inquiries including the conditions under which public funds are paid and how the inquiry accounts for its expenditure. My officials hold regular formal meetings with the Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson inquiries to discuss their financial forecasts under the terms of these documents;</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/18" class="indent">letting the inquiries make use of the Northern Ireland Office procurement division and have access to other procurement expertise in order to ensure that value for money is secured;</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/19" class="indent">setting maximum hourly fees levels for publicly funded counsel and solicitors;</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/20" class="indent">introducing a general 40 hour weekly cap on fees;</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/21" class="indent">ensuring representation by counsel is limited only to interested parties or key witnesses whose evidence is in dispute;</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/22" class="indent">making sure the scope of the legal work that may be undertaken at the public expense is circumscribed by the respective inquiry costs protocol and that all bills in respect of publicly funded legal assistance are subject to monthly scrutiny by the inquiry solicitor who is required to authorise disbursements in excess of &pound;100.</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/23">The chairmen of the Billy Wright inquiry and the Robert Hamill inquiry separately asked me to convert their statutory basis for their inquiries to the Inquiries Act 2005 under section 15 of that Act. One consequence of my decision to grant their request for conversion is that the framework for the award by the chairman of costs in relation to legal representation set out in section 40 of that Act applies, I know that both chairmen take seriously their responsibilities in this regard, and the provision in section 17(3) of the Act that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/24" class="indent">In making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry, the chairman must act with fairness and with regard also to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost (whether to public funds or to witnesses or others).</p>
	<p pid="b.1840W.8/25">In respect of the Billy Wright inquiry I have exercised my power on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 89-91WS, to make a notice of determination under section 40(4) of the Act and notified the House by means of a written statement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1845W.0/1">The Government are committed to reducing offending behaviour in Northern Ireland and has set the target of a 5 per cent. reduction in re-convictions (a proxy for re-offending) by 2008. A multi-agency Reconviction Monitoring Group and a Resettlement Multi-Agency Forum (established to oversee the roll-out of the supporting resettlement strategy) meet regularly to drive forward work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1845W.0/2">Initiatives being progressed by statutory and voluntary agencies to reduce re-offending include a drink-driving scheme targeted at disqualified drivers that has been demonstrated to reduce re-offending by 75 per cent., and novel and innovative mentoring and offender support schemes in the community. These projects and others like them complement work being done by the Probation Board and the Northern Ireland Prison Service as part of the regional re-settlement strategy. The inter-agency collaborative work on monitoring and managing risks associated with sex offenders on release from prison (MASRAM) is also important in reducing re-offending and protecting the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1845W.0/3">In addition Northern Ireland is represented on the national Inter Ministerial Group on Reducing Re-Offending and is setting up a local Inter Ministerial Group to further promote mutual and co-ordinated efforts to address offending behaviour within Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1848W.2/1">Responsibility for the Post Office is a reserved matter for the Department of Trade and Industry. However I and my ministerial colleagues and officials have participated fully in discussions over the future of the Post Office network to ensure that the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland were fully taken into account in DTI's considerations. The Department of Trade and Industry has now launched a consultation which includes proposals for new access criteria for the national Post Office network which will protect vulnerable consumers in deprived urban areas and rural and remote areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1848W.2/2">Government recognise the important role that rural schools play both in children's education and in the cohesion of rural communities. It is important that communities have access to strong viable schools which provide an excellent education for the pupils, and have the accommodation, equipment and range of teaching expertise needed to deliver a modern curriculum. This message comes through clearly in the recently published report on the independent Strategic Review of Education.</p>

	<p pid="b.1849W.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-19">19 December 2006</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="b.1849W.2/4" class="indent">(i) at account was taken of the implementation of (a) the Traffic Management Act in Scotland and (b) the implementation of a Scottish Road Works Commissioner, in drafting the Draft Street Works (Amendment) Northern Ireland) Order (110306;</p>

	<p pid="b.1849W.2/7" class="indent">(iv) whether the proposals for a draft Street Works (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order have been subject to a targeting social need assessment (110378); and</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/8" class="indent">(v) whether the proposals for a draft Street Works (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order have been reviewed by the Better Regulation Unit of the Department of Enterprise (112742)</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/9" class="indent">I understand Minister Cairns will be responding directly to you on PQ Reference 110308. I have been asked to reply to the other four PQs as the issues raised fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/10" class="indentitalic"> Traffic Management Act and Scottish Road Works Commissioner</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/11" class="indent">The Traffic Management Act 2004 (&quot;TMA&quot;) was introduced in England and Wales to update the existing legislation controlling street works&mdash;largely the works of utilities&mdash;in Great Britain (the New Road and Street Works Act 1991, or &quot;NRSW&quot;). The Scottish Executive, however, decided to introduce different arrangements for controlling street works in the Transport (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/12" class="indent">One of the key differences between the approaches taken in Scotland, and in England and Wales, is in relation to permit schemes. These, as introduced by the TMA, would require utilities to obtain permits for their works and would enable highway authorities to attach conditions to the permits so as to minimise congestion. The Scottish legislation makes no arrangements for permit schemes. However, the Minister is conscious of the frustration and disruption experienced by road users every day, which result from delays caused by utility street works. The decision was taken, therefore, that the power to operate a permit scheme is necessary, in order to facilitate better coordination and, thereby, minimise disruption caused to road users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/13" class="indent">Another key difference is in relation to traffic managers. Whereas the TMA makes provision for traffic managers to be appointed by highway authorities, who would be responsible for keeping traffic flowing on the road network, the Transport (Scotland) Act creates the office of the Scottish Roads Works Commissioner, responsible for overseeing works in roads in Scotland. The Department for Regional Development already has a duty to coordinate all works in roads in Northern Ireland and, in order to keep the number of interfaces to a minimum, we have developed a role for certain officials in Roads Service Traffic Sections across Northern Ireland, which is similar to the function of Traffic Managers created under the TMA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/14" class="indent">The Minister decided that, rather than follow the Scottish approach, the measures contained in the TMA were appropriate for introduction in Northern Ireland. The measures in the TMA may be tailored to suit the needs identified by a particular highway authority, whether in an urban or rural environment. The same measures could be adapted for use in Northern Ireland and the draft Order has been prepared accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/15" class="indentitalic"> Consultation with Political Parties</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/16" class="indent">The Department undertook consultation on three occasions in relation to the street works proposals. Between June and September 2005, a public consultation took place on the Department's street works policy proposals and, following careful consideration of all responses received, the then Minister, Shaun Woodward, decided that he would proceed to have the draft Order prepared.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/17" class="indent">The need to introduce legislation for an additional power to delegate some departmental street works functions to private sector road operators was subsequently identified. As a result, between February and April 2006, a consultation was carried out with interested parties on the supplementary proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/18" class="indent">Following the preparation of the proposal for a draft Order, the Department carried out public consultation on the draft regulation between June and September 2006. The Minister, David Cairns, having considered all responses to the consultation, concluded that no amendments were required and, with the agreement of the Secretary of State, the draft Order was laid at Westminster on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/19" class="indent">In terms of your specific query about consultation with political parties, the public consultations on the policy proposals and on the draft legislation were carried out in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. This included Northern Ireland parties and Northern Ireland MPs, MEPs, MLSs and members of the House of Lords. Indeed, during public consultation on the proposal for the draft Order, a very positive response was received from Councillor Margaret Ritchie your party's regional development spokesperson.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/20" class="indent">For all consultations that were carried out, the Department considered the responses received and issued a consultation report to respondents. The reports were also published on the Roads Service website, as were the comments submitted in response to the consultations. This material can be viewed at <a href="http://roadsni.gov.uk/consultation/consultation.htm">http://roadsni.gov.uk/consultation/consultation.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/21" class="indentitalic"> Targeting Social Need</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/22" class="indent">The draft Order is simply a framework of enabling legislation, which would allow the detailed arrangements to be developed in subordinate legislation. Consequently, the draft Order in itself has no implications on the new targeting social needs policy, although such implications will be considered as part of the procedure for preparing the regulations in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/23" class="indentitalic"> Better Regulation Unit of the Department of Enterprise</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/24" class="indent">You also asked whether the proposals had been reviewed by the Better Regulation Unit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Better Regulation Unit, like the Better Regulation Commission in Great Britain, considers only full regulatory impact assessments. In the case of the street works proposals, only a partial regulatory impact assessment has been carried out, based on the information that was available when we published the consultation document on the policy proposals for amending street works legislation in June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1849W.2/25" class="indent">We do not yet have sufficient information on the detailed proposals to carry out full regulatory impact assessments However, we will do so when details become available, as the street works regime in England and Wales in developed. Full regulatory impact assessments will also be carried out in relation to each set of regulations that will be made under the powers being introduced in the draft Order.</p>

	<p pid="b.1851W.2/2">A balance must be struck between the need to minimise congestion and delay on our roads, and introducing additional controls on utilities. Ministers are satisfied that the draft Order strikes the balance correctly and is necessary to address the disruption on the roads in Northern Ireland. For these reasons, it is intended that the draft Order should proceed as planned through the parliamentary stages. I remain hopeful that the draft Order will be made by the Privy Council in February 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1857W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December</phrase>, UniversitiesUK published proposals for national arrangements for the use of academic credit in higher education in England. The proposals derive from extensive consultation with the higher education sector and respond to a need for a more systematic approach to credit nationally that the Government highlighted in its 2003 White Paper &quot;The future of higher education&quot;. This is welcome progress and establishes a programme that will lead to English institutions voluntarily credit-rating their provision by 2009/10 and thereafter including the credit value in a published description of each of the programmes they offer. A more consistent, transparent approach to the use of credit will benefit learners by helping to establish better progression routes into and through higher education, especially as those routes become more varied and adaptable. The proposals also take account of developments in credit arrangements across Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.1863W.2/1">The proposal in Clause 19 of the Further Education and Training Bill emerged after informal discussions with a number of interested parties in the further and higher education sectors, following a recommendation by Andrew Foster in his report that the issue of foundation degree awarding powers for some further education colleges should be looked at. The proposal has also taken into account the challenges set by Lord Leitch in his recent report about the need to expand our higher level skills base. Since the publication of the Bill, we have written to a wide range of stakeholders and interested bodies to seek their views. We have made clear our commitment to working with partners in both the further and higher education sectors to make the proposals function effectively.

	<p pid="b.1864W.3/1">The Bergen Communiqu&eacute; of 2005 accepted the principle of Foundation Degrees within national systems by adopting an overarching framework for qualifications in the European Higher Education Area comprising three cycles. This includes, within national contexts, the possibility of short-cycle or intermediate HE qualifications (such as the Foundation Degree).</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.3/2">I should make it clear that allowing further education institutions to apply for the power to award Foundation Degrees will in no way alter or undermine the status of the Foundation Degree as a higher education qualification. Indeed, over three-quarters of all current Foundation Degree programmes are delivered through the FE sector. Any further education institution applying for the power to award Foundation Degrees will be subject to rigorous quality assurance assessments which will be of the same standard as those already in place for institutions seeking degree awarding powers. There is no question that the extension of Foundation Degree awarding powers to further education institutions will be allowed to have any negative impact on the status of that qualification, whether in the domestic or international context.</p>

	<p pid="b.1877W.6/5" class="indent">You asked what assessment the Secretary of State has made of the quality of Ofsted inspections; and how many inspections fell (a) below and (b) above the expected standard in the last period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1877W.6/6" class="indent">Ofsted published an evaluation report on the new arrangements for the inspection of maintained schools under section 5 of the Education Act 2005 on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-21">21 July 2006</phrase>. On the same date, it also published an interim report by NFER, which is undertaking an independent external evaluation of the impact of section 5 inspections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1877W.6/7" class="indent">The full titles and links to these reports are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1877W.6/10" class="indent">Ofsted works with its partners, the five Regional Inspection Service Providers (RISPs), to undertake inspections of maintained schools. Ofsted provides the frameworks, instruments and guidance used by all inspectors when conducting inspections, and arranges training for Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI). The RISPs and NISPs recruit, train, deploy and manage additional inspectors (AIs); they are responsible for ensuring that they are fit and proper persons who conduct inspections and write reports to the high standards required by Ofsted. HMI visit a proportion of the inspections conducted by AIs and, as required by the 2005 Act, 'sign off' new AIs when they conduct inspections for the first time. All inspection reports are scrutinised by HMI and 'signed off' as fit for publication in HMCI's name. In exceptional circumstances, if an inspection or report is found to be seriously flawed, Ofsted has the power to declare it void and to arrange a new inspection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1877W.6/11" class="indent">The most recent data about the quality of Ofsted inspections of maintained schools is for November 2006. In this month, there were 1,069 section 5 inspections of maintained schools. Quality assurance visits were made by Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI) to 69 of these (about 6.5 per cent.). On none of these was it necessary for HMI to intervene in the process of inspection. During the month, 34 new AIs were presented for assessment by HMI and all were 'signed off'. Eight complaints about section 5 inspections were fully or partially upheld during the month.13 reports were not 'signed off' by HMI and required significant amendment before publication.</p>

	<p pid="b.1879W.6/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1879W.6/2"><i> (a)</i> The Department has only entered into one public private partnership (PPP) agreement, in July 2001, which was with Capita Business Services Ltd. for management and delivery of the Connexions Card. The PPP Agreement budget was &pound;108.8 million (originally &pound;109.7 million) for the period September 2001 to December 2008. However, the Department announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June 2006</phrase> that the Connexions Card scheme was to close early. The PPP Agreement was terminated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-05">5 August 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1879W.6/3">Ownership of Departmental assets was not transferred to Capita. The public sector comparator calculation made at the time showed that the cost of the Connexions Card PPP was likely to be in the mid range of estimated costs of a comparable traditional procurement. But this was not the key factor in deciding to use a PPP; more important was the ability of a partner organisation to manage, develop and implement complex smart card technology and also have commercial expertise to negotiate rewards and discounts associated with the Connexions Card.</p>
	<p pid="b.1879W.6/4"><i> (b)</i> The Department itself has not entered into any private finance initiative contracts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1904W.0/1">Because an understanding of the physics and chemistry of matter and processes at the nanoscale is relevant to all scientific disciplines, a wide variety of research activities could be deemed to embrace nanoscience and nanotechnologies to some extent. Thus it is not possible to accurately identify all Government funding in this area in the last five years. But to date funding of around &pound;13 million has been allocated for research to address the potential risks posed by engineered nanoscale materials and the social and economic implications of nanotechnologies. To help industry maximise the potential benefits of nanotechnologies, between 2001 and 2006 this Department committed at least &pound;49 million on applied research projects that are relevant to industry and &pound;45 million on support for research infrastructure. The Research Councils have provided substantial funding for nanoscience and nanotechnology. For example, they provided &pound;19.8 million for an Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration on Nanotechnology to operate between 2002 and 2007 and between 2001 and 2005 relevant expenditure by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council alone amounted to over &pound;160 million in research grants with additional support for around 200 new PhD studentships.</p>

These plans are revised every two years. The current Corporate Plans cover the period 2005-08. The Corporate Plan outlines how each RDA will deploy resources to meet the objectives and targets set in the Plan. Progress made in delivering against Corporate Plan commitments is then monitored by the RDA Board and reported publicly every six months on each RDA's website. A report on progress made in delivering against the Tasking Framework core output targets set in Corporate Plans is laid in the House every six months.</p>

The Guidance requires the RDA to measure the effectiveness of each grant made. The contract between the RDA and the applicant should include provision for effective monitoring of delivery and evaluation of the results. It should focus on the critical success factors, which were identified at the appraisal stage, and its conclusions should assess whether these were met and the outcomes and outputs delivered. Normally evaluation will occur at a period after project closure when the impact can be assessed, usually six months after closure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1914W.8/1">The Department provides information on a range of substances including anabolic steroids, particularly highlighting the risks of their use, in publications such as &quot;Dangerousness of Drugs&mdash;a Guide to the Risks and Harms Associated with Substance Misuse, 2003&quot;. In addition, the FRANK campaign, which is a joint initiative from Department and the Home Office and supported by the Department for Education and Skills, aims to inform young people and their parents, carers and families about the effects and risks of taking illicit drugs, including anabolic steroids and amphetamines. FRANK also gives people advice, support and provides details of appropriate drug services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1914W.8/2">The Department has no current plans to educate young people on the misuse of pseudophendrine in its own right. However, pseudophendrine is listed as a controlled precursor under European legislation, is a precursor of methylamphetamine and is used in its illicit and licit manufacture. The risks and harms associated with the use of methylamphetamine, commonly known by its street name of crystal meth, are also included in &quot;Dangerousness of Drugs&quot; and included on FRANK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1920W.11/1">The decision was based on the duty to ensure the most cost effective way of distributing information on keeping warm and well in cold weather and to seek value for money for the tax payer. Only a very small percentage of calls were about health matters, and the line was acting as a signposting service to other services as half of all callers were referred on to other helplines such as the warm front scheme and the winter fuel payments helpline. In addition, since the start of Keep Warm, Keep Well, other health information services such as NHS Direct have become established. In 2005-06 only 16,000 calls were received by the Keep Warm, Keep Well helpline at a cost of&pound;11 per call, despite promotion of the helpline number. In contrast we distributed over two million information booklets, at a cost of 15p per booklet. The cost savings were around &pound;175,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1920W.11/2">It is too early to assess the impact on vulnerable groups of closing the line. However, resources have been devoted to extending the reach of the information materials by working through stakeholders and gaining coverage of the campaign messages in the media. To date 2.5 million campaign items have been ordered or distributed by our stakeholders. The campaign has promoted the other helplines, and callers to the Keep Warm, Keep Well former number will be signposted to these other helplines. Additionally, other campaigning activities, i.e. linking winter warmth messages with the Department's flu campaign target vulnerable populations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1924W.2/1">Avoidable Deaths is a product of the Centre for Suicide Prevention at the University of Manchester. The centre has been commissioned by the National Patient Safety Agency to investigate suicides, homicides and sudden unexplained deaths in mental health services and make recommendations on how they might be prevented. I understand from the director of the National Confidential Inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness (Professor Louis Appleby) that while the inquiry team have not taken into account this particular resolution of the European Parliament, they have paid utmost attention to presenting their findings appropriately. Based on empirical analysis of the available data on homicides by people with mental illness, the report concludes that community care has not increased the risk to the general public.</p>

The PHOs publish a very wide range of material. It is estimated that, nationally, they produce some 200-300 publications per year, including the indications series on public health in the English regions. In addition, some 350 local authority based profiles are also produced per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.2/4">A great deal of output from PHOs comes through individual requests, e.g. from primary care trusts and strategic health authorities, including production of data packs, electronic downloadable tools, CD/DVD ROMs etc. PHOs also produce regular articles for publication in professional journals such as the <i> Health Service Journal</i>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1940W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-12">12 December 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/2">The Department operates a number of policies that will inevitably support rural areas, but it is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to determine local services in consultation with local people and other health and social care professionals. All new departmental policies are rural-proofed in liaison with colleagues in the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Some examples of these policies are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/3" class="italic"> Community hospitals and services programme</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/4">Through the community hospitals and services programme, &pound;750 million worth of capital funding is available over the next five years, to fund the provision of community hospitals and services, with up to&pound;150 million worth of capital funding available in 2007-08. Whilst funding is not specifically targeted at rural areas, it is inevitable, because of the nature of community hospitals, that some of this funding will fund services in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/5" class="italic"> Mental health</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/6">The needs of those living in rural communities are set out in the mental health national service framework (NSF), published in 1999, feature particularly in reports on progress to implement the strategy to reduce the rate of death by suicide. The NSF is a 10-year programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/7">The Department operates a number of activities, which affect the problems of rural stress as part of a wider programme of action to tackle mental illness and promote good mental health in rural areas, these include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/8" class="indent">suicide prevention (the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) programme);</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/9" class="indent">research commissioned on suicide amongst farmers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/10" class="indent">a policy on reviewing all PCT local development plans and agreeing flexibility around fidelity to the prescribed service model for (Public Service Agreement) targeted teams in rural areas, e.g. Cumbria;</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/11" class="indent">NIMHE Social Inclusion Programme;</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/12" class="indent">rural proofing the mental health national service framework;</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/13" class="indent">membership of the rural services action plan (a representative from NIMHE on the rural services working group); and</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/14" class="indent">section 64 grants to voluntary and charitable organisations supporting schemes to</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/15" class="indent">establish a network of support available to people in rural communities who are suffering from stress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/16">The Government are committed to ensuring that mental health services are more accessible to service users 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We have established a number of key access points including NHS Direct where a specialist mental health team has been established which, through training and supporting nurse advisors, enables the provision of 24 hour service across the country. This is particularly valuable to people living in isolated areas. We have also established over 700 new mental health teams working in the community (i.e. assertive outreach, early intervention, crisis resolution teams) which have improved access to mental health services around the clock.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/17" class="italic"> Primary Medical Care</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/18">PCTs are now consistently reporting that almost all patients, including those in rural areas, have the opportunity to be seen by a general practitioner within two working days, or by a primary care professional within one working day in line with the NHS plan target for fast access.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/19" class="italic"> Funding</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/20">Allocations to PCTs are made on the basis of a fair funding formula, which directs funding to those areas of greatest need. It is for PCTs to determine how to use the funding allocated to them to commission services to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/21">The allocation formula used in the 2006-08 allocations provides the best available measure of health need in all areas. In calculating health need in rural areas, it takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/22">The 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations represent &pound;135 billion investment in the NHS,&pound;64 billion to PCTs in 2006-07 and &pound;70 billion in 2007-08. Over the two years covered by this allocation, PCTs will receive an average increase of 19.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1940W.2/23">The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation will be considering the question of how best to take account of rural issues within the funding formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.1941W.5/1">In recognition of the overall financial situation in 2006-07, the Department issued the education and training budget as part of a bundle of central budgets to strategic health authorities (SHAs) at the end of July. The bundle included money to fund workforce programmes, the quality and outcomes framework, clinical excellence awards, as well as other miscellaneous programmes at a level higher than in 2005-6. Within the overall resources allocated, this approach has provided the SHAs with the maximum flexibility to determine their own local priorities, including how much is invested in education and training. It would not therefore have been possible for the Secretary of State to assess in advance what those decisions would be.</p>

	<p pid="b.1946W.5/1">The criteria for awarding civil servants within the Home Office a bonus payment on top of their regular salary is based upon the achievement of individual work objectives. An annual performance appraisal assessment is made by the line manager or supervisor. If this assessment concludes that the objectives have been exceeded and overall performance is exceptional, then a performance bonus payment is awarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/2">The Home Office also has a recognition bonus scheme. Bonus payments recognise outstanding achievement or individual contribution. Line managers may recommend individuals for these at any time of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/3">Other types of bonus payments awarded to civil servants within the Home Office include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/4" class="indent">A corporate bonus scheme within the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). The criteria for the level of payments made are based upon the achievement of centrally set targets. These targets aim to incentivise employees to achieve stretching service standards, while operating within reducing budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/5" class="indent">A change bonus scheme also operates within the IPS to incentivise managers to deliver the IPS's change programme. Performance against targets is assessed by line management, countersigning officers and a moderating committee chaired by the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/6" class="indent">As part of the 2002 Treasury Spending Review process, the Prison Service agreed to implement a benchmarking programme through which all prison establishments would be assessed over a 7-year period. This programme introduced additional recognition and reward processes for the best prisons within the public sector. High performing status is an annual award that recognises excellent performance through which a sum is made available for staff recognition. This can take the form of bonus payments to staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/7">The criteria for awarding Senior Civil Servants within the Home Office with bonus payments is set by the Prime Minister following independent advice from the Senior Salaries Review Body. The level of bonus payment takes into account a number of factors including individual performance against agreed priority business objectives and targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1954W.2/1">A new internal grievance procedure was introduced in January 2005 which is compliant with the Employment Act 2002 (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2004. All staff and managers have access to the procedures. The operation of this new policy in the central Home Office and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate was reviewed in 2006. Before following the formal procedure, employees are required to attempt to resolve any grievances informally. The Home Office has a number of trained mediators who can act as an impartial third party to help members of staff reach agreement. Additional support and guidance for those handling grievances is provided by HR units.</p>

	<p pid="b.1955W.0/1">Complaints made by a member of Home Office staff about another member of staff are dealt with under the internal Home Office grievance procedures, which are modelled on the provisions of the Employment Act 2002 (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2004. Complaints raised by members of staff in the Prison Service are dealt with under the procedures set out in Prison Service Order 8550 - Staff Grievance procedure. Complaints about the Permanent Secretary would be referred to the Cabinet Office. Complaints about those not directly employed by the Home Office would generally be referred to their employing organisation.</p>

All investigations are carried out in accordance with Home Office guidance and procedures. A member of staff who is the subject of an investigation can seek the support of their trade union, staff support groups and the health and welfare services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1955W.0/4">Written complaints from members of the public are allocated to the appropriate unit in the central Home Office and the Prison Service and dealt with accordingly. If a member of public is dissatisfied with the handling of their complaint they can raise the case with the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

	<p pid="b.1962W.8/1">Individual support orders (ISOs) were introduced in May 2004 and courts are obliged to consider making one when making a stand alone antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) on a 10 to 17-year-old. We provided 500,000 to Youth Justice Board (YJB) in June 2005 to fund ISOs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1980W.5/3">This covered individual vehicle immobilisers operating on private land where wheel-clamping is not governed by the Road Traffic Act 1991, as this was the scope defined by the 2001 Act.

The Home Office is keeping the situation under review and will be formally assessing the effectiveness of this licensing work in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.1988W.5/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is the matter for the chief executive. He will write to the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply form the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions:-</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/5" class="indent">what his estimate is of the amount of Child Support Agency outstanding unpaid maintenance arrears for each quarter since 1993 broken down into (a) collectable (b) possibly uncollectable (c) deferred and (d) probably uncollectable; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/6" class="indent">what the total uncollected Child Support Agency arrears were for each year since 1993 broken down by quarter; how much of the amount is assessed as (a) uncollectable and (b) collectable; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/7" class="indent">This information is presented in the attached table, showing the total Agency debt form 1994-95 to 2005-06. The figures shown below are in respect of maintenance and include arrears and current maintenance scheduled. It is not possible to break this down into quarters as the collectability analysis is done on an annual basis only.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/8" class="indent">Please note that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/9" class="indent">i) Each year a proportion of the debt is classified as probably uncollectable, recognising the fact that the Agency is unlikely to collect this debt and a provision is made in the accounts for this amount. A change in accounting practice in 2005/06 meant that the Agency made a provision for a proportion of possibly uncollectable debt as well as probably uncollectable debt. The accounts for 2004/05 have been re-stated on this basis, please refer to 2005/06 Annual Report and Accounts. Therefore the possibly uncollectable figures for 2004/05 and 2005/06 are based upon the provision in the accounts only, hence the increase in collectable debt in these years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/10" class="indent">ii) The Annual Report and Accounts for previous years were re-stated in 1997-98, due to a change in accounting policy in reporting collectability of the debt. The re-stated figures have been shown.</p>
	<p pid="b.1988W.5/11" class="indent">iii) The Agency did not publish audited account in 1993-94, therefore no figures are shown for this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1990W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many uncleared Child Support Agency applications there have been in each month since May 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.5/5" class="indent">The attached table shows the number of uncleared applications at points in time between May 1999 and September 2006. It also provides a definition of what clearance means. For the period prior to May 1999, reliable management information on uncleared applications is not currently available. It should be noted that monthly data is only available from March 2003 and, for the period prior to this, only quarterly data can be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.5/6" class="indent">The information provided in the table can be derived by combining information from Table 1 and Table 2.1 of the September 2006 Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_sep06.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_ sep06.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.5/7" class="indent">Although the total volume of uncleared applications, 247,500 in September 2006, is the lowest since comparable records began, the Agency recognises that this remains unacceptably high. Therefore, the Agency has a 2006/07 target to ensure that, by March 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25 per cent and our challenge, as set down in our Operational Improvement Plan, is that the Agency should not have a backlog by March 2009. I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

They avoid the duplication of payments of social security contributions and most make provisions for uprating of UK pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1993W.6/3">The last reciprocal agreement is over 25 years old. There are a number of factors, for example, the numbers of people moving between the UK and the other country, the benefits available under the other country's scheme and the compatibility of the social security systems, which determine whether a reciprocal social security agreement is entered into with another country. There are therefore no set criteria.</p>

This is, as we have always made clear, the gross cost, taking no account of any possible savings from a reduction in the payment of income-related benefits or any possible increase in tax income. The length of time over which payments would be made make it difficult to estimate what the cost would be after these adjustments, as this would depend on the income distribution of people affected, the tax brackets they are in and their benefit entitlements.</p>

	<p pid="b.2001W.2/1">Our reforms to state pensions will ensure that by 2050 the vast majority of pensioners will have income from both the basic state pension and state second pension, with pensioners receiving on average around &pound;130 per week in state pension. This means most people will have a higher foundation on which to save than a full basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.2001W.2/2">We estimate that around 30 per cent. of pensioner households will be eligible to pension credit in 2050 under the reforms proposed in the Pensions Bill, compared to around 80 per cent. without reform. Furthermore, only around 6 per cent. of pensioner households will be eligible to just the Guarantee element of pension credit and therefore face a pound for pound withdrawal rate. Most of these will either have no private savings or very small amounts. Those with savings pots below &pound;15,000 may take advantage of the trivial commutation rules and take their savings as a taxable lump sum.</p>
	<p pid="b.2001W.2/3">We recently published detailed analysis on the incentives to save in personal accounts, Financial incentives to save for retirement. This shows that the vast majority of people can expect to benefit in retirement from saving in a personal account. For example, even someone receiving the savings credit in 2050, and no other benefits, could expect a payback of &pound;2 for every &pound;1 saved due to a minimum employer contribution and tax relief plus investment growth.</p>

	<p pid="b.2001W.2/5" class="indent">1. Projections of pension credit entitlement based on the current system assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard minimum guarantee; continued price uprating of the savings credit threshold; and continued price uprating of the basic state pension. Earnings uprating of the standard minimum guarantee was an agreed policy until 2008 and will continue beyond that date as part of our stated pension reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.2001W.2/6" class="indent">2.
