	<p pid=".1281W.7/1">Estimates that were published in March 2005 show that the UK is on course to meet its Kyoto protocol commitment to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, by 12.5 per cent. Below base level years by 2008&ndash;12. The data released in March also indicates that, even without the further action currently being considered under the review of the UK Climate Change Programme, the UK will be about 20 per cent. below base year levels in 2010. This is a significant achievement.</p>
	<p pid=".1281W.7/2">The UK have set itself an ambitious domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Our most recent projections show that, on the basis of existing policies, emissions of carbon dioxide will fall by about 13 per cent. below the 1990 level by 2010. We therefore recognise that more needs to be done. Our review of the UK Climate Change Programme is examining how existing policies are performing and is considering additional measures that we could implement to put the UK back on track to achieving the domestic goal. The outcome of this review will be announced before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".1281W.7/3">Many of the means by which emissions can be reduced have been devolved to the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations, but the UK Government maintain overall responsibility for the Kyoto target and for ensuring that a programme is put in place for delivering it. The devolution legislation do contain powers that could be used to bind the administrations to the UK's international target but the Government do not propose to use these powers because it is confident that significant reductions can be, and are being, delivered through working in partnership.</p>
	<p pid=".1281W.7/4">The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are also committed to the UK's domestic carbon dioxide goal. The nature of the 20 per cent. goal is different, in that it is not a legally binding target, and the UK Government and the administrations aim to achieve it through a balanced, partnership approach rather than through a set of quantified, contributions from the different parts of the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".1285W.2/1">The UK Government are concerned about the loss of rainforest habitats, and we are working with rainforest countries to promote sustainable development around the world. We recognise the efforts of Brazilian and other Governments to address the problems in the Amazon region and are working together to promote sustainable forest management and the implementation of policies on the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".1285W.2/2">To that end, Defra is working closely in conjunction on this issue with the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office.</p>
	<p pid=".1285W.2/3">The UK Government are involved with a number of initiatives. In Brazil the Government have contributed &pound;14 million to the multi-donor pilot programme for the preservation of Brazilian rain forests. In addition the UK is a major contributor to the global environment facility (GEF) that is creating and maintaining protected areas in the region through the Amazon region protected areas programme. The managers of the GEF have approved or endorsed funding for 29 projects in Brazil, with a value of approximately &pound;150 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1285W.2/4">The UK continues to support projects in the Amazon through multilateral organisations, including the European Commission and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".1285W.2/5">The UK Government also recognises the role that trade can play in promoting sustainable rainforest management. Within the EU Britain is taking a leading role in championing an action plan on forest law enforcement, Governance and trade, which is aimed at combating illegal logging and international trade in illegally harvested timber. And since 1976 Britain has been a signatory to the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p>

	<p pid=".1292W.9/2">The Government provides funding for concessionary fares through the Revenue Support Grant system.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.9/3">Concessionary fares is one of the services covered in the district-level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services Formula Spending Share formula. This formula looks at the relative need to spend by authorities on all services covered by the formula. It is not possible to disaggregate this formula.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.9/4">Formula Spending Shares are neither the Government's assessment of how much an authority should spend on a particular service nor are they grant. Instead they are simply the formulae used to derive the amount of Formula Grant (i.e. Revenue Support Grant, Redistributed Business Rates and Police Grant, where appropriate).</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.9/5">Formula Grant supports authorities over a wide-range of services. It is not intended to entirely support any of those services as authorities can also raise income from council taxes. It is therefore not possible to work out how much grant an authority received with respect to concessionary fares.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.9/6">Details of the 2005&ndash;06 calculations of formula grant are already available in the Library of the House.</p>

The new system was introduced at Lincoln Combined Court on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-11">11 April 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid=".1300W.0/1">The Immigration Appeals Tribunal (IAT) developed a system of country guidance cases to facilitate consistent decision making. This enabled the IAT to issue guidance cases on the circumstances and risks to certain groups in particular countries following a detailed assessment of the available country information. The IAT (and now Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT)) nominates leader cases which contain issues consistently seen by Tribunal judiciary. These lead to other cases being identified as containing very similar issues to that of the leader case&mdash;known as follower cases&mdash;which are heard and determined once the leader case has been promulgated. The number of leader cases currently awaiting determination has caused some delays in listing the follower cases for hearing. There has been some further delay due to the commencement of the AIT on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>, created by a merger of the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) and the IAT. The leader cases, which number approximately 100, are expected to be listed to be heard substantively in September and October of this year, and once these have been determined the follower cases, approximately 300 in number, will then be listed for hearing as soon as is practicable.</p>

	<p pid=".1303W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1303W.2/2">The Community Justice Centre will not be fully operational until September. The court is currently hearing cases in a courtroom of Liverpool magistrates court and the daily running costs are approximately the same as for the other courtrooms. The average cost of a magistrate's courthouse per day is &pound;4,382 and a courtroom is &pound;111 (figures for 2003&ndash;04). The cost of providing the multi agency problem solving team is &pound;666 per day. The cost of this team is not currently borne by a mainstream magistrates court, as the function is performed to some extent elsewhere and is accounted for by the CJS agencies (eg Probation, YOTs).</p>
	<p pid=".1303W.2/3">The evaluation will compare the resources that are being used in the existing CJS agencies dealing with one courtroom with the cost of those based within the centre. The effectiveness of the existing CJS agencies framework against the joint approach of the centre will be measured in their outcomes. An example of this would be a reduction in antisocial behaviour or the number of young people getting involved in crime. The evaluation will also measure qualitative benefits such as the level of victim and witness satisfaction.</p>

	<p pid=".1306W.0/1">The research into remote electronic voting is primarily conducted through pilots under S. 10 of the Representation of the People Act 2000. There have been 27 e-voting pilots in 2002 and 2003 and these were all evaluated by The Electoral Commission which reported on each of the pilots and also published a strategic evaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.0/2">In addition to piloting, research has been jointly commissioned by the Government and key stakeholders investigating the issues surrounding the implementation of electronic voting in the UK. This research was published in May 2002.</p>

These specialists are primarily employed to provide engineering and construction support on deployed operations where the operational conditions would preclude the use of commercial operators. It is possible that these engineers may be employed on construction projects for the armed forces, for instance in the UK, but only when it is sensible and cost-effective to do so and the training experience accrued will directly benefit their role on operations. Otherwise, the skills and expertise of the commercial sector is employed, allowing the armed forces to concentrate on military tasks.</p>

	<p pid=".1317W.6/1">We have been working with the Home Office to identify areas where the identity cards scheme could provide business benefits. Our assessment has indicated that the proposal for the introduction of identity cards would benefit the Ministry of Defence by aiding the identification of individuals who have a relationship with the Department, but are not direct employees. Examples include potential new recruits, past employees, members of the reserve forces, job applicants, visitors and contractors. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library of the House a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. The Ministry of Defence is in dialogue with the Home Office and we will judge the impact on our IT systems as details of the scheme emerge. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1320W.6/1">It is not the policy of the Ministry of Defence to 'mothball' sites against undefined future defence uses.

There are currently no sites in this category.</p>
	<p pid=".1320W.6/2">All possible alternate defence requirements will be considered for a site before it is declared surplus. Once declared surplus a site will be disposed of as quickly as possible to ensure it is bought back into productive use at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid=".1323W.2/2">I am now clarifying the information provided.</p>
	<p pid=".1323W.2/3">The answer I gave stated that officers received a tax-free allowance to enable them to maintain their uniform and dress. It has now come to my attention that officers in fact receive an annual tax-credit, known as &quot;income tax relief for maintenance of uniform&quot;, rather than an allowance as such. This means that a certain proportion of their salary is not subject to income tax. For dismounted male officers below the rank of colonel, and therefore all personnel belonging to those regiments identified in your original question, this annual rate amounts to &pound;589.29 of earnings against which income tax is not paid.</p>

Among the international financial institutions, the World Bank and the regional development banks play the lead role in addressing climate change through policy advice and through their financing operations. At the G8 pre-Summit Finance Ministers' meeting, chaired by the Chancellor, Finance Ministers called on the World Bank and multilateral development banks (MDBs) to increase dialogue with their major borrowers on energy issues and put forward specific proposals at their annual meetings in September that encourage cost-effective investments in lower carbon infrastructure. Building on this, World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz will co-chair a meeting in September with the UK as G8 presidency on the financing workstream within the 'Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development', which was launched at Gleneagles. In addition, the Bank and MDBs will also take forward work with others to create a new framework for mobilising investment in clean energy. The UK will work with the institutions to ensure that these initiatives are taken forward effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".1329W.2/1">Under the G8 debt agreement 100 per cent. stock cancellation will be delivered by relieving post-completion point HIPCs that are on track with their programmes of repayment obligations. 18 completion point heavily indebted poor countries will become eligible for multilateral debt relief once the G8 debt agreement is approved by the boards of the World bank, IMF and African development bank, 14 of these countries are in Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). A further nine countries are expected to become eligible over the next two years as they reach completion point of the HIPC initiative, all of these are in Africa (Cameroon, Chad, DRC, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe). A further 11 countries are pre-decision point in the HIPC initiative, but would also become eligible when they reach completion point. Of these 11, nine are in Africa (Burundi, CAR, Comoros, Congo, Cote D'ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan and Togo),</p>
	<p pid=".1329W.2/2">It is essential that the resources freed up by debt relief are used to support poverty reduction. For this reason, the G8 debt agreement provides debt relief only to those countries that have demonstrated their commitment to reducing poverty through implementing a successful poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). The countries that qualify for the G8 debt agreement will have reached completion point of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative and have demonstrated their commitment to poverty reduction and sound financial management.</p>
	<p pid=".1329W.2/3">Under the G8 initiative, non HIPC sub-Saharan African countries do not receive multilateral debt relief. However, the UK's continuing bilateral policy of paying the debt service from loans for the AfDB and IDA is open to all low-income countries that are eligible only for concessional IDA lending and are following policies of sound public expenditure management.</p>

In line with Section 9 of that Act, all export licence applications are assessed against the consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, which require specific consideration under Criterion 7 of the 'existence of a risk that the equipment will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions'. When making our licensing assessment we take full account of the equipment's potential end-use and destination as well as the stated end-use and destination.</p>

	<p pid=".1338W.3/1">The Government's assessment of the remaining lifespan of global oil reserves is set out in the Energy White Paper 2003 &quot;Our energy future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy&quot; (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml</a>). Paragraph 6.15 of the White Paper notes that</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;Globally, conventional oil reserves are sufficient to meet projected demand for around 30 years, although new discoveries will be needed to renew reserves. Together with non-conventional reserves such as oil shales and improvements in technology, there is the potential for oil reserves to last twice as long&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/3">This is consistent with the latest assessment by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its 2004 World Energy Outlook. The IEA concludes that</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;. . . global production of conventional oil will not peak before 2030 if the necessary investments are made.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/5">The Government remain committed to working with producers, consumers and the international community to improve the conditions for investment in the international oil sector, as well as implementing policies to maximise the economic recovery of the UK's own oil (and gas) reserves and to ease the UK economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuel supply. We are also supporting efforts to promote greater transparency in reporting of global oil reserves.</p>

	<p pid=".1340W.11/1">239 small-scale (i.e. with a capacity below 5MW) hydro generators accounted for 184MW of installed generation capacity at the end of 2004. It is not clear how much of this capacity is exported to the distribution network, rather than consumed by the generator, as the number will change on a daily basis according to the level of demand by the generator themselves and the total electricity generated on a given day.</p>

The quality of the reports is verified by trained medical auditors using a defined audit process of statistically valid sample cases. In addition, an independent Medical Reference Panel undertake a quality review, each month, on a number of completed medical reports. Members of the Medical Reference Panel are jointly appointed by the Department and the Claimants' Solicitor Group. Finally, a clerical audit is completed on every medical report. These quality assurance and verification processes safeguard both the claimant and the Department but the claimant also has redress through a disputes procedure.</p>

	<p pid=".1348W.5/1">The part of the Patents Act 2004 relating to post-grant amendment is one of several provisions which will bring UK patents legislation into line with the revised European Patent Convention (&quot;EPC&quot;). All such provisions will be brought into force at the same time as the revised EPC itself comes into force, which is desirable in order to maintain consistency between the UK and European patents systems. It is uncertain exactly when this will be, because the revised EPC takes effect 2 years after the 15th state has ratified or acceded, or (if earlier) three months after the final state has ratified or acceded. At present I understand that 14 states have done so, and therefore that the revised EPC, and the corresponding provisions in the 2004 Act, are very unlikely to take effect until mid-2007 at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid=".1348W.11/1">The decision to allow all new and refurbished hydro plant under 20 MW to be eligible for renewables obligation certificates (ROCS) was made after the Renewables Obligation Preliminary Consultation, published October 2000 and was included within paragraph 2.17 of the Renewables Obligation Statutory Consultation, published August 2001 as:</p>
	<p pid=".1348W.11/2" class="indent">&quot;The majority of responses to the preliminary consultation supported the exclusion of large scale hydro stations, which were constructed under public ownership. However, concern was expressed by the industry over the age of current stations and the need to refurbish them, and there has also been concern that some potential new developments could not proceed without support. We therefore propose to exclude existing stations with a declared net capacity (DNC) of over 20MW from the Obligation, but to include any station first commissioned after the date of the Order is made, regardless of capacity. We believe that these measures will encourage the refurbishment of existing stations of up to 20MW and will support any future scheme if planning permission can be secured&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".1349W.2/2">Responsibility for approving a transmission charging methodology rests with the independent regulator, Ofgem. Ofgem approved National Grid Company's proposed methodology in February 2005, following extensive consultation with the industry, and a consideration of the environmental impacts of the proposals. The Department commissioned independent consultants to investigate the impact of transmission charges on renewable generation in Scotland. Their report will be published later this summer, alongside the Government's proposals for adjusting transmission charges for renewable generators in a specified area of the North of Scotland.</p>

An export licence would only be required if the goods were exported from the UK, and a trade licence would only be required for the transfer of the goods between third countries if there were some UK involvement, as defined in the relevant legislation.

This core element of the DTI's Efficiency Programme offers a new and radical approach to workspace utilisation and will allow the Department to reduce its accommodation by approximately 30 per cent. Starting in 1 Victoria Street, the accommodation is being remodelled as part of a wider change programme to support team based desking in a flexible, open plan working environment on the basis of providing on average eight desks for every 10 people to be accommodated. This has enabled us to increase the capacity of our main HQ building from 1,680 under the original, traditional approach to approximately 2,400 now and to release other buildings on the estate for reuse or disposal. This highly successful change programme will now be applied to the rest of our London accommodation.</p>

	<p pid=".1354W.6/1">The WEEE Directive requires that retailers provide free take-back of WEEE they collect in-store. The Government are developing its implementation planning for the Directive in order to offer retailers several options for how they can take back the household WEEE they collect.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.6/2">The Government obtained flexibility for UK retailers to discharge their obligations under the WEEE Directive. Retailers will have a choice to comply either by (i) offering take-back services in-store to consumers; or (ii) by showing membership of an approved compliance scheme which will support an alternative national network of facilities for separate collection of household WEEE. This flexibility enables retailers to provide alternatives to the in-store take back provision set out in the Directive. In addition, the Government announced in March this year that it would delay implementation of the Directive to January 2006. The course the Government have taken will provide cost savings to retailers compared to the estimates from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) of &pound;200-&pound;500 million per annum for in-store take back. Ultimately the costs to retailers will depend on the retailer's choice of compliance and the volume of WEEE returned to them. The Government are proposing to implement the WEEE Directive with as little disruption as possible to current retailer practices, while achieving the environmental aims of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.6/3">The Government have had extensive discussions with many retailers on implementation of the Directive. It has encouraged the BRC to develop proposals for a retail compliance scheme to provide a national collection network, including funding upgrades to civic amenity sites' facilities for separate collection of WEEE. The BRC has proposed a fund for a retail compliance scheme of some &pound;8.2 million over the three years to 2008 to upgrade all civic amenity sites in the UK, including funds to maintain the infrastructure over the same period.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.6/4">Where retailers choose to comply with their obligation by offering in-store take back services, they will be expected to do this on a &quot;one-to-one&quot; basis, as the Directive requires.

	<p pid=".1355W.2/2">The WEEE Directive requires that retailers provide free take-back of WEEE they collect in-store. The Government are developing its implementation planning for the Directive in order to offer retailers several options for how they can take back the household WEEE they collect.</p>
	<p pid=".1355W.2/3">The Government obtained flexibility for UK retailers to discharge their obligations under the WEEE Directive. Retailers will have a choice to comply either by (i) offering take-back services in-store to consumers; or (ii) by showing membership of an approved compliance scheme which will support an alternative national network of facilities for separate collection of household WEEE. This flexibility enables retailers to provide alternatives to the in-store take back provision set out in the Directive. In addition, the Government announced in March this year that it would delay implementation of the Directive to January 2006. The course the Government have taken will provide cost savings to retailers compared to the estimates from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) of &pound;200-&pound;500 million per annum for in-store take back. Ultimately the costs to retailers will depend on the retailer's choice of compliance and the volume of WEEE returned to them. The Government are proposing to implement the WEEE Directive with as little disruption as possible to current retailer practises, while achieving the environmental aims of the Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".1360W.9/1">Specific data on infant mortality (first year of life) are unreliable given the lack of effective vital statistics systems. Data collection is further compromised by the fact that about half of the women in developing countries deliver at home, without links to the health system. However, data is much more robust on deaths of children under 5 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1360W.9/2">Each year, 11 million children under 5 years die of acute respiratory infections (19 per cent.); diarrhoea (18 per cent.); malaria (8 per cent.) measles (4 per cent.). However, 40 per cent. of all deaths in children under 5 years occur within the first 28 days.</p>
	<p pid=".1360W.9/3">Three quarters of these, 4 million neonatal deaths, occur within the first week of life. Three main causes are severe infections (26 per cent.) (including sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis); premature births (28 per cent.) and birth asphyxia (23 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".1360W.9/4">&quot;Making every mother and child count&quot; (The World Health Organisation 2005), provides costs for the provision of skilled attendants, support with the instruction of breastfeeding, vaccinations, combating diarrhoea, pneumonia, sepsis and malaria, as well as prevention and care for HIV. The report identifies a set of costings with differing assumptions and scenarios for the 75 countries that together account for almost 95 per cent. of global child deaths (refer to <a href="http://www.who.int/whr">www.who.int/whr</a>). The costing of saving a child's life differs by country and there is no global figure available.</p>
	<p pid=".1360W.9/5">Underlying causes of these child deaths include poverty, with malnutrition and lack of clean water accounting for at least half of the mortality. Weak health systems that cannot ensure access to reproductive health services, including skilled attendants at birth, impact on child health outcomes&mdash;we know that babies born to mothers who die in childbirth are unlikely to survive their first year. Poor health and nutrition of adolescent girls has significant long-term effects on their health and the survival of their newborns.</p>

	<p pid=".1362W.2/1">The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the largest UN provider of reproductive health assistance to developing countries and countries in transition. It is an influential advocate for gender equality, women's empowerment and sexual and reproductive health and rights. In 2003, the UK was the fourth largest provider of core resources. For 2004&ndash;07 the UK has committed &pound;80 million in core funding.</p>
	<p pid=".1362W.2/2">UK assistance for sexual and reproductive health anywhere in the world is provided in support of the principles of free and informed choice set out at the International Conference on Population Development in Cairo in 1994, and re-affirmed through various international fora since. These principles reject coercion in matters relating to childbearing and reproduction and support the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is important that this work should continue and that all people be given access to modern services, and the chance to choose their family size. Apart from DFID providing core funding to the UNFPA globally, we are not providing direct or targeted support for family planning in China.</p>
	<p pid=".1362W.2/3">The UNFPA works in China to support change and reform. The programme is making a full range of client-oriented reproductive health services available in 32 counties on a voluntary basis. Birth targets and quotas have been abolished and abortion and sterilisation rates and maternal mortality have all dropped significantly in UNFPA counties. These findings were produced by independent research carried out by the University of Southampton and the China Population Information and Research Centre and paid for by DFID China. The UNFPA's programme in China will continue to promote reform and the adoption of a programme based on principles of voluntary choice and rights.</p>

There is nothing in the Licensing Act 2003 or the guidance that we issued under section 182 of the Act or the associated regulations that prevents a ward councillor from sitting on a licensing sub-committee considering representations in respect of premises in his or her own ward. However, like all of us who have been elected to public office, councillors do have to promote and maintain high standards of conduct, ethics and propriety. Any advice that councillors receive on this issue would come from their own internal advisers and standards committees. The advice will generally be identical to that which applies to all committees carrying out local authority functions. Ultimately, the decision as to whether any councillor should disqualify himself or herself from participation in any individual case would be a matter for him or her. Such decisions would normally be subject to scrutiny by the local authority's standards committee.</p>

	<p pid=".1374W.6/1">The proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery is a serious threat to international peace and security, in the Middle East and elsewhere. Following an agreement reached in Paris in November 2004, the UK, France and Germany, supported by the EU High Representative, have been in discussion with Iran about long term arrangements for its nuclear programme. These should provide objective guarantees that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. The new Iranian President elect, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has said the talks will go on. We remain fully committed to the Paris agreement. We continue to honour our commitments, and expect Iran to do likewise.</p>

There has been some co-operation between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority, but there have only been limited agreements so far, e.g. to demolish settler housing inappropriate for the Palestinian population. While this is positive, it is essential that the two sides step up their co-ordination in the coming weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".1375W.5/1">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Government cut the daily food ration in January so that it now constitutes approximately half the daily energy requirement. Two thirds of the DPRK population remain dependent on this public distribution system. The World Food Programme (WFP) aims to provide food aid for 6.5 million people it considers to be in need. This is roughly a quarter of the population. There have been a number of breaks in the supply of food aid, due mainly to fluctuating support from major donors. WFP has not managed to assess the impact of these breaks. Because of DPRK Government restrictions on information sharing, it is difficult to be certain of data on the food situation. As far as we are aware, the WFP has no plans to suspend its food aid operations in the DPRK.</p>

The closure was due to difficulties with nurse staffing levels associated with compassionate leave, maternity leave and sick absences.</p>
	<p pid=".1378W.6/2">The same group of nursing staff work in both the intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency unit (HDU) and when there is a higher than usual demand for ICU beds, nurses are redeployed from HDU to ICU. Given the unpredictability of the demand for ICU beds, the situation is monitored by the trust on a day-by-day basis.</p>

	<p pid=".1380W.8/1">There are two ways in which asbestos is legally managed. One is by disposal to a landfill site with a dedicated cell which receives only asbestos waste. The other is by contained storage in waste transfer stations where asbestos is kept until it can be transported to Great Britain for disposal in landfill in an economically viable manner.</p>
	<p pid=".1380W.8/2">Asbestos can also be illegally disposed of by depositing on unlicensed sites or mixing it with other wastes to disguise its appearance.</p>
	<p pid=".1380W.8/3">Currently three facilities in Northern Ireland are licensed to receive asbestos. These relate to one landfill site (which is currently completing engineering works before asbestos can be received) and two waste transfer stations. The landfill site was issued with a licence on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-04">4 January 2005</phrase> while the waste transfer stations were licensed on <phrase class="date" code="1984-09-03">3 September 1984</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-19">19 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1380W.8/4">The Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment is investigating a small number of isolated incidents of illegal dumping of asbestos. It is difficult to quantify how prevalent this problem is as the activity is clandestine and disposal locations are not obvious. However, at present illegal disposal of asbestos on a commercial scale does not appear to be a serious problem in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".1381W.9/1">Insurance is a reserved matter. However, the issue of the level of insurance premiums for businesses in Northern Ireland has been raised regularly with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment by a variety of private sector interests over the past few years. A working group made up of representatives from DETI, the business sector and the insurance industry, has closely monitored the on-going situation and a guide offering practical advice to businesses on purchasing insurance cover has been widely distributed.</p>
	<p pid=".1381W.9/2">DETI has also introduced an annual insurance survey. The results of the last survey revealed an improving picture as a result of a general softening in the market. The survey results are available on the DETI website <a href="http://www.detini.gov.uk">www.detini.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".1392W.2/1">The otorhinolarynology service provided by Sperrin Lakeland Trust includes ENT services and is currently based at Tyrone county hospital (TCH). In-patient and day case services are delivered from TCH with out-patient services delivered from both the Erne and Tyrone county hospitals. The service also provides cover to Cavan/Monaghan hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".1392W.2/2">The vast majority of otorhinolarynology procedures are performed on a day case basis and the future model for these services envisages that TCH will continue to provide both out-patient and day case services. These services will operate as part of a larger, area-wide network for the provision of otorhinolarynology services with in-patient services provided at the most appropriate acute hospital within the network. Such a network will greatly enhance the potential to recruit staff to local services and will ensure that patients are seen by the right person in the right place as quickly as possible.</p>

Cost effectiveness is one of the indicators we expect that PwC will analyse as the five year study progresses, but it is important to note that academies are funded at the same level as other schools. Their recurrent funding is calculated on the same basis as other local schools and their capital costs are calculated using the same benchmarks as for other new schools.</p>

	<p pid=".1400W.3/1">The number of looked-after children who are the subject of a care order made by the family courts has increased from 36,400 on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March 2000</phrase> to 39,400 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/2">Before 2000, information was not collected centrally for the costs of looked-after children. We estimate that, in February 2000, the total weekly cost of looked-after children in England was &pound;25 million, or &pound;435 a child, and in February 2003 the total weekly cost was &pound;36.5 million, or &pound;585 a child. (Information derived from the Children in Need Censuses.) Thus, the increases in the costs faced by local authorities in looking after children who have been taken into care arise as a consequence of both the increased number of children who have become the subject of care orders and the increases in the costs experienced by local authorities in caring for them.</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/3">Information is not collected centrally on the detailed reasons for the making of care orders by the family courts. However, section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 provides that:</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/5" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; and</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/6" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/7" class="indent">(i) the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him; or</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/8" class="indent">(ii) the child's being beyond parental control.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/9">Thus, all children who are taken into care by means of the making of a care order will have been considered by the court to have met these criteria, following the making of applications to the courts by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1400W.3/10">In the Command Paper, &quot;A Fairer deal for Legal Aid&quot; (Cm 6591), published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July 2005</phrase>, the Government announced a review of child care proceedings in England and Wales. The review will include work to identify innovative practice which enables children to be diverted away from court proceedings and, instead, be supported in their families where this is possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1403W.2/1">Since the Government initiated the quality protects programme in 1998, the promotion of placement stability for looked-after children has been an important aspect of our programme. Data on the number of children who move three times in one year has been collected since that time. This data indicates that the percentage of children looked-after at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> each year who had three or more placements in one year had declined from 16 per cent. to 13 per cent. between 1998 and 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1403W.2/2">Although the Government have not issued specific guidance solely concerned with placement stability, since 1998, all relevant publications relating to looked after-children, such as materials issued as part of the Choice Protects programme, which is intended to improve the availability and quality of foster care and local authority placement commissioning, and the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters (2003)&quot;, have emphasised the importance of placement stability, in order that looked-after children are enabled to secure the same outcomes as all other children</p>
	<p pid=".1403W.2/3">As part of the current DfES programme to support the delivery of our revised PSA target with the Treasury to improve placement stability, we are developing further strands of work, in order to analyse and promote good practice in delivering placement stability for looked after children.</p>

	<p pid=".1405W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June 2005</phrase> that there will be an independent review of best practice in the teaching of early reading, including the role of synthetic phonics. The review is being led by Jim Rose, the former Director of Inspection at Ofsted. It is independent from, and is not being conducted by, the Government's Primary National Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/2">Jim Rose has invited a group of advisers, with considerable experience as practitioners and researchers in this field, including early years expertise, to provide him with advice on conducting his review. The group will consist of the following members:</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/3" class="indent">Professor Greg Brooks, University of Sheffield</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/4" class="indent">Professor Morag Stuart, Institute of Education</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/5" class="indent">Professor Pam Sammons, University of Nottingham</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/6" class="indent">Professor Kathy Sylva, University of Oxford</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/7" class="indent">HMI Janet Brennan</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/8">In addition to the specialist phonics advice that Janet Brennan will provide Ofsted will also be contributing to Mr. Rose's review by HMI Tim Key providing information from Ofsted's inspection data.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.0/9">In making his recommendations Mr. Rose will draw on his advisers' expertise, and he will also examine academic research and best practice for using synthetic phonics in reading in primary schools and early years settings. He will seek views from a broad range of individuals and organisations that represent the interests of those sectors, as well as examining recent reports on reading by the Education and Skills Select Committee, Ofsted, the study in Clackmannanshire local authority in Scotland and other evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".1405W.6/1">The discretionary fee waiver scheme for part-time students ran from 1998/99 to 2003&ndash;04. In 2004/05 for the first time non-repayable grants were introduced for part-time students: a fee grant of up to &pound;575 (to replace the fee waiver), and a non-repayable course grant of up to &pound;250. Transitional protection was put in place for continuing students who had received a fee waiver in 2003/04.</p>
	<p pid=".1405W.6/2">The support available to part-time students is being further improved for 2005/06: the maximum fee grant is being increased to &pound;885; the income threshold below which students can get both the fee and course grants is also being increased; and the amount of fee support the student receives will, in future, be linked to the intensity of their study. The grants are means-tested in order to target funding most effectively at those on the lowest incomes.</p>

	<p pid=".1406W.2/1">Over the last 12 months, Ministers and officials have met regularly with representatives from higher education institutions with high proportions of part-time undergraduate students to discuss a range of issues, including the changes to the student funding system which will be introduced in 2006&ndash;07. Ministers have listened to concerns raised by institutions and are considering the most effective means of using available funding to support part-time undergraduate provision. This includes an ongoing consideration of the merits of fee deferral in light of a deepening understanding of the diverse part-time student body.</p>
	<p pid=".1406W.2/2">To understand better the part-time undergraduate student body, the Department for Education and Skills commissioned Alan Woodley from the Open University's Institute of Educational Technology to survey part-time students. The report &quot;Earning, learning and paying: the results from a national survey of the costs and financing of part-time students in higher education&quot; was published in November 2004. Additionally, part-time undergraduates are included within the scope of the 2004/05 &quot;Student Income and Expenditure Survey&quot; (SIES). The SIES is due for publication early in 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1406W.2/3">The Woodley survey confirmed the heterogeneity of the part-time undergraduate student body and that the barriers which individuals may face to participation are, by no means, uniform. Notably, 65 per cent. of part-time undergraduates are in full-time employment with a further 18 per cent. in part-time employment. Moreover, 36 per cent. of part-time undergraduate students have all their fees paid by an employer. Consequently, any consideration of the merits of fee deferral for part-timers must address the financial resources available to individual students and the likelihood of replacing existing employer support.</p>
	<p pid=".1406W.2/4">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has considered representations from institutions for special funding in response to concerns about the impact of variable fees on large scale providers of part-time undergraduate higher education. The Council announced its findings on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase>. These included a commitment to develop a widening participation measure, from the 2006/07 academic year, designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged students will continue to be able to study on a part-time basis. Details of the measure will be confirmed by the HEFCE board in the autumn. No representations have been received from the Office for Fair Access with regard to part-time undergraduate provision.</p>

	<p pid=".1407W.2/1">This information is not part of the Department's statutory annual data collection. However, research carried out for the DfES in 2002/03 showed that 44 per cent. of schools teaching pupils aged 7&ndash;11 offered some form of language learning, 35 per cent. of which took place in curriculum time. This is up from 21 per cent. of schools offering some form of language learning in 2000, and we expect that number will have increased again significantly last year. Our research showed that French is the language most commonly taught, followed by Spanish, German and Italian. 28 LEAs reported other languages being taught. We know from our Key Stage 2 language pathfinders that a wide range of languages are now being taught at primary schools, including community and other world languages.</p>

The DfES also continues to assist the MOD in its work on raising awareness and knowledge of veterans in society by helping educational organisations to prepare resources and facilities suitable for schools. This was particularly important for the build up to the 60th anniversary, as the DfES helped to co-ordinate and promote information and to advise on delivery.</p>

	<p pid=".1422W.3/1">Arranging provision for children with special educational needs (SEN) is a matter for schools and local education authorities (LEAS), within the framework set out in the Education Act 1996 and taking account of statutory guidance, such as the SEN Code of Practice. That framework and guidance sets out a graduated approach to meeting children's SEN, including, where necessary, a process for the assessment of children's SEN and the drawing up of SEN statements. Admission to special schools, including those for children with moderate learning difficulties, is through the school being 'named' on the statement, other than in exceptional circumstances, such as where a child is admitted for the purposes of an assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".1422W.3/2">When a statement is being drawn up or the description of a child's educational needs on a statement and the provision to meet those needs is being amended, parents can ask for the school of their choice, mainstream or special, to be named. The LEA must consider the parents' preference carefully and whether the school is suitable for the child's needs and whether placing the child there is compatible with the education of other children at the school and the efficient use of resources. If the LEA does not name the parents' preferred school, the parents can appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal, whose decisions are binding on LEAs.</p>
	<p pid=".1422W.3/3">The provision made for children with moderate and severe learning difficulties, and the funding for it in the case of those with statements, should be decided upon individually. However, it is open to LEAs to have general SEN funding arrangements, as long as they are prepared to vary those arrangements in individual cases. In May 2004 the Department published guidance on &quot;The management of SEN expenditure&quot; which recommended that changes to funding arrangements should be consulted on widely. However, precise arrangements in each local authority area are matters for the relevant LEA.</p>

	<p pid=".1430W.8/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has already published a range of guidance on these two areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/2">ODPM is committed to working closely with the Home Office and the Housing Corporation, as part of the 'TOGETHER' campaign to support social landlords and other relevant practitioners in tackling antisocial behaviour by way of balanced approaches involving prevention, support and enforcement. This includes providing material aimed at social landlords on the Together website, access to a helpline (the Together hotline) and the Together Academy (a centre of excellence in tackling all aspects of ASB).</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/3">Guidance produced is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> In April 2004, ODPM published guidance &quot;Achieving positive shared outcomes in health and homelessness&quot;, jointly with the Department of Health, to local authorities, PCTs and other health providers on key positive outcomes which health and housing partnerships might work towards, including improving mental health treatment and preventing homelessness through targeted health support.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/5" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> &quot;Action on Mental Health&quot; was published by ODPM in October 2004 as a follow up to the Mental Health and Social Exclusion report published in June 2004. The pack contains a number of factsheets aimed at both service users and service providers and gives guidance to promoting social inclusion for adults who are affected by mental health problems. The factsheet on housing gives information on ensuring appropriate housing allocations, enabling someone to keep their home and preventing and addressing homeless for this vulnerable group.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/6" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> In March 2005, ODPM published guidance on &quot;Accommodation and support options for people with mental health problems&quot;. This was primarily aimed at local authority Supporting People officers and local service commissioners, but will also be of assistance to landlords in understanding the needs and support options of tenants.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/7">The Housing Corporation's Regulatory Code and guidance sets out the fundamental obligations and expectations of registered social landlords. In July 2004 the corporation published circular &quot;Tenancy Management: Eligibility and Evictions&quot; which provides guidance on RSLs working with local authorities and other agencies to arrange appropriate support, so that it is available at the beginning of a tenancy, to those individuals whose assessments indicate vulnerability for whatever reason.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.8/8">In August 2004 the corporation published circular &quot;Statutory Housing Management Guidance on Anti-social Behaviour Policies and Procedures&quot; which sets out the corporation's expectations of RSLs' compliance with section 12 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 and how compliance will be assessed. In addition the corporation has published statutory guidance on the prevention of antisocial behaviour including measures such as mediation services, uniformed warden patrols and reward schemes for tenants with a record of a well conducted tenancy.</p>

Because they are mobile property, boats are 'chattels' rather than buildings or structures. This means they are outside planning control unless one is moored for so long in the same place that it can be regarded as bringing about a material change of use of land.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be explaining the new arrangements in more detail to RSLs, in general terms via guidance from the Housing Corporation and through specific bidding guidance on the next bidding round. This guidance will include an explanation of arrangements for monitoring the progress of schemes.

	<p pid=".1437W.6/1">The following table provides details of actual revenue grant payments made by the Homelessness and Housing Support Directorate to local authorities in London. It also shows the full revenue allocations, as some payments are subject to authorities submitting outstanding supporting documentation.</p>
	<p pid=".1437W.6/2">Funding provided by the Directorate has supported action to successfully reduce rough sleeping by more than 70 per cent. since 1998, end the use of B&amp;B hotels as long-term accommodation for families with children, and develop homelessness strategies and preventative approaches which have resulted in the first sustained fall in new cases of homelessness for nearly a decade. Homelessness acceptances dropped by 20 per cent. in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1437W.6/3">The National Audit Office have estimated that, by achieving reductions in the use of B&amp;B hotels for families, local authorities nationally have achieved annual savings of up to &pound;50 million. London authorities were generally the highest users of B&amp;B accommodation so will have accrued significant savings.</p>
	<p pid=".1437W.6/4">In addition to providing revenue grants the Directorate has also, since 2004&ndash;05, provided capital funding to authorities and also provides grants to voluntary sector agencies providing services across more than one borough. Capital funding to London authorities was &pound;10.8 million in 2004&ndash;05 and is increasing to &pound;14.9 million in 2005&ndash;06.

	<p pid=".1446W.8/1">Park land is protected by the provisions of national planning policy guidance note 17 (PPG 17). This requires planning authorities to protect from development all forms of open space, including parks, unless they are demonstrated to be surplus to the requirements of the community. There are no current plans to change this guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.8/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not hold central records of the amount of all park land disposed of by local authorities. We are however committed to developing a national database of green spaces in England, which will help us to identify the location, quantity and changes to green spaces.</p>

	<p pid=".1447W.2/2">This explains that local authorities parking standards should result in an average of 1.5 off-street parking spaces per dwelling over their plan area. The 1.5 is intended to be an average across the plan area. Planning policy does not expect all dwellings in new developments to have 1.5 car parking spaces.</p>
	<p pid=".1447W.2/3">The Government accepts that parking needs vary, according to location and housing type. To help the development of appropriate standards, research has been commissioned to consider how varying levels of car parking can be achieved in ways consistent with the Government's policies on sustainable residential environments. This research will inform the preparation of the Planning Policy Statement 3: &quot;Housing&quot;, a draft of which will be the subject of consultation later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1452W.9/2">For cultural and/or religious reasons, some women are less likely to accept invitations for screening than the general population as a whole. Language and access to acceptable and meaningful information can also be a significant barrier and can effect the coverage levels.</p>
	<p pid=".1452W.9/3">The national informed choice leaflet, &quot;Breast Screening: The Facts&quot;, which is sent out with every invitation for screening, has now been translated into 18 languages.</p>
	<p pid=".1452W.9/4">In December 2003, NHS Cancer Screening Programmes published &quot;Inequalities of Access to Cancer Screening: A Literature Review&quot;. The recommendations in the review have been sent to all local screening programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1452W.9/5">A number of local actions have been put in place to combat inequalities in inner-city areas. For example, in Haringey, sessions on screening have been held in community centres, with advocates from the relevant communities attending to translate and encourage women to attend their screening appointment. Many primary care trusts are conducting similar initiatives across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1452W.9/6">In 2004, to raise awareness about the availability of breast cancer screening, the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes issued a regional communications pack to all local breast screening programmes to increase coverage rates, the packs include advice on raising the awareness of screening and posters.</p>

The Department does not hold details of whether dental clinics in south Devon received funds from the dental care development fund. Health authorities imposed conditions on the grant: that the additional capacity was maintained, usually for three years; and that the practices in receipt of funds contributed around 50 per cent. of the total value of the grant.</p>
	<p pid=".1457W.2/3">The Department made &pound;50 million available to strategic health authorities to buy back local dental capacity from dentists in 2004&ndash;05. Of this, &pound;1.56 million was made available to the South West Peninsula Strategic Health Authority, who allocated &pound;242,000 to the primary care trusts covering south Devon: Torbay (&pound;149,000); and south Hams and west Devon (&pound;93,000). The amounts of money allocated to individual dental clinics is not held by the Department. The grant was intended to support NHS practice, but no specific conditions regarding continuing to practice in the NHS were attached to the moneys.</p>

These dentists are known to be more committed to the NHS; hence, the effect of their leaving the GDS pool is to reduce the average GDS payments for those who remained at the end of 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".1460W.8/1">During an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment cycle more than one embryo needs to be created if the patient is to have a realistic chance of having a child at the end of the treatment. This is because not all the embryos developed will be of sufficient quality to give the patient a chance of becoming pregnant. Additionally, where good quality embryos are available, only two will be transferred to the patient to limit the risk of a multiple pregnancy. Spare embryos are not automatically allowed to perish as the patient has the option of either storing them for future treatment or donating them for use in the treatment of others or research.</p>

	<p pid=".1461W.11/1">Food irradiation falls into the Food Standards Agency's (FSA) area of responsibility. I am advised by the FSA that all European Union countries permit the irradiation of food, subject to their irradiation facilities obtaining approval from their national competent authority. Although irradiated food is permitted in all EU countries, it does not follow that there are approved food irradiation facilities in each member state. An up-to-date list of approved food irradiation facilities in EU member states is available at: <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/approved_facilities_en.pdf">http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/approved_facilities_en.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.11/2">Dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings are currently the only foods that can be irradiated in, and traded freely between, all EU countries. A number of EU countries also permit other categories of food to be irradiated. However, up-to-date information on all the permitted foods in the different member states is not held centrally. In practice, not all permitted foods are in fact irradiated as this depends on the existence of an approved facility for the irradiation of each foodstuff. The European Commission provides annual reports on all food irradiated in practice each year at EU facilities. The most recent information currently available is for the year 2002 at <a href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/rpt/2004/com2004_0069en01.pdf">http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/rpt/2004/com2004_0069 en01.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.11/3">Irradiated foods imported into the EU from non-EU countries must have been irradiated at facilities approved by the European Union. There are currently five approved facilities outside the EU, three in South Africa, one in Turkey and one in Switzerland. Decisions on the approval of food irradiation facilities in non-EU countries are based on the results of inspections performed by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission. FVO inspection reports are published at <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/inspections/fi/reports/index_en.html">http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/inspections/fi/reports/index_en.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1461W.11/4">All food imported from non-EU countries is subject to food safety controls carried out on the basis of risk assessment by local food authorities at the point of entry into the United Kingdom. As regards irradiated food, food products that do not comply with the Food (Control of Irradiation) Regulations 1990 (as amended) can be refused entry or destroyed.</p>

	<p pid=".1464W.11/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1464W.11/18">1. Expenditure has been taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.</p>
	<p pid=".1464W.11/19">2. Figures for 1997&ndash;98 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services. In 2001&ndash;02, there was a high degree of inter authority transactions, which have increased the apparent expenditure per head.</p>
	<p pid=".1464W.11/20">3. In many HAs there are factors, which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".1464W.11/21">the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid=".1464W.11/22">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs or PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".1464W.11/23">4. The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies, therefore the total expenditure in the answer by health authority does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.</p>

	<p pid=".1477W.2/1">Information from police recorded data for the years 1999 to 2004 is contained in the tables.</p>
	<p pid=".1477W.2/2">Chorley is a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) area. The most recent available information relates to 2003&ndash;04. Data for the period up to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> will be included in the forthcoming publication &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2004&ndash;05&quot; which will be available on the Home Office website and in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1477W.2/3">In terms of violent crime, much of the rise in violence against the person which is shown in the tables can be accounted for by changes to the way the police define and record certain offences. Police recorded crime data are subject to changes in police recording practices, including those relating to national Counting Rules and recording standards. The Counting Rules changes in 1998 had a very significant impact on violent crime, across England and Wales the numbers of such crimes recorded by the police increased by 83 per cent. in the first year of using the new rules. The National Crime Recording Standard, introduced in April 2002, again resulted in increased recording of violent crimes, particularly for less serious violent offences. In addition, increased police activity can have an impact on how many offences are recorded, because, in such circumstances, police officers may encounter and record incidents that may not previously have been reported or recorded.</p>
	<p pid=".1477W.2/4">In comparison, British Crime Survey data, widely regarded as the most authoritative view of violent crime, shows considerable reductions in violent crime across England and Wales since 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".1481W.8/2">The time it takes to reach a decision depends both on individual circumstances and on the number of cases in the consideration process. Sometimes people do not complete the Family ILR Exercise Questionnaire properly, or fail to provide the documentation requested. The checks we conduct on potentially eligible applicants can also take some time to complete, depending on individual circumstances. We also encounter a number of complex cases that can take some time to resolve.</p>
	<p pid=".1481W.8/3">The main factor, though, which makes providing a meaningful completion date for the exercise difficult, is the substantial number of cases we still have to consider. In addition, we continue to receive a number of applications for the scheme, each of which requires careful assessment. We are hoping to have completed consideration of the majority of cases by the end of April 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".1487W.2/1">Persons living in the UK illegally may have entered the UK unlawfully, either clandestinely or by deploying deception, or may have entered the UK legally and remained beyond any permitted permission to remain. The methods and routes used to enter the country are varied and change in response to a number of factors, including the impact of new security measures.</p>
	<p pid=".1487W.2/2">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate routinely monitors the trends and changes to methods of illegal entry into the UK. These assessments are used to inform policy and operational initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".1487W.2/3">Many of those entering the UK use the services of criminal groups to provide documentation, transport and to provide assistance once here. Under Reflex, the Government's multi-agency taskforce to combat organised immigration crime, intelligence assessments of the routes and methods used to enter the United Kingdom are regularly updated and are used to direct targeted operations against the criminal gangs involved.</p>
	<p pid=".1487W.2/4">The main route for clandestine entry to the UK has been through the South East ports while those entering by air often use false documents and take circuitous routings. A number of successful countermeasures have been introduced to combat these routes such as the introduction of juxtaposed controls, enhanced freight searching, deployment of overseas officers, the development of risk assessment units at key visa posts overseas and regular alerts to front-line staff on developments in document abuse.</p>

	<p pid=".1491W.5/1">The estimated cost of the Passport Service's Authentication by Interview (ABI) scheme in its year of introduction is aggregated within the total estimated unit cost of &pound;67.93 for 2006&ndash;07, published within the Corporate and Business Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.5/2">The ABI initiative is intended both to deter and to detect fraudulent applications among first time applicants but its business case has been constructed on its potential deterrent effect, for which evidence exists. UKPS data sampling have identified the first time adult channel as accounting for 74 percent. of all fraudulent applications, although this group accounts for less than 10 percent. of all applications processed annually by the Agency. ABI closes the loophole that currently exists in the postal application system by bringing together the physical applicant, and current biographical information, to ensure they are one and the same. A fraudster will now be faced with having to act out their false identity, and risk a real possibility of detection. There have been a number of instances in the past where the requirement to attend for interview would have enabled UKPS to identify a fraudulent application and prevent the issue of a passport in a false identity.</p>
	<p pid=".1491W.5/3">The savings the scheme is designed to deliver are in deterring fraudulent applications passport applications and thus contributing to the overall fight against identity fraud.</p>

The F213SH is used in all prisons, both male and female. The form is designed to be user-friendly and to enable the manageable and consistent collection of standardised, accurate information.

The heightened risk is associated with the fact that the majority of remand prisoners are in the early phases of imprisonment. Remand prisoners, as compared to sentenced prisoners, have also been shown to have higher rates of a number of risk factors that we know increase the likelihood of self-harm, such as mental disorder, substance dependence, previous self-harm and previous abuse (Singleton et al, 1998).</p>

	<p pid=".1503W.2/1">The number of apparently self-inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales, July 2004&ndash;June 2005 is provided in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".1503W.2/2">Reducing the number of such tragic incidents is a key priority, and an unprecedented amount of work is being done in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".1503W.2/3">The number of apparently self-inflicted deaths fluctuates. The four deaths in April and May this year represent the lowest in a two month period since 1992. Sadly, sometimes there are also apparent 'clusters' of self-inflicted deaths, such as the 16 deaths in June. Each death will be the subject of a coroner's inquest and a thorough investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman. The Prison Service and contracted prisons will be looking to see if there are any early lessons to learn and act on.</p>

National health service primary care trusts are now responsible for commissioning the primary health care services at all but three of the publicly-run prison establishments in England. By April 2006, that responsibility will be fully devolved to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.8/3">Prison doctors were advised in 1995 that they should make condoms available to individual prisoners, on application if, in their clinical judgment, there was a risk of the transmission of HIV infection during sexual activity. The Prison Service expects shortly to issue revised guidance and instructions aimed at clarifying its policy on condom provision and ensuring that it is applied more consistently across the estate.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.8/4">All prisoners undergo a health screening on first reception to identify those who have immediate health needs, or who are at a high risk of having a significant health problem. This, or other harm minimisation or health promotion resources, may result in individual prisoners requesting an appointment with a sexual health service, which may lead to testing, and associated pre-and post-test discussion, for blood borne viruses.</p>

	<p pid=".1507W.2/2">The National Probation Service (NPS) seeks at all times to retain the right profile of staff to deliver a high standard of service and to meet a stringent set of performance targets. The latest available figures for turnover of operational staff in the probation service in England and Wales are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>The latest available figures for turnover of operational staff in the probation service in England and Wales </caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/6"> <th>Grade</th> <th>Percentage</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/9"> <td>SPO</td> <td>6.30</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/10"> <td>SP</td> <td>3.14</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/11"> <td>PO</td> <td>7.07</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/12"> <td>TPO</td> <td>4.88</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/13"> <td>PSO</td> <td>9.47</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1507W.2/14"> <td>Ops Total</td> <td>7.60</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".1507W.2/17">These figures are based on leavers in 2004&ndash;05 financial year who have left the service as a whole. For the same period the turnover rate for non-operational staff was 13.55 percent. The annual average turnover rate based on these figures is 10.06 percent. This figure is significantly better than the national average for the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.2/18">As part of the service's strategy for building and maintaining an excellent, fit for purpose organisation, we are investing in our people by developing and supporting staff, building and refreshing their motivation and skills. This is being achieved in a number of ways including: designing and implementing new policies on pay, reward and conditions of service, work/life balance policies including flexible working; investment in leadership, management, training and development: and the development of a national workload measurement tool. These and other initiatives are designed, in part, to maintain a balanced workforce and make the NPS an employer of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.2/19">However a small number of staff will always leave an organisation because their circumstances change or because they want to develop a career elsewhere. For staff committed to a career in the probation service we hope that that the measures outlined above will provide rewarding working environment.</p>
