	<p pid="b.725W.3/1">Since 2004 the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has commissioned an annual suite of complementary surveys to measure attitudes towards (and awareness of) health and safety at work. In 2009, these surveys targeted three distinct groups: employees, workplace health and safety managers and chief executive officers or senior directors of medium and large businesses and public sector bodies. The latter two surveys include questions that measure attitudes towards health and safety requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.3/2">I have arranged for a copy of the 2009 survey report to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.3/3">In addition to the annual monitoring of attitudes towards health and safety through this survey programme, ad-hoc evaluation studies may also capture attitudes towards specific health and safety legislation of particular groups at a fixed point in time.</p>

	<p pid="b.753W.2/1">The Treasury produces regular estimates of the average cost of answering a written parliamentary question. The estimated figure was last updated to &#163;154 in January 2010 and Parliament was notified in a written statement issued by the former Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-20">20 January 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-01-20.15"><i> Official Report</i>, column 15WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.2/2">Estimating the exact costs of producing individual PQ answers is very difficult, although it is fair to say that in the case of most of the above questions the average cost has almost certainly been exceeded, and in a few cases may be approaching the upper disproportionate cost threshold limit of &#163;800. All of these questions requested a large amount of factual information, none of which was stored centrally and thus required a coordinated information gathering exercise across the Law Officers Departments.</p>

	<p pid="b.756W.5/2">The National Lottery etc. Act 1993 established four good causes: arts, sport, national heritage and charitable expenditure which each received 20% of lottery proceeds. In addition to the four good causes a further 20% was assigned to projects to mark the year 2000 and the beginning of the third millennium. This ceased to receive income from the national lottery in 2001.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made clear in his written ministerial statement that we have taken action to provide the flexibility needed to allow local authorities the freedom to make their own decisions about where savings are found without impacting on essential frontline services. We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount individual authorities lose. The impact on their area of the reductions in grants this year will be for local authorities to decide.</p>

	<p pid="b.772W.2/1">When health and local authority commissioners are planning services to meet the mental health needs of children and young people locally they will want to consider the right way to engage with schools so as to get the best possible services to children and families. Schools are also able to use their own budgets to provide services to meet the needs of their pupils, including services to support pupil's emotional wellbeing and mental health.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.2/2">The national Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme was developed to test the effectiveness of evidence-based mental health support in schools for children, young people, and their families. Schools delivering TaMHS commission a range of service procured from voluntary (as well as statutory) sector providers to meet the particular needs of their pupils (e.g. counselling support for children struggling to cope following family breakdown or bereavement). For specialist mental health support for more severe problems, schools may wish to refer pupils to local specialist CAMHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.2/3">The learning from TaMHS on effective commissioning of emotional wellbeing and mental health support and joint working with CAMHS is being shared across schools this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.2/4">While programmes such as TaMHS have been testing what works in developing school based mental health support, any decision about whether to commission these services remains at the school's discretion.</p>

Reports from unannounced visits are not automatically published as they may contain sensitive information which could identify the complainant or the identity of members of staff or pupils. Any failures identified would be followed up with the school and if the inspection confirmed there were serious failures, a full inspection would take place leading to a published report.</p>

	<p pid="b.774W.2/7">Some analysis has been carried out for 2007/08 on the number of excluded pupil enrolments, as shown in the table. A pupil's SEN status can change between periods of exclusion; therefore data relating to the SEN status of excluded pupil enrolments has been based on their SEN status at the time of their most recent fixed period or permanent exclusion. To carry out this analysis for further years would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.777W.8/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) will publish its business plan for reproductive, maternal and newborn health by the end of 2010. It seeks to increase women's ability to choose when, and how often, they have a child, and to increase the survival of women and babies during pregnancy and childbirth. This will have a significant positive impact on families, economies and societies, as well the health and empowerment of women themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.777W.8/2">The plan will clearly acknowledge the links between maternal health and child health. Nearly 40% of deaths of children under five occur in the first month of life, up to 45% in the first 24-hours. Preventing unintended pregnancies and ensuring pregnancy and child birth is safe for all mothers and babies make a vital contribution to child health. Recent DFID-supported evidence from Bangladesh shows that a child who has lost their mother has a significantly lower chance of surviving to 10 years old.</p>

The National Cancer Action Team continues to work with cancer networks to support implementation of the guidance across the country by the end of December 2010, but it is possible that a minority of networks will not be in a position to commence activity in this area until early 2011.</p>

GPs have also been given guidance on how to record the status of veterans on their information systems. We are proceeding with plans to improve information systems so that, in future, when military personnel leave the armed forces, they will be provided with information on their entitlement to treatment in the national health service, including priority treatment. Once these are in place, military personnel will be encouraged before they leave the service to fill out a GP registration form which asks whether or not the patient registering is a veteran. The form will then be sent direct to the new GP or given to the veteran to present on registration.</p>

	<p pid="b.795W.8/1">The UK has an established and robust regulatory framework that ensures the nuclear industry effectively manages the risks associated with the operation of civil nuclear installations and facilities. As a result of this approach the probability of a beyond-design basis accident is considered to be exceedingly small, the possible costs for which it would not be meaningful to estimate in advance.</p>
	<p pid="b.795W.8/2">There is in place a well-established international regime for regulating liability and compensation for third party damage in the event of an accident. The Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (&quot;1965 Act&quot;) implements the UK's obligations under the Paris convention on nuclear third party liability and the Brussels supplementary convention, which we have been contracting parties to since the 1960s. In giving effect to the Paris convention, the 1965 Act limits the liability of nuclear operators to &#163;140 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.795W.8/3">We are currently working on amendments to the 1965 Act to implement the changes to the conventions agreed in 2004. These changes set a minimum operator liability of &#8364;700 million but there is discretion to set a higher limit or have it uncapped. In the circumstances we are reviewing the limitation of operators' liability. We have held no discussions with potential new nuclear operators on this issue however we intend to consult on our proposed changes to the 1965 Act, including limitation of liability, later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.798W.7/1">Many of the cost elements of running the proposed referendum on the alternative vote system will be similar to those for a general election. The previous Government estimated the cost for conduct elements of the 2010 general election in Great Britain at &#163;82.1 million, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-03-30.1079"><i> Official Report</i>, 30 March 2010, column 1079W</phrase>. Based on this, and our modelling for the 2009 European and 2010 general elections, it can be estimated that the cost of conduct elements for the proposed referendum will be similar. We have made initial assumptions about the conduct costs of a referendum were it not to be combined with any other polls and on that basis we currently estimate a saving of &#163;17 million on the conduct costs of the referendum through combination.</p>

	<p pid="b.798W.7/3">Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, designated lead campaign organisations are entitled to send a referendum address post free, similar to the entitlement in place for candidates at general elections. The cost of funding this entitlement does not form part of the costs of the conduct of the poll. The Government are considering how this entitlement will apply at the referendum on the alternative vote.</p>

	<p pid="b.800W.3/4" class="indent">The table below shows (a) the mid-2009 estimated resident population aged 18 and over for Wakefield and (b) the number of people registered to vote in local government elections as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase>, resident in Wakefield. These figures are the latest available.</p>
	<p pid="b.800W.3/5" class="indent">The definition of residency differs between the two figures above. The mid-year population estimates refer to the usually resident population as defined by the standard United Nations definition of residing in an area for at least 12 months, regardless of eligibility to vote. To register to vote in local government elections, a person must be resident in the electoral area. In this context, residency is not defined in law but it has been held by the courts to entail a 'considerable degree of permanence'.</p>

	<p pid="b.803W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-08">8 June</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, the Olympics, Media and Sport set out the Government's plans for ensuring the UK has the best superfast broadband network in Europe by the end of the Parliament. These plans include enabling access to existing infrastructure to reduce the cost of deployment. Further, the Secretary of State proposed three market testing projects schemes for superfast broadband in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.8/2">As a first step towards this ambition, the Government are also committed to making a service level of 2Mbps available in towns and villages still without a basic level of access. The office charged with delivering this Universal Service Commitment, Broadband Delivery UK, will be holding an industry event in July to provide further information on the approach to meeting the 2Mbps service commitment and the market testing schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.805W.2/1">Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE) users were given notice in 2005 by Ofcom that they would have to vacate channels 31-37 (600 MHz spectrum) and 63-68 (800 MHz spectrum) by 2012, and in 2007 that channels 61-62 (800 MHz spectrum) would no longer be available for use. Ofcom considers this an acceptable period of notice for users to react and are not obliged to offer compensation or to find alternative spectrum. However, Ofcom has said that most of the 32 channels retained for digital terrestrial television after Digital Switchover in the 600 MHz band will still be available on an interleaved basis for PMSE and it is confident there will be enough spectrum in individual locations to more than satisfy historic peak demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.805W.2/2">Ofcom will be able to say more about precise frequencies in specific locations later this year, following the outcome of negotiations with neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.805W.2/3">After Ofcom's 2005 statement, users had legitimately been expecting to use channel 69 (in the 800 MHz spectrum) for PMSE until 2018, and therefore as Government agreed with a proposal to change the use of this channel, Government will ensure PMSE users will be compensated for being moved from channel 69.</p>
	<p pid="b.805W.2/4">This Government are now considering options on the appropriate level of compensation, taking into account how we can best ensure users are neither better nor worse off, what sort of precedent a compensation scheme would set, and whether it would be lawful. Equally important, in particular in the current financial climate, is the need to appropriately safeguard and make efficient use of taxpayers' money. A decision will be taken as soon as possible.</p>

OASys includes two predictors of reoffending, the OASys general reoffending predictor (OGP) and the OASys violence predictor (OVP). OVP predicts reoffending involving non-sexual violence, while OGP predicts most other reoffending.

This screening includes the Offender Group Reconviction Scale (OGRS) which predicts all types of reoffending. The validation of OGRS version 3 can also be found on the Ministry of Justice website (Research Summary 7/09).</p>

	<p pid="b.811W.2/1">A broad range of services and interventions are delivered generally to offenders across custody and the community to meet particular needs and address offending behaviour. There are a number of accredited offending behaviour programmes addressing thinking skills, anger management, domestic and other types of violent crime as well as sexual offending. A range of interventions is available for offenders with an alcohol or drug problem. Other activities across prison and probation such as training, education, work, non accredited courses, specialist support and resettlement may also have a significant part to play.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.2/2">The Ministry of Justice works closely with independent organisations that provide services specifically for veterans, and across Government to raise awareness among ex-service personnel of the help and support available to them and their families while they serve a prison or community sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.2/3">Contact details are provided for the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA), The Royal British Legion (TRBL), Soldiers Sailors Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) Forces Help and Combat Stress. Posters detailing the types of support provided by these agencies are distributed and displayed widely across the prison estate and in Probation offices. Prison officers and offender managers now have direct access to the SPVA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.2/4">Ministry of Defence funded mental health services provide support to veterans in prison as well as those in the community. The MoD funded Medical Assessment programme provides specialist military mental health advice for veterans in prison referred to them by prison medical staff. The programme has been extended to include reservists mental health for those who have deployed since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.2/5">Many prison governors have managed to appoint a local point of contact for co-ordinating and promoting services as part of the model of practice promoted in the Guide, &quot;Veterans in Custody Support-A Guide&quot; which has been distributed to all prison establishments.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.2/6">Many prison and probation staff are veterans themselves and bring further experience and understanding.</p>

	<p pid="b.813W.0/1">IPSA has advised me that the merits of introducing a paper-based system for claiming expenses were considered during the start-up phase of IPSA. It was concluded that in line with current expectations of IT-led delivery within the public sector, it would be inappropriate to design a new expenses process which was not based at least in part on an IT-led solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.0/2">IPSA remains of the view that an IT-led, rather than paper-based, system is most appropriate. Using an IT-led solution allows IPSA to achieve a high level of transparency more easily and cheaply than an equivalent manual approach. It will also allow any future changes to processes to be more easily implemented.</p>

	<p pid="b.814W.0/1">The MPs' expenses scheme only allows the costs of economy/standard class tickets or the equivalent to be reimbursed. MPs travelling on sleeper train services are additionally entitled to claim for sleeper supplements, for either a single occupancy berth or a share of a twin occupancy berth. Both companies which provide sleeper train services within the UK will allow travellers to purchase either berth as a supplement to a standard class ticket.</p>
	<p pid="b.814W.0/2">The total cost of the ticket plus sleeper supplement may be higher than the price of a standard open ticket. Therefore, as the guidance to the scheme states at paragraph 7.7, the total cost will be reimbursed in these cases.</p>
