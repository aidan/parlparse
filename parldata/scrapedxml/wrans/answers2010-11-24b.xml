	<p pid="b.293W.9/1">There are no current plans to ban the use of electronic training aids for animals. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 already makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal and to treat an animal in a way that fails to meet its welfare needs. It also provides additional powers to prohibit the use of any such equipment through secondary legislation if considered necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.293W.9/2">However, we recognise the need for further research into this issue. DEFRA is currently carrying out a study into whether electronic training collars cause unnecessary suffering, and this is expected to be completed next year.</p>

The review will consider results of on-going research projects that are investigating practical and realistic ways to rear laying hens without the need for beak trimming and will consider the outcome of industry study tours to those European countries where they do not beak trim. As the impact of feather pecking is greatest in systems of management which do not house birds in cages, the risk to the welfare of laying hens from injurious pecking is likely to increase after the ban on conventional cages comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>. A review in 2015 will allow producers time to increase their experience of managing flocks in alternative systems.</p>

Detailed budgets have not yet been finalised and so I cannot provide a four-year profile.</p>

	<p pid="b.315W.2/1">The Parliamentary Outreach service aims to spread awareness of the work, processes and relevance of the institution of Parliament, encouraging greater engagement between the public and the House of Commons and House of Lords. Since its launch, the level of demand for outreach sessions has increased continuously. Parliamentary Outreach now employs two main methods of increasing levels of public understanding and participation: (a) regional parliamentary training sessions, and (b) sessions explaining how to engage with select committees and the process of public bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.315W.2/2">Over the past 12 months, the Parliamentary Outreach team has run 456 events, of which around 4.39% (20) were run in partnership with local authorities and non-departmental bodies. The majority of events are run in partnership with organisations in the voluntary and community sectors, ensuring maximum reach and value for money. Some 13,000 people have attended outreach events during the past 12 months. The vast majority of attendees are from organisations which have either a strategic remit to increase civic engagement or a direct objective to engage with parliamentary processes. As the partner organisations organise the attendance at the regional events, it is not possible to give an accurate figure of the percentage of attendees who are employed by local authorities or non-departmental government bodies. Analysis of the attendees at the Public Bill workshops in the last two months shows that 9.4% of those who registered to attend are employed in these fields.</p>
	<p pid="b.315W.2/3">The success of each outreach event is measured by evaluating whether the participants feel better equipped to engage with Parliament. At least 98% of attendees at the recent Public Bill workshops have stated that they felt better equipped to engage with Parliament and at least 94% rated the workshop as good or excellent.</p>

	<p pid="b.318W.0/1">In the interests of long-term financial affordability, the strategic defence and security review (SDSR) determined that we would transition to a two platform fast jet fleet consisting of the highly capable multi-role aircraft, Typhoon and joint strike fighter. In the transition period the difficult decision has been taken to remove Harrier from service in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/2">The overriding factor in deciding between removing either the Tornado GR4 or Harrier was the ability to support operations in Afghanistan. The Harrier fleet would have been too small to support Afghanistan operations at current levels, notwithstanding Carrier Strike and other contingent operations. Conversely, the Tornado GR4 force-even at its reduced size-will be significantly larger than the current Harrier force and would allow continuous UK fast jet close air support to forces in Afghanistan and the ability to support concurrent operations. It also has a number of key capability advantages over the Harrier GR9 including:</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/3" class="indent">greater payload and range and integration of capabilities such as Storm Shadow;</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/4" class="indent">fully integrated dual mode Brimstone;</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/5" class="indent">the Raptor reconnaissance pod; and</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/6" class="indent">a cannon.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/7">We will retain a reduced Tornado GR4 fleet that will drawdown gradually to ensure there is no effect on operations in Afghanistan as we transition to Typhoon and joint strike fighter, from which we will also regenerate our Carrier Strike capability. In line with these transitions, we currently plan to take the Tornado GR4 out of service in 2021. This updates the out of service date and associated costs in the reply given to the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead in another place by Lord Astor on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-16.178"><i> Official Report,</i><i> House of Lords,</i> column WA178</phrase>, which were based on pre-SDSR plans. The Prime Minister received full advice on the options regarding our fast jet fleet as part of the SDSR process.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/8">The MOD made estimates of cost savings accrued from measures considered in the SDSR for the purpose of formulating policy. Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice the MOD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trade unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed savings or updated in-service cost figures at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/9">The MOD calculates the full cost of aircraft per flying hour. The current rates for our fast jets are shown in the table. These figures include forward and depth servicing, fuel costs, crew costs, training costs, cost of capital charge, depreciation and amortisation. The Typhoon cost per flying hour reflects the build up of the fleet with small numbers of aircraft currently in-service. This cost will comparatively reduce as the fleet builds and is expected to be similar to our other fast jet fleets when we reach a steady state position.</p>

	<p pid="b.318W.0/20">These costs will need to be reviewed once we have finalised the SDSR decisions and how they will be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/21">The Tornado aircraft fleet, consisting of the GR4 ground attack and F3 air defence variants, is supported by two availability based maintenance contracts. The Availability Transformation: Tornado Aircraft Contract (ATTAC), for which BAE Systems is the prime contractor, provides Depth Support until 2016 and has a total value of &#163;1.5 billion. The Turbo-Union RB199 engine which powers the Tornado aircraft is supported by the RB199 Operational Contract for Engine Transformation 2 (ROCET 2) awarded to Rolls-Royce until 2025. The contract has a total value of &#163;690 million. There are no penalty clauses in either contract. However, both contracts include a number of conditions that allow for early termination. Any costs associated with the implementation of these conditions following the SDSR outcome are being negotiated with the contractor.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/22">Under the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot) programme approved in December 2007, 96 Tornado GR4 aircraft will receive capability upgrades between 2011 and 2014 at an estimated cost of around &#163;300 million. This number of aircraft is sufficient to maintain the operational capability of the Tornado GR4 Forward Available Fleet until OSD. There are currently no plans for the aircraft to receive any further capability upgrades after 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.0/23">For the number of Tornado GR4 modified for Operations in Afghanistan, I refer the noble Lord to the reply given to the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead in another place by Lord Astor on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-11-04.427"><i> Official Report,</i><i> House of Lords,</i> column WA427</phrase>. To optimise the further 17 Tornado aircraft required for operations in Afghanistan will cost around &#163;0.5 million. The 15 Harrier GR9 aircraft that have returned from Afghanistan would require refitting of equipment to be made ready for operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.320W.5/1">The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is the independent regulator of health and adult social care services in England. CQC's role is to provide assurance of safety and quality for people who use services and patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.5/2">Under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the 2008 Act), providers of regulated health and adult social care activities must register with CQC and meet a set of 16 requirements of essential safety and quality. The registration requirements, set in secondary legislation, include a requirement that providers must take steps to ensure that at all times there are sufficient numbers of suitably qualified, skilled and experienced staff, and that staff are supported in relation to their responsibilities by receiving appropriate training, professional development, supervision and appraisal.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.5/3">Failure to comply with the registration requirements is an offence, and under the 2008 Act CQC has a wide range of enforcement powers that it can use if a provider is not compliant.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.5/4">These include the issue of a warning notice that requires improvement within a specified time, prosecution, and the power to cancel a provider's registration, removing its ability to provide regulated activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.5/5">In addition, Skills for Care is working with employers to ensure that care workers can access continued professional development, (Skills for Care is an employer led work force development organisation for adult social care which is largely funded by the Department, and the partner of the Sector Skills Council in England).</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.5/6">National Occupational Standards describe the skills, knowledge and values care workers should meet for a variety of settings at different levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.324W.2/1">The National Service Framework (NSF) for Diabetes sets out the framework for the prevention and diagnosing of diabetes, developing services and improving outcomes for people with diabetes. The national health service has made good progress against the NSF with the number of people getting the key tests and measures to help prevent or delay the complications of diabetes rising year on year. In addition, the National Quality Standard for Diabetes is currently subject to public consultation before being finalised in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/2">The NHS is taking a structured approach to risk assessment and management of diabetes with the NHS Health Check programme. The Quality and Outcomes Framework encourages general practitioners to maintain a register of people with a diagnosis of diabetes and to ensure that they receive the key processes of care on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/3">Supporting people with diabetes to better understand their condition is key to reducing complications arising from diabetes. Structured education programmes, access to specialist diabetes advice, care planning discussions and annual checks are all part of the wide range of NHS support for people with diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/4">NHS Diabetes, the national service improvement team has an extensive range of work programmes in place to support the NHS in improving diabetes care at the local level. Specifically, they have produced &quot;Commissioning Without Walls&quot; which provides commissioning advice across a number of facets of diabetes care.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/5">To raise awareness of type 1 diabetes, in July 2010, NHS Diabetes in association with Diabetes UK and the Department published an exemplar patient journey to highlight the diagnosis and entire care pathway for a child with type 1 diabetes. This is aimed at professionals from a broad range of backgrounds including education, the NHS, social services and the voluntary sector.</p>

We are currently at the stage of planning the reform programme and I am considering proposals for the process and timescales. You will know already that we place a high value on the views of our partners in the sector. We will work closely with a wide range of organisations to maximise the potential of informal adult and community learning to support the development of the Big Society and create progression routes into further learning, training and employment for people who are disadvantaged.</p>

	<p pid="b.339W.5/1">To support the Browne Review and the Government's response, we commissioned research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) to explore how changes in fees, grants and loans impact on participation. This research drew on variation in grants, fees and loans over the period 1992-2007, and indicated that a &#163;1,000 increase in fees results in a 4.4ppt decrease in university participation, while a &#163;1,000 increase in loans results in a 3.2ppt increase in participation, and a &#163;1,000 increase in grants results in a 2.1ppt increase in participation; therefore offsetting any effect from an increase in fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.339W.5/2">The Government's proposals provide a more generous package of grants and loans to ensure that no students face any up-front costs for tuition and those from lower income households, while studying, get more support for their living costs. The Government are also due to consult on the details of the National Scholarships programme aimed at providing further targeted support for students. The more progressive repayment system of graduate contributions to the cost of university education will also protect any low-earning graduates.</p>

Since 2006, in response to consumer concern, Ofcom has introduced a range of measures that has made 0870 and 0845 calls cheaper for calls from landlines, although this has not been possible for calls from mobile telephones due to the additional costs, which are usually involved in transmitting and connecting the call from the mobile network.</p>

	<p pid="b.345W.5/1">The regional growth fund is a challenge fund that is open to bids from the private sector, or public private partnership from any part of England. Bids will be expected to demonstrate how they meet the fund's two published objectives:</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/2" class="indent">stimulate enterprise by providing support for projects and programmes with significant potential for economic growth and create additional sustainable private sector employment; and</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/3" class="indent">support in particular those areas and communities that are currently dependent on the public sector make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/4">To help applicants, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has produced guidance that details the criteria that bids will be assessed against to meet the two objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.5/5">BIS has also published an outline of the fund's appraisal process, part of which includes an assessment by an independent advisory panel chaired by my noble Friend Lord Heseltine. All of these are available on the regional growth fund web page:</p>

However, this is a challenge fund, which will mean that some bids that meet the criteria will not be successful, as in that particular bidding round there were stronger bids that also meet all the criteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.8/1">The carbon footprint of a heat pump is dependent on a number of factors including its overall efficiency, whether it is providing space heating and/or hot water, temperature lifts, the refrigerant used, the size of the building, levels of insulation, the hours of operation, and various design, installation and maintenance issues. The EU renewables directive requires that heat pumps must have a minimum Seasonal Performance Factor in order to qualify as a renewable source. The Commission are to issue guidance on how the Seasonal Performance Factor is to be calculated.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.8/2">An SPF of around 2.7 would make CO2 emissions from gas condensing boilers and heat pumps more or less equivalent with today's grid intensity. At this level of performance the CO2 emissions associated with running a heat pump are considerably lower than those associated with using either oil or electric resistive heating. CO2 savings against all these fuels will improve further, as the electricity grid decarbonises. The Energy Saving Trust field trials are not complete, but, when they are, they will provide useful information on the actual system efficiencies, as well as information to improve installation and maintenance practice.</p>

This review considered all aspects of LLW management including disposal infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.351W.5/2">The strategic review fully recognised that, without improvements in application of the waste hierarchy to avoid waste creation and promote recycling, volume reduction, better waste segregation and use of more appropriate waste disposal routes, the LLWR in Cumbria (which has in the past been the default destination for much LLW) will not provide the capacity required to manage the whole of the UK's projected inventory of LLW. A significant opportunity is to preserve capacity at LLWR for those wastes that require the levels of safety and environmental protection provided by the facility, and to develop better waste segregation and alternative disposal capacity for lower hazard LLW and very low level waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.375W.8/1">Before the Academies Act, academies were already required to use their best endeavours to meet any special needs of pupils, have regard to the Special Education Needs (SEN) code of practice, have an SEN policy and appoint a suitable person to co-ordinate SEN provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.8/2">Where an academy fails to meet its SEN obligations, the Young People's Learning Agency, on behalf of the Secretary of State, has the role of ensuring that these obligations are met. Academy parents and pupils also have the same rights of access to the First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs and Disability). In practice this means that children in academies already had very similar rights and protections as children in maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.8/3">Where a child has a statement of SEN, the local authority retains both the funding for the appropriate provision, and the responsibility for ensuring that it is provided. As a result of the Academies Act, any new academy and any existing academy which moves to the new Funding Agreement (the contract between the Academy Trust and the Secretary of State) is under exactly the same duties as maintained schools in relation to children with SEN.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.8/4">In relation to admissions, academies must comply with the School Admissions Code and School Admission Appeals Code in the same way as maintained schools. This protects the interests of hard to place pupils and pupils with a statement of SEN. All maintained schools and academies must participate in their local authority's Fair Access Protocol in order to ensure that unplaced children, especially the most vulnerable, are offered a place at a suitable school in their home local authority as quickly as possible.</p>

HBAI uses household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, to provide a proxy for standard of living. The data are sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS)<sup>(1 )</sup>which collects detailed financial information across a range of income streams including income from the education maintenance allowance. There are concerns as to the reliability of EMA data on the FRS with a small number of relevant cases and amounts received being, in some instances, inconsistent with the implied entitlement. Therefore estimates of the impact of the removal of EMA on child poverty rates should be treated with some caution. However, data from 2008/09 suggest that the removal of EMA will have a negligible impact on the number of children in poverty.</p>

We want the dynamism that characterises the best independent schools to drive up standards in the state sector. In this spirit we will not be setting overly prescriptive requirements in relation to qualifications: instead we will expect business cases to demonstrate how governing bodies intend to guarantee the highest quality of teaching and leadership in their schools. No school will be allowed to proceed unless its proposals for quality teaching are soundly based. Ensuring each Free School's unique educational vision is translated into the classroom will require talented people with a diverse range of experience. As is the case with all schools, Free Schools will be subject to employment law and the Equalities Act 2010 with regard to age requirements.</p>

The Department considered carefully the options for securing the requisite services from an external organisation. Given the need for specialist skills and experience to be in place quickly it was decided to award a time limited grant to NSN. In doing so the Department took account of the UK Public Procurement Regulations 2006 and the Compact Commissioning Guidance. There have been no discussions with the Treasury on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.379W.8/2">NSN has championed the development of parent and teacher promoted schools and has been providing advice and support to those interested in establishing new schools since 2009. It has also been developing networks among interested groups and individuals. This experience makes it ideally placed to fulfil the role. The Department has given similar grants in the past, such as to the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, the Youth Sport Trust, Holocaust Educational Trust and the National Literacy Trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.380W.8/1">The Government want to reform the existing rigid national pay and conditions rules to give schools greater freedoms to pay good teachers more.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.8/2">The Department consulted teacher and head teacher unions, employers and governor representatives on changes to the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (the Document) and the accompanying statutory guidance for September 2010. The main changes result from decisions made following a series of recent School Teachers Review Body (STRB) recommendations, including changes to pay scales to implement the 2.3% pay increase, and to pay arrangements for teachers of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). We received nine responses to the statutory consultation on the Document which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-30">30 July</phrase>, which were broadly supportive of these changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.8/3">In addition there was a request to amend the teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) provisions; and eight requests to refer the matter of a proposed upper limit on leadership group remuneration to the STRB. Outside the consultation, seven teacher and head teacher unions also wrote to the Secretary of State about the proposal to implement an upper limit on leadership group remuneration. The Secretary of State wrote to the Chair of the STRB on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-04">4 August</phrase> to say that consideration of a limit on head teacher pay will be included in a future remit.</p>
	<p pid="b.380W.8/4">The Department also recently consulted on changes to the statutory guidance which accompanies the Document. Nine responses were received to the statutory consultation which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-25">25 August</phrase>. Although the responses were broadly supportive, three consultees made reference to the award of TLRs; six consultees suggested revised wording for the statutory guidance on SEN allowances for teachers which have informed amendments to the statutory guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.382W.0/1">The Department for Education is committed to the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and to improving outcomes for disabled children and young people. The UK Government will report to the UN Committee in July 2011, setting out how implementation has been achieved across Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.382W.0/2">We are determined to raise the achievement and wellbeing of children with special educational needs (SEN) and disabled children. We are aiming to publish a SEN and Disability Green Paper. The Green Paper will consider how we can achieve better educational outcomes and life chances for disabled children and young people and those with SEN-from the early years through to the transition into adult life and employment. The Green Paper will seek to make radical improvements to the entire SEN and disability system for disabled children and young people. It will explore issues such as school choice, early identification and assessment, funding systems and family support in order to make life better for children with SEN and their parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.382W.0/3">We have carried out an open 'call for views' exercise and we intend to engage directly with disabled children, young people and parents of disabled children as part of the Green Paper consultation process.</p>
