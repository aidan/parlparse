The Obscene Publications Act 1959 and the Indecent Displays Act 1981, are designed to protect children and others from exposure to inappropriate material. Furthermore, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents operates a voluntary code of practice for the display of pornographic magazines; 'lifestyle' magazines are displayed at newsagents' discretion, and customers can seek to influence how that discretion is exercised.</p>

	<p pid=".528W.2/2">The operation of air traffic control stacking procedures is a matter for National Air Traffic Services (NATS), the air navigation services provider. NATS' service performance, including reductions in delays, is incentivised by independent economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority, subject always to overriding safety considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/3">Aircraft are held in stacks when demand dictates, or when they are affected by weather or other factors, and their rate of arrival would otherwise exceed the capacity of the airport to receive them.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/4">The Future of Air Transport White Paper noted that future growth would require a structured programme for the redesign of UK airspace, taking into account safety and environmental considerations. As part of that, we look to NATS to operate and develop air traffic control efficiently, consistently with their overall objectives, and in particular to seek to minimise stack holding as far as possible, to reduce fuel burn and emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.2/5">Estimates of daily levels of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to stack-holding are not available.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.2/1">In line with its manifesto commitments, the Government will examine the potential of moving away from the current system of motoring taxation towards a national system of road pricing.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/2">The Feasibility Study of Road Pricing in the UK, published by the Department for Transport in July 2004, concluded that a scheme could reduce congestion by some 40 per cent. and achieve benefits of up to &pound;12 billion a year in time savings and increased reliability. This would bring benefits for the economy as a whole and individuals using the road network for business and leisure.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/3">The Feasibility Study recognised that before road pricing could be implemented much more work would need to be done. It is too early to specify all the details of a scheme, or to determine precisely its impacts. It will be important to learn from the experiences of charging schemes already in place, such as the London Congestion Charge. We need to design a system that works at a reasonable cost, with clear benefits to road users as well as the country as a whole. Key considerations include the need to safeguard our environmental objectives, respect privacy and the setting of prices.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/4">More detailed work is now being taken forward to allow a decision to be made about whether national road pricing should be introduced and what form it should take.</p>

	<p pid=".549W.13/1">The REACH proposals will require industry to provide data on chemicals to enable an assessment to be made of their potential harm to the environment and human health. There will in some cases be a legal requirement for the use of animals for safety testing in much the same way as the current requirements for chemicals under existing regimes. However, the REACH regulation will require that all existing data from animal tests and alternative methods of generating data are taken into consideration before any new animal testing is carried out.</p>
	<p pid=".549W.13/2">The Government are committed to minimising the numbers of animals used for safety testing and risk assessments under REACH and is supporting work aimed at the development of integrated testing strategies based on existing data, advanced modelling approaches and in vitro testing methods that do not require the use of animals. However, before the new methods can be accepted by regulatory authorities, there is a need for the methods to be fully validated as fit for purpose. It is also very unlikely that alternative methods will be available in the short term for certain toxicity endpoints, particularly those involving long-term exposure to chemicals.</p>

	<p pid=".551W.2/1">Estimates published in March this year suggest that in 2004 UK greenhouse gas emissions were provisionally about 12.5 per cent. below base year levels. The data released in March also indicate that, even without the further action currently being considered under the review of the UK Climate Change Programme, the UK will be about 20 per cent. below base year levels in 2010. The UK is therefore on course to meet its Kyoto protocol commitment to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below base level years by 2008&ndash;12. This is a significant achievement. On the basis of existing policies, emissions of carbon dioxide are projected to be about 13 per cent. below the 1990 level in 2010. We therefore recognise that more needs to be done if we are to meet our more challenging domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".551W.5/1">The Government are taking a wide range of measures to protect and conserve endangered species in this country and also internationally through mechanisms such as international conservation agreements and the Government's funding schemes (for example, the Darwin Initiative and FCO's Sustainable Development Global Opportunities Fund).</p>
	<p pid=".551W.5/2">More specifically on breeding of endangered species, we are also taking measures. For example, the Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) Kew, a non-departmental public body sponsored by Defra, carries out much important work, in support of the Convention on Biological Diversity. All living collections held at RBG Kew have undergone a conservation audit so that their endangered state is known and this material is available for propagation and reintroduction. RBG Kew assists governments to identify areas of floristic diversity which should be protected in countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Madagascar, Cameroon, Thailand and Brunei, and manages the Millennium Seed Bank Project which involves partnerships between 18 countries which seek to collect and conserve long-term, seed from 24,200 species. Seed of 96 per cent. of the seed bearing flora of the British Isles are also held in the Millennium Seed Bank. Seeds of rare and threatened species, such as the Lady's Slipper Orchid, are micro-propagated prior to reintroduction into the wild as part of the national Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), managed by English Nature and other UK conservation agencies. Collections of rare UK BAP lower plants (bryophytes) are held as a cryo-preserved collection and work is currently under way to develop methods to recover and reintroduce these cryo-preserved collections.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.5/3">Also, in recognition that zoos can play a role in breeding endangered species for conservation purposes, British zoos are regulated through the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 to require them to participate in conservation measures including captive-breeding programmes for endangered species of animals.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.5/4">We also provide funds to a number of Darwin Initiative projects which are focused on breeding endangered species in order to contribute to their conservation in the wild. For example, the Initiative has provided three grants to the RSPB and the Institute of Zoology for work to address the catastrophic decline of Vulture species across Asia. This work has identified causes of these declines and set up a captive breeding programme to ensure survival of populations while these causes are being addressed.</p>

	<p pid=".553W.8/1">The tonnage requiring treatment will depend on a number of factors, not least the amount arising. In 2003, some 4.8 million tonnes of special waste was consigned, and 47 per cent. was specifically consigned to treatment facilities (including recycling and reuse), 38 per cent. to landfill and 4 per cent. to incineration.

	<p pid=".562W.2/1">The most recent estimate by the Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) is that taken together consumer electronics, home computing equipment, domestic cooking equipment and office equipment in the UK produced approximately 800,000 tonnes of carbon (c7 TWh) in the UK during 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.2/2">We are also aware that there is further energy consumption from white goods such as washing machines and dishwashers which are switched on awaiting use or after they have completed their wash cycles; consumer electronic equipment using external power supplies (eg domestic portable telephones) that continue to consume energy when plugged in but not in use; and domestic personal computer equipment where the stand-by facilities are not properly enabled. Taken together, these sources of consumption may bring the overall figure to around 1 million tonnes of carbon.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.2/3">In order to try to tackle this problem the Market Transformation Programme (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the stand-by power consumption of household appliances through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets. This approach has been fairly successful in respect of televisions: an EU-wide voluntary agreement will mean that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK now consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&ndash;8 watts consumed by older models. This agreement is currently being extended to cover other consumer electronics.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.2/4">A similar agreement for external power supplies aims to encourage new power supplies consuming around half a watt in stand-by mode compared to the present average of just over 2 watts.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.2/5">The recently agreed Framework Directive for the Eco-design of Energy Using Products (EUP), which is expected to come into force later this year will provide a streamlined and effective route for setting EU-wide environmental requirements for traded goods. EUP requires the Commission and member states to treat the issue of stand by energy consumption as a priority area for consideration. The UK will work proactively with the Commission and other member states to influence and speed the delivery of measures under EUP</p>

	<p pid=".565W.5/1">The need to maintain, and improve where necessary, the health and vitality of trees is integral to the Government's approach to sustainable forest management. We have set this out in the UK Forestry Standard and its supporting literature, which contain many specific measures for protecting woodland and improving tree health. All woodland management by the Forestry Commission is consistent with this standard and we expect private woodland owners that receive grant aid from the Forestry Commission to also meet the standard. The Government have encouraged the development of the voluntary UK Woodland Assurance Standard that provides an independent verification of compliance with good practice and measures to ensure the continuing good health of woodland. We shall continue to ensure compliance with the UK Forest Standard in those woods managed by the Forestry Commission and encourage it in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".565W.5/2">We will also continue to improve, through research, our knowledge of factors affecting tree health and we shall maintain a vigilant guard against the establishment of non-native pests and diseases. For example, there is a determined effort, led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Forestry Commission, to contain and eradicate the diseases of trees and shrubs caused by the pathogens Phytophthora ramorum and Phytophthora kernoviae.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.8/1">Regulation 6(2) of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994, places a duty on the Environment Agency to ensure, through its discharge consenting powers under schedule 10 of the Water Resources Act 1991, as amended by the Environment Act 1995, that treatment standards set in the regulations are met. Where the Environment Agency considers sewerage undertakers are in breach of their consents it can undertake legal proceedings. Courts finding in favour of the Environment Agency can then levy fines.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.8/2">Sewerage undertakers also have a duty under section 94 of the Water Industry Act 1991 to provide sewage collecting systems, which is supplemented by Regulation 4 of the above-mentioned regulations. The Water Act 2003 also gives Ofwat, the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales powers to impose financial penalties in certain circumstances. The approach is included in the 'Statement of policy with respect to financial penalties' which is on Ofwat's website, <a href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk">www.ofwat.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid=".572W.2/1">HM Revenue and Customs' figure for value for money procurement savings for 2004&ndash;05 is due to be audited and submitted to the Office of Government Commerce at the end of July. During 2004&ndash;05, HMRC delivered a total net full time equivalent reduction of 1,045 posts.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.2/2">The Treasury's target for efficiency savings over the Spending Review 2004 period includes the delivery of &pound;1 million of efficiencies by 2007&ndash;08 through improvements to the Treasury's procurement strategy. The plans to achieve this target include securing economies of scale through sharing of services with HMRC and maximising income opportunities through sub-letting of the building. Quantified procurement savings are currently being identified.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.2/3">During 2004&ndash;05 the Treasury has secured efficiencies in working practices and processes which have enabled it to make good early progress on its full time equivalent post reduction target. By April 2005 efficiencies had been secured leading to a reduction in 100 full time equivalent posts. Both the HMRC and Treasury reductions in posts are adjusted for the 150 tax policy posts that transferred from HMRC to the Treasury during 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".573W.8/1">This is a targeted measure that is expected to help up to 110,000 homebuyers over the next five years. While this is a substantial boost for first time buyers it needs to be considered in the context of the measures the Government is taking to increase housing supply, with 200,000 new homes expected to be built in this year alone and similar levels of home building in future years, and which are on top of a housing stock of some 26 million homes. With supply increasing far faster than the provision of these shared equity schemes, and this being on top of a total housing stock that dwarfs the number of homes that will be bought through shared equity schemes, we believe the effect on house prices in general will not be significant.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.8/2">What really matters for the majority of homebuyers in terms of house prices is low and stable interest rates which this Government's monetary policy framework&mdash;in particular the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee&mdash;is delivering, alongside increasing housing supply, helped by a series of supply side reforms, including on planning.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".577W.6/2">The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), which regulates the security of nuclear material held by the UK civil nuclear industry, has recorded no theft of nuclear material from the industry. MOD is responsible for the security of the UK's inventory of non-civil nuclear material and there is no recorded theft of such material. Internationally, the security measures to prevent, and provide early warning of, the possible theft of nuclear material (e.g. by 'non-state actors') are a matter for the individual states concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".577W.6/3">In addition, nuclear safeguards provide assurance that states (or nuclear facility operators on their behalf) do not divert nuclear material from declared peaceful uses. Euratom treaty safeguards are applied to all civil nuclear material in the UK and the European Commission's most recent report on its application of these safeguards concluded there were no indications that civil nuclear material in the EU (including UK and EU members of NATO) had been diverted from its declared uses <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/energy/nuclear/legislation/doc/2005_01_07_COM_2004_861_en.pdf">http://europa.eu.int/comm/energy/nuclear/legislation/doc/2005_01_07_COM_2004_861_en.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".577W.6/4">So far as the application of international safeguards to inventories of nuclear material outside the UK are concerned, in addition to the Euratom treaty safeguards conclusions mentioned above, the definitive source is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose safeguards conclusions are published at the IAEA website <a href="http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/SV/Safeguards/es2003.html">http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/SV/Safeguards/es2003.html</a>. However, such IAEA safeguards do not apply to all nuclear material in nuclear-weapon states nor to all material in states which are not party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (the NPT).</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/2">Funding for further education is increasing and will rise by over &pound;1 billion in 2005/06 compared to 2002/03&mdash;almost a 20 per cent. real terms increase over three years. Funding increases for individual colleges will depend on a number of factors including the extent to which college activities align with our key priorities. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) have not yet confirmed Bournemouth and Poole College's allocation for 2005/06. As the allocation of funding to colleges relates to the LSC's operational responsibilities. I have asked the LSC's Chief Executive, Mark Haysom, to write to the hon. Member with the information requested. A copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Annette Brooke, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-09">9 June 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/4" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills regarding FE funding for Bournemouth and Poole College. Following discussions with colleagues who work with the College, I hope the following will answer your concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/5" class="indent">Bournemouth and Poole College's Further Education allocation for 2004/05 was &pound;22,684,000. The budget for this year, (2005/06) has been confirmed at &pound;23,134,337&mdash;an actual increase on the previous year. Written confirmation of this amount was given to the college on <phrase class="date" code="">27 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/6" class="indent">The LSC is aware that some FE institutions are warning of serious cuts in courses for adults, particularly part-time courses, to make ends meet while others talk of the need for staff redundancies. We have always been clear that this funding round was going to be tough and that the whole sector is going to have to make difficult choices.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/7" class="indent">None of this is due to the LSC cutting FE budgets. In fact we have increased FE funding nationally from &pound;3.5 billion to &pound;4.5 billion from 2001/02 to 2005/06, an increase of 29 per cent. This year we will be increasing national funding by a further &pound;170 million. This increase is reflected across the country with Bournemouth and Poole College seeing an increase of &pound;450,337.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/8" class="indent">The fact that budgets have increased does not disguise the immense challenges ahead. Public funds are always finite and there will never be enough money to do all that the LSC or the FE colleges would like to do. There are a number of key factors to explain why colleges like Bournemouth and Poole are feeling the funding squeeze. The first is their success in driving up participation and achievement. For example, we now have the highest ever level of 16&ndash;18 year olds in education and training. These numbers have to be funded and this has put a strain on budgets, leaving less for other areas and ensuring that money will be tight in the next academic year and beyond.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/9" class="indent">Funding is also being squeezed because we are concentrating funding on key priorities we have agreed with the Government in the areas of education and training for 16&ndash;18 year olds, young people taking Apprenticeships, anyone needing to improve their literacy and numeracy and anyone without a full level 2 qualification. These priorities are vital to delivering the Government's Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/10" class="indent">Copies of &quot;The Skills We Need&quot;: Our Annual Statement of Priorities, which sets out the key actions for this coming year, were distributed during December 2004 and this was followed by a paper outlining local priorities, several group presentations and one to one meetings with the College. The last of these was held on May 12 to finalise allocations and gave them a week to respond with views.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/11" class="indent">We recognise this situation will not be easy and we understand that some colleges find it difficult to reduce courses outside our priorities. That is why we believe they can develop additional funding by increasing the fees for those individuals with higher-level qualifications and from employers.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/12" class="indent">The Skills Strategy clearly emphasised the need for employers and individuals to contribute more in relation to the significant benefits they receive from education and training. That is why following consultation last year, the LSC increased the levels colleges are assumed to charge for courses from 25 per cent. to 27.5 per cent. Raising fees is designed to ensure public funds are concentrated on those people with low or no skills to bring about a better balance between public and private investment in education and training.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/13" class="indent">In the summer of 2004, I discussed with college principals from all parts of the country the major and urgent issues facing further education. The extensive dialogue was an essential part of the LSC's commitment to work in partnership with FE in a spirit of trust, openness and transparency.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/14" class="indent">Following this we produced an agenda for change, identifying issues crucial to the transformation of FE to meet the needs of learners and employers. For our part, the LSC made very clear the scale of the challenges that we face together and the transformation agenda that we must pursue in FE to meet those challenges. I will be speaking further about our progress during a second series of regional road shows planned for this summer.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/15" class="indent">Trish Taylor, Executive Director for Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole plans to keep you updated throughout this year with progress against our priorities for Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole. In the meantime, I hope this letter answers your questions regarding funding for Bournemouth and Poole College.</p>

We have introduced a range of measures aimed at supporting fathers in their important role. For example, we have developed materials for schools on working with fathers, including a booklet on &quot;Engaging Fathers&quot; and an &quot;Involving Parents Raising Achievement&quot; toolkit. We have supported, through the Parenting Fund and the Strengthening Families Grant, projects run by organisations in the Voluntary and Community Sector which focus on fathers. We are currently considering what further measures we might put in place to meet the specific needs of fathers, and particularly to encourage them to support their children's development and learning, as we develop our work to support parents more generally.</p>

	<p pid=".585W.5/1">Assuming that 91 per cent. of EU students are charged the full &pound;3,000 fee and 9 per cent. charged &pound;2,000, and assuming that 80 per cent. of them take out a fee loan and that their repayment behaviour is similar to English and Welsh students, costs are estimated to be around &pound;40 million <sup>1</sup> per year (steady state at academic year 2006/07 terms). These costs are made up of the interest rate subsidy of loans together with the costs that are never repaid for example loans that are written off after 25 years or death.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.5/2">The costs of EU students studying in the UK are offset by the longer term economic benefits which they bring. It is estimated that each EU student provides a net benefit of over &pound;6,000 per year in living expenses to the UK <sup>2</sup> . Multiplying this estimate for individual contributions to the UK economy by the estimated number of eligible EU students suggests that these students alone contribute &pound;270 million per year. Of the known first destinations of EU undergraduates, 25 per cent. remain in the UK to work after graduation and on average they pay &pound;5,000 in income tax over 1.5 years <sup>2</sup> . In addition there are substantial unquantifiable benefits to the UK. In particular, the UK benefits from an addition to its stock of employed manpower of a significant number of highly skilled young people. Other benefits arise from the contribution of these EU students and researchers within UK HEIs, and from having a significant proportion of the young future elite of Europe living, studying and working in this country for an important and formative period in their lives.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.5/1">Building Schools for the Future aims to ensure that all secondary-age pupils are educated in 21st-century facilities, whether in mainstream or special schools. We expect all local authorities that have special schools to include them in their plans. As for mainstream schools, depending on local circumstances, these plans can include new buildings and/or improvements to existing buildings. Costs of each project are only identified as they proceed through procurement and are not finalised until contract signature. We have indicated to local authorities broadly where in the 15-year programme their projects will come, but have not specified in which wave.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.5/2">Building Schools for the Future is not the only programme which supports building improvements in special schools. Each special school receives its own allocation of Devolved Formula Capital and local authorities can use their formulaic capital allocations to address the needs of special schools, which should be included in their asset management plans. Special schools are also a priority project within the Targeted Capital Fund, and we are currently considering applications for funding in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.2/1">The Department has a PSA target to &quot;Improve children's communication; social and emotional development so that by 2008 50 per cent. of children reach a good level of development at the end of the Foundation Stage, and reduce inequalities between the level of development achieved by children in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas and the rest of England&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.2/2">The 50 per cent. level, set in July 2004 and covering the period April 2005 to March 2008, was based on the 2003 Foundation Stage Profile (FSP) results. The target level is provisional as the 2003 FSP data were &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. The 2005 results, which will be published in a Statistical First Release in October, will inform the calculation of a challenging trajectory to enable the progress made by children to be measured. The 2005 survey will also collect for the first time information about children in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas and this will be used to measure the rate of development achieved by children in these areas compared to the national picture. The figures from the 2004 survey indicate that 51 per cent. of children are working securely within the Early Learning Goals for communication, social and emotional development.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.5/1">The Government's overarching priority for children with SEN is that their needs should be met in an appropriate way, through an appropriate package of support. Children with less significant needs should in general be able to have their needs met in a mainstream environment, provided that appropriate support is in place. However, we recognise that mainstream schools are not suitable for some children with special educational needs. Both mainstream and special schools have a significant role to play.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.5/2">There needs to be a range of high quality provision for pupils for whom mainstream education may not be right, or may not be what their parents want. There must be strong links between special schools, mainstream schools, special units and resourced provision. This type of partnership working is a key aspect of the Government's published strategy on SEN&mdash;&quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;.</p>

The CPS recognises that awareness raising and confidence building are important elements of its work against domestic violence. CPS Hertfordshire works constructively with its criminal justice partners and NGOs in the county to raise awareness of domestic violence as an issue and of strategies for dealing with it.

	<p pid=".603W.2/1">Each year, the Prison Service invites applications from all prisons for inclusion in its local pay scheme or for increasing existing local pay rates. These applications are considered by the Prison Service Management Board and evidence, which is shared with trade unions, is supplied to the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) which considers whether there is a case for adjustment of existing rates. In February, the PSPRB recommended that local pay rates should remain unchanged. The Home Secretary decided to implement the recommendations of the PSPRB in full with the local pay rates for most London prisons remaining at &pound;4,000.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.3/1">Since the announcement last month that Acordis was going into administration, the administrators have been working hard in co-operation with the company's management, employees, suppliers and customers to ensure its survival as a going concern.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.3/2">I understand that the administrators have received a number of expressions of interest in the company which they are currently reviewing. In the meantime, it is continuing to trade and the support of its existing customers has resulted in an increase in orders. My colleagues and I will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".611W.2/1">Insolvency levels, both personal and corporate can and do fluctuate, influenced by a number of economic factors such as inflation rates, the availability and price of credit, employment levels and economic growth. The trend in personal insolvencies has been steadily upward since 1997 and reflects in part the extent to which access to personal credit has increased. Corporate insolvencies increased modestly between 1997 and 2002, since when they have fallen, due to a stable economic environment for business and an increasing tendency for businesses to address their financial problems at an earlier stage.</p>

	<p pid=".611W.5/1">Government Departments are working with industry organisations and law enforcement agencies through groups such as the Internet Crime Forum to tackle internet crime.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.5/2">Two of the main approaches used in dealing with fraud over the internet are prevention and education. A large amount of fraud can be prevented if organisations and individuals have proper fraud prevention measures in place. The Home Office publishes fraud prevention advice on the e-tailing mini website, which forms part of the Crime Reduction website. It helps consumers and businesses protect themselves when buying and selling over the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.5/3">The Government are also involved in the development of Project Endurance, an initiative that will launch an internet security public awareness campaign later this year. The project is an alliance of public and private sector bodies, which brings together several Government Departments and law enforcement organisations with a number of high profile private sector companies. This campaign will be targeted at micro business and consumers, primarily aimed at helping them gain confidence in using the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.5/4">The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 protect consumers against payment card fraud including credit cards. The regulations apply to contracts made at a distance including online ones. The card issuer is required to reimburse consumers the full amount in the event of fraudulent use of the consumer's card.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.5/5">The Government issued guidance in December 2003 advising consumers how to guard against the risks associated with internet auction sites. Details are available from Consumer Direct Online at <a href="http://www.consumerdirectgov.uk/auctions">www.consumerdirectgov.uk/auctions</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.11/2">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) owns two vessels the 'Atlantic Osprey' and the 'European Shearwater'. They were transferred to the NDA from BNFL on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and are now registered in the NDA's name. Their specifications and certification are in accordance with those specified in the International Maritime Organisations' (IMO) International Code for the Safe Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium, and High Level Radioactive Wastes on Board Ships (INF Code). Details on the INF Code can be found at <a href="http://www.imo.org/home.asp">www.imo.org/home.asp</a>.

	<p pid=".614W.2/1">At the five-yearly reviews conducted by the Competition Commission of the three BAA London airports and Manchester airport, the Commission is able to examine all activities conducted by the airports, including car parking. Where it concludes that the airport has been acting against the public interest in any of these activities the Commission can ask the CAA to impose a remedy in the form of a condition on the airport. The Competition Commission last reviewed the four airports during 2002. It did not make any public interest findings in relation to car parking at any of the airports but did indicate that car parking at Manchester airport was an issue to which it might wish to return at the next review.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.5/3">Any such shipment will be carried out in accordance with the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR), which are administered and enforced by the DTFs Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). A key requirement of the NISR is that a Transport Security Plan is submitted to OCNS for approval. All details of this plan, including dates, are confidential and it is not Government policy to release such information. OCNS will not approve the plan until it is satisfied that all measures are in place and are adequately robust to counter any credible threat. The responsibility for any costs of security arrangements falls onto BNFL.</p>

It is too soon to say what, if any, co-operation there will be as both countries believe that areas of beneficial co-operation are best determined by our respective industries. Ongoing studies by industry will determine the optimum and most cost-effective way in which any co-operative options can be implemented. It would be inappropriate to speculate on what industry's proposals may consist of, but Governments will take a view on their proposals, when available, later this year.</p>

Among airmen and women for the same period, &quot;dissatisfaction with pay&quot; was rated as an important or very important reason for leaving by 39 per cent. of the 723 personnel who responded, placing it 57th factor in the overall list of importance. &quot;Salary outside the RAF&quot;, however, was rated as important or very important by 62 per cent., placing it 16 overall.</p>

In the same period, of the 543 Airmen and women who responded to this question, 9 per cent. rated &quot;basic pay&quot; among their top five reasons for leaving, ranking it 18th out of a list of 102 factors.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.6/1">There are currently no procedures to encourage specific reporting of anaesthetic awareness by patients and the Department does not routinely collect information about the number of cases.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.6/2">However, the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) that we established in July 2001 to improve the safety of national health service patient care by promoting an open and fair culture has in place a national reporting and learning system for adverse events across the NHS. The NPSA is about to start a pilot to encourage patients to report all patient safety incidents, including those involving anaesthetic awareness.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.6/3">The NPSA has also undertaken a review of the anaesthetic process. This involved taking a &quot;standard patient journey&quot; and working through the whole process, identifying and analysing the risks. The NPSA is now in the process of identifying and prioritising areas for action and is being assisted in its work by a clinical speciality adviser (CSA) in anaesthetics and an anaesthetic reference group.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.6/4">The most important contribution to patient safety in this area is the continuous presence of a highly trained and skilled anaesthetist who has the benefit of modern equipment to deliver and monitor the patient's condition. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, which represents more than 9,000 anaesthetists, has issued &quot;Minimum Standards for Monitoring&quot; in recognition of the importance of monitoring the patient throughout an anaesthetic. The Association also launched its revised guidelines, &quot;Checking Anaesthetic Equipment&quot;, in 2004. The guidelines were developed jointly with the Royal College of Anaesthetists and their application by all anaesthetic staff will help to improve patient safety.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.5/1">In February 2004 the Department published &quot;Regulation of Cosmetic Piercing and Skin-Colouring Businesses&quot;, guidance for local authorities on section 120 of the Local Government Act 2003. The guidance explains the provisions in section 120 and Schedule 6 of the Local Government Act 2003, which amend section 15 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 1982, and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/2">The new provisions give local authorities in England (outside London) and in Wales, specific powers relating to persons carrying on businesses of cosmetic piercing, that is, piercing of the body including the ear, and semi-permanent skin-colouring, including micropigmentation, semi-permanent make-up and temporary tattooing. Local authorities will be able to require such businesses: to register themselves and their premises; and to observe byelaws relating to the cleanliness and hygiene of premises, practitioners and equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/3">London local authorities already have such powers under private legislation (London Local Authorities Act 1991 and the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1981).</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/4">These measures are intended to increase health protection and reduce the risk of transmission of blood-borne virus infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C and other infections. The publication also contains model byelaws that local authorities may wish to adopt in their area to facilitate consistency of enforcement. It also makes reference to the Health and Safety Executive/Local Authorities Enforcement Liaison Committee, Local Authority Circular 76/2: Enforcement of skin piercing activities (October 2001). This contains comprehensive guidance on issues such as infection control, waste disposal and aftercare advice.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/5">Before the new provisions were introduced by the Local Government Act 2003, local authorities had powers under the Local Government (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1982 to regulate ear piercing, tattooing, acupuncture and electrolysis by requiring registration and observance of byelaws.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.11/1">The London Ambulance Service (LAS) national health service trust is fully committed to working with patients and their representatives and will continue to develop an effective relationship with them in order to improve further the quality of patient care delivered throughout London.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.11/2">It is the Government's intention to focus patient forum activity at the primary care trust (PCT) level but with arrangements in place to ensure the whole &quot;patients' journey&quot; is covered by forum activity. In the context of the London Ambulance Service NHS trust, it is envisaged that all London PCT forums would work together to ensure that ambulance services are monitored and reviewed effectively from the patient perspective. It will be for the forums themselves to decide how best to achieve a comprehensive and robust arrangement, but one approach might be for each PCT forum to nominate one of its number to form a pan-London specialist ambulance review panel. Such an arrangement would mean that there was strong input from across the city with a membership of 29, with each London locality having a real chance to input into the LAS at both strategic and operational levels.</p>

These parameters are specified in the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 (as amended). The Food Standards Agency is aware of two withdrawals of bottled water on the grounds of bacterial contamination since 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.5/3">Water companies in England and Wales have to monitor for specific microbiological parameters at the frequencies and points set out in the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000 in England and 2001 in Wales. These parameters are total coliform bacteria, <i>E.coli</i>. Enterococci and <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>. The presence of these organisms indicates potential bacterial contamination of the water supply and the possible presence of other pathogens. If any of these organisms is detected, water companies are required to investigate the source of the potential contamination and take appropriate action to protect public health. Monitoring results are included in the annual reports to the Secretary of State by the Chief Inspector of Drinking Water, available in the House of Commons Library. Recent reports for the years 1999&ndash;2003 are also available on the Drinking Water Inspectorate website (<a href="http://www.dwi.gov.uk">www.dwi.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid=".647W.11/1">We welcome recent progress in the search for fugitive war crimes suspects. In the last six months, 17 Bosnian Serb or Serbian indictees have been transferred to The Hague by the Governments of Serbia and of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina&mdash;there are now only 10 remaining fugitives. These include Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, who remain at large 10 years after the Srebrenica massacre, for which they are held most responsible.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.11/2">The Chief Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, in her most recent report to the United Nations Security Council, has commended the improvement in co-operation from the authorities in Belgrade and Banja Luka, who have re-iterated their commitment to full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. But the policy of encouraging voluntary surrenders, which they have pursued to date, appears to have reached it limits.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.11/3">The UK, together with the international community, therefore continues to press for the transfer of all outstanding fugitive indictees, notably Karadzic and Mladic, as well as Gotovina, to The Hague. If they are unwilling to surrender voluntarily, the countries of the region should locate and arrest them.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.9/1">The UK fully recognises Israel's right to self-defence, and agrees that a barrier is a reasonable way to achieve this.

We oppose Israeli Government plans to build 3,500 housing units in El&mdash;an area between Jerusalem and the settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim.

	<p pid=".653W.2/1">With only four months elapsed since the new government under President Viktor Yushchenko took office it is early days and much work is still in progress. On the economy, positive steps have been taken to tackle corruption and to simplify the tax system. Progress is also being made to meet the conditions needed to secure Market Economy Status from the EU and to accede to the World Trade Organisation. However, uncertainty remains over the review of past privatisations and there are questions over the longer-term affordability of recent increases in pensions and civil service salaries. The constitutional reforms to increase the powers of the Parliament and Prime Minister in relation to the President are likely to come into force in either September this year or January 2006. The Ukrainian Government is also making progress in entrenching the new freedoms that the media has enjoyed since the Orange Revolution and in investigating the case of the murdered journalist, Hearhiy Gongadze. We look to the Ukrainian Government to maintain the momentum in order both to deliver sustainable growth and prosperity and to take Ukraine closer to the EU.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.2/1">Following consultation with key stakeholders, a pilot money advice project is being delivered in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 by Advice NI and Citizens Advice. The Department has allocated &pound;550,000 of funding to the pilot project. Over &pound;231,000 of the budget available has been drawn down to date. The locations of the specialist advice posts that are being funded are based on the evidence of unmet need identified by external independent consultants, and advice from Advice NI and Citizens Advice.</p>

Invest NI encourages potential investors to consider areas throughout Northern Ireland, including Dundonald, capable of sustaining the project in question. Ultimately it is the promoter of the project, and not Invest NI, that makes the final decision as to where the project will be established, although Invest NI's Local Offices Network works closely with key stakeholders to ensure that detailed information on sub-regional sales propositions is available to all potential investors.</p>
