The Act also allows the Secretary of State to compulsorily acquire a listed building herself though such powers are only exercised in exceptional circumstances. The Act requires the Secretary of State to consult English Heritage before she exercises the powers to confirm or make a CPO.</p>

	<p pid="a.2660W.8/1">The reform of licensing and gambling laws share many of the same guiding principles. These include better protection for children, the prevention of crime and disorder and a generally tougher regime to deal with rogue operators. Changes also provide for increased local decision making, and will deliver more choice for the citizen. We therefore consider the reforms in each area to be mutually supportive.</p>

	<p pid="a.2664W.8/2">The first review of the Beachy Head to Selsey bill shoreline management plan (SMP) Unit 20 recommends a policy of managed re-alignment for the River Arun to Poole Place Groyne frontage, Littlehampton. It is proposed that this policy will enable the shape of the coastline to be realigned slightly to enable a more naturally functioning coastline to develop. The exact details of any realignment scheme, including the need for any secondary defences, will be developed in due course following agreement of the SMP.</p>
	<p pid="a.2664W.8/3">There are historical agreements that cover the western 1.5km of this 3.5km frontage. These agreements relate to the maintenance of the shingle beach and groynes that were in place when the agreements were made. The Environment Agency has had dialogue with the landowner and is due to meet him in the new year to discuss the long-term plans for the frontage. The Environment Agency is also continuing with operations to maintain the shingle defence by recycling material along the frontage, and will undertake some work on the timber groynes early in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.2667W.3/1">As my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has separately reported to the House, agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime was successfully concluded under the UK Presidency at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2667W.3/2">The Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by DEFRA following the publication of the Commission's proposals for reform in June this year included consideration of the likely impact on employment in both the sugar production and processing sectors in the UK as well as in companies using sugar as a raw ingredient.</p>
	<p pid="a.2667W.3/3">A significant employer in London in the sugar sector is Tate and Lyle. Assessing the impact on its business of the decisions now reached is a commercial matter for the company itself. In a press release issued following the Council agreement the company made the following statement,</p>
	<p pid="a.2667W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Whilst the long-term impact on Tate &amp; Lyle remains significant, the final decision to make the cut in the sugar reference price of 36% (instead of the 39% previously proposed) and to delay the implementation of the price reduction is very welcome.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.2668W.6/1">The Environment Agency is the principal authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England. The extent to which both the Clywedog and Vyrnwy Reservoirs can help mitigate the effects of flooding in the Severn Basin is limited as any beneficial effect to alleviate flooding rapidly diminishes downstream. Other parts of the catchment also contribute floodwater and the proportion that the reservoir &quot;holds back&quot; becomes smaller as the total catchment area gets bigger.</p>
	<p pid="a.2668W.6/2">The catchment area above Clywedog Dam is 2 per cent. of the entire catchment draining to Shrewsbury and 1 per cent. of the catchment draining to Bridgnorth. Previous studies have indicated that the influence of floodwater storage at Llyn Clywedog has extended only as far as Buttington.</p>
	<p pid="a.2668W.6/3">A study in 1999 for the Environment Agency confirmed that existing reservoir flood drawdown controls, in place for many years, adequately maximise the opportunity for local flood alleviation. The findings of this study have been reviewed as part of the Fluvial Severn Flood Risk Management Strategy, which was issued for public consultation (including to local MPs) in the summer of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.2668W.6/4">The Environment Agency's strategy to lower water levels in these reservoirs means more storage being available to hold water during periods of heavy rainfall. This assists flood risk management in the Severn Basin insofar as the reservoirs influence this. However, it should be remembered that the primary function of the reservoirs is to maintain flow in the River Severn during dry periods.</p>

	<p pid="a.2672W.2/1">All spiders have the ability to produce venom with which they immobilise their prey, but not all spiders are considered to be venomous in the sense that they may pose a threat to human health.</p>
	<p pid="a.2672W.2/2">No one agency collates all the recorded finds of non-native spiders found in the UK. Specimens are sent to a variety of organisations including local environmental health officers, pest control companies, local and national museums and universities for examination and identification. It is therefore impossible to put an absolute figure on the number of non-native spiders recorded in the UK on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.2672W.2/3">The Central Science Laboratory, an executive agency of DEFRA, provides an invertebrate identification service primarily for plant health quarantine purposes and does receive a limited number of spider specimens each year. During the last five-year period this service saw an average of 26 spiders per annum, almost all collected off plant material with some import connection. Approximately 90 per cent. of these were non-native species. Of these, only one species, the Melbourne trap-door spider (Stanwellia grisea), is considered to be venomous to man. One confirmed, and two unconfirmed, specimens of this species were intercepted on tree ferns imported from Australia in 2004. This spider has very large fangs and can inflict a painful, but not dangerous bite. Since this find, tree ferns have been subject to greater control prior to export from Australia and New Zealand and so live invertebrates such as this are less likely to be encountered on this commodity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2672W.2/4">Another traditional means of spiders entering the country in an uncontrolled way has been via bananas, although this is now very rare since not only are banana crops increasingly sprayed with pesticides during growth, but refrigeration kills any travellers who escape that. Similarly, arrival on uncut timber is much reduced, since the amount of 'raw' timber imported has fallen, replaced by processed timber.</p>

	<p pid="a.2674W.2/2">The creation of Environmental Stewardship (of which Entry Level Stewardship is a part), involved extensive consultations with stakeholders and other interested groups. Entry Level Stewardship, as the 'whole farm' scheme open to all farmers and land managers, has been designed to cover the vast majority of landscapes and farming systems in England, including those found in upland areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2674W.2/3">The uplands have a specific range of options, such as those relating to moorland and rough grazing which take into account farming systems in those areas. Entry Level Stewardship has a national payment rate of &pound;30 per hectare, per year, however land parcels of 15 hectares or more in the Less Favoured Area, are eligible for payments of &pound;8 per hectare, per year. This lower payment rate reflects the reduced management input required for these options.</p>

	<p pid="a.2676W.2/1">DFID leads the Government's efforts to develop alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan. In financial year 2005&ndash;06, DFID is spending over &pound;45 million on alternative livelihoods. This is almost a tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.2676W.2/2">DFID's assistance is closely aligned with the Government of Afghanistan's leadership on alternative livelihoods. DFID has invested a &pound;27 million in quick impact alternative livelihoods this year. This is going through the Afghan Government's National Priority Programmes. This support will provide over 3 million labour days; access to microfinance for over 20,000 new clients including opium debt refinancing; and support for local infrastructure development to 150 villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.2676W.2/3">DFID funding also helps improve long-term agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. DFID is contributing a joint US$30 million nationwide programme with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to increase access for over 500,000 farmers to seeds and fertiliser as an alternative to poppy. Innovative ways for farmers to make a living are also being pursued, including apricot drying, honey bee keeping, tailoring and weaving and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production.</p>
	<p pid="a.2676W.2/4">At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, it is important to develop non-farm alternative livelihoods if we are to ensure longer term sustainability. DFID activities in Badakshan and Eastern Hazarajat provinces are developing sustainable economic alternatives and social incentives to enable farmers to stop growing poppy.</p>

	<p pid="a.2677W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="">19 December 2205</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.2677W.3/2">The Nuffield Council on Bioethics report (2004) provided a review of the actual and potential benefits of genetically modified (GM) crops for developing countries. The Government shares the report's conclusions that achieving food security and reducing poverty in developing countries are complex issues, that GM crops are unlikely to feed the world, but that in some circumstances they could make a useful contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2677W.3/3">In 2000, DFID funded a study on the development of methodologies for assessing the impacts of modern agricultural biotechnology on poor people. DFID has not made specific assessments on the benefits or potential problems of golden rice or the impact of biotechnology companies on seed sharing and saving in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2677W.3/4">DFID takes genetic modification in crops and foods and its potential impacts on developing countries very seriously. Our approach is based on the principle that the health of people and their environment is of primary concern. We recognise that GM technology in itself will not solve the problem of world hunger. It can, however, be used safely and effectively to promote development and reduce poverty, if managed responsibly and applied to those crops on which the poor rely.</p>
	<p pid="a.2677W.3/5">Recognising that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with GM crops, developing countries should be able to make their own informed choices about whether to adopt GM technologies. To this end, DFID worked with The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and other Government Departments to establish the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2677W.3/6">The Protocol aims to ensure that countries are provided with the information necessary to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of genetically modified organisms. It also facilitates the exchange of information on living modified organisms and assists countries in the implementation of the Protocol. The Protocol has a strong precautionary approach. This means that importing countries are able to make a decision to avoid or minimise potential adverse effects of GM organisms, even if there is a lack of scientific certainty on the extent of such potential adverse effects.</p>

	<p pid="a.2688W.2/1">The increase in expenditure by the national health service on abortions is likely to be due to a number of factors. The NHS is now funding more abortions than in 1997 (from 123,886 to 152,385 in 2004, a 23 per cent. increase) and the cost of performing an abortion has increased since 1997, as has been the case for most other treatments.</p>

	<p pid="a.2688W.5/1">In the United Kingdom mifepristone (RU486) and the emergency contraceptive pill (as Levonelle-2) have been available as prescription-only medicines since 1991, following advice from the then Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) that was based on a review of all the available evidence for safety, efficacy and quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.2688W.5/2">The safety of mifepristone and the emergency contraceptive pill are also monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a continual basis using both UK and international data. Thus, yellow card reports of suspected adverse drug reactions, periodic safety update reports submitted by marketing authorisation holders and new research published in the medical literature are reviewed regularly. In the event that these processes identify information that changes the balance of risks and benefits of a medicine, advice is sought from the Commission on Human Medicines, formerly the Committee on Safety of Medicines, and its expert advisory groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.2688W.5/3">When a medicine is on the market, the Department will (re-)review its use in response to a specific stimulus, such as a safety concern, a proposed change in policy or a proposal to change the dose, indication or legal classification. Such reviews take into consideration all relevant data, regardless of whether it was generated in the UK or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.2688W.5/4">The MHRA, in consultation with the wider Department, reviewed the use of the emergency contraceptive pill in 2001, when Levonelle-2 was made available for sale in pharmacies as Levonelle; in 2003, when the dosing regimen was changed from taking two tablets 12 hours apart to taking them at the same time; and in relation to this, when the strength of the pill was doubled in 2004. Advice from the CSM was sought on all occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2688W.5/5">The use of mifepristone was most recently reviewed by the MHRA in September 2005. This followed the receipt of new information about the reporting of serious suspected adverse reactions in the United States of America. No new safety concerns were identified and no action considered necessary. We are also aware that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reviewed the use of mifepristone when producing the 2004 edition of its evidence-based guideline 'The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion'.</p>
	<p pid="a.2688W.5/6">As with all licensed medicines, the safety of the emergency contraceptive pill and mifepristone will continue to be monitored by the MHRA.</p>

We are aware of the possibility that a pandemic may strike before the antiviral stockpile is complete. The guidance we have published on antiviral storage and distribution takes this into account. Access to antivirals will need to be prioritised, initially to healthcare workers, and to those who fall into one of the 'clinical at risk' groups, as defined for seasonal flu. We have already received 3.3 million treatment courses, so the issue of prioritisation of healthcare workers should not arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.2691W.5/1">Consideration has been given to the application of the Human Rights Act to independent sector bodies carrying out national health service services, and to organisations registered under the Care Standards Act 2000. My noble Friend, Baroness Ashton recently said in parliamentary debate:</p>
	<p pid="a.2691W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;On the issue of public authority . . . we share the disappointment about the way 'pubic authority' in the Human Rights Act has been interpreted by the courts. The narrow construction of the definition has not fulfilled our hopes and expectations. The Government are following the advice of the Joint Committee and adopting two strategies to approach the problem. First, . . . we are actively seeking a suitable case in which to intervene to argue for a wider definition of public authority. That would include the point . . . on local authority-funded residents in private care homes, such as the Leonard Cheshire case.</p>
	<p pid="a.2691W.5/3" class="indent">Furthermore, we are issuing guidance on how the contracts between public authorities and private organisations for the provision of services may seek to protect convention rights. This is a very important area; noble Lords have referred to the need to think about it very carefully. It will benefit from careful consideration and will therefore be a matter for the discrimination law review to consider.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.2693W.0/1">New community pharmacy contractual arrangements provide the framework for pharmacy to make a positive contribution to tackling key health priorities such as obesity and coronary heart disease and to improving the health of the public, including where health inequalities persist.</p>

	<p pid="a.2693W.0/3">We published &quot;Choosing Health through Pharmacy&mdash; A programme for pharmaceutical public health&quot; in April 2005, which aims to maximise the contribution of pharmacists, their staff and the premises in which they work to improve health and reduce health inequalities. This strategy will enable pharmacists and their staff to make better use of their skills and it will open up opportunities for pharmacy to make a bigger difference to improving the health of people in England. PCTs can commission local enhanced services to meet identified health needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.2693W.0/4">Although we do not hold details centrally on the number of pharmacists planning to offer health checks or the numbers of such checks, we have developed an assurance framework for PCTs to use in monitoring pharmacy's implementation of new contractual requirements, and also strategic tests for strategic health authorities to monitor how PCTs are using the new framework to deliver key health priorities and objectives locally.</p>

This consideration will reflect: the principles set out in the Cabinet Office guidance &quot;Departmental Evidence and Response to Select Committees &quot;(July 2005); the policy outlined in the Department for Constitutional Affairs' Devolution Guidance Note number 12 &quot;Attendance of UK Ministers and Officials at Committees of the devolved legislatures&quot;, and the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. The principles underlying the provision of information to House of Commons Select Committees are set out in &quot;Departmental Evidence and Response to Select Committees&quot;, particularly sections 4B and 4C.</p>

It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide on how best to use these resources based on the needs of their local populations.

	<p pid="a.2705W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase>, we launched a new rapid process for assessing drugs and other treatments to sit alongside the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) global standard process. This new single technology appraisal (STA) will be used to produce faster guidance on life-saving drugs which have been licensed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2705W.2/4">Roche, the manufacturer of Herceptin, has announced that its application for a licence will be made to the European medicines agency for the evaluation of medical products in February 2006, with a decision anticipated by July 2006 at the earliest. The new STA will allow NICE to react as soon as possible after the drug is licensed.</p>

	<p pid="a.2706W.5/2">The discharge of terminally ill patients from hospital is based on the clinical decision of the health service staff responsible for that patient's care. Decisions on discharge are informed by the recommendations in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance on supportive and palliative care, published in 2004. The guidance endorses the use of three key tools: the gold standard framework, the Liverpool care pathway and the preferred place of care, which support clinicians and patients to plan how and where services are provided that best meet the wishes of the patient. The national roll-out of these tools is a key part of the end of life care programme, which is a three-year Government programme to provide patients with the choice to die at home.</p>

	<p pid="a.2710W.2/1">We are in the process of analysing the responses to the consultation on the independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) service which ended on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>. We received 174 written responses to the consultation. In addition, some 450 people attended regional road shows to put forward their views on the consultation in a more informal way.</p>

The aim will be to keep statutory regulation to the minimum. The Government will publish the results of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2710W.2/3">As part of the development work for the IMCA service we are setting up some IMCA pilots to help identify the practical issues involved in implementing it.</p>

The pilots will test different ways of setting up this service&mdash;for example with full-time IMCA advocates and with sessional advocates. They will test systems for recording, referral and for monitoring. The outcome will be good practice guidance which will be useful both for the commissioners of this service when it becomes a national requirement and also for the future IMCA advocacy providers, many of whom may be small and will benefit from access to information about good practice in other advocacy services.</p>

	<p pid="a.2713W.11/1">Health Service Guidance 95(18) sets out the arrangements for the handling and laundering of linen and states the importance of securing the disinfection of used and infected linen, including uniforms. The guidance recommends that a wash at 65 degrees Celsius ( <sup>0</sup> C) for not less than 10 minutes, or at 71 <sup>0</sup> C for not less than three minutes, is more than adequate for uniforms. Most uniforms can be safely processed at this temperature; indeed white garments manufactured to a correct specification can safely be processed at 85 <sup>0</sup> C provided a cool down facility is incorporated within the washing process.</p>
	<p pid="a.2713W.11/2">In relation to washing uniforms at home, the advice from microbiologists is that a wash at a domestic clothes washer's temperature of 60 <sup>0</sup> C, followed by a rinse cycle, is more than adequate. The main point is the enormous dilution factor of the wash rather than the actual killing of the bacteria. The use of detergent will dislodge soil containing bacteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.2713W.11/3">Health Service Guidance 95(18) is currently under review which will clarify the expectations of NHS organisations in terms of laundering uniforms. This work is being supported by scientific research, and will include recommendations on temperatures for washing uniforms and other linen.</p>

	<p pid="a.2714W.2/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has been commissioned to prepare definitive guidance on the prevention, identification, management and treatment of obesity. This is expected to be published in February 2007, after full consultation. The Department's interim Obesity Care Pathway is intended for use by frontline health professionals in primary care to help manage patients who are overweight and/or obese. As part of the process of developing the draft Obesity Care Pathway, early drafts were shared with some interested stakeholders between September and November, to ascertain their views on how the care pathway might be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.2714W.2/3">A consultation on the content is currently under way on a more advanced draft of the Obesity Care Pathway and related documents, and a draft weight loss guide. Consultees have been asked to respond by <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-03">3 January 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.2722W.2/1">As set out in &quot;Commissioning a Patient Led NHS&quot;, primary care trusts (PCTs) will be required to strengthen their commissioning function. They will need to ensure access and choice to a range of high quality health services and to ensure that the Government's commitments to health, reducing health inequalities and health services are delivered for local people. They will also be required to manage contracts on behalf of their practices and public, engage with local people and other local service providers to ensure patients' views are properly heard, and to be responsible for emergency planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.2722W.2/2">The policy, in relation to service-provision, is that this will be a matter for PCTs to determine locally. Any move away from direct provision of services will be a decision for the local national health service within the framework set out in the forthcoming White Paper and after local consultation, including staff.</p>

Following new advice from the US PDA, where this product is used in combination with another medicine that is not licensed for this purpose in the UK, serious adverse reactions, including cases of serious bacterial infection, associated with mifepristone have been reviewed. The regulatory authorities within Europe, including the UK, did not identify any new safety issues as a consequence of this review.</p>

	<p pid="a.2731W.5/3">Advice and guidance on hospital laundry arrangements was issued to NHS trusts in &quot;Health Service Guidance HSG (95)18&quot;. This sets out the arrangements for the handling and laundering of linen and states the importance of securing the disinfection of used and infected linen, including uniforms. This guidance is being reviewed to ensure it reflects current research evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.2735W.2/1">Decisions about the learning required by individual employers taking part in the employer training pilots are reached after discussions with skills brokers and help with identifying and assessing the training needs of low-skilled employees. As such decisions are business-related, we feel it is not appropriate to give information about the training and funding received by individual employers participating in ETP without first obtaining permission to do so from each employer. As of the end of November 2005, 26,434 employers had participated in employer training pilots.</p>

Discussions are being held with consultancy groups drawn from national samples of head teachers, teachers, local authority representatives, subject and professional organisations and higher education institutions. A consultation forum has been set up on the DfES website. To date, well over 100 contributors have taken part in consultancy group discussions and the website consultation forum has had 14 contributions posted on it, some of which are from local authorities feeding back comments from their meetings with local teachers.</p>

After Easter 2006, a draft revised framework will be published for more formal consultation. The Secretary of State made clear when she announced the Rose review and the renewal of the literacy framework in June 2005 that the findings of the Rose review would inform the development of the revised framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.2742W.2/1">The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 has had a very significant impact. In 1997, a third of children left primary schools without having mastered the basics in English and maths. Now three-quarters achieve in maths and even more in English. Many 5 to 7-year-olds were in classes of more than 30. That experience is a thing of the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.2742W.2/2">There have been sustained and substantial improvements in attainment at 14,16 and 18. There are many fewer failing schools. In 1998, 616 secondary schools secured 5 A*-Cs at GCSE for fewer than 25 per cent. of their pupils. Now that figure is 131. These achievements are important but we must now go further. Our White Paper &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools For All&quot; sets out our plans to do so.</p>

The Department is already tackling the issues raised through a coherent Quality Initiative which includes teaching training, workforce development and initiatives which will increase the quality of teaching and learning. This will form part of the Quality Improvement Strategy lead by the Quality Improvement Agency. Recent ALI and Ofsted reports have highlighted improvements in quality, eg improved diagnostic assessment and better use of teaching and learning materials.

	<p pid="a.2744W.8/2">I can confirm that all land and buildings held by a local authority for the purposes of a school becoming a trust school would normally transfer to and vest in the trust. The trustees would need to notify the school's maintaining local authority if they wished to dispose of any non-playing field land and, in the case of playing field land, they would need to obtain the prior consent of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills before disposing, or changing the use, of such land.</p>
	<p pid="a.2744W.8/3">The existing arrangements that deal with land issues when a foundation or voluntary school closes will also apply to trust schools. They will require the trustees of a closing trust school to apply to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to exercise her powers and direct that the land either be returned to the local authority or to pay her or the authority the whole or part of the value of the land. Where the discontinuance of a trust school is connected with proposals for the establishment of a new school she may direct that the land transfer to and vest in the governing body or trustees of the new school.</p>

	<p pid="a.2745W.3/1">The preparation work for the bid is already well advanced, and is being shared between the UK Government and skills partners in the business, voluntary and public sectors. This will help to build an enduring social partnership which will promote a higher level of skills investment across the UK as an important legacy effect. A national coalition of skills partners, including the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA), Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Investors in People UK (IiP UK), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the devolved Administrations, is working hard to secure the funding we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.2745W.3/2">We have put in place a Project Board and a UK-wide steering group chaired by myself to manage the bid process. At its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, the steering group endorsed the partnership approach as the best way forward and approved the plans for the Pre-Qualification Visit in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.2745W.3/3">In January a team from the WorldSkills Executive Board will visit us to validate our Expression of Interest against their essential criteria for hosting the event. If these criteria are met, we will be invited to submit a full bid. Our task will be to showcase the best that London can offer and convince the WorldSkills assessors that we mean business. We will then work with the LSC, the SSDA, IiP UK, UK Skills and the devolved Administrations to submit a full bid by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2745W.3/4">Our bid will eventually be presented to the WorldSkills Council in Melbourne in May, where we will find ourselves competing against France, Sweden and Australia. If successful, we will then build the national organisation and funding model we need to deliver the event.</p>

In 2011 we aim to field a full team comprising over 40 competitors in skills ranging from welding and autobody repair, to beauty therapy and restaurant service. We will use the Japan 2007 and Canada 2009 competitions to build our capacity to do this.

Our final choice will not be made until 2007&ndash;09.</p>

	<p pid="a.2759W.3/1">As is usual on large and complex projects, changes have been made to internal budgetary assumptions during the life of the Type 45 project to achieve the optimum balance between cost and capability. The planned reductions made in funding for the risk provision associated with the ship's combat system and funding for setting up initial support arrangements, which were listed in the 2005 major projects report, do not materially change the ship's capability. The reduction in funding of the incremental acquisition plan listed in the 2004 and 2005 major projects reports means that a number of capabilities over and above those originally planned for the first of class ship are not currently expected to be fitted to the class. These included enhanced electronic warfare capabilities. However, the Type-45 has been designed to enable its capability to be upgraded through life, and these capabilities may be added at a later stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.2764W.6/1">Any competent supplier may be invited to bid for such work. An objective evaluation of suitability to be invited to tender is made on a number of factors including, but not limited to, financial capability, quality assurance standards, supplier capability, organisation and management, supply chain management. Assessment of suitability is often facilitated through completion of a pre-qualification questionnaire. There is no absolute requirement to build all warships and Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels onshore, and the evaluation will also need to take into account the need to retain the ability to build, integrate and support complex ships in the UK, as set out in the recently published 'Defence Industrial Strategy'.</p>

The energy review will be bringing forward proposals next year&mdash;no decisions have been taken at this time and it is important the Government does not pre-empt the outcome of the review.

	<p pid="a.2776W.3/1">It is not possible to assess the average period between inspections. Inspections either follow notification of a complaint to the Employment Agency Standards (EAS) Inspectorate (when a follow up inspection may be carried relatively soon after the initial visit, if breaches of the legislation were identified), or as part of a targeted programme of inspections on the basis of risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.2776W.3/2">Thus, as inspections are not carried out on a routine basis, no meaningful figure is available. The interval between inspections is in fact a factor of complaints received and perceived risk based on the sector(s) and area in which the agency is operating.</p>

	<p pid="a.2781W.8/1">Government policy is not to intervene in the energy market except in extreme circumstances, such as a threat to safety. We take the issue of security of energy supplies, and rising energy prices, very seriously, and are leaving no stone unturned in finding ways to mitigate the impact on customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2781W.8/2">The Department has been working with the Energy Intensive Users Group, of which British Glass is a member, and Ofgem through the Gas Prices Working Group (GPWG) to develop ideas for improving the operation of the wholesale gas market and ways to mitigate the effects of high wholesale prices. The GPWG has agreed an Action List of short to medium term measures, including maximising UK gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.2781W.8/3">In particular, the Department has worked hard to smooth the regulatory path for the construction of major new pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands, as well as two further gas import terminals in Pembrokeshire, all of which will ease the supply situation. Ofgem's Demand Side Working Group is working closely with industry to ensure that any necessary demand-side response is delivered in an efficient, flexible and responsive way. Also, the Government has put a lot of effort into pressing for full liberalisation within the EU, including at the successful Energy Council on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, which I chaired, and this remains one of our key energy objectives. More recently, I have held meetings with the operators of North Sea gas fields, companies using the Bacton-Zeebrugge interconnector and the Isle of Grain gas import terminal to impress on them personally the importance I attach to the facilities operating effectively this winter.</p>

	<p pid="a.2784W.0/1">The following table sets out answers to these questions to the extent that data is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2784W.0/2">For the UK auto industry, employment data is not separately available for car manufacturing, as the total for vehicles also includes commercial vehicles and engines. For completeness, the table also includes employment at component suppliers, although this understates the true size of the UK auto industry as many suppliers to the industry are classified in the statistics according to what they make (e.g. steel, glass). The ONS Annual Business Inquiry does not have employment data for 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.2784W.0/3">From this data, it can be deduced that UK auto industry productivity is improving, both in terms of cars made per worker per annum, and GVA per employee. These are important measures that indicate continuing improvements in UK's auto manufacturing competitiveness on the global stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.2784W.0/4">As regards registrations data, new registrations are in the public domain and are quoted here. Used vehicle transaction data is normally a chargeable service from DVLA, but SMMT provides used car sales data on request, and this is quoted here.</p>
	<p pid="a.2784W.0/5">Data on the value of vehicle sales, new or used, is commercially sensitive within the industry and not published. However, data is available from ONS on the value added generated by the motor trade and this is quoted here. Again, the value added generated per employee is on a rising trend, indicating continually improving efficiency and competitiveness.</p>

	<p pid="a.2788W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2788W.8/2">The European Commission's impact assessment estimated the cost of compliance for an average paper mill to be &euro;7 million per year. This however was based on the Commission's original proposal and the scenario of a notification of a substance in magazine paper as an &quot;article&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2788W.8/3">The compromise text agreed under the UK presidency at Competitiveness Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December 2005</phrase> amended the notification requirements to only those that contain substances of high concern in quantities of over 1 tonne per year and where they are present over a concentration of 0.1 per cent. weight by weight. This will greatly reduce the burden on the paper industry and avoid having to test every batch of waste paper collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.2788W.8/4">The agreed compromise text also makes it clear that waste&mdash;as defined in Council Directive 75/4222/EEC&mdash;is exempt from the REACH regulations. This will minimise any impact on recycling and compliance with the landfill directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.2799W.5/2">There is no reason to believe that the introduction of home information packs will have an adverse effect on the housing market. These reforms are designed to improve the home buying process by making it more transparent and reducing the current high rate of transaction failure. A more efficient system will have clear benefits for the housing market and the UK economy. The information in the pack will help achieve the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's goal of sustainable home ownership, by ensuring that buyers are not faced with unexpected repairs and other commitments they cannot afford. A more efficient housing market will also facilitate greater flexibility and labour mobility. The partial regulatory impact assessment on home information packs shows that the cost of the new system will be broadly neutral and a copy of this has been deposited in the Library of the House. The only new cost being imposed on the system overall is the cost of a home condition report in a proportion of transactions. Any new and additional costs will be offset by savings from a reduction in wasted costs that are currently running at over &pound;1 million per day.</p>

I am replying in her absence. (38552 &amp; 38558)</p>
	<p pid="a.2800W.11/4" class="indent">No significant changes were made to the methodology used to calculate mid-year population estimates in 2002. The estimates published in 2002 were the mid-2001 population estimates and these were the first mid-year population estimates to use the 2001 Census results. The standard 'cohort component' methodology was used, in that Census data were updated to reflect births, deaths, migration, and ageing of the population between the date of the Census and the mid-year point (approximately 9 weeks). In a Census year the mid-year estimates are rebased on the most recent Census before the method is applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.2800W.11/5" class="indent">The most recent significant change to the way that the mid-year population estimates are compiled was made in 2000, and applies to the mid-1999 and subsequent estimates. This was in respect of the internal-migration component of the population estimates. This change was widely consulted on before introduction. It was extensively peer-reviewed both within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and by external academic and local authority experts. The then Liaison Group on Population Statistics (now the Central Local information Partnership (CLIP) Population Subgroup) was also fully consulted on the change. This change, in simplified terms, introduced the use of patient records to allocate migration within (former) health authorities instead of electoral roll information. This was widely thought to be a more reliable method for calculating internal migration. This change was documented in Population Trends 101. No specific racial impact assessment was carried out as part of this methodological change. However, consultation confirmed the recommendation that the methodology should be implemented to improve the quality of population estimates.</p>

Currently ONS has no plans to implement significant changes to the methodology used in the calculation of mid-2005 population estimates as research and evaluation is ongoing. (Mid-2005 population estimates are due to be published in August 2006.) However, this current position is subject to possible change. Before any changes are implemented, they will be carefully researched, evaluated and where possible assessed for impact.

	<p pid="a.2808W.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what percentage of the population is registered to vote in each Ward in Wales. (38272)</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/4" class="indent">I am placing a table giving the requested information in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/5" class="indent">The closest available geography to electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. It is necessary to convert electorate counts to the CAS ward geography and therefore the electorate counts are not necessarily consistent with data published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/6" class="indent">The latest available population data available at ward level is for mid-2002, published in April 2005. The ward electorate counts are for December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers. No adjustment has been made to reflect the difference between these two timepoints. There are a number of wards that are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. These are shown by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, and appear under both constituencies (except where the split is across the English/Welsh border). Electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. It is not possible to split the data for these wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/7" class="indent">There are a number of limitations with the data that mean that some care should be taken with interpretation of the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/8" class="indent">There is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. In addition, people can register in more than one place.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/9" class="indent">The population data are estimates and as such are subject to a margin of confidence. This margin of confidence is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority level estimates. These estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/10" class="indent">Finally, there a number of other definitional differences between electorates and population estimates. Population estimates include all those usually resident irrespective of nationality, whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included). Overseas electors are included in electorate data but not population estimates. Comparable ward counts of local government electors are not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2808W.8/11" class="indent">There is a relatively small number of wards (11) where the electorate counts are more than 10 per cent. greater than the population estimate. The majority of such cases are likely to be attributable to a limitation in the methodology used to convert electorate counts to a CAS ward geography, though the other limitations set out above will also have an effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.2810W.2/1">At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> the Public Accounts Commission considered a memorandum from the National Audit Office setting out its proposals for securing its future workspace requirements. These had been drawn up taking into account the views expressed during informal discussions between the NAO and myself, as Chairman of the Commission, and the hon. Member for Gainsborough, in his capacity as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/2">The NAO acquired its existing headquarters building in Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1 in 1984 for &pound;11 million, based on a 127 year lease at a peppercorn rent. Its interest in the building is now thought to be worth about &pound;22 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/3">The NAO's case for a significant upgrading of its headquarters accommodation rests on two main factors:</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/4" class="indent">the partial refurbishment of the NAO's current building in Buckingham Palace Road, carried out prior to their taking occupancy in 1986, will shortly reach the end of its 20-year life expectancy</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/5" class="indent">a full condition survey of the building in 2003 concluded that the NAO &quot;needed to invest significant expenditure in terms of the necessary, and in some cases urgent, renewal of existing elements of the building fabric and services, including the heating and cooling systems, windows, much of the roof covering and other features of a health and safety concern&quot;; these remedial works would need to be carried out within the constraints imposed by the listed status of the central core of the building.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/6">Faced with these conclusions, the NAO has reviewed the options available to it to meet its future accommodation needs, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/7" class="indent">a programme of restoration and repair of the building in its existing configuration</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/8" class="indent">a full refurbishment of the building designed to produce &quot;a more modern, flexible and efficient workspace&quot;, based on open plan principles conducive to flexible team-working</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/9" class="indent">the sale of the NAO's interest in the current building, and relocation to another site.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/10">Taking all these options into consideration, the NAO has concluded that a phased programme of refurbishment will provide the best value for money solution, and has approached the Commission both for approval in principle for such a course and for authority to incur expenditure on preparing a detailed design and firm costings.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/11">The cost of the refurbishment is provisionally estimated at &pound;150 million over 30 years, as against relocation options ranging from &pound;155 to &pound;250 million. The NAO points out, however, that these figures would need to be offset against current annual expenditure on maintaining and operating the existing BPR building of some &pound;4.4 million, which, discounted over 30 years, would equate to about &pound;81 million. So the net cost of all the options should be reduced by that amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/12">Expressed in terms of additional net resource requirements (and thus the direct impact on the NAO's Estimate) the NAO's preferred option of refurbishment of the BPR building produces the following estimated figures for years 1 to 3 (although the breakdown between capital and revenue may well change following detailed planning):</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="a.2810W.2/15"> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th> <th>&pound; million</th> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.2810W.2/16"> <th></th> <th>Year l<br/> (2007&ndash;08)</th> <th>Year 2<br/> (2008&ndash;09)</th> <th>Year 3<br/> (2009&ndash;10)</th> <th>Total<br/> for years</th> </tr>
		</thead>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/24">By contrast, the relocation options would involve an initial negative capital expenditure, as the cost of any necessary works would be more than offset by the proceeds of the NAO's interest in the current building. Thereafter, however, the stream of annual costs arising from relocation would be significantly greater than those for refurbishment&mdash;reflecting mainly the difference between the current peppercorn and future commercial rents.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/25">In preparation for the Commission's meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>, both the hon. Member for Gainsborough and myself visited the Buckingham Palace Road site. We saw not only the current cramped layout and run-down condition of the building, but also the results of a trial refurbishment and conversion to open plan operation of part of the sixth floor. This reorganisation of the workspace represents a stark contrast with the rest of the building and we understand it has already shown tentative results in terms of improved staff morale and efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/26">We reported these findings to the Commission. Having taken oral evidence from the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Assistant Auditor General responsible for the building project, the Commission accepted the NAO's case for a substantial upgrade of its workspace. Specifically, the Commission agreed:</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/27" class="indent">(i) to approve in principle the NAO's plans to refurbish its Buckingham Palace Road headquarters, subject to project costs being confirmed</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/28" class="indent">within a reasonable range of the estimates and projections contained in the NAO's memorandum to the Commission;</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/29" class="indent">in time for submission to the Commission for consideration as part of the NAO's next Corporate Plan, for 2007&ndash;08 to 2009&ndash;10;</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/30" class="indent">(ii) to authorise the NAO</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/31" class="indent">to incur expenditure of approximately &pound;500,000 on the preparation of detailed costings for the refurbishment project</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/32" class="indent">to include provision in its Estimate for 2006&ndash;07 for any of the relevant expenditure falling in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/33">In order to ensure that the NAO's business case is as robust as possible against other options, the Commission has asked it to carry out a cost/benefit analysis of the option of relocating the headquarters building to a north of England location. We have also asked for a detailed explanation of the NAO's reasons for rejecting the option of relocating to a building of similar age on the Civil Estate in London SW1.</p>
	<p pid="a.2810W.2/34">The NAO's memorandum setting out its case for the refurbishment option, and the transcript of the evidence given by the Comptroller and Auditor General at the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> are available on the Commission website, at <a href="http://www.parliament.uk">www.parliament.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="a.2821W.5/1">Northamptonshire recently received a boost to its higher education provision when the University College in Northampton gained the Royal Charter and official university status. This is good news for the communities of Northamptonshire who will benefit from the university located at the heart of the county and the university is looking to expand its provision significantly over the next five years. In addition, the Tresham Institute serves the communities of North Northamptonshire, providing Post-16 education, vocational training and a wide variety of adult learning courses. Tresham is also an associate college of De Montfort university, so offers a range of professional and degree level courses. The institute plans to open a new &pound;20 million campus in Kettering in early 2007 as part of a wider programme to renewal all of its campuses by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.2821W.5/2">The Milton Keynes-South Midlands sub regional strategy identifies the need to expand higher education resources to serve the increasing education and training needs of the sub-region's population and states that it has a key part to play in the growth of the area. I understand that local growth partners in North Northamptonshire recognise that physical presence by a university is an important element in supporting a broad range of jobs, opportunities and economic development of the area and are in early discussions with education providers to explore how this could be best be strengthened. Officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would expect to be involved in these discussions at the appropriate stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.2823W.2/1">No specific research has been commissioned on this, as there is no reason to believe that the introduction of home information packs will have a significant effect on house prices. The only new cost being imposed on the system overall is the cost of a home condition report in a proportion of transactions. Together with the rest of the information in the pack, this will help to ensure that house prices are set more realistically and buyers are not faced with unexpected repair bills and other commitments they cannot afford. The reforms are designed to improve the home buying process by making it more transparent and reducing the current high rate of transaction failure. A more efficient system will benefit the housing market and the UK economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.2823W.5/3">Increase transparency&mdash;at present, key information about the property only becomes available after terms have been agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.2823W.5/5">Reduce the huge abortive costs for consumers&mdash;over &pound;350 million spent by consumers on failed transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2823W.5/6">Speed up the transaction process&mdash;sales take twice the time of the European average; HIPs should bring us more into line with overseas experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.2823W.5/7">Improve consumer redress&mdash;estate agents marketing homes with packs will be required, for the first time, to belong to an approved redress scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.2823W.5/8">Improve the position for first time buyers&mdash;they will receive pack information &quot;free&quot;, thus reducing the cost of entry into home ownership.</p>

The home condition report in the pack will contain an energy efficiency report and certificate. This will assist the delivery of the Government's target of a 20 per cent. reduction in residential carbon emissions by 2010.

	<p pid="a.2831W.11/1">Northamptonshire recently received a boost to its higher education provision when the University College in Northampton gained the Royal Charter and official University status. This is good news for the communities of Northamptonshire who will benefit from the university located at the heart of the County and the university is looking to expand its provision significantly over the next five years. In addition, the Tresham Institute serves the communities of North Northamptonshire, providing Post-16 Education, Vocational Training and a wide variety of Adult Learning Courses. Tresham is also an associate college of De Montfort University, so offers a range of professional and degree level courses. The institute plans to open a new &pound;20 million campus in Kettering in early 2007 as part of a wider programme to renewal all of its campuses by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.2831W.11/2">The Milton Keynes-South Midlands Sub Regional Strategy identifies the need to expand higher education resources to serve the increasing education and training needs of the Sub-Region's population and states that it has a key part to play in the growth of the area. I understand that local growth partners in North Northamptonshire recognise that physical presence by a university is an important element in supporting a broad range of jobs, opportunities and economic development of the area and are in early discussions with education providers to explore how this could be best be strengthened. Officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would expect to be involved in these discussions at the appropriate stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.2837W.10/2">A total of around US $26 million has so far been pledged to the Afghan Counter Narcotics Trust Fund. So far, A$2 million (US$1.5 million) from Australia and NZ$500,000 (US$0.35 million) from New Zealand have been transferred into the Fund. The United Nations Development Programme will contribute US $300,000 towards the management of the Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.2837W.10/3">The European Commission has made a firm commitment to the Fund of 15 million euros ($18 million), and for 2005&ndash;06 the UK, through the Afghan Drugs Inter-Departmental Unit, has made a firm commitment of &pound;3.5 million (US$6 million). The Department for International Development is considering a contribution of &pound;20 million over three years, making a total initial UK contribution of around US $40 million. At least seven other donors have expressed an interest in contributing but have not yet pledged money.</p>
	<p pid="a.2837W.10/4">The Trust Fund does not require a large minimum amount in it to make it financially viable. These pledges are already enough to make it a worthwhile funding instrument.</p>

Whether any particular &quot;rendition&quot; is lawful depends on the facts of each individual case. Where we are requested to assist another State and our assistance would be lawful, we will decide whether or not to assist taking into account all the circumstances. We would not assist in any case if to do so would put us in breach of UK law or our international obligations, including under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In particular, we would not facilitate or permit the transfer of an individual from or through the UK to another State where there were grounds to believe that the person would face a real risk of torture.</p>

	<p pid="a.2841W.2/2">There is no legal obligation for carriers to provide passenger lists when refuelling, overflying or landing at UK Overseas Territories. The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation applies equally to UK Overseas Territories as it does to the UK. Article 5 provides that airlines are not required to seek prior permission for non-stop flights across the territory of another state or to make a non-traffic stop in another state. Refuelling is a non-traffic stop (i.e. where no passengers or cargo are taken on board or dropped off).</p>

	<p pid="a.2856W.6/3">The carer's allowance claim pack is kept under review and improvements are introduced on an ongoing basis. Claims can be made in writing, by phone and on-line, and can be accepted by organisations such as Age Concern and Citizens Advice as well as DWP offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.2856W.6/4">The weekly rate of carer's allowance is increased annually in line with the Retail Prices Index. As announced on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>, it will go up to &pound;46.96 in April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.2857W.11/5" class="indent">In 2004/05 the Agency had an internal target 'to ensure that 60% of all new applications cleared resulted in full maintenance calculations', with the remainder being closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2857W.11/6" class="indent">In 2005/6, this target was dropped as it was recognised that Agency staff had no control over whether or not a parent with care chose to close their case prior to it reaching a calculation, or whether a case is subject to a reduced benefit decision or claiming good cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.2857W.11/7" class="indent">At September 2005, 44% (scheme to date) of all new applications cleared resulted in a full maintenance calculation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2857W.11/8" class="indent">However the Agency definition of 'cleared' has recently changed following improvements and availability of management information. Where as previously a 'clearance' only included a case which had been closed or had received a calculation, it now includes cases subject to a reduced benefit decision, claiming good cause or identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case (as opposed to a new application). As a result, the volume of recorded clearances rose, making the proportion of clearances resulting in a maintenance calculation lower than the 60% originally envisaged in 2004/5.</p>

	<p pid="a.2860W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.2860W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2860W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the total of unpaid maintenance owed by the Child Support Agency to parents with care has been in each quarter since 1997; how much has been written off each year as uncollectable maintenance; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2860W.2/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency does not owe child maintenance to parents with care; child maintenance is owed by non-resident parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.2860W.2/6" class="indent">The Child Support Agency has no legislative power to write off debt, and current debt is now the cumulative total of 12 years. For accounting purposes the Agency accepts that in some cases some debt is &quot;probably un-collectable&quot; (for example, where the non-resident parent is long-term unemployed, has gone abroad, or has died). The accounts have been adjusted accordingly: however the full amount owed remains due from the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2860W.2/7" class="indent">The table below summarises the cumulative total of the Child Support Agency's &quot;collectable&quot; and &quot;probably un-collectable&quot; debt on an annual basis since 1996/97. It is extracted from the annual debt analysis and is as reported in the Annual Report and Accounts. Information is not held on a quarterly basis:</p>

In order to support the delivery of its work agenda and realise the benefits of modernisation, the Department's human resource strategy is for a smaller work force that is more highly skilled, more productive, better motivated and rewarded, delivering an improved level of customer service.</p>
	<p pid="a.2867W.2/2">A key element of the Department's human resource strategy, set out in the 2004 Spending Review, is the managed reduction in staff numbers of 30,000 posts by March 2008 taking place alongside significant investment in information systems.

Violent crime has fallen by 43 per cent. since a peak in 1995, an estimated 1.8 million fewer incidents. Although the Home Office has not commissioned any specific research into the role of alcohol and its impact on levels of violent crime it does monitor, via social surveys, levels of alcohol-related crime including violent crime. Data from the British crime survey on the percentage of violent incidents in England and Wales in which the victim believed one or more offenders was 'under the influence of drink' are published on a regular basis. The Offending crime and justice survey also contain information on the role of alcohol and violent offences and this information is also published on a regular basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.2879W.2/1">Criminal offences, including incidents of fraud, should be reported to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.2879W.2/2">A large amount of fraud can be prevented if organisations have proper fraud prevention measures in place and individuals take simple precautions to protect themselves. Government therefore works closely with the finance and retail sectors as well as with the police to combat fraud and takes an active role in improving public awareness of fraud and how to avoid becoming a victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.2879W.2/3">For firms which are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Financial Services and Markets Act gives the FSA a role in preventing financial crime, including fraud. The FSA handbook includes a requirement that firms take reasonable care to establish and maintain effective systems and controls for countering the risk that they might be used to further financial crime and there is also an explicit requirement to report significant fraud. The combined code on corporate governance similarly requires all listed companies to maintain sound systems of internal control so as to safeguard company assets against relevant business risks, including the risk of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.2879W.2/4">Terms of reference for a wide-ranging cross Government review of fraud were announced by the Attorney-General on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>. The review will look at the scale of the problem, the appropriate role for Government in dealing with fraud and how resources could best be spent to maximise value for money across the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.2884W.2/1">The Home Office commissions a variety of social and scientific research in order to improve policy making, decision taking and to provide the public and Parliament with information necessary for informed debate and for future use. All high quality social research outputs will either be published by the Home Office, or permission granted for such outputs to be published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.2884W.2/2">The majority of social research is published as online reports, freely available on the Home Office website. Some works are still published in paper form, such as the Home Office research studies, and the summary publication: Findings. The Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) Business Plan 2005&ndash;06 outlines the wide range of work carried out by HOSDB to deliver on the (recently published) HO Science and Innovation Strategy, increasing the effective use of physical sciences in Home Office business. The HOSDB Business Plan is available on the Home Office website. HOSDB is carrying out in excess of 100 science and technology projects to increase the capabilities of its stakeholders. As has been the case for many years, publications arising from the (non-classified) work will be made available in hard copy and (more recently) on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid="a.2884W.2/3">Other (classified) publications will be given a limited circulation and issued to key stakeholders in their preferred format as appropriate. The Forensic Science Service carries out projects funded by the Home Office Hard Science research and development fund. The results of these projects are published when appropriate in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
	<p pid="a.2884W.2/4">There are a number of other areas of the Department that also undertake research to inform policy development. The available information providing details of the research projects currently being undertaken across the Department and its agencies has been summarised in tables which will be placed in the Library, together with copies of the business plan for RDS NOMS.</p>

	<p pid="a.2887W.2/1">The Home Office has welcomed the Strategy Unit Report Improving Life Chances for Disabled People. The package of recommendations put forward should deliver improved outcomes for disabled people, their families and society as a whole. Although the Home Office does not hold sole responsibility for the recommendations put forward, the department has responded positively by taking forward the joint recommendations as part of the work on public sector duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The department, working closely with the new Office of Disability Issues and the Disability Rights Commission is reviewing its policies and services to identify the action needed to deliver equality for disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.2891W.5/1">The Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 amends the Road Traffic Act 1988 to authorise the police to conduct compulsory roadside test for impairment and for the presence of drugs. Any equipment used to test for drugs by testing a specimen of sweat or saliva must be of a type approved by the Secretary of State. Since there is as yet no such equipment, tests cannot at present be conducted. It is therefore not possible to give the unit cost per test or the cost of the equipment necessary to conduct the test.</p>
	<p pid="a.2891W.5/2">A detailed device specification is currently in preparation. We hope this will be available in early 2006. Manufacturers will then be able to submit to the rigorous type approval process any device they have developed which complies with the specification.</p>

This will provide a new basis for Ministers in the Council to set strategic organised crime priorities.</p>

Government grant and central spending on services for the police will have increased by 56 per cent. or almost &pound;4 billion between 2000&ndash;01 and 2007&ndash;08.

	<p pid="a.2898W.5/2">Streamlining administrative licensing processes by the police under the Licensing Act 2003 should lead to a saving of up to &pound;15million annually. The Act gives the police further powers to tackle alcohol related disorder, for example, by allowing temporary or permanent reductions in trading hours. Through the Violent Crime Reduction Bill we are also introducing further powers for the police to help them tackle the problems of alcohol related crime or disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.2898W.5/3">We have also recently announced funding of &pound;2.5 million to boost a range of operations to crack down on alcohol-related disorder; the sale of alcohol to under-18s and drunks; and the closure of problem premises.</p>

	<p pid="a.2899W.0/2">There are no offences under The Motor Vehicles (Safety Equipment for Children) Act 1991.</p>
	<p pid="a.2899W.0/3">The Motor Vehicles (Safety Equipment for Children) Act 1991 enables regulations to be made about the type of restraints (e.g. car child seats) to be used by children in motor vehicles. It also covers the information to be provided on the installation and use of such restraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.2899W.0/4">No such regulations have been made. Instead, provisions for child restraints are included in the Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) Regulations 1993 (SI 1993 No 176) and the Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts by Children in Front Seats) Regulations 1993 (SI 1993 No 31) made under sections 14 and 15 (as amended) of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>
	<p pid="a.2899W.0/5">Those Regulations refer to the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (SI 1986 No 1078) which demand that child restraints satisfy the requirements of the British Standards Institute or the international requirements of EC Directive 77/541/EEC or Regulation 44 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. In addition to performance standards, these include requirements for installation instructions to be provided with new restraints.</p>

On this basis, we propose through the Road Safety Bill, currently under consideration in another place, to provide the courts with powers to refer people convicted of speeding and careless driving offences to retraining courses with the incentive of a reduction in disqualification or penalty points.

	<p pid="a.2910W.2/1">The Department completed research into the effectiveness of airbags in motor vehicles in 2003. The principal findings were presented at the International Research Council on the Biomechanics of Impact International Conference 2002. This project focused on obtaining an improved understanding of the overall benefits and risks involved with both front and side airbag deployments for a range of vehicle occupants. The project determined that in general frontal airbags offer extra protection to vehicle occupants, with significant overall benefits for head injuries. The benefits for thoracic injuries are less clear, and airbags are less effective at reducing injuries in certain types of accidents (such as angled impacts, pole impacts and high intrusion impacts). There is insufficient data available at present to draw any firm conclusions on the risks and benefits of deploying side airbags.</p>

	<p pid="a.2921W.2/1">It is for the courts to provide an authoritative interpretation of the law, and two High Court judgments have confirmed miniature motor scooters to be motor vehicles within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended. We believe it likely that a similar ruling could be made on other vehicles, such as miniature motorcycles, should a court case arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.2921W.2/2">Motor vehicles on the public highway must meet relevant construction requirements and be registered, taxed, insured etc. Drivers/riders must hold an appropriate licence and where necessary wear a suitable helmet. Off-highway use is possible where landowners' permission (whether private or public landowners) is received.</p>
	<p pid="a.2921W.2/3">Enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for individual Chief Officers of Police. In addition police forces can counter irresponsible use of miniature motor scooters and other such vehicles under the Police Reform Act 2002. This enables the police to seize vehicles being driven in a careless and inconsiderate manner or off-road without consent and in a way which causes alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.2921W.2/4">I understand that the packaging on powered items such as miniature scooters or motorcycles generally includes a warning that they are not for highway use. However it may be that, once such packaging is discarded, this is overlooked or ignored. The Department has issued guidance on our website to remind purchasers and others about responsible use of these vehicles and about possible penalties for mis-use, while the Home Office has published advice on its TOGETHER website for practitioners tackling the associated mis-use. In addition, a number of local authorities and police forces are running initiatives to inform the public about these matters, and are taking action where offences are committed.</p>

	<p pid="a.2922W.2/2">The &quot;Newcastle Upon Tyne Unitary Development Plan&quot; (UDP), adopted in January 1998 guides the consideration of possible locations for major travel generating development. The UDP also provides the context for decisions upon individual planning applications. In addition, Government's national planning policy documents&mdash;principally, planning policy guidance and planning policy statements&mdash;provide a context for the development of plans at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.2922W.2/3">In order to update and review the UDP, in consultation with the local community, the city council is producing a &quot;local development framework&quot; (LDF). The LDF will contain a suite of local development plan documents prepared under the powers of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2922W.2/4">Within the council's local development scheme,, effectively the LDF project plan of action, a key priority is to produce a &quot;core strategy&quot; development plan document which will be the subject of public consultation in 2006. The core strategy will provide a vision, strategic objectives, spatial strategy and an implementation framework for all other more detailed and site-specific development plans that will be produced in the city. It is these development plans that will help to shape how the city develops and regenerates over the current and next decade, including how development relates to the local transport system.</p>

	<p pid="a.2924W.5/3">As part of the approval process for rolling stock, the HSE takes into account the safety of both seated and standing passengers. Train operators monitor the levels of crowding on their trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.2924W.5/4">The Secretary of State has discussions with train operators on a wide range of topics, including how they respond to crowding.</p>

	<p pid="a.2925W.2/1">The information is not available in the form requested. Ticket sales figures include London as a destination but do not distinguish between different London termini. On average, there were 4700 return journeys between Bath Spa and London termini (London Paddington or London Waterloo) each week last year. The majority of these journeys would have been to London Paddington owing to the quicker journey time. Bath Spa -London Paddington takes one hour 50 minutes. Bath Spa- London Waterloo takes two hours 40 minutes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2928W.8/1">The performance regime the Department has in place with franchised train operators takes account of all train lateness on a train-by-train basis. When financial calculations are made every four-weeks, a single payment encompasses all the bonus and penalty elements occurring during that time period. These in turn aggregate into annual sums shown on the following table, which represent the net performance bonus to (or penalty payment from), each train operating company in each year requested. The amount shown is therefore the overall difference between performance penalties and bonuses.</p>

	<p pid="a.2929W.5/1">There are no proposals to apply penalties to train operating companies where trains are overcrowded. Train operators and Network Rail work together to make best use of available capacity to reduce overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.2929W.5/2">Focus is being given to improve timetabling, infrastructure maintenance and renewals and other factors that can impact on reliable delivery of train services, which in turn will impact on crowding levels. We will continue to review train counts and train plans to assess that resources are being deployed effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.2929W.8/1">This information is not held centrally by the Department. However following major investment in the network, a total of around 4200 new vehicles have been brought into service since 1996. This has resulted in the replacement of around 2000 Mark 1 slam door vehicles. It has also led to complete fleet replacements on the C2C, West Coast and Cross Country passenger services and replacement of some vehicles on other routes which were approaching the end of their operating life.</p>

	<p pid="a.2939W.5/1">Since the introduction of Local Transport Plans in 2000, East Sussex has received around &pound;58 million for local transport improvements and maintenance schemes. In addition the county has received almost &pound;5 million for major local transport schemes. We do not have the data to identify a figure separately for local transport investment in Battle. Funding for trunk roads is neither allocated nor recorded on a county by county basis but we can say that around &pound;22 million has been invested in the following schemes in East Sussex since 2000: A27 Polegate Bypass (&pound;19.3 million); A27 Ashcombe Roundabout (&pound;1.3 million) and A21 John's Cross Roundabout (&pound;1.7 million). East Sussex has also benefited from the new trains and associated power supply and depot upgrades delivered as part of the Mark 1 &quot;slam door&quot; stock replacement programme, the total value of the investment being in the region of &pound;2 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.2940W.0/1">International civil aviation is governed by the Chicago Convention. Under the convention, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is responsible for establishing minimum safety standards which contracting states are required to implement. States are required to recognise the certificates issued by other contracting states unless they have reason to believe that they have not been issued in accordance with ICAO standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.2940W.0/2">Any airline from outside the EU, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland which wishes to pick up or put down passengers or cargo in the UK requires a permit from the Secretary of State for Transport. It is a condition of the permit that the airline should be operated in accordance with international safety standards established by ICAO.</p>
	<p pid="a.2940W.0/3">If we have doubts about whether an aircraft or airline complies with international safety standards we will arrange for the aircraft to be inspected by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Permits may be refused, and existing permits suspended or revoked by the Secretary of State. This may occur where there is a breach of a permit condition, which would include non-compliance with international safety standards; however action can also be taken for reasons other than safety. Permit decisions will be reviewed in the light of new information or changed circumstances. An up to date list of airlines which have been refused permits is maintained on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.2940W.6/1">The Department for Transport provides financial assistance to incentivise the development and uptake of clean, low carbon road vehicles in the form of grants.

	<p pid="a.2942W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2942W.2/2">The following table sets out answers to these questions to the extent that data is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2942W.2/3">For the UK auto industry, employment data is not separately available for car manufacturing, as the total for vehicles also includes commercial vehicles and engines. For completeness, the table also includes employment at component suppliers, although this understates the true size of the UK auto industry as many suppliers to the industry are classified in the statistics according to what they make (e.g. steel, glass). The ONS Annual Business Inquiry does not have employment data for 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.2942W.2/4">From this data, it can be deduced that UK auto industry productivity is improving, both in terms of cars made per worker per annum, and GVA per employee. These are important measures that indicate continuing improvements in UK's auto manufacturing competitiveness on the global stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.2942W.2/5">As regards registrations data, new registrations are in the public domain and are quoted here. Used vehicle transaction data is normally a chargeable service from DVLA, but SMMT provides used car sales data on request, and this is quoted here.</p>
	<p pid="a.2942W.2/6">Data on the value of vehicle sales, new or used, is commercially sensitive within the industry and not published. However, data is available from ONS on the value added generated by the motor trade and this is quoted here. Again, the value added generated per employee is on a rising trend, indicating continually improving efficiency and competitiveness.</p>
