	<p pid="a.1980W.2/6" class="indent">The Official Solicitor and Public Trustee is the authority in England and Wales responsible for the enforcement of maintenance orders overseas. The UK has reciprocal arrangements with more than one hundred countries, which enable maintenance obligations to be established or recognised and enforced if the non-resident parent resides in one of those countries. The parent with care may apply to a magistrate's court for a maintenance order to be enforced overseas and procedures also exist to enable the parent with care to ask the foreign authorities to create an order for maintenance on their behalf. However this route cannot be used to enforce Child Support Agency debt that was incurred prior to the non-resident parent's move abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.1981W.2/1">Parental employment is the single biggest determinant of family income and children in out-of-work families are at a high risk of poverty. Work, therefore, continues to be the most sustainable route out of poverty. Our reforms of the welfare system have focused on helping people move into work, and increased employment has played an important role in reducing the number of children in relative poverty by 600,000 since 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="a.1981W.2/2">In particular, we have reduced the number of children in workless households by around 445,000 since 1997. The proportion of children in workless households currently stands at 15.5 per cent., down by 3.3 percentage points since 1997. We have increased the Great Britain lone parent employment rate which now stands at 56.3 per cent. The lone parent employment rate has increased by 11.6 percentage points since 1997 and this translates into an extra 320,000 lone parents in employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1981W.2/3">In addition to these reforms of the welfare system, the reforms we have already made to the child maintenance system, along with our intention to introduce a full child maintenance disregard, will lift over around 100,000 children out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1981W.2/4">However, we recognise that there is more that we need to do, particularly in these turbulent economic times. This is why we are continuing the process of welfare reform and introducing into legislation our commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.1982W.0/1">There is no official or agreed definition of severe poverty. The Households Below Average Income series presents a range of low-income thresholds (based on 50, 60 and 70 per cent. of median income).</p>
	<p pid="a.1982W.0/2">Child poverty statistics, published in the Households Below Average Income series, only allow a breakdown of the overall number of children in relative poverty at Government office region level or for inner or outer London.

	<p pid="a.1983W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The Cold Weather Payments scheme involves linking groups of postcode areas to weather stations that report to the Met Office on a daily basis. 76 such stations are currently used in the scheme. Each postcode area is linked to a station with the most similar climate in terms of mean winter temperature (mean for 1971-2000).

The winter mean temperature at East Kilbride is 3.3 degrees Celsius and at Bishopton it is 3.7 degrees Celsius. An alternative station used in the Cold Weather Payments scheme is Salsburgh, approximately 12 miles north-east of East Kilbride. There the winter mean temperature is 2.6 degrees Celsius. On that basis, the more suitable linkage is Bishopton, which is used for almost all the Glasgow postcodes.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1983W.8/1">Local housing allowance was rolled out nationally in April 2008 for customers in the deregulated private rented sector who make a new claim for housing benefit, and for existing customers who move address. It is a new way of calculating the rent element of housing benefit based on the area in which a customer lives and his/her household size. Local housing allowance is paid to the tenant rather than the landlord in most circumstances. Tenants are able to keep any excess benefit up to a maximum of &pound;15 per week that is over and above the cost of their rent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1985W.3/2">This compares favourably with the previous position because although such customers received 50 per cent. of eligible housing costs after eight weeks under the old rules, they had to wait 26 weeks before receiving 100 per cent.

	<p pid="a.1985W.6/2">The Work at Height (Amendment) Regulations 2007 changed the detail of the requirements under the Work at Height Regulations 2005 with respect to certain caving and climbing activities. As such, the 2007 regulations have very limited application to the fire and rescue service and no review is considered to be needed. In 2006, the Department for Communities and Local Government published guidance for the fire and rescue service on the practical application of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 to fire and rescue service activities. The Health and Safety Executive expects that the fire and rescue service itself will keep this practical guidance under review to ensure it continues to represent best practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1986W.8/1">Council tax benefit makes an important contribution to the financial security of around 2.6 million pensioner households. We therefore want to ensure that, they get the money they are entitled to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.8/2">We are making good progress. When pension credit was introduced in October 2003, we invested almost &pound;0.5 billion a year in increasing the amounts on which housing benefit and council tax benefit are based. This meant that around 2 million pensioner households became either entitled to council tax benefit for the first time or qualified for more help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.8/3">People on the guarantee credit or guarantee plus savings credit of pension credit (with or without the savings credit) can get maximum council tax benefit. They are treated as having no income or capital. People with savings credit only may still be entitled to some council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.8/4">All pension credit customers who are identified as having council tax liability are encouraged to claim council tax benefit when they make their initial claim for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.8/5">Since December 2005, people applying for pension credit have been able to access housing benefit and council tax benefit at the same time via one phone call to the Pension, Disability and Carers Service&mdash;one phone call, one number, three benefits. Pension, Disability and Carers Service staff completed a short claim form on the customer's behalf, and sent it to them for signing and returning it to the local authority for processing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.8/6">From October 2008, we dispensed with the claim form. Pension, Disability and Carers Service now pass the information direct to the local authority. Previously around 40 per cent. of pre-populated council tax benefit claim forms sent to customers checking and forwarding to the local authority were never sent to the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.8/7">Our longer term aim is to make support for council tax liability as accessible as possible and we will continue to examine ways of achieving this.</p>

This can include advice on effective job-search strategies, matching people to the many thousands of new vacancies that come up every day and, where appropriate, help with writing a CV, filling in job applications, or with accessing opportunities to refresh or develop new skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1987W.5/3">We have introduced key changes to the jobseeker's allowance rapid reclaim process. Jobseekers can now apply for benefit under the rapid reclaim process up to 26 weeks after a previous claim to the same benefit, rather than within 12 weeks as before. As much of the relevant information is already held, rapid reclaim cases can be processed more quickly, though this is dependent on the jobseeker's circumstances remaining the same as when they left benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1987W.5/4">Temporary jobs can provide valuable work experience and can often be a stepping stone to more permanent employment. Rapid reclaim supports the incentive to take up employment, including short-term periods of full-time work, by easing concerns about reapplying for benefits should the work suddenly come to an end.</p>

	<p pid="a.1992W.5/1">The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is the Government's principal policy on insulating homes in Great Britain. Under CERT the major energy suppliers have an obligation to promote household carbon saving measures such as insulation. The most important measures for hard-to-treat homes are solid wall insulation and central heating. Suppliers installed around 80,000 heating measures and around 40,000 solid wall measures under the previous obligation period to March 2008, mostly in partnership with social landlords. We recognise that the high up-front cost of solid wall insulation makes it difficult for suppliers to justify this investment. Under CERT we have therefore introduced specific incentives to help improve the financial viability of these measures, with a particular focus on solid-walled homes which are not on the gas grid.</p>
	<p pid="a.1992W.5/2">We also continue to assess innovative products, including solid wall insulation, for inclusion in the Warm Front scheme&mdash;the Government's main fuel poverty programme in England (fuel poverty is a devolved matter). There will be a focus on improving the energy efficiency of hard-to-treat properties in the forthcoming Community Energy Saving Programme, the proposals for which will be consulted on shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1992W.5/3">In addition to insulation, through CERT we also promote other energy efficiency measures, such as low energy lamps and high efficiency appliances. We also recognise the value of providing information and advice on energy use and the best steps to make a home more energy efficient. We already provide an on-line carbon calculator, and will shortly be consulting on new provisions to encourage the deployment of real-time energy displays and home energy efficiency advice under CERT.</p>

	<p pid="a.1994W.5/2">I am, however, able to provide information on the degree to which Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel, who are in pinch point trades, breach the Single Service Harmony Guidelines and this is shown in the following table. Current individual harmony guidelines are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.5/3" class="indent">The Royal Navy guidelines determine that personnel spend, on average, 60 per cent. of their time deployed and 40 per cent. alongside in their home port during a three-year period. The maximum individual threshold (separated service) is 660 days away from their normal place of work in the same three year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.5/4" class="indent">The Army guidelines determine that soldiers can be deployed for one six-month tour in every 30 months (six on, 24 off) and during that 30 month period a soldier should not expect to be away from his or her normal place of work for more than a total of 415 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.5/5" class="indent">The Royal Air Force guidelines determine that personnel should not spend more than 280 days in every 24 months away from their normal place of duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.2007W.2/2">The UK also contributes to the EU's African Peace Facility, which has provided funds of &euro;19.7 million to AMISOM between March 2007 and December 2008. A further &euro;20 million will be provided in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.2007W.2/3">The security situation in Somalia will only improve if there is a political resolution to the conflict there. We continue to work with Somali and international partners to build political stability, including working closely with the United Nations Special Representative to the Secretary General for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, and the UN Political Office for Somalia. We welcome the decision of the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia in November 2008 to form a unity government and to continue work on justice and reconciliation issues. We fully support the Djibouti peace process and hope it will deliver a long-term solution for peace and stability in Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="a.2007W.5/1">The UK has taken a comprehensive approach to the problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="a.2007W.5/2">The Royal Navy is combating acts of piracy on the high seas off Somalia, and acts of armed robbery in Somali Territorial Waters. We are providing the Operation Headquarters and Operation Commander for the EU's operation (Atalanta) to protect World Food programme shipping and to deter piracy. We are providing a frigate for the first phase of the operation and we contributed to a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation counter piracy mission in 2008. We have a leading role in the planning and execution of military counter-piracy operations through the Combined Maritime Forces in the region. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary negotiated a new UN Security Council Resolution (1851) further consolidating the international commitment to deal effectively with piracy. The UK is a member of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia which met for the first time in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-14">14 January 2009</phrase>, and we will host the Working Group tasked to encourage greater international co-ordination and co-operation. In addition we continue to work closely with the shipping industry, advising on best practice for counter piracy self defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.2007W.5/3">Ultimately piracy is a symptom of wider issues. We continue our efforts to address these, and are encouraging the European Commission and other partners to increase targeted support for governance/economic development in Somalia, in particular in coastal areas. In 2007-08, the UK provided over &pound;25 million of humanitarian and development assistance to Somalia. For 2008-09, this was increased to &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2007W.5/4">Although there has been a significant increase in the number of successful pirate attacks in the last three years (10 in 2006, 35 in 2007, 43 in 2008 and three so far in 2009), piracy off the Somali coast continues to affect a very small proportion of the shipping that transits the area. Since Operation Atalanta established the Maritime Security Centre for the Horn of Africa in December 2008 no vessel registered with it has been successfully pirated.</p>

Information contains the vehicle registration number and other specifics of the vehicle, but no personal details that would reveal the identity of the vehicle keeper.

The UK Government decided collectively to cease their participation in the scheme because of the generally low levels of intervention stocks and because there was a lack of interest in the scheme, primarily due to the bureaucratic procedures that apply in order to reduce the risk of fraud. In short, the Government concluded that the Scheme did not represent good value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.2031W.6/1">The Government would prefer to see all animals stunned before they are killed. However we do recognise the rights of religious communities to eat meat killed in accordance with their religious beliefs.</p>
	<p pid="a.2031W.6/2">The European Commission has published a proposal for a regulation on the welfare of animals at the time of killing. If agreed, this will be directly applicable in every member state and will replace EU Directive 93/119 and all national legislation implementing it. The current Commission proposal includes a derogation allowing animals to be killed in accordance with religious rites without prior stunning. However the proposal gives individual member states the right to decide not to apply that derogation if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.2031W.6/3">We believe it is important to ensure member states retain the ability to determine this issue. We will therefore be seeking to ensure member state discretion on this point is retained in the final regulation. We will pursue this point in ongoing negotiations and when the proposal is discussed in Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.2033W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2033W.11/2">The Government are committed to addressing the housing, employment and social needs of rural communities in ways that are sustainable and compatible with the protection of the countryside. Our advice to local planning authorities about development in rural areas is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, &quot;Green Belts&quot; (PPG2), Planning Policy Statement 3, &quot;Housing&quot; (PPS3) and Planning Policy Statement 7, &quot;Sustainable Development in Rural Areas&quot; (PPS7). For example, a key principle of PPS7 is that new building development in the open countryside away from existing settlements, or outside areas allocated for development in the local plan, should be strictly controlled.</p>
	<p pid="a.2033W.11/3">We set up the Affordable Rural Housing Commission in summer 2005 to look into the availability of affordable housing in rural areas. Following publication of the Commission's report in May 2006, we have responded positively to the majority of their (over 100) recommendations where they were directed at Communities and Local Government. Many of the recommendations are embodied in Planning Policy Statement 3, &quot;Housing&quot; (PPS3).</p>
	<p pid="a.2033W.11/4">Published in November 2006, PPS3 highlights the need to provide market and affordable housing in all areas, including rural areas. The delivery of housing in rural areas should respect the key principles underpinning PPS3 of providing high quality housing that contributes to the creation and maintenance of sustainable rural communities in market towns and villages. New housing, particularly in the examples of very small villages and hamlets, would need to be carefully considered and managed so as not to have adverse impacts on those areas which would actually undermine sustainable development objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.2033W.11/5">We also invited <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> to carry out an independent review of economics and affordable housing provision in the countryside. His report, Living Working Countryside, came out in July 2008, and its recommendations are being given thorough consideration: we will publish our response shortly.</p>

We see the improved coordination of border management of Schengen States as having a direct impact to the United Kingdom, and play as full a part as possible in operations, and should commit resources to them for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.2054W.5/2">The shift patterns of police officers is an operational matter, and as such is for the chief constable to determine. However, the Government published a review of the Licensing Act 2003 in March 2008 which revealed a mixed picture in terms of its impact. The change in opening hours has not led to the widespread problems some people feared. Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down, but there has been a small increase in alcohol-related violence in the early hours of the morning and some communities have seen a rise in disorder. Our main conclusion is that people are using the freedoms, but people are not sufficiently using the considerable powers granted by the Act to tackle problems, and that there is a need to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.2054W.5/3">Additionally, we have introduced legislation for a new, mandatory code of practice. This will contain some compulsory national conditions, banning the most irresponsible practices and promotions which encourage people to drink excessively, or promote a binge-drinking culture. This will not affect the majority of businesses, small or large, who behave responsibly&mdash;but will target those that do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.2054W.5/4">Further, the Government are funding a &pound;4.5 million enforcement campaign, in addition to existing resources from the police, local authorities and others, focused on 40-50 priority areas and led by ACPO Commander Simon O'Brien. There is additional funding for the 20 priority PCT areas, and a &pound;10 million investment in national awareness campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="a.2054W.8/2">In 2009-10, North Yorkshire police authority will receive &pound;76.7 million in general grants, an increase of 2.5 per cent. (+&pound;1.9 million) over 2008-09. North Yorkshire benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 2.5 per cent.; it would have received &pound;5.8 million less if the funding formula had been strictly applied. In addition to general grant, North Yorkshire will also receive an estimated &pound;11.2 million from a range of other Government funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.2054W.8/3">A review of the funding formula for the next CSR period (2011-12 to 2013-14) is currently taking place with the Police Allocation Formula Working Group (PAFWG) continuing to meet throughout 2009 and early 2010. Following consultation, the formula will be revised as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.2054W.11/1">Work is continuing to finalise the strategy and plans for the security of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Home Office has provided funding to police forces in 2007-08 and 2008-09 to enable them to plan and prepare for the Games. It will continue to make available funding as necessary. Any decisions will need to take account of the operational needs of the police and other security agencies, affordability within the total funding envelope and the need to secure value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.2055W.0/1">The Government have been clarifying the performance management framework for the police for some time, to help the police focus more effectively on the issues that concern the public. The top down numerical target which concerned frontline officers the most&mdash;to increase the total number of offences brought to justice from the 2004 Public Service Agreements (PSAs)&mdash;ceased to have effect at the end of 2007-08. The Policing Green Paper made further significant changes as part of its broader proposals for reforming the relationship between the police service, the public and the Home Office. In particular, the Government committed to a single top down target for police forces&mdash;on improving public confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.0/2">Centrally set efficiency and productivity targets for individual forces and authorities ceased to have effect from the publication of the Policing Green Paper (<phrase class="date" code="2008-07-17">17 July 2008</phrase>). Volume and value targets on cash forfeiture orders also ceased to have effect on that date. Centrally set 10-year race employment targets relating to the recruitment, retention and progression of black and minority ethnic police officers and staff come to an end on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, when a final report against a centrally set progression target will also be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.0/3">Centrally set multi-agency targets for local criminal justice boards (LCJBs, on which police forces are members alongside other agencies) on enforcement (including fail to appear (FTA) warrant enforcement, community penalty breach enforcement and licence recall) and asset recovery (specifically on obtaining and enforcing confiscation orders) cease from April 2009. The Persistent Young Offenders (PYO) Pledge ended on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.0/4">All of this demonstrates how we are complying with our commitment in the Green Paper to &quot;neither set nor maintain&quot; top down numerical targets for individual police forces with the exception of one&mdash;to raise public confidence that their local crime and antisocial behaviour priorities are being addressed.</p>

The Impact of the Economic Downturn on Local Government Finances.&quot; identified expenditure on gas, electricity, fuel and food as areas which have seen the highest level of inflation in council expenditure. However, it also found that this made up less than 2 per cent. of total local authority spending and that inflation was now reducing, easing some of the in-year pressures. It reported that fuel prices are now lower than they were in April 2008. The Government expect the significant fall in the price of crude oil to feed into the cost of other goods and to impact on energy bills in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.2070W.3/1">In exercising their planning functions local planning authorities are required to have regard to the Government's overarching planning policy on parking which is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 13: 'Transport' (2001), one of the key objectives of which is to reduce the need to travel, especially by car. PPG13 is clear that local authority policies in preparing their development plans should set maximum levels of parking for broad classes of development, including residential and non-residential development, and that there should be no minimum standards for development, other than parking for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2070W.3/2">In relation to residential development, Planning Policy Guidance note 3: 'Housing' (2000) advised that car parking standards that resulted in development with more than 1.5 off-street car parking spaces across a local authority area on average were unlikely to reflect the Government's emphasis on securing sustainable residential environments. This advice has subsequently being replaced by Planning Policy Statement 3: 'Housing' (2006), which gives local planning authorities the flexibility, consistent with the objectives of PPG13, to set their own residential parking policies taking account of the expected levels of car ownership, the importance of promoting good design and the need to use land efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.2070W.3/3">In terms of non-residential development, PPG13 sets out national maximum car parking standards. Again, within the context of reducing the need to travel by car required by PPG13, draft PPS4: 'Planning for Sustainable Economic Development' (2007) proposes to devolve responsibility for setting non-residential car parking standards to local authorities so that they can reflect local circumstances. We are currently working to finalise the policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.2072W.7/2">However, in May 2008 the Department launched a national communications campaign to improve the public's understanding of units of alcohol.

	<p pid="a.2075W.5/2">The General Dental Council (GDC) provided for the registration of CDTs with effect from July 2006 and so far, some 80 CDTs are registered with the GDC. It is too early to make a detailed assessment of their impact, but we are examining the role of CDTs in relation to national health service primary care dental services. Currently a primary care trust may contract with a registered CDT to provide NHS primary care dental services under the personal dental services regulations or with a CDT, working in partnership with a dentist, under the general dental services regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.2078W.5/3">It is based on a feasibility study from which it was concluded that roll out of primary angioplasty across England would be feasible, that a 24/7 service was likely to lead to best outcomes and that acceptable times to treatment were 120 minutes from patients call for help and 90 minutes from arrival at hospital. An impact assessment suggested that roll out would be feasible in three years for 97 per cent. of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.2078W.5/4">The status of this guidance is 'best practice' and so decisions about the pace of change are for local commissioners. The treatment times given are to guide local planning and local performance assessment. The Department has however worked with the national health service to put in place appropriate monitoring mechanisms to assess progress. A recent survey of the 31 cardiac clinical networks identified that 10 had achieved 24/7 coverage and that a further 18 had plans for the introduction of primary angioplasty.</p>

	<p pid="a.2078W.8/1">As part of the Department-commissioned &quot;Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management (2007)&quot;, the clinical guidelines expert group who developed the document commented on the potential role of slow release oral morphine (SROM) in the treatment of drug dependence. It stated that SROM is not licensed in the UK for the treatment of opiate dependence and should not normally be used in the community. A copy of the document has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2078W.8/2">However, the clinical guidelines expert group also acknowledged European research that has shown that SROM can be effective in treating drug dependent patients who 'fail to tolerate methadone' but recommended that it should only be used in the United Kingdom by specialist clinicians who have the necessary competencies to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.2078W.8/3">Within UK clinical settings morphine is mainly used for the management of severe and chronic pain, especially in palliative care.</p>
	<p pid="a.2078W.8/4">The Department commissioned the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to examine and make recommendations on the most effective drugs for substitute opioid treatment. In 2007, NICE recommended methadone and buprenorphine as the most effective substitute opioids to be used in the treatment of opiate dependence.</p>

	<p pid="a.2080W.5/1">Deep cleaning is just part of a comprehensive range of measures to improve cleanliness and tackle infections set out in the strategy 'Clean, Safe Care: Reducing Infections and Saving Lives', a copy of which is already available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.5/2">The national deep clean programme was overseen by strategic health authorities (SHAs). Information about the specific timing and cost of each individual trust's deep clean was not collected centrally. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-17">17 January 2008</phrase>, a written ministerial statement confirmed that out of 328 trusts, 263 had started their deep clean and that the remaining 65 trusts all had agreed plans in place. My right. hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) made a further written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-21">21 April 2008</phrase> marking the end of the deep clean initiative for 2007-08. The same statement confirmed that SHAs had made available all the funding promised for the programme, a total of &pound;62.5 million. The spend for Yorkshire and Humber SHA was &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.5/3">On completion of the national deep clean programme, SHAs took the lead in evaluating the impact of each trust's deep clean actions as each programme was different. It was recognised that no single measurement method would pick up all the benefits, particularly as trusts implemented a wide range of measures to improve cleanliness and tackle healthcare associated infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.2080W.5/4">The Department subsequently worked with SHAs to draw up examples of where a deep clean had had a demonstrable effect in improving patient care and experience. A compendium of good practice, 'From Deep Clean to Keep Clean' was published in October 2008 to form the basis of shared learning across the national health service. A copy of the compendium has been placed in the Library and is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.2083W.11/18">There have been a number of changes to the reference costs collection during the period covered by these figures. They generally fall into two key areas: (i) changes to the scope of the data collected (for example, over time an increased number of treatment function codes (TFCs) have been collected), and (ii) greater disaggregation over time (for example, separately collecting non-consultant-led activity from 2006-07). The changes over time mean that it is difficult to make comparisons between years without fully understanding the underlying changes. The figures presented are based on the full scope of outpatient attendance costs collected in Reference Costs in each year, and are therefore the most accurate reflection of the average cost per outpatient attendance in each year, based on the data collected.</p>

	<p pid="a.2085W.8/1">The requirement for care homes to report incidents to the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is set out in the Care Home Regulations 2001. Regulation 37 requires reports to be made to CSCI without delay of:</p>

	<p pid="a.2085W.8/8" class="indent">Any allegation of misconduct by the registered person or a worker at the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.2085W.8/9">If a serious incident is reported to CSCI under Regulation 37 of the Care Homes Regulations, which governs notification of death, illness and other events in care homes, it is followed up by the CSCI regulation inspector or regulation manager associated with that service. Depending on circumstances, they may refer the issue to the pharmacist inspector. It is one of CSCI's referral criteria to contact a pharmacist inspector and this may result in inspection of the care home and a resulting report with requirements and recommendations. If the overdose is a result of an incorrect prescription from the general practitioner, the pharmacist inspector will liaise via the local intelligence network through the national health service accountable officer at the relevant primary care trust, who will deal with the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.2085W.8/10">We are informed by CSCI that there were 2,716 notifications to CSCI under Regulation 37 of incidents in care homes in Warrington in the years 2006 to 2008. The following table shows a breakdown of numbers of notifications between care homes. We are informed by CSCI that to extract the incidents involving overdose with a controlled drug from these notifications would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.2089W.6/1">The Ministry of Justice collects statistics on the number of finds under the Treasure Act 1996 reported to coroners in England and Wales during each calendar year, the number of treasure inquests concluded during the year and, of these, the number of verdicts of treasure returned. Information is not collected on the time taken to conduct treasure inquests.</p>

	<p pid="a.2090W.2/1">The Government have announced their intention to open up the criminal justice system through the power of the internet by publishing the outcomes of criminal cases on a public-facing website. Further details on this will be brought forward in the spring. However this will not, include court transcripts.</p>

	<p pid="a.2090W.2/5">The courts in the pilot areas&mdash;Leeds, Wolverhampton and Cardiff&mdash;will, for the first time, routinely produce a written record of the decision for the parties involved. In selected cases where the court is making life-changing decisions for a child, they will publish an anonymised judgment online so that the wider public can read it.</p>
	<p pid="a.2090W.2/6">Judgments from the Civil and Criminal Divisions of the Court of Appeal, including the Administrative Court, selected by the Judge concerned, are available at no charge on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII) database. If a High Court judgment is not available by this means, the court can be contacted direct for a copy.</p>

	<p pid="a.2093W.5/1">The number of contracts held between the Legal Services Commission and solicitors' offices to provide legal aid under the General Criminal Contract was 2,909 at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>. At <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> the number of contracts held was 2,230. These figures do not include former providers with claims yet to be paid or those completing existing cases but not taking on new work.</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.5/2">Before the introduction of the Unified Contract for crime work in July 2008, solicitor firms practising from more than one office needed to hold a separate contract for each office that provided legal aid. However, from <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-14">14 July 2008</phrase> there were 1,799 providers contracted under the new contracts to offer criminal legal aid through 2,274 individual offices. The LSC has continued to maintain 100 per cent. coverage of its police station and magistrates court duty solicitor schemes through these providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.5/3">The reduction in the number of contracts reflects the trend in the last several years of offices doing small amounts of legal aid work to drop out of the market or merge with other offices, so that the work is done in larger volumes at fewer offices. This has not affected the availability of legal aid to those that need it.</p>

	<p pid="a.2095W.7/1">Qualifications at HMP Chelmsford are achieved by offenders in a variety of areas of the prison's work. Data are not recorded uniformly although we will improve this through the Learning and Skills Council's IT-based Learner Record system shortly to roll-out across prisons. As well as solving the longstanding problem of prisoner learner data not following them as they move from prison to prison, the new system will for the first time allow all learning outcomes, no matter by whom delivered in the prison, to be recorded on a single record for the learner.</p>
	<p pid="a.2095W.7/2">Health and safety qualifications are delivered in the prison's workshops. 109 qualifications were achieved in 2005, 350 in 2006, 305 in 2007 and 325 in 2008. A further 734 qualifications, including in textiles and engineering, have been delivered in the prison's workshops since 2005. Food hygiene qualifications are delivered in the prison kitchens, literacy and numeracy qualifications through Learn Direct provision, parenting qualifications through the Ormiston Trust, a variety of information technology qualifications through a Prison ICT Academy (PICTA) workshop.</p>
	<p pid="a.2095W.7/3">The physical education department at the prison has recorded the award of 272 qualifications in financial year 2004-05, 282 in 2005-06, 406 in 2006-07 and 438 in 2007-08. The information is not recorded by age.</p>
	<p pid="a.2095W.7/4">Learning and Skills Council data for the 2006-07 academic year shows a total of 52 individual achievements recorded by the offender learning and skills service provider at HMP Chelmsford, of which 15 were achieved by those aged under 21. Final data for 2007-08 are not yet available, but indications are that there were a total of 524 achievements, of which 191 were achieved by those aged under 21. We believe there was significant under-recording of achievements in 2006-07, which we have now taken steps to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.2095W.7/5">Prior to the 2006-07 academic year, education at HMP Chelmsford was provided by Norwich City College.

	<p pid="a.2097W.2/1">The Department was created on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June 2007</phrase>. 34 new recruits joined the Department up to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> and to date, 51 have joined since <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. A breakdown of permanent and temporary staff could be produced only at disproportionate cost. The Department does not hold central records of recruitment campaigns as the majority of vacancies are managed locally by individual vacancy managers. A joint campaign was run on behalf of the DIUS and the Department for Children, Schools and Families for the Private Office in May 2008 which resulted in 16 executive officers being recruited on a permanent basis into the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.2103W.2/1">The increase in the VAT cash accounting scheme threshold in 2007 was estimated to cost the Exchequer around &pound;120 million in 2007-08, as published in table A1.1 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report 2007. This represents the amount of VAT receipts delayed from 2007-08 into 2008-09 as a result of increased membership of the scheme. The effect on individual businesses depends on their turnover and how quickly they make and receive payments in the course of their business activities.

These will include: attending and taking part in top quality theatre and dance performances; attending national and local exhibitions, museums and heritage sites; learning a musical instrument and singing in ensembles; producing creative writing and artwork; and making films. 10 pathfinders are trialling ways of delivering a structured cultural offer.

	<p pid="a.2109W.3/2">In October 2008, we announced our intention to make PSHE education statutory, in recognition of the key role it plays in equipping children and young people with the knowledge and skills they need to lead healthy and successful lives. At the same time we launched an independent review of how this might be achieved in the most effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, the head teacher of Morpeth school in Tower Hamlets, is conducting the review and will report in April 2009. Proposals for the statutory implementation of PSHE education will be the subject of a full public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2111W.2/1">The Department does not hold this information. Isabel Nisbet, acting chief executive of the Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (Ofqual) has written to the hon. Member and a copy of the response has been placed in both the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Isabel Nisbet, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-09">9 January 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/3" class="indent">In his written response to you on the Parliamentary Questions listed above, the Minister of State for Schools and Learners stated that these were questions relating to the conduct of the new regulator Ofqual. He has therefore asked Ofqual to write directly to you in response to these questions. For ease of reference the questions were:</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/4" class="indent">(245825) To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, for what reasons the meeting between the National Assessment Agency and Ofqual requested in May did not take place until July, as referred to in paragraph 6.96 of the Sutherland Inquiry report, (HC 62).</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/5" class="indent">(245829) To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, what the nature was of Ofqual's involvement in the procurement process that led to the award of the SAT administration contract to ETS referred to at paragraph 2.50 of the Sutherland Inquiry report, (HC 62).</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/6" class="indent">As you are aware Ofqual was created in April 2008 on an interim basis, within the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA). Before this time the regulatory functions were carried out by the Regulation and Standards Division of the QCA, and I was its Director.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/7" class="indent">In PQ 245825 you have asked about the accountability meeting that Ofqual held with the National Assessment Agency (NAA) in July 2008. In dealing with the issues of delivery in 2008 Ofqual advised the NAA in May 2008 of its intention to hold an accountability meeting. Its purpose was analogous to that of the formal accountability meetings held with the GCSE and A level awarding bodies a week before the results of those examinations are due to be announced. At these meetings the awarding body is required to provide assurances that the code of practice has been followed, that all papers have been marked and that results will be available on time. It is also an opportunity for the regulator and the awarding body to highlight concerns about any aspect of the past series.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/8" class="indent">With regard to the tests in 2009, Ofqual now holds quarterly formal accountability meetings with QCA, and the first of these was held on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-02">2 December 2008</phrase>. The third of these (planned for May 2009) will be an opportunity to bring together any emerging issues regarding problems with marking or preparation to deliver results.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/9" class="indent">To answer PQ245829, as the Sutherland Inquiry states at paragraph 2.48 'although the Regulator had not been formally involved in the procurement process, they were in July 2006 asked informally about how proposed changes to the National Curriculum test process might impact the Code of Practice'. Regulatory requirements were taken into account. Copies of the Regulatory Framework and the Code of Practice were supplied to all bidders by the NAA. The Regulation and Standards Division also offered all bidders the opportunity to contact them with any further queries. As Director of Regulation and Standards I was a member of the QCA Executive at the time the contract was awarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/10" class="indent">If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me (contact details below) or Helen Knee on 024 7671 6705 and helen.knee@ofqual.gov.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.2/11" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Kathleen Tattersall, Chair of Ofqual, and to Jim Knight, Minister of State for Schools and Learners.</p>

	<p pid="a.2117W.5/2">Much has been done to protect teachers, in terms of promoting good practice to help reduce violence through behaviour management and school ethos, and through giving schools stronger legal powers to discipline and use legally reasonable force to restrain pupils.

DFID has committed to spend &pound;6 billion up to 2015 on health systems strengthening. The UK strategy has four priorities: Advocacy: Scaling-up evidence-based interventions; addressing the social and economic barriers to maternal health and developing new knowledge.</p>

Scaling-up expands health services and the availability of neglected high impact interventions, safe abortion and contraception.

	<p pid="a.2120W.6/1">There are 157 UNICEF-supported schools in Gaza, and work with the Palestinian Ministry of Education identified 40 as high risk in terms of potential unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination. These schools have been visited by technicians from the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). During this clearance 40mm high explosive grenades, as well as 81mm and 120mm high explosive mortars, were removed. Remnants of exploded ordnance were also taken away, including parts of Hell Fire missiles and 155mm high explosive and white phosphorous artillery shells.</p>

	<p pid="a.2120W.9/1">We monitor the situation through our high commission and other sources and by field visits. In October 2008 we announced &pound;2.5 million of humanitarian funding through international agencies. We are sending another humanitarian assessment mission this week and have agreed a further &pound;2.5 million humanitarian funding. We share the widespread concern at the plight of civilians trapped by the fighting and have called on both sides to cease fire and allow humanitarian access.</p>
