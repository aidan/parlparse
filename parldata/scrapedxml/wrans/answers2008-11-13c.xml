First, there must be sufficient evidence to create a realistic prospect of conviction. Second, it must be in the public interest to proceed. If the evidential element of the test is not made out then the case will not go ahead, however strong the public interest in prosecuting. Not all of those arrested during Operation Pentameter II will necessarily have been charged, and many of those who have been charged may not have been prosecuted in court yet as cases are at different stages in the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="c.1293W.5/1">Under the Disability Equality Duty introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, the Department and its public sector bodies listed in the associated regulations are required to publish and implement Disability Equality Schemes. These are plans setting out how they will carry out the Disability Equality Duty, monitor and report on progress. In particular this includes their arrangements for gathering information on the effects of their policies and practices on recruitment, development and retention of their disabled employees, including those with mental health conditions, and making use of that information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/2">The following arrangements are set out in the Department's disability equality scheme:</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/3" class="indent">DEFRA has set an explicit objective to improve the service it provides in relation to mental health issues by December 2009, and another to adopt the Social Model of disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/4" class="indent">DEFRA recognises that the biggest barrier experienced by many people with mental health issues is other people's attitudes. Staff are encouraged to declare whether they are disabled and by the end of 2008 DEFRA will have introduced enhanced data gathering systems that will enable it to identify the different barriers that disabled staff face in their employment. While information is not collected on different impairment categories, the barrier categories will be used to identify those staff who state that 'people's attitudes towards them' is the biggest barrier that they face.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/5" class="indent">To support the achievement of these objectives DEFRA has adopted the principals of the Department of Health sponsored programme 'Action on stigma'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/6" class="indent">DEFRA is taking action to meet our objectives in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/7">It has an employee support service that provides a confidential telephone service 24 hrs a day, seven days a week. One to one counselling can also be arranged and managers and staff can also receive occupational health advice and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/8">A recent initiative is the development of an Employee Support Service externally hosted website for staff use. This includes information on services, factsheets on mental health issues; links to external sources of help and support. This website can be accessed from any computer and can, therefore, be used in complete confidence. This internet based provision is further supported by training and awareness sessions for staff and managers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/9">DEFRA's guidance on making adjustments for disabled staff provides advice and examples of the types of support that may be appropriate for people with mental health impairments, for example; job redesign, counselling or time off for therapy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/10">The Department fully supports the right of all employees to be treated with dignity and respect at work. DEFRA's Dignity at Work policies have been reviewed to ensure that they are effective at tackling the sorts of unacceptable behaviour that people with mental health issues may experience in the workplace. There are trained Bullying and Harassment Officers and Mediators to support staff in the resolution of their complaints.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/11">Additionally DEFRA is joining a working group on Civil Service employment set up by the Cabinet Office. This group has been set up to support delivery of the Socially Excluded Adults Public Service Agreement which aims to significantly increase the number of people with learning difficulties and severe mental health issues (as well as ex-offenders and young adults leaving care) in employment by April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/12">The public sector bodies sponsored by my department that are subject to these requirements are responsible for publishing and implementing their own disability equality schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.5/13">In line with the Disability Equality Duty, a report will be published every three years by the Secretary of State for the Environment to show: progress towards disability equality in his policy sector; and proposals for co-ordination of future work by relevant public authorities within his policy sector. These reports will show what impact, if any, policies have had on the recruitment and retention of disabled people including those with mental health conditions, and set out proposals to address any gaps identified when establishing the progress made across the policy sector. The first report must be published by December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1296W.3/54" class="indent">Finally, it might be helpful if I gave a little more detail on the reference in my previous answer to the Royal Hospital Haslar. It is correct that Haslar ceased to be a &quot;military hospital&quot; in the normal sense of that term several years ago, and in 2007 the Commanding Officer was withdrawn, when Haslar ceased formally to be a military unit. However, the hospital is still open for NHS patients and will continue to be operated in partnership between the MOD and Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust until its final closure in the latter part of next year.</p>

While it is not possible to make any vehicle invulnerable to every possible attack, there has been a programme of continuing improvement to the protection level of vehicles in service. Snatch in particular has been reconfigured for Afghanistan, with a new variant, Snatch Vixen. As a result of modifications to the running gear, chassis, engine and other automotive components, the Snatch Vixen benefits from an increased payload, which has been used to enhance both the mobility and protection of this vehicle. These modifications mean that the new variant offers the highest levels of protection for its size and weight.</p>

FTI is already fitted to some aircraft types within the Royal Air Force, including the C130s, and there are plans in place to fit a number of other aircraft types.

Contracts were let to undertake a Strategic Environmental Assessment, and to provide advice on technical and engineering issues, on potential project ownership structure and financing, and on regional economic and energy market impacts. Following input from stakeholders, the feasibility study published a list of 10 potential schemes in July this year and has been assessing in broad terms the costs, benefits and impacts of the long list of potential schemes. This work will feed into an internal review, which will take place at the end of this year. Subject to that review, we will launch in the new year a public consultation to invite views on the scope of the strategic environmental assessment and on which of the 10 proposals will be short-listed for more detailed assessment in 2009. Advisory and scoping reports produced for the feasibility study will be published with the consultation paper.</p>

The Department is currently conducting the necessary due diligence on its initial scoping work and we cannot yet provide accurate information on workforce projections. However, our approach to the use of agency staff and contractors will be to limit their use to essential tasks only and where it is cost effective for the Department to employ them, rather than permanent members of staff.</p>

In doing this, our overall approach has been to capitalise on the synergies and the opportunities created by the merger of two large parts of Government to form the MoJ.

	<p pid="c.1344W.2/1">Statistics relating to Persistent Young Offenders (PYOs) are designed to measure the speed and efficiency of the youth justice system; through monitoring the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days.</p>
	<p pid="c.1344W.2/2">They are not designed to measure overall trends in youth crime, and will give a significantly misleading picture of the true trend if used for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.1344W.2/3">This is because the definition of a PYO relies on there being multiple sentencing occasions for a single offender during a limited time period. Young offenders are now being dealt with twice as quickly as they were prior to 1997, which means that there are much shorter intervals between sentencing occasions for those youths who repeatedly offend. Youth sentencing is therefore more timely, and for repeat offenders more frequent, than it used to be prior to 1997. Therefore, a side-effect of the Government's success in bringing much swifter justice to young repeat offenders is that more of them end up being defined as PYOs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1344W.2/4">There were 15,945 PYOs registered over the last 12 months for which finalised figures are available (September 2007-August 2008).

The role of the team is to make inquiries and recommendations for further action on cases referred to it from teams across the Agency. Between 2004 and October 2008 the War Crimes Team has been notified of 138 adverse decisions made following their recommendations. This will include decisions to refuse entry, indefinite leave to remain and naturalisation, and exclusions from refugee protection. It is not possible to break this down further into separate decision categories without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>

A person who claims that a local authority has acted in a way which breaches their article 6 or 8 convention rights may take proceedings against that authority. A court in determining any case in which a question arises in relation to convention rights must take into account ECHR case law and so far as possible read and give effect to primary and secondary legislation in a way which is compatible with convention rights.

	<p pid="c.1354W.5/2">The Department has funded early years training, in particular Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) training, through both the School's Standard Fund and the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). In addition to this, we provided a further &pound;7 million during 2007-08 to support EYFS training for schools and practitioners in private, voluntary and independent settings. At the same time we enabled greater flexibility within the Transformation Fund to support its use for training on the EYFS for the private, voluntary and independent sector. Because of the way we fund through these broad grants, local authorities have discretion over how these funds are used at local level and therefore other programme funds may also have contributed, and continue to contribute, to training on the EYFS. Consequently, the Department does not hold information on the sums put towards early years training from these budgets.</p>

	<p pid="c.1356W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/2">This Government remain totally committed to widening participation in higher education (HE), for those from poorer and other under-represented backgrounds. This includes those young people who overcome the greatest challenges, not just to go to university at all, but to one of the most selective universities or courses. We, together with the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the universities themselves, are working to raise both aspirations of young people and attainment&mdash;to unlock the talent of each student so that they can progress to a university that will help them realise their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/3">There is a range of current and emerging interventions designed to raise attainment and aspirations to progress to higher education. Leading universities are involved in all of these. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/4" class="italic"> (a)  Aimhigher programme</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/5" class="indent">A national outreach programme which seeks to widen participation in HE through local partnerships of universities, colleges and schools which co-design and deliver activities to raise attainment, aspiration and application levels of young people from backgrounds currently under-represented in HE.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/6" class="italic"> (b)  Aimhigher Associates</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/7" class="indent">A new mentoring scheme. Pathfinder projects are being established with a view to national roll out in 2009. Associates are HE students who provide targeted support for and sharing of personal experience with young people through key transitions in their school and/or college careers, with a view to enabling their successful application to HE.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/8" class="italic"> (c)  Higher Education Funding Council for England's Widening Participation Allocation</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/9" class="indent">Supports the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from non-traditional backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/10" class="italic"> (c)  HEI/school links</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/11" class="indent">Are both structural and sustained. DIUS is promoting a range of ways in which universities can get involved with schools, including sponsoring academies and trusts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/12" class="italic"> (d) Summer School Programme</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/13" class="indent">Funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), which targets young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The programme has gained commitment from over 70 universities which include Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, London School of Economics, Bristol Liverpool, Birmingham and Warwick.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/14">In September, the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, announced that nine leading universities have agreed to extend opportunities for the best performing students from the most challenging backgrounds. Universities themselves want to do more to ensure they can identify and attract the most talented students. We are currently discussing the next steps with the universities involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.0/15">Leading universities are also involved in providing help to gifted and talented learners funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, with the aim of improving their attainment. In particular, the gifted and talented strand of the City Challenges supports progression to leading universities for academically gifted year 10 pupils eligible for free school meals and attending schools in City Challenge areas. From this term, each will benefit from a tailored four-year support programme backed up by a &pound;400 per year bursary to pay for additional out of school support.</p>

Becta's guidance was written in partnership with the Department and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This guidance says that schools should consult as widely as possible with parents before implementing biometric-based systems. This guidance is in the public domain on the Becta and ICO websites.

The DSG is based on planned spend. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS, which comprises a schools block and a local education authority (LEA) block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through Communities and Local Government's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. For information the EFS figures for 2003-04 to 2005-06 are shown as follows:</p>

In considering a request for flexible working, as in other matters, employers must also avoid unlawful discrimination.

	<p pid="c.1368W.5/3">Renewable electricity generators' income is derived from the sale of electricity, renewables obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates. The value they can derive from these is a matter for commercial negotiation in the market. The Government commissioned estimates of the costs of electricity generation from renewable sources and how much in practice the operators of such generating stations receive from the sale of the electricity, renewables obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates from Ernst and Young LLP. Their report &quot;Impact of banding the Renewables Obligation - Costs of electricity production&quot; (URN 07/948) was published by DTI in 2007 and copies were placed in both Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.5/4">Our proposed reforms of the renewables obligation are designed to increase both the effectiveness and the value for money of the instrument. These issues are discussed in the impact assessment that accompanies the Energy Bill that is currently being considered by Parliament. Our estimates in this impact assessment suggest that under our preferred option, rents could be reduced by &pound;1.9 billion over the lifetime.</p>

Potential measures include reviewing the 'bands' of the renewables obligation, increasing the stability of the ROC price, and considering linking compensation under the renewables obligation to changes in electricity wholesale prices.

	<p pid="c.1369W.9/2">As part of the Alcohol Strategy published in June 2007, the Home Office (and Department of Health) is currently highlighting the issue of our drinking culture through its national marketing campaign 'Know Your Limits'. This campaign aims to change the attitudes of 18 to 24s over the long term by increasing awareness of the problems and by highlighting the consequences of irresponsible drinking. We are doing this in a number of ways which include advertising and also through public relations. Our public relations work includes media advocacy and liaising with news media and also script writers to inform them about our policies and communications and to hold a mirror up to the way they portray alcohol. The aim of this work is to try and influence more positive associations with alcohol to create a culture where it is socially acceptable for young people to choose not to drink and, if they do start drinking, to do so later and more safely.</p>
	<p pid="c.1369W.9/3">The Home Secretary announced in her speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February 2008</phrase> that a number of new measures and possible steps would be taken to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour which is fuelled by alcohol. This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places.</p>
	<p pid="c.1369W.9/4">The Home Secretary also said that she is considering a number of options including making the possession of alcohol by a young person an offence or possibly involving the parents if alcohol is confiscated from a child. We are currently considering the effectiveness of the current powers and what can be done to help the police use them more effectively.</p>

Andy Burnham, said in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-04">4 March 2008</phrase>, that the offence of persistently selling alcohol to children would be changed from 'three strikes' to 'two strikes' in three months. The Government will legislate to increase the maximum fine for not obeying an instruction to stop drinking in a designated public place from &pound;500 to &pound;2,500. Other issues which may not require legislation include making it easier for the police to disperse antisocial drinkers and we will extend the alcohol arrest referral pilots so that under 18s may also benefit from a brief intervention from a trained worker.</p>

	<p pid="c.1370W.2/1">In June 2007, we published a comprehensive strategy to tackle the harms from excessive alcohol consumption&mdash;Safe, Sensible, Social &mdash;the next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy. A copy has already been placed in the Library. Our aims are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/2" class="indent">to focus future action on reducing the types of harm that are of most concern to the public</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/3" class="indent">to reduce the crime and ill health caused by alcohol</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/4" class="indent">to increase the public's awareness of the risks associated with excessive consumption and how to get help</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/5">We undertook in Safe, Sensible, Social to commission an independent review of the relationship between alcohol price, promotion and harm. The second phase of this review will be published soon.</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/6">From <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July 2008</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-14">14 October 2008</phrase>, the Government carried out a major consultation asking for the views of the public and key stakeholders on what action the Government should take in response to the rising levels of alcohol-related health harm and crime and disorder. The Government are considering the comments carefully.</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/7">The Department put in place a vital signs indicator for the national health service from April 2008 to measure change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol-related conditions&mdash;the first ever commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol harm. The Indicator is expected to encourage the NHS to identify risky drinking earlier, this approach linked with advice and support from general practitioners or other healthcare staff has been shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' harmful drinking that leads to health harm. The indicator also provides a strong incentive for primary care trusts (PCTs) to improve treatment provision for people dependent on alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/8">A 'Review of the effectiveness of treatment for alcohol problems' was published in November 2006 by the National Treatment Agency (NTA) for the NHS. A copy has been placed in the Library. It provides comprehensive guidance on the relative effectiveness of the various alcohol treatment modalities. Guidance on developing effective local treatment systems has also been published. (Models of Care for Alcohol Misusers, DH/NTA 2005).</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/9">Funding has been made available for a &pound;6 million Alcohol Improvement Programme, which is providing support to PCTs where alcohol-related harm is highest. Among other actions:</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/10" class="indent">An Alcohol Learning Centre will help to spread world class commissioning practice across the country</p>
	<p pid="c.1370W.2/11" class="indent">A National Alcohol Treatment Monitoring System has been established to report performance data on the provision of alcohol treatment services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1376W.8/16">As HIV is a long-term, chronic condition, many individuals are living with HIV infection who were diagnosed in previous years. Therefore, the last column in the table shows the rates of diagnosed HIV infection among the general population (all ages). The rate will be higher among those aged 15 to 59 years. There are also persons living with HIV infection in the UK who are unaware of their infection&mdash;this proportion was approximately one in every three HIV-infected persons in 2007.</p>

Population data and rates:<br/> The population data used was provided by the Populations and Geographies team in the NHS Information Centre. These figures are for calendar years only; therefore 2006-07 HES data uses 2006 population data. Also the population data are for residents of England whereas HES data are for activity in NHS Hospitals England and activity performed in the independent sector in England commissioned by English NHS.<br/> 2. Assessing growth through time:<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 3. Data quality:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 4. Finished admission episodes:<br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 5. The following admission methods were used to identify 'emergency hospital admissions:<br/> 21 = Emergency: via Accident and Emergency (A and E) services, including the casualty department of the provider<br/> 22 = Emergency: via general practitioner (GP)<br/> 23 = Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau<br/> 24 = Emergency: via consultant outpatient clinic<br/> 28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A and E department of another health care provider<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1382W.3/1">As part of the wave 1 and phase 2 independent sector treatment centre (ISTC) contracts providers are legally required to produce referring health service bodies (RHSB) literature and patient literature. It is therefore the responsibility of the provider to provide information to people about treatment available at ISTCs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.3/2">The ISTC contracts stipulate that RHSB literature should include but not be limited to: a description of the nature of the activities provided at each facility including information for GPs and other referrers; information about the referral process; logistical information such as maps detailing the location of the ISTC.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.3/3">The contracts also set out that patient literature should include but not be limited to the following: a description of the activities provided at each facility; a general explanation of the referral process and the likely length of stay and the likely time involved for the activity or length of appointment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.3/4">Patients referred to ISTCs are eligible, as are all national health service patients, for free travel to and from premises providing NHS health care and between NHS health care providers as long as it is non-urgent, planned and based on medical need. If a health care professional were to refer a patient to an ISTC, then free transport would be available provided the patient met the aforementioned criteria. However, this would be for the local NHS to decide and arrange accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.3/5">Under certain circumstances, patients who are attending an ISTC for NHS-funded treatment who do not qualify for free transport may be eligible for the reimbursement of the costs they incur in travelling to and from their appointment through the Healthcare Travel Costs Scheme. This is part of the NHS Low Income Scheme and ensures that no one foregoes care because of financial constraints.</p>

	<p pid="c.1388W.5/1">The Department has received very low levels of correspondence on this issue. Of the letters that the Department did receive, most supported an extension to the BCG programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/2">However, the Department moved to a selective policy following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/3">Having reviewed all available scientific and epidemiological evidence, the JCVI recommended from September 2005 that a targeted approach to vaccination should be introduced to replace the national schools BCG programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/4">The key reasons behind this decision were:</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/5" class="indent">the primary role of the BCG vaccination is to protect individuals at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis (TB);</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/6" class="indent">since the introduction of the schools based BGC programme the epidemiology of TB has changed from a disease of the general population in tine 1950s to one of predominately high-risk groups;</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/7" class="indent">targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of TB exposure will now be vaccinated earlier in life than under the previous policy;</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/8" class="indent">the BCG is most effective at preventing severe forms of TB in infants and young children; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/9" class="indent">protection decreases with time but repeated vaccination does not appear to offer any additional protection.</p>
	<p pid="c.1388W.5/10">JCVI reviewed its advice in 2007 and concluded that the evidence continued to support the Department of Health policy. A copy of the JCVI advice on this issue is available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1390W.4/1">&quot;Informal Adult Learning&mdash;Shaping the Way Ahead&quot; started an important debate about the role and nature of informal adult learning in the 21st century. The response to the consultation exceeded expectations, with around 5,500 responses. We published the Central Office for Information's consultation report and the DIUS response on our website on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-09">Thursday 9 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.4/2">Informal adult learning is highly valued by Government. We recognise the significant contribution it makes to the quality of life, health and well-being of individuals, neighbourhoods and wider society. We have made an unequivocal commitment to sustain its funding, with &pound;210 million available every year until the end of the comprehensive spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1390W.4/3">DIUS officials are now developing the proposals arising from the consultation, working closely with a wide range of stakeholders. These policy proposals will pave the way towards a new informal adult learning strategy to be published early next year.</p>

Universities also determine what advice should be provided to their students on plagiarism. The Quality Assurance Agency's code of practice, the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Higher Education Academy provide advice and guidance to universities on dealing with this issue. JISC includes on its Plagiarism Advisory Service website a list of well-known European and US essay bank websites, to make academics and teachers aware of these sites. Academics can use examples from these sites to demonstrate how essays used from such sources are often of poor quality and can be identified during their marking.</p>

	<p pid="c.1400W.2/1">Government funding is focused on supporting people to gain the basic platform of skills for entering and progressing in sustained employment. This is reflected in the balance of responsibility between Government, learners and employers in meeting the costs of training with learners and employers contributing more to the costs where they see the greatest private returns. We do not specify whether the contribution towards the cost of a course comes from the learner or the employer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.2/2">For 2008-09, the funding a college or provider receives for a course through the adult learner responsive model is based on an assumption that a contribution of 42.5 per cent. is made towards the costs of the course. Learners who are on income related benefits or studying a Skills for Life basic literacy or numeracy qualification, a first full level 2 or first for level 3 qualification (where they are aged under 25 year olds) will not have to pay fees.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.2/3">Within Train to Gain (which now includes all NVQs delivered in the workplace) there is an assumed contribution where the learner is aged over 25 years and studying at level 3 or above. For Adult Apprenticeships, the funding is based a contribution broadly in line with the national fee assumption.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.2/4">In all cases it is for the college or provider to determine the actual level of contribution towards the cost of the course and how this contribution is made. It is therefore not possible to provide information on the total level of co-funding made in respect of specific courses.</p>

	<p pid="c.1401W.9/1">The Government are undertaking a series of programmes to promote democracy in Afghanistan, across a range of issues. This includes supporting the forthcoming elections, educating the electorate, helping build solid institutional capacity, delivering security, protecting and promoting human rights, including freedom of expression, and encouraging political participation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/2">The Government gave over &pound;20 million to support the 2004-05 Afghan elections, and we are committed to presidential, parliamentary and provincial council elections going ahead in 2009-10. So far this year we have given &pound;6 million to support the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to conduct voter registration and we are working closely with the UN on election planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/3">Our armed forces continue to work hard with their Afghan counterparts to provide the broader security needed for voter registration and elections to take place, and as in 2004-05, they are also ready to provide wider logistical support if needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/4">Across Afghanistan the IEC is also conducting voter outreach&mdash;helping the Afghan electorate to understand both the importance of voting and how they can decide the future of their country. Education is vital to help voters make informed choices, and in 2007-08 we provided &pound;55 million to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund to help finance the salaries of over 100,000 teachers. These resources have contributed to the increase of pupils enrolled in school from two million in 2002 to around six million today.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/5">Freedom of expression, particularly for the media, is key to creating the space necessary for political debate. We have raised our concerns in individual cases where journalists' freedom has been threatened. We are also working with both the BBC World Service and the BBC World Service Trust (the World Service's charitable arm) on projects to improve and develop the media in Afghanistan. For example, we are involving female Afghan journalists in 'Afghan's Woman's Hour' which informs and empowers women in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/6">A key component of democratic development is ensuring women have a vote and are represented in both Parliament and government. In the 2005 elections, over 40 per cent. of those who voted were women&mdash;a major step forward from life under the Taliban. In addition 27 per cent. of seats in the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament are now held by women. There is currently one female Afghan Minister and one female Governor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/7">Since 2001 we have committed over &pound;1.65 billion to aid the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan. Around 80 per cent. of our current aid to Afghanistan is channelled through the democratically elected Afghan government, to help strengthen both its capacity and legitimacy. On the ground in Helmand, we are also working hard with the local Governor to ensure that the Afghan government deliver basic services for their people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1401W.9/8">It is a large task and a long-term endeavour, but these combined approaches to democratic development in Afghanistan are ensuring that gradual progress is being made.</p>

	<p pid="c.1411W.2/1">It is the longstanding policy of the UK, and the EU, to stand up for the internationally recognised principles to which so many Iranians aspire, including human rights, political freedoms and genuinely democratic, transparent and accountable government. We maintain contacts with a wide range of Iranians in many different fields (in and outside government) who work to support reform and the rule of law, including some connected to the Iranian student movement, which has historically been involved in the promotion of civil rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.1411W.2/2">We are concerned by the growing pressure facing student activists this year, and the Iranian Government's refusal to acknowledge the rights of student activist groups. Many have been arrested and imprisoned for taking part in activities in support of their rights, such as demonstrations on National University Students' Day; and student publications are often targeted and closed down. In July five students were arrested in Mashhad for pursuing the cases of other detained students. The EU, with strong UK support, regularly raises concerns about human rights violations with the Iranian authorities. A recent EU demarche, delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October</phrase>, raised specific concerns about the increased pressure on Iranian students and the large number of arrests in recent months.</p>
