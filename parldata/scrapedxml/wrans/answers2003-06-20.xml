The new member states will take on EU partnership and co-operation agreements, and will therefore provide expanded access for developing countries under preferential and free trade arrangements, the EU's Generalised System of Preferences and the &quot;Everything But Arms&quot; scheme. Overall, enlargement will give access to a larger single market of up to half a billion people, with one set of rules and regulations applying throughout.</p>
	<p pid=".451W.6/3">However, enlargement will not alter the conclusion that the CAP as it stands has a detrimental impact on developing countries. The government are committed to CAP reform as a key element towards their goal of a more sustainable agriculture. A fundamentally reformed and market-oriented CAP would benefit developing countries, as well as farmers, consumers, the environment, and taxpayers in both old and new EU member states.</p>

For liquid discharges, the total alpha plus total beta (excluding tritium) measurements in table 1 provide a simple indication of past and future discharges that is representative of the overall discharge. Tritium in liquid discharges, which has very low radiological toxicity, despite being high in quantitive terms, is shown separately in table 2.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.8/3">For aerial discharges in table 3, the total alpha plus total beta measurements relate to particulate activity discharged to the atmosphere from the Sellafield site. In addition to the particulate activity there are low active radioactive gases and vapours discharged from the site which require specific sampling equipment dependent upon the gas to be measured. These measurements are separate from and in addition to the total alpha and total beta measurements and are provided in table 4 to give a more complete picture of past aerial discharges. Included in the gaseous measurements are the noble gases such as Krypton 85 and Argon 41 which are inert and consequently do not react with the environment through the normal pathways of rainwater or ground deposition. Their impact on man is through external exposure and as such their impact in terms of dose is relatively low, although in quantitive terms the discharges appear to be large.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.8/4">The projected results of liquid discharges in tables 5 and 6 are reproduced from the UK's Strategy for Radioactive Discharges, 2001&ndash;20, published in July 2002 and are shown as averaged 5-year predictions. Aerial projections are not currently available. These will be developed in the context of the first revision of the UK's Radioactive Discharges Strategy which is due to be published in 2005.</p>

Over the period in question there have been some changes to regional management structures in the South, which together with accounting constraints, mean that no exact correlation of data is possible.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.8/2">For the fiscal year 2001&ndash;02 the total spend on travel and subsistence for the Law Enforcement South Region was &pound;2.32 million, and covers the operations of all detection, intelligence and investigation officers.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.8/3">For the fiscal year 2002&ndash;03 the total spend was &pound;2.42 million. The initial allocation of funds to cover travel and subsistence costs for this region for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;2.55 million.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.8/4">For 2004&ndash;05 we would expect similar expenditure to 2003&ndash;04 but would adjust accordingly at the time of allocation in the light of any new business developments or changes.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.8/5">The figure for 2003&ndash;04 does not yet take account of new activities related to anti-terrorism and Products of Animal Origin (POAO), which may result in higher spending on travel and subsistence allowances in the South Region.</p>

	<p pid=".465W.9/1">There are some 6,000 children working on plantations in Ecuador and thousands more working on small farms. They do so because of the lack of earning opportunities available to their parents. There is no concrete evidence to suggest that children are being forced against their will to work in plantations. The only sustainable solution is to improve earning opportunities for poor people. We continue to encourage multilateral donors to focus their support on the needs of the poorest to help achieve this.</p>

	<p pid=".465W.9/3">The British embassy monitors the compliance of Ecuador to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights legislation to which Ecuador is a signatory. The UK Government are committed to helping eliminate child labour globally, particularly the worst forms such as child slavery, and all forms of abusive or exploitative child labour. The Government strongly supports the International Labour Organisation's work to fight child labour and the UK has ratified both of the ILO Child Labour Conventions.</p>

	<p pid=".469W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-19">19 June 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/2">In recent years, the Presevo Valley in the south of Serbia and Montenegro (formerly Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) has experienced clashes between the Serbian security forces and armed extremist elements from the local ethnic Albanian community. The security situation has now improved following a peace settlement in May 2001, and a political process which has incorporated the Albanian minority more fully into local government.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/3">Tensions re-emerged in February this year when there were renewed attacks on Serbian security forces from ethnic Albanian extremists, largely based in eastern Kosovo. With the support of the international community, the Serbian authorities brought the situation under control. There remains an increased security forces presence in the region but the situation is currently calm and stable, with only occasional isolated incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/4">Progress on refugee returns to southern Serbia has been good. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) estimates that 90 per cent. of ethnic Albanian internally displaced persons (IDPs) or refugees from Presevo have returned, 66 per cent. from Bujanovic district, and 70 per cent. from Medvedja district. The principal obstacle to further returns is the poor economic situation in the region. We have received no reports of destruction or illegal occupation of properties in any area of the PresevoValley.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/5">The Serb authorities, through the Serbian Government's Co-ordinating Body for Southern Serbia (SGCB), and the International Community continue in their efforts to consolidate the rule of law and multiethnic democracy in the region. There are no international peacekeeping forces in southern Serbia itself. KFOR maintains a presence in Kosovo and in Macedonia, which borders with the Presevo Valley.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/6">United Nations agencies, the OSCE and the European Union Monitoring Mission operate in southern Serbia, as well as a large number of NGOs. These include:American Refugee Committee (ARC); Development Alternatives Inc (DAI); International Rescue Committee (IRC); Medecins du Monde (MDM); Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF); Belgian Red Cross; International Organisation for Migration (IOM); United Methodist Committee of Relief (UMCOR); OXFAM; Cooperazione Internazionale (COOPI); CARE; CHF International; Action contre le Faim (ACF).</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/7">The UK continues to take a close interest in the democratic development and the security situation in southern Serbia. We have contributed financial assistance to projects aimed at stabilising the region, including the OSCE's Multi-Ethnic Policing programme. The last visit by officials from the British Embassy in Belgrade took place on 19&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-03-20">20 March 2003</phrase>. We look forward to seeing progress in tackling the economic problems of the region, and in integrating ethnic Albanians more closely into the local state structures, both of which will help to stabilise the region further.</p>

	<p pid=".477W.5/1">In the year 2000, the Government published the 'No Secrets' guidance on developing and implementing multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse. This guidance, issued to local authorities and others, includes a paragraph (6.32) on the role of advocates, which says:</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;In some cases, it will be necessary to appoint an independent advocate to represent the interests of those subject to abuse. In such cases, all agencies should set out how the services of advocates can be accessed, and the role they should take.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/3">The guidance, issued to local authorities and others, in relation to 'Valuing People' in August 2001, says that development of and support for advocacy services are a priority in Valuing People. Learning disability partnership boards should collate information about the strengths and weaknesses of advocacy services in their area and use this material as the basis for making recommendations about projects to be paid for out of the Development Fund and mainstream funds.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/4">In addition, the Department funded the publication in 2001 of 'Deciding Together', which provides advice on how organisations can better involve people with learning disabilities in decision making that affects their lives, including a chapter on independent advocacy.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/5">The Adoption and Children Act 2002 places a new duty on councils with social service responsibilities, to arrange advocacy services for looked after children and care leavers who make a complaint under sections 26 and 24D of the Children Act. Draft regulations and guidance will be issued for consultation over the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/6">Listening to children underpins the Quality Protects programme and a special grant is available to all councils, to develop independent advocacy services. There has been considerable growth in such services since the start of the programme in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/7">At the request of the Department of Health, Durham University undertook a study of current mental health advocacy services to assist the Department in developing this new specialist advocacy service. Its report contains a number of recommendations for good practice. We will now be working with existing advocacy service providers, people with mental illness and other stakeholders to ensure that we develop an effective advocacy service.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.5/8">No specific guidance has been provided to the National Health Service on advocacy groups. However, as part of the new patient advice and liaison service, available now in most trusts, patients can be sign-posted to local known specialist advocacy groups where they exist. In the area of supporting patients with complaints about NHS services, it is intended to provide an independent complaints advocacy service across the country from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".479W.0/1">My right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit, in close collaboration with other Government Departments, including the Department of Health, is currently developing the national alcohol harm reduction strategy, which will sit alongside the national drugs strategy. The Strategy Unit is due to publish an interim analysis of the harms associated with alcohol misuse in the summer.

There is currently no specific maximum waiting time target for treatment for those with alcohol dependency.

There is a wide range of services available for those with alcohol problems requiring treatment. Medical management is available in primary and secondary care. Specialist services provide a range of psychotherapeutic interventions focusing on alcohol use and the wider contributory factors to development of dependence.</p>

	<p pid=".487W.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-10">10 March 2003</phrase>, the Department published &quot;Inside Out&quot;, a report making recommendations for improving mental health services for black and minority ethnic groups. The report was developed with the close involvement of local communities and black and minority ethnic stakeholders and provides part of a race impact assessment on mental health. This has provided the evidence to show that there is impact, which is adverse, disproportionate and unjustifiable in terms of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act. The Department will be taking remedial action and will be publishing a remedial action plan for consultation in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".487W.5/5">As required by its employment duties, the Department will be publishing a report later this summer on the ethnic monitoring data collected so far and also has a programme of work under way to put in place the additional monitoring arrangements required.</p>

	<p pid=".488W.8/1">New data from clinical trials of paroxetine (Seroxat) in children and adolescents were received by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) at the end of May 2003. These new data have been reviewed by an expert working group on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The data do not demonstrate efficacy in depressive illness in this age group and show an increase in the risk of episodes of self-harm and potentially suicidal behaviour in the Seroxat group compared to placebo. Various analyses suggest that the risk of these events is between 1.5 and 3.2 times greater with Seroxat compared to placebo. On the basis of these data, the CSM has advised that Seroxat should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to treat depressive illness. This advice was communicated to health professionals via the Public Health Link on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-10">10 June 2003</phrase> and was placed on the MHRA website, along with information for patients. Revised patient information leaflets containing the new advice are being sent to prescribers and pharmacists.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.8/2">Seroxat is not licensed for use in those under 18, but it is used in this age group outside its licensed indications where prescribes make a judgment on their own responsibility that it is the right treatment for a particular patient.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.8/3">SSRIs, including Seroxat, have been under close continuous review by the MHRA and the CSM for a number of years. The product information for SSRI antidepressants already contains advice that suicidal thoughts and behaviour are likely to increase in the early stages of treatment of depression (as with all antidepressants) and patient information leaflets already contain advice to seek medical attention urgently in the event of such symptoms.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.8/4">The CSM formally reviewed the issue of suicidal behaviour with SSRIs most recently in December 2001 and concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to confirm a causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour, although an effect in a small high-risk population could not be ruled out. The CSM has advised that Seroxat is an effective treatment for adults with depressive illness and anxiety disorders and that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.8/5">The expert working group of the CSM will examine urgently what implications, if any, these new findings from clinical trials in children have for the use of Seroxat in adults and for other SSRIs.</p>

	<p pid=".489W.2/1">A new expert group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has been convened to further review the safety of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and to ensure the advice in the product information for both patients and prescribers is optimal for the safe use of these products. This group has been asked to examine what implications, if any, the CSM's recent advice on the use of Seroxat in children have for the use of Seroxat in adults and for other SSRIs. The timetable for the group's programme of work has been planned with a view to the availability of advice as promptly as possible, commensurate with a full and detailed consideration of the evidence including the experiences of patients. As part of its initial considerations, the group has advised on strengthened advice on side effects and withdrawal reactions for inclusion in the patient information leaflet on Seroxat. Product information for other SSRIs will also be considered.</p>
	<p pid=".489W.2/2">The advice of the CSM, most recently in 2001, is that the benefits of Seroxat, when used in adults for licensed indications, outweigh the risks. Regulatory authorities world-wide have also taken a similar position. Depression and anxiety disorders are serious conditions that can cause severe suffering and are associated with an increased risk of suicide. The availability of effective treatments is critically important. In the absence of evidence indicating that the risks of using Seroxat in adults outweigh the benefits, it would be difficult to justify withdrawing the medicine from use.</p>
	<p pid=".489W.2/3">The Yellow Card Scheme is recognised to be one of the best in the world in terms of the level of reporting, has a proven track record of identifying new drug safety hazards and enables the monitoring of all medicines, including Seroxat, in clinical use. The effectiveness of the Scheme is under continuous review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the CSM. From April 2003, the first phase of patient reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions via NHS Direct was introduced. When fully rolled out in England and Wales, this will enable the first hand experiences of patients to be utilised in the identification and assessment of drug safety issues. Other measures to further strengthen the Yellow Card Scheme include a new regional monitoring centre, established in Scotland last year and the inclusion of education on yellow card reporting in the training of nurse prescribers.</p>

	<p pid=".492W.2/1">The Home Office does not hold information on the number of Open Circuit Television (OCTV) systems acquired by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".492W.2/2">The cost comparison between an OCTV system and a conventional Close Circuit Television (CCTV) system is not straightforward owing to the differing natures of the two systems and reasons for their use. An OCTV system comprising of a Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) camera and computerised monitoring station will cost in the order of &pound;12,000 (+VAT and delivery etc.). A typical single camera CCTV system will cost anything between &pound;8,000 and &pound;30,000 to purchase and install. On running costs, the OCTV system will incur mobile telephone call charges plus any standing charges. The CCTV system will possibly incur leasing fees for the transmission network.</p>
	<p pid=".492W.2/3">To help ensure maximum impact and sustainability of CCTV, a &pound;1.5 million Home Office funded national evaluation programme is being carried out by the Scarman Centre, University of Leicester, on 15 approved CCTV Initiative schemes. However, no assessment has been made of the effectiveness of OCTV in fighting crime.</p>

The Government, by means of the UK National Contact Point, encourage strongly companies' involvement in and adherence to the Guidelines; which are supported by the business community and trade union federations.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.5/3">The Government expect companies operating in the UK and UK companies investing overseas, to act in accordance with the principles set out in the Guidelines and to perform to at least the standards they suggest.</p>

	<p pid=".498W.5/2">The Government are working to ensure that GATS offers real benefits both to the UK, as the world's second largest exporter of services, and to developing country members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We believe that the progressive, properly managed, liberalisation of services can stimulate economic growth and help reduce poverty. The World Bank estimates that a liberalising trade round could bring 300 million people out of poverty by 2015. Developing countries could increase their annual income by up to $60 billion for a relatively modest degree of services liberalisation. This is greater than total annual aid flows to developing countries ($50 billion).</p>

	<p pid=".500W.5/2">The mid-Round Ministerial Conference in Cancun is our main opportunity to provide increased political momentum towards a successful outcome to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) by the current target of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/3">The UK and EU priority for Cancun is to seek an outcome which keeps all aspects of the DDA negotiations on track and within the single undertaking.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/4">As part of the DDA we are determined to reform agricultural trade, as agreed at Doha, by substantially improving market access, substantially reducing trade distorting domestic farm support and reducing, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies, which do so much harm to developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/5">On market access for non-agricultural goods we will be seeking significantly improved access market by tackling high tariffs, tariff peaks, tariff escalation and non-tariff barriers, in order to significantly increase trading opportunities for all WTO members, including between developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/6">We are hopeful that the services negotiations will bring considerable market opportunities for business as well as benefits to consumers world-wide. However, we are not seeking general deregulation or privatisation of sectors where principles of public interest are at stake, such as healthcare, education and the provision of water.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/7">We are committed to finding solutions to justified developing countries' concerns about implementation of existing WTO agreements, to their proposals for specific actions for Special and Differential Treatment and to providing trade-related assistance to help their participation in WTO negotiations, to implement the results of the DDA, and to build up their trade capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/8">We believe that launching negotiations on the &quot;Singapore Issues&quot; (investment, competition, transparency in government procurement and trade facilitation) at Cancun will help provide predictability, transparency, secure market access gains, and level a playing field for all WTO members.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.5/9">In addition, we strongly welcome G8 leaders' commitment to securing a resolution to the issue of access to affordable medicines for developing countries, before Cancun.</p>

	<p pid=".502W.5/1">I have taken the hon. Member to mean academics rather than academies. University Challenge is not designed to sponsor academics to move into industry, nor does it support established businesses. In their first three years of operation, the 15 Seed Funds established in 1999 have assisted the creation of 159 spinout companies. It is too early to assess the long-term survival rates of these companies, but an evaluation of the University Challenge Scheme is expected to begin in mid-autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".502W.8/1">A review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 was launched by my predecessor in July 2001 with the publication of a consultation document &quot;Tackling the loan sharks&mdash;and more!&quot; A summary of responses was published in February 2002 and a progress report was published in August 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/2">There has been further consultation on five key areas for reform:</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/3" class="indent">Increasing or removing the &pound;25,000 financial limit in the Consumer Credit Act and reviewing the status of some exempt;</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/4" class="indent">Making the regulations on early settlement fair and equitable to both lenders and borrowers;</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/5" class="indent">Enabling lenders and consumers to be able to enter into and conclude credit agreements by electronic means;</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/6" class="indent">Reform of the consumer credit licensing regime; and</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/7" class="indent">Reform of the protections offered to consumers in respect of extortionate credit;</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/8">Further consultation papers will focus on:</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/9" class="indent">Simplifying the consumer credit advertising regulations; and</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/10" class="indent">The form and content of credit agreements;</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/11">I intend to complete an implementation plan later this year and implementation will begin in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/12">The consultation on making the extortionate credit provisions within the Consumer Credit Act 1974 more effective closed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-06">6 June 2003</phrase>. The responses to this consultation are currently being analysed. Once this analysis is complete I will publish details of the measures I intend to take to protect vulnerable borrowers from exploitation.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/13">In addition a National Debt Helpline pilot was launched in March 2002 to give consumers free, easy access to debt advice and where appropriate help them to draw up debt repayment plans to manage their debts. This project is funded jointly by the Government and the credit and finance industry.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.8/14">The pilot aims to test how effectively consumer debt problems can be resolved by a national telephone advice and to establish the strength of the case for a national free money advice service. Since <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-01">1 March 2002</phrase> the National Debtline has helped 29,412 people with debt problems. They deal with 700 calls per week, providing a wide range of advice including on income maximisation, bankruptcy and debt management schemes to a wide variety of people from various social and economic groups.</p>

They also gave an update on the High Level process of reflection on patient mobility and health care development, indicating that the second Ministerial plenary session would take place in July.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/7">Under any other business the Commission updated the Council on the programme of co-operation on bioterrorism and health security. The Commission also presented a proposed Recommendation on Cancer Screening. Voting was not required on either of these items. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Andrew Smith) represented the UK together with my hon. Friend, then Minister for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions (Alan Johnson), at the Employment and Social Policy part of the ESPHCA on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-03">3 June</phrase> in Luxembourg.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/8">The Council agreed a general approach to the 2003 Employment Guidelines. The EP will now be consulted as directed by the Treaty and the Guidelines will be adopted at a future Council as an A point. The UK are content with the simplified guidelines which are more focused on the employment targets set at Lisbon in 2000 and are geared more towards outcomes. Council also agreed the Recommendations on member states employment policies, the second part of the Employment package.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/9">There was a lengthy discussion on the proposed Directive on Temporary Agency workers which was originally tabled for political agreement. The Council was unable to reach agreement on the proposal and the Presidency remitted further negotiations to the Italian Presidency, recalling that the Brussels Spring Council urged agreement on the directive by December 2003. The UK maintained its position that it could back a directive that supported agency workers without putting their jobs at risk. Any directive must reflect the realities of our labour market.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/10">Council agreed the rest of the items on the agenda with little or no discussion. Council reached political agreement on a regulation on the European Co-operative Statute and a parallel directive on employee involvement.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/11">Council also reached political agreement on a Decision setting up an Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work. The UK and Denmark made a written declaration, to be included in the minutes of the Council, regretting the use of Article 202 as the legal base for this Decision.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/12">Council adopted two Resolutions without discussion: one Resolution on building social and human capital in the knowledge society; and a second on promoting the employment and social integration of people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/13">Council also agreed a general approach on the three chapters of a Regulation to replace Regulation 1408/71, the co-ordination of member states' social security systems, that have been discussed under the Greek Presidency. The chapters concerned cover invalidity benefits, pensions and special non-contributory benefits. Work will continue under the Italian Presidency with a view to completing the simplification of this regulation by December 2003, as requested by the European Council at Barcelona in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/14">The Council approved, without debate, the Social Protection Committee's plans to carry out themed studies on pensions issues.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/15">Under the Council's new rules of procedure, both the Commission and the Presidency presented Any Other Business items as written information. There was no discussion of these points.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.2/16">No votes were taken in this part of the Council.</p>

	<p pid=".508W.9/1">The cost of maintaining the C130K fleet is estimated at around &pound;30 million per year (covering maintenance and support, but not the cost of aircrew, fuel, etc.). Based on current plans, it is expected that these aircraft will be withdrawn from service around the end of this decade. To ensure that the fleet remains operational up to this point, it is expected that modifications will be required on most of the fleet to maintain structural integrity of the aircraft. A more substantial work package, including outer wing replacement, may be required for several C130K aircraft that have undertaken more demanding flying tasks during recent operations.</p>
	<p pid=".508W.9/2">We currently operate four C-17 aircraft obtained under lease until 2008. If we exercise the option to extend the lease on all four to 2010, the additional costs are estimated at around &pound;130 million in total. This sum includes the cost of the lease extension and in-service costs for the two-year period 2008&ndash;10.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.2/1">The forces participating in the operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be under the political control and strategic direction of the EU Council of Ministers. This is exercised through the Political and Security Committee which is comprised of representatives of member states. We expect that personnel and equipment participating in the operation will carry some form of identifying EU insignia, as is the case for the EU-led operation in Macedonia. This follows the example of NATO operations where participating forces are expected to wear NATO insignia.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.2/1">The High Court judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-13">13 June 2003</phrase> against the Ministry of Defence, as appellant, rested on a number of considerations. A key consideration was that the Pensions Appeal Tribunal was entitled to find, in Mr. Rusling's case, that the Ministry of Defence had failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that disablement due to 'Gulf War Syndrome', which he claimed in 1994, was neither attributable nor aggravated by his Service in the armed forces. The High Court made it clear that it was not in a position to express any views on whether, according to current medical research, 'Gulf War Syndrome' was or was not a 'single disease entity', and the judge confirmed that the court had not expressed any such view in its judgment. The court confirmed that all other cases would have to be decided on their own facts.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.2/2">We would not expect the level of Mr. Rusling's war pension to be affected by this judgment as the disablement that he describes as 'Gulf War Syndrome' is already being fully compensated for in his war pension award, using the World Health Organisation's International Classification of diseases, 10th edition, (ICD10) category, &quot;Signs, Symptoms and Ill-Defined Conditions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.2/3">Of those veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict who have already claimed for conditions they attribute to their Service in the armed forces, many have already received a war pension. These awards have been based on consideration on whether there was evidence of disablement and whether this was attributable to Service. Where these have been satisfied, an award has been made. Similarly, therefore, the eligibility for an award and its level has not been affected by the issue of whether or not there was a single disease entity, 'Gulf War Syndrome'.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.2/1">Amendments to the Building Regulations that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> significantly improved the requirements for the safe accommodation and energy efficiency of new and replacement domestic boilers. We announced in the Energy White Paper (EWP) that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will raise the energy performance standard even further to the level of the most efficient types of condensing boilers, and that we aim to bring the next major review of the Building Regulations into effect in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/2">The Government are well aware of the hazards associated with combustion appliances and encourage periodic maintenance checks. It is the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's view that the frequency of inspections should be determined by appliance manufacturers having regard to the type of fuel used. Guidance and encouragement supporting this position is conveyed in:</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/3" class="indent">the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister leaflet, &quot;Solid Fuel, Wood and Oil Burning Appliances : Get Them Checked, Sweep Your Chimneys and be Safe&quot;. This warns of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and encourages appropriate maintenance for solid fuel and oil appliances which includes checking for gas tightness; and</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/4" class="indent">the HSE leaflet, &quot;Get Them Checked&mdash;Keep Them Safe&quot;. This provides similar advice for gas users.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/5">The Energy Saving Trust (EST) advises on annual servicing of domestic boilers and safety awareness through its network of Energy Efficiency Advice Centres (EEACs).</p>
	<p pid=".525W.2/6">In addition to this general guidance and encouragement, the increased risks to health and safety in rented accommodation are addressed through the requirement in the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations for annual checks. Advice to landlords is available from Letlink.</p>

	<p pid=".527W.3/1">The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal (2001) sets out the vision of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for narrowing the gap between the most deprived areas and the rest of the country on the key domains of crime, health, education and skills, worklessness, and housing and the physical environment.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/2">An important element in delivering the strategy is the introduction of floor targets under SR2000. These are National Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets that set a floor or minimum standard so that Whitehall Departments are judged for the first time on the areas they are doing worse rather than on the national average. Under SR2002, Department for Transport (DfT) have signed up to a PSA target on road safety with a floor component:</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/3" class="indent">Reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in Great Britain in road accidents by 40 per cent., and the number of children killed or seriously injured by 50 per cent., by 2010 compared with the average for 1994&ndash;98, tackling the significantly higher incidence in disadvantaged communities.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/4">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit has been working closely with the DfT on its proposals for tackling road accident casualties in deprived areas. DfT is targeting &pound;17.6 million to those deprived areas with a high number of child pedestrian casualties. Several of these are in Greater Manchester and around. Local authorities will be expected to draw up local strategies to tackle the problem and obtain results in three years. Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) and the police will have a stake locally. In these areas, LSPs will play a key role in drawing together all the key agencies from both from the public and voluntary, community and business sectors to deliver decisions and actions that join up partners' activities. The Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) could be used to support some of the less 'roads' oriented work.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/5" class="italic">NRF and LSPs</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/6">The Spending Review 2000 made available &pound;900 million for NRF (&pound;200 million in 2001&ndash;02, &pound;300 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;400 million in 2003&ndash;04), and an additional &pound;975 million was made available as part of the Spending Review 2002 (&pound;450 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;525 million in 2005&ndash;06).</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/7">NRF can be spent in any way that tackles deprivation in the most deprived neighbourhoods, particularly, but not exclusively, in relation to floor targets and to local targets set out in the Local Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy (LNRS) agreed by each of the 87 LSPs (Kerrier and Penwith work together as the west Cornwall LSP). NRF spending plans are therefore determined locally, and the NRF can be used to support not only local authority services, but also those of other organisations, including other members of the LSP. NRF is used primarily to facilitate the bending of mainstream resources to tackle deprivation in the most deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/8">Various innovative local transport schemes have been pursued across England as part of the NRF:</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/9" class="indent">from a total NRF allocation of &pound;722,708 for 2002&ndash;03, Ashfield local authority has spent &pound;87,220 on access to services and facilities improvement. Two buses have been acquired to link isolated parts of the district council;</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/10" class="indent">in the north-east, Stockton-on-Tees local authority, from a total NRF allocation of &pound;2,889,153 for 2002&ndash;03, has an estimated spend of &pound;28,877 towards an initiative in the Queens Park ward, which has provided greater access for the disabled and disadvantaged through alternatives to public transport. In Wear Valley, &pound;34,000 has been spent on demand responsive community transport for health;</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/11" class="indent">in the north-west, Wirral local authority has spent &pound;110,000 from a total NRF allocation of &pound;3,806,394 for 2002&ndash;03 on a Heritage Skills and Community Transport programme, creating a base for social enterprise that will provide training in construction, driving and mechanical skills for people from priority areas; and</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/12" class="indent">Islington local authority in London, from a total NRF allocation of &pound;4,702,515 for 2002&ndash;03, has spent &pound;42,500 providing safe, accessible and sustainable transport linking people to services.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/13">Some LSPs have identified access and transport related priority themes when developing their Local Neighbourhood Renewal Strategies (LNRS). For example:</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/14" class="indent">Hackney LNRS has a transport Action Plan to:</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/15" class="indent">combat congestion on local roads to reduce pollution and minimise accidents;</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/16" class="indent">make streets healthy and safe for pedestrians and cyclists to enable them to travel easily around the borough; and</p>

	<p pid=".527W.3/29" class="indent">New Deal for Communities (NDC) supports inclusive neighbourhood partnerships, which identify the priority needs of their area and develop appropriate regeneration strategies. We do not hold data centrally about how much NDC funding is allocated to transport projects in each region.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/30">The specific problems of each NDC neighbourhood are unique, but each NDC partnership looks for outcomes that make a real impact on the people living in their neighbourhood, by tackling five key themes: poor job prospects; high levels of crime; educational under-achievement; poor health; and problems with housing and the physical environment.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.3/31">As each NDC neighbourhood has different needs, some but not all NDC Partnerships have specific transport projects. One example of such a project is the Shoreditch NDC Partnership, which launched a project called the Shoreditch Hoppa, which is a new local bus serving the NDC neighbourhood. This project has been so successful that it has been mainstreamed by Transport for London.</p>

	<p pid=".530W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to promoting the achievement of sustainable development in the UK, in support of the WSSD commitments, through a range of policies and programmes. We have published the Sustainable Communities Plan, held an 'Urban Summit' and will be holding a 'Better Buildings' Summit later this year. All of these have sustainable development at their core. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Delivery Agreements relating to sustainable communities, sustainable regional economic growth, the provision of decent housing and action to promote neighbourhood renewal and reduce social exclusion, are all in support of successive sustainable development aims and commitments. In addition, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister supports the Government's aim of sustainable development in specific areas, for example, promoting energy efficiency in buildings as part of the Government's Energy White Paper and in areas set out in the Memorandum submitted to the Environmental Audit Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.5/2">We cannot at this stage pre-empt the arrangements for the 2004 Spending Review, though we will continue to ensure that sustainable development is at the heart of the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
