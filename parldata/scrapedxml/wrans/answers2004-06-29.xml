	<p pid=".155W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-21">21 June</phrase>. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Affairs was also present.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/2">The Council held a public debate following the Commission's presentation of an Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. We joined other Ministers in welcoming the Plan while stressing that expansion of the organic sector would have to be driven by consumer demand. The UK would play its part in further discussion but would want to ensure that requirements laid on the organic sector were economically realistic.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/3">The Commission updated the Council on continuing WTO negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda and on its negotiations for a trade agreement with the Mercosur countries. We endorsed the efforts of the Commission to work for progress on both fronts and, on the WTO, emphasised the value of securing progress before the summer break. I re-iterated the benefits that a Doha deal could bring to the world economy and especially to developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/4">The German Minister presented a memorandum to the Council on renewable resources, following a conference held last month in Bonn, which the Secretary of State had attended. Delegations welcomed the German paper, noting the growing importance of renewables. The Commission said it would submit a biomass plan by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/5">The Council had a brief exchange of views on the Commission's report on the operation of the beef labelling regulations. There was general agreement that the regulations had done much to support consumer confidence in beef and that major changes are not needed. Further technical discussion will take place at official level.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/6">The Commission presented a paper setting out proposals for promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods and a timetable for introducing new measures. This was the product of previous discussions between member states. The proposals had received wide support, including from the UK. We will continue to seek technical solutions and to support research directed at methods which respect the environment and contribute to a sustainable fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/7">The Council agreed the ceilings for the maximum fishing effort of member states in waters to the west of Britain (principally ICES Areas VI and VII). This was the final element of the arrangements agreed by the Council in October 2003, which are based on an up-dated reference period of 1998&ndash;2002 reflecting actual fishing effort over that period. We were pleased that the final text provided for consistency of approach and transparency in the calculations.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/8">The Commission sought initial views on proposals for the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency. There was general agreement that the concept was commendable if it improved consistency of enforcement. We indicated that we would be pleased to participate in discussions about the detail and registered that we believed that the Agency should complement rather than substitute the enforcement responsibilities of member states.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/9">The Commission reported on continuing negotiations with trading partners over the rice tariff and with Russia on its requirements for certificates covering animal and animal product imports.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.2/1">The harms caused by cannabis smoking are kept under expert review. Since the British Lung Foundation report the Department has commissioned and published an update of &quot;Dangerousness of Drugs&quot; (2003), an independent expert review of the harms caused by drugs of misuse, which addresses the risks associated with smoking. In addition, the FRANK campaign and website, &quot;talktofrank&quot;, have raised awareness of these risks, increasing knowledge among young people of the illegality of cannabis use and the fact that it is a harmful substance.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.2/2">The Department has also set up an expert working group made up of members of the scientific committee on tobacco and health and the advisory council on the misuse of drugs to consider the issues of cannabis and tobacco smoking, and has commissioned research into the smoke produced by these substances, on the advice of this group, with results due later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.3/1">The contraceptive implant currently available in the United Kingdom is Implanon, a progestagen-only implant that provides contraception for a period of three years. Implanon is a prescription-only medicine which may be recommended for women of any age but which is most commonly used by older women.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.3/2">Studies carried out by the marketing authorisation holder for Implanon were evaluated at the time of licensing and the product information states that safety and efficacy has been established in women between the ages of 18 and 40 years. The limited available data do not suggest that the safety profile of Implanon is different in women under the age of 18 years. However, no formal research has been carried out and the judgement on the balance of risks and benefits in women under 18 is the responsibility of the prescribing physician.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.3/3">Health care professionals are encouraged to discuss the potential side effects with everyone who seeks treatment. In addition, prescribers are expected to satisfy themselves that all women understand the risks and benefits of using Implanon and that it is in their best interests to receive the treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.3/4">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will continue to monitor the safety of Implanon and will review any potential safety issues in the light of any new evidence which may emerge.</p>

Savings to the defence budget come from spreading the fixed overhead costs of equipment over the longer production runs generated by exports, from the sale of surplus military equipment to overseas Governments, and from Commercial Exploitation Levy on exports of equipment developed using public money.</p>

	<p pid=".184W.9/1">Current arrangements for cross-Channel freight services derive from the contract between Eurotunnel, British Railways Board and SNCF. As required by section 206 of the Transport Act 2000, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is developing a regional Channel Tunnel strategy for passenger and freight services. The SRA's proposals will have to take account of the business plan expected to be produced shortly by the Eurotunnel Board.</p>

Child deaths or serious injuries were down 40 per cent.; over three-quarters of the way towards our 50 per cent. target by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.5/3">The strategy included a commitment to formally review progress every three years. The first review published in April 2004 concluded that we are on track to deliver the challenging casualty reduction targets, while highlighting some areas requiring continuing attention. These areas are being given special focus as we continue to develop the strategy as new ideas and technology emerge.</p>

	<p pid=".187W.0/1">I recently met the Chair and Director of the British Film Institute (BFI), to discuss their plans to reform the BFI. A key element of this strategy is a long-term plan to secure and further develop the BFI's Archive. Immediate initial investment is being made to stabilise the collection, improve storage, and enhance public understanding of its contents. Increased training of existing staff and recruitment of new curatorial and technical staff will support this capital investment.</p>
	<p pid=".187W.0/2">Through the UK Film Council, the Government have increased their core funding of the BFI from &pound;14.5 million to &pound;16 million this financial year, together with a one off award of an additional &pound;2 million in capital funds. It is not possible to itemise expenditure specifically for digitisation. The largest proportion of new material being received at the BFI Archive is UK television programming, almost all of which is now delivered in a digital format. Currently, it is not possible to calculate exactly the amount of material in the Archive that is digitised, though the BFI are planning to invest significantly in digital access technology, so that the widest possible number of people can enjoy the treasures within the film Archive.</p>

Unsuccessful outcomes in the Crown court comprise: cases in which the prosecution decided not to proceed before a jury was sworn, and in which the judge ordered an acquittal; cases written off (usually because the defendant could not be traced by the police); judge directed acquittals; and acquittals by the jury.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-29.179496.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-06-29.193W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1281" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="193W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040629/text/40629w11.htm#40629w11.html_spnew6">
	<p pid=".193W.6/1">E-mail is an extremely powerful vehicle for targeting vast numbers of consumers at very low cost. The types of scams that they carry are also becoming more sophisticated and the nature of the medium also means perpetrators can easily hide their real identities. This particular kind of fraud is therefore challenging, but we believe we are helping to put in place an effective framework of activities to meet it.</p>
	<p pid=".193W.6/2">First, through law and enforcement co-operation. E-mail fraud is dealt with under the same laws as other fraud and consumer protection laws such as misleading advertising and distance selling. Therefore they incur the same penalties for infringements of these laws. Our focus then is on ensuring that they can be effectively enforced. To help this process, we are building partnerships between Government, regulators and industry to develop ways&mdash;including technological solutions&mdash;to find the perpetrators and stop this kind of activity. As many of these types of e-mail come from abroad, a major part of this is building effective co-operation agreements with other countries. In the past two years the UK has built up a network of consumer protection co-operation agreements with other countries including the United States and our European Union partners, and we are at the forefront of driving international co-operation to tackle unsolicited emails (SPAM).</p>
	<p pid=".193W.6/3">Second, through information. Advice and guidance to help consumers is key. The Department of Trade and Industry, Home Office and Office of Fair Trading all provide a wide range of information on email fraud for consumers. See <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp">www.dti.gov.uk/ccp</a> <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice. gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk">www.oft.gov.uk</a> Consumers should also take note of the help and guidance given by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
	<p pid=".193W.6/4">We believe that this approach&mdash;encompassing co-operation, enforcement, information provision and technological solutions&mdash;is the right one, and we will continue to improve and build on these elements.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.2/1">Based on the Office for National Statistics' Low Pay data released in 2003, the DTI estimates that in Scotland, between 90,000 and 110,000 people aged 22 or over were expected to have benefited from the October 2003 uprating of the national minimum wage. It is not possible to provide estimates specifically for 18 to 21-year-olds (the Development Rate) because of small sample size.</p>

	<p pid=".199W.0/2">The use of animals in scientific procedures in the UK, whether at universities or elsewhere, is strictly regulated by the Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.0/3">Licences are only granted for animal experiments undertaken for specified permissible purposes. There has to be no alternative to using animals, and the likely benefits of the work have to outweigh the adverse effects on the animals concerned. The number of animals used and any suffering that may be caused have to be minimised.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.0/4">Any proposal to conduct a programme of animal experiments has first to be considered by the local ethical review process at the establishment concerned. A licence application is only submitted to the Home Office once those involved in that local process are satisfied that it can be justified.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.0/5">Applications received by the Home Office are rigorously assessed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, to ensure the criteria in the 1986 Act are met. Inspectors are either medical or veterinary graduates, and advise the Secretary of State on whether and on what terms licence authorities should be granted. Some applications are also referred for advice to the Animal Procedures Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.0/6">Establishments where licensed animal experiments are conducted are visited regularly by the inspectorate, to monitor progress and ensure compliance with licence authorities. The majority of visits of inspections are without notice. Appropriate action is taken should irregularities or breaches of licence conditions come to light.</p>

	<p pid=".201W.5/2">The Home Office has published a wide range of research reports containing results from evaluation of crime reduction initiatives funded under the Crime Reduction Programme (CRP). These include reports on the reducing burglary initiative, the CCTV initiative, the targeted policing initiative, the 'On Track' intervention aimed at children at risk of getting involved in crime and treatment of offenders. The reports have been deposited in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.5/3">The CRP consists of many strands and many individual projects under these strands. The CRP publication plans are designed to bring together information from the various individual projects, with an emphasis of provision of material that will provide good practice guidance for practitioners. It is expected that reports containing the results from the CRP, with the exception of the final results from the restorative justice strand and the evaluation of Probation Pathfinder Offending Behaviour Programmes, will have been published by the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.5/4">It is expected that the final evaluation report of the Probation Pathfinder Offending Behaviour Programme will appear in the summer of 2005. The CRP evaluation of restorative justice relates to a project commencing late in the course of the CRP and depends for its final assessment of effectiveness on a two-year reconviction rate study. This means that the final report is due towards the end of 2006, with publication in 2007. However, interim reports are planned for publication in 2004, 2005 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".203W.0/1">We take the use of drugs and other substances to assist in sexual offending and allegations of it very seriously. It is an offence to administer a stupefying substance with the intent of overpowering the victim to engage him or her in sexual activity. Penalties for this crime were recently substantially increased in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to a maximum of 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.0/2">An average 450 allegations of this type are investigated by the Forensic Science Service annually. Of these only between 1 and 2 per cent. show any sign of an unexplained sedative drug. We do not hold central information about the number of cases reported.</p>

This includes 'drug rape' and work with the Association of Chief Police Officers has seen improved guidance to the police. This includes a joint police and Crown Prosecution Service training package and the Joint Operational Police Instructions (JOPI) which were published in June 2003. The &quot;Core Investigative Doctrine&quot; and the &quot;Sexual Offences Investigation Manual of Guidance&quot; are also currently being updated by Centrex.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.0/5">The Government are funding a three year national drugs campaign, FRANK, which uses TV, radio and print to provide a wide range of information on drugs issues. Its target group is young people and their parents. Information about spiked drinks and the use of substances for sex offences has been included where relevant in support materials provided to stakeholders and local community organisers.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.0/6">The Safer Clubbing Guidance is to be updated later this year and will specifically contain guidance on the prevention of, and provision of information on, drug assisted sexual assault.

	<p pid=".208W.8/2">All elements of the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme have been subject to, or are currently undergoing, evaluation by external evaluators. These evaluations seek to identify both the impact of the different interventions and also draw out lessons around implementation and delivery which feed into ongoing performance improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.8/3">The operation of Criminal Justice Integrated Teams (CJITs), which provide case management for drug misusing offenders in the programme, are being evaluated as part of the overall evaluation. But it is unlikely that the evaluation will compare directly the operation of CJITs with the very important care provided by GPs. This reflects the difference in roles between GPs and CJIT workers, in particular in relation to the wider co-ordination roles of CJIT staff.</p>

	<p pid=".211W.9/1">DFID supports civil society organisations (CSOs) in a number of ways, including through centrally managed funding schemes such as the Civil Society Challenge Fund and Partnership Programme Agreements, and through individual country offices, country programmes and humanitarian assistance. CSOs play an important role in eliminating world poverty and are important partners for DFID in meeting that objective. DFID's support is based on CSOs' performance against specific agreed programmatic or strategic outcomes, rather than by assessing CSOs one against another. A range of monitoring, evaluation and review procedures are used.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.2/1">The ultimate indicators of whether aid is effective are the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These were agreed by 150 countries in 2000; they represent an unprecedented commitment by these countries to work together to improve the well-being of the world's poor. If aid is effective, it will result in progress towards the MDGs. For this reason, the MDGs are explicitly included in DFID's Public Service Agreement, and we monitor progress towards the goals every year in our Departmental Report.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/2">Sometimes DFID may want to compare the effectiveness of individual agencies' aid. The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is the major forum where this happens. Only bilateral donors are members of the DAC, although multilateral donors such as the World Bank have observer status on some committees.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/3">The DAC conducts periodic &quot;peer reviews&quot;, where the development policies and efforts of individual DAC members are critically examined by other members. Each country is reviewed approximately once every four years. These reviews provide a qualitative indication of the aid effectiveness of various donor agencies. More specifically, the DAC has also elaborated a framework of 13 indicators designed to measure objective evidence of progress on harmonisation and alignment. Information against these indicators is currently being collected in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/4">As a contribution to the debate over what constitutes effective aid, DFID has also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of multilateral institutions. The framework was developed in consultation with our multilateral and bilateral partners, including the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".213W.2/5">DFID has no plans to introduce new indicators of aid effectiveness. Instead we will work with others, especially through the DAC, to refine and improve existing internationally accepted indicators.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.5/1">By their nature, there is an expectation that a higher proportion of low-risk projects will meet some or all of their objectives than is the case with medium or high-risk projects. Evidence from DFID's PRISM system bears this out: in the 12 months to end December 2003, 75 per cent. of low-risk projects were evaluated as successful, compared with 57 per cent. of medium-risk projects and 35 per cent. of high-risk projects.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.5/2">However, where risks are managed sensibly, high-risk projects can have very high potential benefits, such as making an exceptional contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). High-risk work contributing to the peace process in Nepal and to reducing communal tensions in Indonesia would be two examples here. High risk, high return is commonly achieved with innovative or experimental projects, and even partial success on some high-risk projects will have a high impact on poverty. Examples of successful high-risk projects include: the Africa Private Infrastructure Financing Facility, Acholi Land Conflict Resolution (Uganda) and Guyana Enterprise Privatisation.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.5/3">Clearly, it does not automatically follow that high risk means high potential return. However, given the nature of the environments in which DFID works, it is important that we do not follow only the safe options. A certain amount of risk-taking is inevitable and essential if DFID is to deliver on our demanding Public Service Agreement targets. In Sierra Leone and Nigeria, for example, a low risk approach would have implied a very low level of engagement.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.0/1">DFID has made significant progress towards a resource allocation system that targets countries where aid will have the biggest impact. Resources are matched to objectives and priorities through an annual resource allocation round. This first considers broad priorities and allocates available resources between DFID divisions. Each division then reports on progress against its Directors' Delivery Plans (DDPs) and makes detailed resource allocation proposals. These are assessed to ensure that they set out a credible strategy for achieving Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets and objectives and that progress is being made. Programme allocations are based on assessment of the DDPs and their annual reviews.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/2">In line with the Strategic Review of Resource Allocation Priorities (SRRAP) recommendations a model has been introduced to review country allocations to low-income countries in terms of poverty and policy and institutional performance. The tool is used only to inform resource allocation; the final allocation being subject to a wider set of considerations. DFID is considering extending the SRRAP approach to middle-income countries.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.0/3">DFID is also developing an objective, evidence based system for assessing and monitoring multilateral effectiveness to inform financial allocations. This focuses on the organisational systems that enable multilateral to achieve results on the ground, including: corporate governance, strategic planning, resource management and operational management. The assessment will inform resource allocation, alongside assessment of the importance of institutions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and of expected performance in achieving development outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.2/1">Government Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3) requires that local planning authorities should plan to meet the housing requirements of the whole community, including those in need of affordable and special needs housing. The provision of affordable housing is then a local authority responsibility and should be made on the basis of robust local assessments of needs. Where need is clearly demonstrated for affordable housing, this should be taken into account in formulating development plan policies and in deciding planning applications involving housing.</p>

This will underline that the planning system must enable the provision of new homes in the right place (focusing on brownfield sites first) and at the right time to meet planned supply targets.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.5/1">The Government office for the south-west (GOSW) is a member of the South West Housing Body (SWHB) and provides secretariat support to the steering group, working group and regional housing forum. Along with partner organisations on the SWHB, GOSW will be heavily involved in drawing up the SW Regional Housing Strategy 2004. This document will have an influence on local policies on housing provision (including affordable housing).</p>
	<p pid=".225W.5/2">GOSW staff also assess all local authority housing strategies against standard fit for purpose criteria. The fit for purpose criteria require local authorities to ensure that provision of affordable housing is made on the basis of robust local assessments of needs. A demonstrable lack of affordable housing to meet local needs is a material planning consideration, which should be taken into account in formulating development plan policies and in deciding planning applications involving housing. Government have issued guidance on how to undertake local housing needs and market assessments.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.5/3">The Housing Corporation, who are also a member of each regional housing board (RHB) and are responsible for investing public money in housing associations, have a much more involved and direct role in the provision of affordable housing and work closely with each individual local authority and their partner housing associations.</p>

The level of precept is at the discretion of the parish, although Government have the power to cap the precept in exceptional circumstances. The precept is 'added' to the total council tax bill for those living within the parish and is collected by the district council on behalf of the parish council.</p>

	<p pid=".232W.2/1">One local authority notified the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that the information used to allocate the authority's award for plan making performance was incorrect. This was because of an administrative error by the authority. Following this notification the authority's entitlement for plan making was re-calculated.</p>
	<p pid=".232W.2/2">In 2002&ndash;03, the most recent year for which figures are available 32 local planning authorities BVPI 109 returns were qualified by the auditor. In these cases the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has withheld 10 per cent. of any Planning Delivery Grant (PDG) allocation made on account of development control performance pending further investigation. Authorities have been asked to explain the reason for the qualification, what they have done to address the identified problem and to provide an assessment of the likely impact of the identified problem on submitted performance statistics. Authorities have been informed that this process could lead to payment, in part or in full, of any withheld grant or to my demanding repayment, in part or in full of any grant paid on account of development control performance. It would not be appropriate to name the authorities involved as the investigation is ongoing. It is anticipated that this process will be completed and final decisions taken on authorities' grant entitlement by the end of the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.10/1">Jobcentre Plus is working with local community organisations and local employers to promote and increase job seeking services in Coventry, South. These local initiatives work alongside and add value to our national programmes like New Deal.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/2">The New Deal has clearly been a great success&mdash;helping well over a million people to find work nationally, including over 1,700 people in Coventry, South. We are building on this foundation of success, opening up more opportunities for people to find work. The New Deal has helped reduce youth unemployment, long-term unemployment and the number of lone parents dependent on benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/3">The development of Jobcentre Plus is building on the high quality service already provided by social security offices and Jobcentres by delivering a single, integrated service to all people of working age, with a clear focus on work.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/4">Jobcentre Plus provides high quality services to employers, helping them to fill job vacancies quickly and effectively with well-prepared and motivated employees.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/5">Local initiatives include progress2work, helping people with drug problems to overcome them and lead healthy and productive lives and making sure that local drug treatment and local employment services are joined up effectively. The Step Up pilot programme, covering a number of wards in Coventry, South, is working to help the long-term unemployed move from benefits into work and the local Outreach service is using innovative and community based ways to help ethnic minority people overcome the barriers they face in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/6">Jobcentre Plus is also working with the new Arena Development to ensure that the 3,500 new job opportunities it is creating are being made available to local communities. For example, the Arena Jobs-bus, a feature of this partnership initiative, has visited locations in the constituency, such as St. Michaels, Canley and Westwood to bring information on the jobs available to peoples doorsteps.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/7">Liaison with local employers has resulted in the establishment of the Construction Employment Unit. Based at Tile Hill Jobcentre Plus, it offers unemployed people the chance to work in the local construction industry and is providing paid training.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.10/8">As a result of these initiatives, the employment level in Coventry, South has risen by 11.4 per cent. since 1997 and the claimant unemployment level has dropped by 37 per cent. over the same period.</p>

	<p pid=".237W.12/1">We are aware of the Human Rights Watch report (issued in December 2003), which was the result of an investigation into reports of human rights abuses from Acehnese refugees in Malaysia. We take these reports seriously. We have raised Aceh with the Indonesian Government on a number of occasions, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-09">9 June</phrase> when the British Ambassador to Indonesia raised it with the Indonesian Minister for Politics and Security.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.12/2">There continues to be reports of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian armed forces in Aceh. The Indonesian military continues to court-martial soldiers arrested on suspicion of human rights abuses. The Indonesian military are now training soldiers in human rights prior to deployment and have established a joint military and civilian police unit to investigate all shootings involving the Indonesian military.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.12/3">The security situation in towns and cities in Aceh is much improved since the Human Rights Watch report was issued. Martial law has been lifted and Aceh has been returned to civilian control. We continue to monitor the human rights situation in Aceh closely.</p>

	<p pid=".243W.2/43">1. The financial data is taken from local education authorities' Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES. Section 52 is collected at local education authority level and as such the figures are provided for all London LEAs. Data is subject to change by the LEA. Cash figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.2/44">2. Expenditure per pupil includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA. Figures also include an estimated apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers&mdash;this is due to the change in the way data was collected. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.2/45">3. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

	<p pid=".244W.2/1">We estimate that up to 9.4 million people may be potentially eligible for the new level 2 entitlement to free tuition that we announced in our Skills Strategy White Paper, &quot;21st Century Skills&quot;. This is the number of people, of working age, who are in the workforce or economically inactive and who lack a foundation of employability skills equivalent to a full level 2 NVQ or five good GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid=".244W.2/2">From September 2004 the level 2 entitlement will be trialled as an integral part of a coherent offer of support for unskilled and low-skilled adults in the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) north east and south east regions. We will use the regional trials to assess demand for and take up of this offer, and this will inform how we manage its introduction nationally. This prioritisation of the needs of unskilled and low skilled adults will contribute to the Department's ambition to reduce the number of adults who lack a level 2 qualification by 40 per cent. by 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".248W.5/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/18">1. The financial data is taken from Wigan LEA's Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/19">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/20">3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/21">4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/22">5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/23">6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/24">7. The variations that appear under the pre-primary sector and special school sector have arisen because the LEA scored items within specific areas differently between 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02. The items fall within specific areas such as premises related, supplies and services, and third party payments; and under special schools the specific areas are employees and premises related expenditure. However, the overall total expenditure for all sectors within the specific areas does not reflect similar substantial differences between the years.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.5/25">8. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

	<p pid=".250W.5/40">1. The financial data are taken from LEAs' section 52 outturn statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. 2002&ndash;03 data are subject to change by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.5/41">2. The cost of home to school transport includes the cost of public transport, contract hire or the use of authority vehicles in transporting pupils to school under section 509 of the Education Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.5/42">3. Wholly selective areas for grammar school ballots purposes are those which the Department has calculated that 25 per cent. or more of the maintained secondary school population attend maintained grammar schools.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.5/43">4 Figures include all expenditure by the local authority on school transport. This includes the pre-primary, primary, secondary and special school sectors. The unit cost is calculated by dividing the sum of the net expenditure in these sectors by the total number of pupils educated in LEA maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.5/44">5. The statistical neighbours categorisations are based upon the classifications developed by Ofsted. The calculation of statistical neighbours is concerned with finding, for each LEA, other LEAs with the most similar values of a given set of variables that describe LEA contexts. The average for a LEA's statistical neighbours is calculated using the sum of the 10 statistically &quot;closest' neighbours net expenditure divided by the total number of pupils educated in these 10 LEAs.</p>
	<p pid=".250W.5/45">6. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

In November 2002 a good practice anti-bullying guide for post-primary schools was distributed. The Department in partnership with key interests in the statutory and voluntary sectors were involved in an advisory capacity in the preparation of that guide. The Department is also committed to producing a similar guide for primary schools in due course in consultation with statutory and voluntary agencies. In November 2003 the Parents Advice Centre (NI), with the Department's support, produced a booklet for parents giving advice on how to identify the signs of bullying and what parents can do to tackle the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/1">Decisions in relation to university research funding are entirely a matter for the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL). There are many differences between the research funding model adopted by Northern Ireland and that implemented by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), due to the different needs and circumstances of Northern Ireland. In general, HEFCE does not provide recurrent research funding to university departments rated lower than four in the Research Assessment Exercise. The Research Capability Fund in England was allocated, therefore, to a limited range of departments rated 3a. In Northern Ireland, to help maintain a broad base of research activity across the two universities, all departments rated 3a already receive recurrent funding from the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/2">The Research Capability Fund, as introduced by DEL has two distinct strands. One strand, in keeping with the policy aim of maintaining a broad research base, funded some university departments rated 3b. A second strand, in keeping with priority 1 of the Regional Innovation Strategy, &quot;think/create/innovate&quot;, is to be used to support, selectively, those areas relevant to the needs of the Northern Ireland economy; there is no comparable strand in England.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.8/1">There is no evidence at present of any cases of West Nile infection in people in Northern Ireland or the rest of the United Kingdom. The inter-departmental Regional Zoonoses Group chaired by the Chief Medical Officer is currently considering the issue in liaison with the UK Zoonoses Group on which Northern Ireland is represented. In late May 2004, the Chief Medical Officer in England published a contingency plan to protect the public's health in England in the event of a case of West Nile Virus illness being diagnosed. This will help inform preparations in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service last year recommended that those who travelled to North America defer making donations of blood for 28 days after returning from that area. The Chief Medical Officer's (DHSSPS) &quot;Update&quot; publication has also drawn West Nile Virus to the attention of GPs to raise awareness when considering a diagnosis. Information on West Nile Virus is also included on the DHSSPS website.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.8/2">Much has been learned from our planning and preparations to deal with infections such as SARS and Influenza, which will enable us to deal with other infections as they emerge.</p>
