Additionally the phased introduction of witness care units (WCU) across England and Wales during 2004-05 has meant that CPS and police staff are able to provide information and support to victims and other witnesses based on the individuals preferred means of contact.</p>

	<p pid="b.325W.3/2">The Government are also taking action to assist children from low income families across the UK through the introduction of Child Trust Funds enabling families to save for their children's future with additional funding for low income households. 64,000 children in Wales will benefit from an additional Welsh premium. The Government have also ensured an increase in the child element of child tax credit benefiting an estimated 380,000 children and in child benefit, benefiting an estimated 640,000 children in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.3/3">The Welsh Assembly Government are further complementing these efforts through the introduction of legislation such as the proposed Children and Families (Wales) Measure underpinning their commitment to the target set for 2020. This recognises families in poverty often face multiple disadvantages requiring specialist and intensive support. The Welsh Assembly Government also has in place a range of policies aimed at tackling child poverty including employment support programmes, childcare initiatives, education and health programmes and Communities First interventions.</p>

	<p pid="b.332W.3/1">The law in this area is clear: it does not permit the copying for personal use of a recording the copier has purchased, without permission of the copyright holder. For example, tracks purchased online are often accompanied by licences permitting consumers to make a limited number of copies for their own use, but many CDs have &quot;all rights reserved&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.332W.3/2">The Government carefully considered this issue in their Copyright Strategy, &quot;(c) the way ahead&quot;, and the second stage consultation on copyright exceptions arising from the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. We concluded that a UK-only approach will be unable to deliver the correct balance between the access that consumers desire and the appropriate remuneration that rights holders need. EU-wide consideration is required, which we would support.</p>

	<p pid="b.335W.2/2"><i> </i>The Higher Education Museum, Galleries and Collections Fund recognises the importance of these nationally valued institutions. I am pleased that the resources we have allocated to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) mean that they are planning not only to continue this funding stream, but also to increase it to &#163;10.6 million in 2010/11.</p>
	<p pid="b.335W.2/3">However, it is important that all special funding streams are reviewed periodically. This ensures that public funds continue to be spent wisely. The Museums Fund is currently under review by a panel appointed by the Funding Council. The review will make broad recommendations about the fund's future. The HEFCE Board will make detailed funding decisions for individual institutions based on these recommendations. I understand that those decisions are expected to be made before the summer, after which the review report will be published.</p>
	<p pid="b.335W.2/4">The Department has received correspondence from Oxford university and the university of Central Lancashire on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.335W.2/5">The total allocation in each year is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.342W.5/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is primarily focused on increasing sports participation, with Sport England as our key delivery partner. However, this is part of a joint target with the Department of Health to get two million more people more physically active, including one million more people playing more sport. DCMS and Sport England work very closely with the Department for Health across this target and sport will, of course, have a great positive effect on people's health.</p>
	<p pid="b.342W.5/2">As the non-departmental public body with responsibility for community sport, Sport England's aim is to increase and sustain levels of participation in sport and develop talent to drive standards of elite performance throughout the country. Their funding is distributed as part of the commitment to get one million more people playing more sport by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.342W.5/3">National governing bodies of sport (NGBs) are at the heart of the strategy as it is their networks of community clubs, coaches and volunteers that make sport happen. Sport England is investing &#163;480 million through 46 governing bodies over the next four years and have agreed grow, sustain and excel targets with each one. Each sport has developed a whole sport plan to achieve these targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.342W.5/4">In addition to the current funding being invested through NGBs, Sport England has invested a total of &#163;776,115 Exchequer funding into Torbay since 2002. This includes a recent investment of &#163;634,615 into the Brixham Amateur Swimming and Life Saving Society in order to modernise the pool. Swim Torquay Limited also received funding of &#163;136,500 in 2008-09 to extend their facilities. Sport England has further invested &#163;317,771 of Lottery funding to various projects throughout Torbay since 2002-03.</p>

	<p pid="b.353W.8/1">Jobseeker's allowance was introduced in October 1996 and replaced unemployment benefit as the benefit for unemployed people.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/2">Jobseeker's allowance claimants must be available for and actively seeking work as a condition of their benefit, and Jobcentre Plus provides a wealth of support to help people back into work, including help with jobsearch techniques, basic skills and work-focussed training.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/3">There are also a series of measures in place to help jobseekers in the transition from benefits into work, whether that work is full or part time.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/4">For example, jobseekers can also claim working tax credits, which provide financial support to people who are working and on a low income. This support aims to boost work incentives by topping up the wages of people on lower pay, according to their family circumstances. This includes providing direct help with the cost of child care for working families.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/5">Jobseekers may also qualify for a Job Grant, a non-taxable, discretionary, work related payment which aims to bridge the gap between a customer's final payment of benefit and first receipt of wages. To qualify for this, a customer must have been in receipt of a qualifying benefit for 26 weeks immediately prior to starting work of at least 16 hours per week. Awards are &#163;100 for single customers or couples without children and &#163;250 for lone parents or couples with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/6">In addition, jobseekers can have their housing benefit extended to cover the first four weeks they are in work, providing they have previously been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or other income related benefits for at least 26 weeks immediately before entering work. A similar scheme, with similar rules, exists to support homeowners back into employment. The Mortgage Interest Run-On provides an additional four weeks' payment of mortgage interest costs after a customer enters work.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/7">We know that the vast majority of people are better off in work. However, we understand that some jobseekers still find the transition into work difficult, and in the December White Paper &quot;Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment&quot;, the Government further announced that we will introduce an enhanced Better off in Work Credit that will ensure that everyone who has been unemployed for 26 weeks or more will receive at least &#163;40 a week more income on moving into work. The new credit will be introduced in one region from October 2010 and we expect the credit will be available nationally from January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.8/8">In addition, lone parents in receipt of jobseeker's allowance may be eligible for the In Work Credit which is paid at &#163;60 a week in London and &#163;40 a week in other parts of the country. Customers who return to work from incapacity benefits may be eligible for the Return to Work Credit which is paid at &#163;40 a week. Both credits are available to these customers when they start work for 16 hours a week, with payments lasting for 52 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.357W.6/1">As part of the Government's commitment to support people into work, &#163;5 billion has been made available across the UK since November 2008 to offer extra support to jobseekers to help them find work at all stages of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/2">The Department has quadrupled the available funding for the rapid response service, which provides advice and support to customers facing redundancy. Also, we launched an enhanced offer to all jobseekers at day one of their claim which includes targeted group sessions in jobsearch techniques, access to local employment partnership vacancies and access to help with the costs of getting back to work through the adviser discretionary fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/3">At the six-month point in a claim, all jobseekers now have access to a substantial package of extra support including recruitment subsidies, work-focused training places, volunteering opportunities and support to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/4">In addition, 18-24 year olds in Leeds West who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months or more have access to the new deal for young people, and customers aged 25 and over who have been unemployed for 18 months continuously or for 18 out of the last 21 months or more have access to the New Deal 25 Plus programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/5">The new flexible new deal and supporting interventions, which build on the success of the New Deal programmes, will be introduced in Leeds West from April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/6">The Government have also targeted significant new resource on young people in recognition of the particular challenges young people face during a recession. These measures are designed to prevent, wherever possible, young people experiencing prolonged spells of unemployment early in their working lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-29">29 July 2009</phrase>, the Government launched a campaign called &quot;Backing Young Britain&quot;, calling on businesses, charities and government bodies to create more opportunities for young people, such as internships, work experience placements, links to mentors and apprenticeships. Almost 18,000 graduate internships have already become available across the UK and thousands more opportunities will follow early in 2010. Over 470 organisations are supporting the campaign, with numbers growing all the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/8">Furthermore, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January 2010</phrase>, the Government launched the &quot;Young Person's Guarantee&quot;, meaning all 18-24 year olds who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months are now guaranteed a job, work placement or work-related skills training.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/9">Leeds is already benefiting from successful future jobs fund bids from Leeds City council and Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Forum Ltd, which will create up to 734 jobs in the Leeds area.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.6/10">In addition, we are introducing access to a named personal adviser to all young people from day one of their claim. This will be available to all from April.</p>

	<p pid="b.360W.3/1">Beyond the information that CLG collects and publishes on local housing authorities' activities under homelessness legislation, the Department has figures on counts of people found sleeping rough. Rough sleeping street count figures, collected from local authorities, are published at a local, regional and national level. In 1998 there were estimated to be 1,850 rough sleepers in England. Since then good progress has been made in reducing the total number of rough sleepers to 464 in street counts in 2009. The 2009 total street count figures are shown in Table 1.</p>

However, Afghanistan ranks second to last on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (before Somalia) and nearly one in every five Afghans experience corruption when trying to access public health care and state electricity supply. Integrity Watch Afghanistan estimate that in some provinces, households on average pay $100 per year in bribes to public officials.

	<p pid="b.374W.2/8">Building Afghan institutions that are durable, capable and accountable to their people is key to success in Afghanistan and a key element of the UK mission in Afghanistan. Tackling corruption at all levels is essential to achieving this. The UK has set up a Multi-Agency Task Force (MATF) of experts across the Government to support the Afghan Government's efforts to tackle corruption. The MATF is focused on prevention efforts such as improving public financial management, building Afghan law enforcement so that impunity can end, the strengthening of accountability bodies and opportunities for citizens to hold their government to account.</p>

	<p pid="b.374W.5/1">We have significant concerns about human rights in Belarus which we set out in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's annual Human Rights Report. The Belarusian authorities continue to harass civil society, non-governmental organisations, religious organisations and the independent media. Belarus is the only European country to continue to use the death penalty. However, there have been some small but welcome improvements in the past two years. In particular, we welcome the decision to allow a number of independent newspapers access to state distribution, and to allow European Radio for Belarus to open a correspondents' office for a year. We also welcome the engagement by the Belarusian authorities in the EU's Eastern Partnership, and the EU-Belarus Human Rights Dialogue launched in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.374W.5/2">Progress on democratic reform has also been slow. Belarus has responded to some of the recommendations made by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Monitoring Mission in 2008. This is a positive step, though we are disappointed that an important change-the right of observers to view the ballot papers as they are counted-was not included in the proposed reforms. The conduct of local elections in April 2010 will be an important test of the willingness of the Belarusian authorities to meet international election standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.375W.5/1">The UK remains concerned about reports of the use of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan. The UK has raised its concerns with the Uzbek Government and through the EU. Our embassy in Tashkent also remains in regular contact with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on the issue. In order to support the establishment of stronger child labour monitoring systems in Uzbekistan our embassy is funding a project that has delivered informal education and vocational training to children most at risk of child labour in thirteen rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.5/2">The EU welcomed Uzbekistan's signing of the International Labour Organisation Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and the Minimum Age of Employment in 2008 and 2009 respectively. A National Action Plan was launched in 2008 to ensure implementation of these conventions. We continue to urge Uzbekistan to implement effectively its international obligations in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.5/3">The EU can temporarily withdraw trade preferences provided to developing countries under its Generalised System of Preferences, if there is sufficient evidence of labour rights violations. However, the EU and UK believe the best way to improve labour standards is for governments to work with workers' and employers' groups to improve their ability to comply with, and enforce, labour laws.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.5/4">The UK Government continue to call on businesses to look at their supply chains and take appropriate action if they find evidence that goods have been produced using child labour.</p>
	<p pid="b.375W.5/5">There is no legal requirement for goods to bear marks indicating their origin. As such it would be difficult for the Government to establish a blanket ban on imports of Uzbek cotton and clothing. Similarly, products manufactured using Uzbek cotton in a third country would legitimately bear the country of manufacture as the country of origin.</p>

	<p pid="b.386W.0/1">The model referred to in paragraphs 5.12, 5.13 and Annex B of the impact assessment is still under development. For this reason, its output has not been incorporated into any of the figures reported in the impact assessment. The model will continue to be updated and refined as more information becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/2">The Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) has constructed a dynamic microsimulation model to produce estimates for the Green and White Papers of the costs and other impacts of reforms to the funding system for care and support for older people. The model consists of data on almost 30,000 older people in waves 3 to 15 of the British Household Panel Survey. The data includes information on each person's age, gender, household composition, disability (activities of daily living), income, savings, receipt of informal care and other characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/3">Table 13 of PSSRU discussion paper 2644 sets out the unit costs of residential care and community care that are used in the modelling. These are derived from data provided by local authorities via the Personal Social Services (PSS) EX1 return. They are assumed to increase by 2 per cent. per year in real terms, in line with expected rises in real earnings.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/4">The NHS Information Centre provides the information for part <i> (c)</i> Table 35e as a response to a Health Select Committee Question. This table contains the unit costs for the hourly rate for home care provided or commissioned by Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs) to adults (aged 18 and over).</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/5">The unit cost of services provided or commissioned by CASSRs to adults is collected via the PSS EX1 return. The PSS EX1 return collects both financial and activity information and has been the responsibility of the NHS Information Centre since April 2005. Prior to this date data was collected by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/6">The unit costs are average costs and are calculated using gross total cost for home care (i.e. including capital charges and before deducting client contributions) divided by the total number of home help/care contact hours for all adults (aged 18 and over) during a sample week, multiplied by 52.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/7">The activity figures for clients receiving home care are taken from a survey in a typical week in September each year. The figures are for services provided or commissioned by a local authority. This will exclude private arrangements by an individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/8">In 2007-08 a change has been made to the definition of capital charges to bring the PSS EX1 data in line with the 2006 local authority Accounting Statement of Recommended Practice. This means that total cost cannot be compared historically.</p>
	<p pid="b.386W.0/9">A new column was added to the PSS EX1 return in 2007-08 to record grants to voluntary organisations against the appropriate service line to allow more meaningful unit costs for provision by others to be calculated. Grants are now excluded from the unit cost expenditure as only activity relating to the CASSR care plan can be recorded and used in the unit cost calculation. This change combined with the change to the definition of capital charges which applies to both own provision and provision by others means that the unit costs for 2007-08 cannot be compared with previous years.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.0/1">The Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) has constructed a dynamic microsimulation model to produce estimates for the Green and White Papers of the costs and other impacts of reforms to the funding system for care and support for older people. The model consists of data on almost 30,000 older people in waves 3 to 15 of the British Household Panel Survey. The data includes information on each person's age, gender, household composition, disability (affecting activities of daily living (ADLs)), income, savings, receipt of informal care and other characteristics. The modelling assumes that disability rates (by age and gender) remain constant over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/2">Each disabled person in the model is assigned:</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/3" class="indent">informal care, which is imputed on the basis of disability and living alone;</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/4" class="indent">Fair Access to Care Services (FACS) guidance category, which is imputed on the basis of disability and other factors; and</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/5" class="indent">a normative care package, assigned on the basis of their needs (disability and household composition).</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/6">Table 10 of PSSRU discussion paper 2644 sets out the numbers of older people in the model that fall into each level of need, as defined in FACS, based on their severity of impairment, before any consideration of their informal care situation. Table 12 sets out similar information after consideration of informal care.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/7">The starting point for the estimates of service users who are defined as critical under FACS reporting difficulty with four or more ADLs shown in table 2 of the Impact Assessment is an estimate of the number of FACS critical users at home taken from PSSRU's microsimulation model for older people. This initial estimate differs from the FACS critical volume figure in table 10 of the PSSRU discussion paper 2644 in two important regards. First, the figures in the discussion paper relate to those in both residential and domiciliary settings, whereas what is important for the purpose of the Impact Assessment is the number of those living at home. In practice, almost all those in a residential care setting are likely to have critical needs. And secondly, the figures in the discussion paper are estimated before informal care considerations. Since receipt or not of informal care is part of the assessment of Fair Access to Care, it is an important consideration in determining the number of people deemed to be FACS critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.0/8">The next step is to estimate the number of FACS critical individuals reporting difficulty with four or more ADLs. This is done using the information in table 1 of the Impact Assessment, and is explained in detail in the responses I gave to him on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-12-14.762"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 762-3W</phrase>.</p>

As a result of the consultation, we increased the statutory legacy from &#163;125,000 to &#163;250,000 where the deceased leaves a surviving spouse or civil partner and children and from &#163;200,000 to &#163;450,000 where the deceased leaves a surviving spouse or civil partner and parents or siblings, but no children.

	<p pid="b.430W.0/18">The Department for Transport consulted in 2009 on a new road safety strategy for the next two decades, A Safer Way: Consultation on making Britain's Roads the Safest in the World. This consultation identified protecting motorcyclists as one of a number of key road safety challenges and proposed specific measures, as well as initiatives to tackle safety on rural roads, where motorcyclists are at particular risk. The new road safety strategy will be published following the completion of the North Review into drug and drink driving law.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.0/19">The Government's Motorcycling Strategy sets out a range of measures to improve the safety of all powered two-wheel users. It was published in February 2005 and a revised action plan was issued in June 2008. This includes THINK! publicity for powered two wheeler and other road users, improvements to rider training, a safer road environment and safer vehicles and equipment. We are currently working with stakeholders on revising the Motorcycle Strategy.</p>

In the last financial year (2008-09) &#163;6,627,000 was spent on the Directory-which includes &#163;5.65 millon in grants to local authorities to enable them to develop their own local databases of family service information.
