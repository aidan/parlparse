	<p pid="b.1140W.5/7" class="indent">In order to produce estimates for small geographical areas, APS and annual LFS estimates are provided based on survey microdata. These are consistent with the UK</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.5/8" class="indent">population estimates published in February and March 2003, whereas the regional and national estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release are based on more up-to-date population figures, so the two are not directly comparable.</p>

Gender equality issues have been central to developing the Pensions Act 2007, and to the current Pension Reform Bill going through Parliament. DWP has produced and published two extensive gender impact assessments alongside this legislation which demonstrate how these pension reforms will contribute to achieving equality of outcome in state pension provision, and equality of opportunity in building up private pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155W.5/1">The Government are committed to tackling all aspects of disability poverty and has made considerable progress. In terms of financial poverty the number of disabled individuals in households with an income below 60 per cent. of median on an after housing cost basis fell by 500,000 in Great Britain between 1998-99 and 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.1156W.5/1">UK citizens who move to live in Spain may be able to claim UK and Spanish benefits.

	<p pid="b.1156W.5/2">People who move from the UK to live in Spain may continue to be covered by the UK for social security purposes, because for example they receive a UK contributory benefit. These rules cover old age, survivors, invalidity, unemployment, sickness, maternity, and family benefits. The UK is responsible for the healthcare costs of certain UK citizens, mostly pensioners, who are resident in Spain and who receive Spanish healthcare on the same basis as Spanish citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1156W.5/3">There are a number of factors that determine which Spanish benefits a UK national resident in Spain can receive; including whether the benefit is covered by the coordination rules, and the entitlement conditions for the benefits. The UK does not hold detailed information on the benefits systems of other states. However, if UK citizens had worked in Spain they could be entitled to Spanish contributory benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1157W.10/2"><i> </i>The emergency bluetongue vaccination plan, developed in close collaboration with a core group of industry stakeholders, outlines how mass vaccination can be best achieved through a voluntary approach. The plan will be supported by a sustained, intensive and widespread campaign promoting the benefits of vaccination, led by the farming industry in partnership with the Government and veterinary organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.10/3">The campaign will include reports in farming, veterinary and national media, regional meetings and the distribution of information at livestock auction markets. Known infected premises will be targeted directly through promotional activity because experience from mainland Europe and advice from epidemiologists suggests that infected premises will be the most likely source of infection when the disease re-emerges later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162W.2/1">The Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) has analysed the performances of a range of television types, including units with plasma screens. The annual energy consumption of televisions varies significantly with screen size and television type, with larger screen TVs using more energy, regardless of whether they are plasma, liquid crystal display (LCD) or cathode-ray tube (CRT).</p>
	<p pid="b.1162W.2/2">There is no significant difference on average in the energy efficiency of the different TV technologies currently available. A 32 inch CRT, LCD or plasma screen will all consume much the same energy, around 300 kWh. However a 42 inch plasma TV (a typical size for this technology) will consume 500 kWh per year under typical usage patterns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1162W.2/3">In the 2007 Energy White Paper, the Government announced that we will continue to work with the UK supply chain and seek commitments from manufacturers, retailers and service providers to deliver more efficient goods and services. To support this work, the Government consulted last year on our analysis of how the performance of consumer electronics products will need to improve over the next 10 to 20 years, including proposals for product standards and targets to phase out the least efficient products.</p>
	<p pid="b.1162W.2/4">Following completion of the preparatory studies on consumer electronics: TV, the European Commission will bring forward proposals for mandatory minimum standards under the Eco-design for Energy-using Products Framework Directive (EuP) expected in 2010. The preparatory studies analyse the environmental impacts of TVs in light of the market, consumption, technologies and consumer behaviour for the European Union.</p>

The CEMs undergo daily internal calibration checks and a mandatory independent quality assurance check in accordance with the relevant British Standard. Operators provide the Environment Agency with records of each measured daily average for particulates.

	<p pid="b.1167W.6/1">We have recently consulted on the transposition of the EU Batteries Directive. When transposed, the directive will reduce the quantity of hazardous and non hazardous waste batteries going to landfill and increase the recovery of the materials they contain. Collection targets set by the directive for portable batteries are 25 per cent. by 2012, rising to 45 per cent. by 2016. The prohibition on incinerating or landfilling industrial and automotive batteries implies a 100 per cent. collection and recycling target for these batteries. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1167W.6/2">We are in the process of analysing the responses to the consultation. We will publish a summary prior to the second consultation later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1167W.6/3">Research and trials to provide evidence for the consultation and to investigate the best ways of implementing the Batteries Directive have been carried out on portable batteries. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has been working in partnership with a range of local authorities and not-for-profit organisations that already run recycling collection services to pilot portable waste battery collection trials in the UK. Trials include establishing 'drop off' points at supermarkets, as well as other methods of collection such as at the kerbside.</p>
	<p pid="b.1167W.6/4">Supported by funding from DEFRA and the devolved administrations, the trials form part of a wider effort to develop cost-effective ways for the UK to meet the targets of the Batteries Directive. The results of the various trials will be published later this month, and these will be used to help Government and batteries producers identify the best methods of collecting batteries to meet the directive's targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1167W.6/5">It is important to stress the fact that under the Batteries Directive, which is a Producer Responsibility Directive, responsibility for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries will lie with the producers of batteries. In order to fulfil their obligations, they may need to engage with local authorities to improve their collection network. Therefore, when the directive is enforced, local authorities wishing to increase the level of the batteries recycled will need to make contractual agreements with the compliance scheme or schemes representing producers of batteries in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175W.5/1">The following table shows what proportion of those convicted of offences under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 of <i> (a)</i> all ages and <i> (b)</i> aged 18 and over, were sentenced to immediate custody in each year from 1997 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/2">The Courts Proceedings Database records five offences under section 5 of the Act. For two of the offences there is a mandatory minimum penalty:</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/3" class="indent">'possessing or distributing prohibited weapons or ammunition' under section 5(1) (a), (b), (aba), (ac), (ad), (ae), (af) or (c) of the Firearms Act 1968, as amended by section 288 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/4" class="indent">'possessing or distributing firearm disguised as other object' under section 5(1A)(a) of the Firearms Act 1968, also as amended by section 288 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/5">The mandatory minimum is five years for those aged 18 and over, and three years for those aged 16-17. The mandatory minimum came into affect in January 2004, and does not apply to those persons who committed offences before this date. The maximum penalty for these offences is 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/6">The following figures are taken from the Ministry of Justice (formerly Home Office) Court Proceedings Database and relate to sentences imposed (including life and indeterminate sentences) and the average sentence length of immediate custody (excluding life and indeterminate sentences) for those sentenced for such offences where the principal offence is the one for which they were found guilty. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe. Where a person is convicted on the same occasion of a firearms offences, and one such as homicide, conspiracy, robbery or GBH with intent (218 of OPA 1861) where the maximum is higher, the data in respect of the firearms offence will not have been included in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/7">The Lord Chief Justice and I have concerns about the quality of the data relating to mandatory minima. An earlier project was undertaken that looked at cases reported to the Court Proceedings Database during the first six months of 2006 where the mandatory sentence was not given to persons aged 18 and over. These cases were checked with the Crown courts concerned. Of 65 cases, 12 were found to have the offence incorrectly classified (although two were still subject to the five-year sentence). A further case had the custody duration recorded as five months instead of five years. Some 17 per cent. of Crown court cases checked, therefore, had the wrong offence classification. The majority correctly reflect the offence and court outcome although in few cases were the courts able to say whether exceptional circumstances, as allowed for in the Criminal Justice Act, had been the reason for the five-year sentence not being imposed. Among reasons quoted were 'gun incapable of being fired', 'defendant clinically depressed', 'technical breach only' and 'defendant too young for imprisonment'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/8">The Ministry of Justice is now looking to see if the situation has improved by looking at data from the first six months of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1178W.2/1">The table shows the number of persons sentenced to immediate custody of possession of an illegal firearm eligible for the mandatory minimum, and the proportion that received the mandatory minimum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/2">The mandatory minimum only applies to two offences;</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/3" class="indent">'possessing or distributing prohibited weapons or ammunition' under s. 5(1) (a), (b), (aba), (ac), (ad), (ae), (af) or (c) of the Firearms Act 1968, as amended by s. 288 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/4" class="indent">'possessing or distributing firearm disguised as other object' under s. 5(1A)(a) of the Firearms Act 1968, also as amended by s. 288 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/5">The mandatory minimum is five years for those aged 18 and over, and three years for those aged 16-17. The mandatory minimum came into affect in January 2004, and does not apply to those persons who committed offences before this date. The maximum penalty for these offences is 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/6">The figures in the table are taken, from the Ministry of Justice (formerly Home Office) Court Proceedings Database and relate to sentences imposed (including life and indeterminate sentences) and the average sentence length of immediate custody (excluding life and indeterminate sentences) for those sentenced for such offences where the principal offence is the one for which they were found guilty. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe. Where a person is convicted on the same occasion of one of these two firearms offences, and one such as homicide, conspiracy, robbery or GBH with intent (218 of OPA 1861) where the maximum is higher, the data in respect of the firearms offence will not have been included in the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/7">Courts are required to impose the minimum sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender which justify not doing so. The purpose of the minimum sentence is to tackle gun crime and gun culture. It is not aimed at purely technical offences. Exceptional circumstances might therefore include where the holder of a firearms certificate inadvertently forgets to renew his authority or where a war trophy is discovered among a deceased person's effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/8">The Lord Chief Justice and I have concerns about the quality of this data and that relating to knife crime. An earlier project was undertaken that looked at cases reported to the Court Proceedings Database during the first 6 months of 2006 where the mandatory sentence was not given to persons aged 18 and over. These cases were checked with the Crown courts concerned. Of 65 cases, 12 were found to have the offence incorrectly classified (although two were still subject to the 5-year sentence). A further case had the custody duration recorded as five months instead of five years. Some 17 per cent. of Crown court cases checked therefore had the wrong offence classification. The majority correctly reflect the offence and court outcome although in few cases were the courts able to say whether exceptional circumstances, as allowed for in the Criminal Justice Act, had been the reason for the five year sentence not being imposed. Among reasons quoted were 'gun incapable of being fired', 'defendant clinically depressed', 'technical breach only' and 'defendant too young for imprisonment'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178W.2/9">The Ministry of Justice is now looking to see if the situation has improved by looking at data from the first six months of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1181W.0/1">There is no expectation that any law centre will close because of Legal Services Commission (LSC) changes to the fee schemes. Out of the 60 law centres to which the LSC provides funding, four have indicated that they may cease to operate. These four providers have been affected by the withdrawal of non-LSC funding. Funding to law centres from the LSC has increased significantly over the last seven years from &pound;6.7 million in 2000-01 to &pound;11.6 million in 2006-07. It is not the only source of funding to Law Centres and the continuity of their operations depends on securing a range of flinders as well as on the general management of their business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190W.0/1">National guidance to probation areas states that offenders sentenced to a community order with a requirement to attend an accredited sex offender programme should commence the group work programme by the sixth week of the order. In some cases this timetable can be altered at the discretion of the offender manager. There is no timetable for offenders on licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/2">Offenders waiting for a place on the group work component of the community sex offender treatment programme or the internet offender programme are under the supervision of their offender manager from the day of sentence. Before they commence either programme a full assessment is required in order to confirm their suitability for the programme; confirm the treatment plan; and identify the modules in which they should participate. During this initial period the offender manager will monitor the risk posed by the offender and manage it. Additionally the offender manager will normally prepare offenders for the programmes by carrying out set work.</p>

These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems, which, as with any large scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. The waiting times may include time that has elapsed while the offender is prepared for the programme or because an offender has been recalled to custody.</p>

The Prison Service uses control and restraint (C and R) techniques to restrain prisoners, including young adults, as a last resort in order to bring a violent or refractory prisoner under control and only when all other de-escalation techniques have failed. An independent review into the techniques used to restrain young people, below the age of 18, in custodial settings is currently under way and will report to Ministers in June this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192W.8/1">The Government are considering an amendment to the Merchant Shipping (Inland Waterways and Coastal Operations) (Boatmasters' Qualifications and Hours of Work) Regulations 2006 which would introduce a new category of licence. This would allow masters to operate in a geographically limited area on tidal waters, without the comprehensive and rigorous qualification required by the existing Tier 1, Level 2 licence, subject to the agreement of the relevant navigation and port authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.8/2">The safety of those who use the UK's waterways has always been the focus of the BML, and it is this concern for safety that led to the current situation of onerous qualification requirements. Any amendment to the BML regulations will follow extensive consultation to ensure that public safety will not be compromised.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212W.3/1">I refer the hon. Members to the update I provided to the House on the security situation in Basra in my Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 628-43. We continue to keep the security situation in Basra under close review following the transfer of Basra to Provincial Iraqi Control in December 2007 and in the light of recent developments. We and our coalition partners continue to provide support to the Iraqis in our overwatch role in accordance with our rules of engagement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.3/2">There has been encouraging political progress in Basra since December. For example, the supporting the Law Council, which represents all of Basra's political leaders, signed an agreement in December 2007 committing them to support the rule of law and recognise the ISF as the sole guardians of security in Basra. This demonstrated a willingness on the part of all of Basra's political parties to work together in a spirit of compromise and reconciliation. This commitment has been tested during recent events, but it is striking that Muqtada al-Sadr, in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-30">30 March 2008</phrase>, reaffirmed the importance of cooperation with the Government and the need to respect the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.3/3">The UK is also working with coalition partners and the Government of Iraq to promote private sector-led economic growth in Basra. Since December we have helped to launch a Basra Development Commission, which is bringing together Iraqi, regional and international business leaders to provide advice and guidance to the Provincial Council and promoting Basra as an investment location through a recent major investment conference in Kuwait. We are leading on an initiative to help set up the Basra Development Fund, to provide finance to small and medium sized enterprises, and to make progress on key projects such as the redevelopment of Basra International Airport and Umm Qasr port.</p>

This approach was agreed jointly between the MOD and the helicopter Design Organisation (Westland Helicopters, now AgustaWestland).</p>

In all cases, the Department is required to seek independent airworthiness advice before the modification is released to service. Additionally, MOD personnel are required to seek advice from the helicopter Design Organisation, as was the case for all Marks of HISL modification. For all Marks except Mark 5 and Mark 6 aircraft, the HISL modification has retrospectively been formally accepted onto the aircraft drawings by the helicopter manufacturer through a process called Cover Modification.</p>

	<p pid="b.1216W.5/1">In late 2004, my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Mr. Straw) requested a review by officials of the options for the regulation of the overseas operations of private military and security companies (PMSCs) registered in or operating from the UK. This applies to PMSCs operating both in Afghanistan and elsewhere overseas. This was to follow up on the Green Paper of 2002, 'Private Military Companies: Options for Regulation' and to respond to the increase in activities of PMSCs in areas of conflict overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.5/2">The review was completed in mid-2005 and suggested a number of options for ways in which the industry could be regulated. The review also highlighted complex issues, particularly around the definition of what activities should be regulated and how any regulations would be enforced. These issues, along with the options for regulation, continue to be the subject of Ministerial correspondence and official consultation. The Government have undertaken to keep Parliament fully informed of its proposals in this area. If it is agreed that regulation is appropriate, the Government will put the proposals to public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1223W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.2/2">The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is shortly due to finalise its budget for 2008 and the list of Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PROP) projects and recurrent costs for donor support. Progress in implementing the PROP will be reported at the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="">2 May</phrase>. The World Bank and European Commission have established funding mechanisms to co-ordinate donor financial support for the PROP.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.2/3">The takeover of Gaza by Hamas in June 2007 led to severe Israeli restrictions on imports into Gaza and a near complete-ban on exports. This has had a profound impact on the Gazan economy. The Palestinian Trade Centre (PalTrade) states that 95 per cent. of industrial working establishments in Gaza closed between July 2007 and February 2008, with the construction, export agriculture, furniture and garment sectors hardest hit. PalTrade estimates that in the construction sector alone, 42,000 workers have been laid off since January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.2/4">The impact of the Hamas takeover and closure of Gaza by Israel on the whole Palestinian economy is more difficult to assess. The Occupied Palestinian Territories' economy was stagnant in 2007 despite large donor inflows. It is likely that without the closure of Gaza, GDP would have grown slightly. According to the World Bank, real GDP per head in the OPTs is now 40 per cent. lower than in 1999.</p>

	<p pid="b.1223W.5/2">UK aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA) is subject to the high levels of scrutiny to ensure it reaches those most in need. Funding is provided through the European Commission's PEGASE mechanism (the replacement for the Temporary International Mechanism) and the new World Bank fund. These mechanisms conduct rigorous checks against each payment, independent auditing, tracking and monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229W.5/1">The 30 new public service agreements (PSA) set out the key priority outcomes the Government want to achieve in the 2008-11 spending period. The Department for International Development (DFID) is a formal delivery partner for the PSAs on climate change (PSA 27) and conflict prevention (PSA 30). In addition, through our work on poverty reduction, the Department will contribute to delivery of the PSAs on migration (PSA 3) and counter-terrorism (PSA 26).</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/2" class="italic"> PSA 27</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/3">In consultation with others, we are helping to design a suite of multi-donor climate investment funds to reduce poverty through action on climate change. These will be launched in 2008 and will be capitalised by funds from the &pound;800 million in the international window of the UK's Environmental Transformation Fund. In addition, we are supporting the Global Environment Facility (GEF), multilateral development banks' Clean Energy Investment Framework and UN Special Adaptation Funds, and working to address the information and knowledge gaps relating to climate change impacts in Africa. We will also be looking to address climate change through our bilateral programmes, such as in China and Bangladesh.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/4" class="italic"> PSA 30</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/5">Many of the countries and regions which are the focus of the new conflict prevention PSA are priorities for DFID. Reducing poverty in these fragile and conflict-affected states is essential to tackle the conditions in which conflict emerges and to achieve the MDGs. DFID is increasing levels of funding to fragile and conflict affected countries. In addition to these efforts, DFID is working with FCO and MOD to help prevent, manage and resolve conflict through the Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP) and the Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF). The total value of these funds is set to rise from &pound;139m (2007-08) to &pound;229 million (2010-11). The PSA also focuses on building more effective international institutions. DFID has been working with FCO and MOD to strengthen the UN's capacity to prevent conflict and build peace, and has committed funds of more than &pound;50 million over three years to the Peacebuilding Fund, the Peacebuilding Support Office and UNDP's Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/6" class="italic"> PSA 3</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/7">DFID is contributing &pound;35 million to a new cross-government Returns and Reintegration Fund led by the FCO. The Fund will be headed by a DFID staff member and DFID country teams will be contributing their expertise to make sure fund projects are as effective as they can be.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/8" class="italic"> PSA 26</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/9">Within the parameters of the International Development Act, our programme will make a positive contribution to the Government's counter-radicalisation effort. In November, the Prime Minister publicly committed DFID, FCO and the British Council to spending</p>

	<p pid="b.1231W.2/1">There are no plans to set a target to increase the use of video-conferencing with the specific aim of reducing travel. The Department for International Development (DFID) does however have a target to reduce air miles flown by 5 per cent. per annum and video-conferencing is one tool helping to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.2/2">Meetings are arranged around the needs of the business but before any travel is authorised in DFID staff must confirm that they have considered using video-conference.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.2/3">DFID currently use a total of 119 video-conference units, in the UK and overseas. In the last year DFID held 7,169 managed video conferences. A recent study showed that video-conferencing in DFID avoids more than two million miles of air travel a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is deeply concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Currently there is no danger of starvation but an estimated 1.1 million Gazans&mdash;80 per cent. of Gaza's population&mdash;is at least partly dependent on food aid. Food aid provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the World Food Programme (WFP) covers 60 per cent. to 80 per cent. of calorific need of those that receive it, with people left to buy the remainder.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.5/2">Palestinians currently have access to basic medical treatment and medicines continue to enter Gaza. However, the health care system is under strain as infrastructure and equipment deteriorates. The World Health Organization reports that 85 essential items are nearly or completely depleted, largely because of procurement problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.5/3">The water and sanitation sector throughout Gaza is facing severe difficulties. Gaza has traditionally had problems with the purity of its drinking water but the current situation is exacerbated by power cuts affecting pumping stations; 90 per cent. of mains water is polluted and up to 60 million litres of raw or poorly treated sewage are being discharged into the Mediterranean sea each day. Figures are unavailable for the number of people affected by the polluted water.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.5/4">This situation has not been caused by a lack of response or support from the international community, rather the continued restrictions on access to Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.5/5">To help ease the situation the UK provided &pound;15.45 million in March 2008 through the European Commission's PEGASE mechanism, supporting essential services and providing allowances to 77,000 key workers. To support the work of UNRWA DFID provided &pound;15.6 million in 2007-08.</p>

PAs have been recruited and trained by Connexions Partnerships and there are now approximately 1,000 operating in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244W.2/3">The introduction of the Youth Opportunities Fund and Youth Capital Fund (YOF/YCF) during the last year has given young people the opportunity to participate in a range of positive activities. It has actively encouraged participation and engagement of disadvantaged young people and those who are hard to reach. The funds are worth &pound;6.5 million in the West Midlands, with young people as the applicants, decision makers and beneficiaries. YOF/YCF will continue for the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244W.2/4">The West Midlands Healthy Care Programme and Healthy Care Grant is supporting vulnerable young people in the West Midlands. This is mainly through targeted support through individual local authorities and support through key networks, including Education Protects, West Midlands Leaving Care Managers Network and Healthy Care Network.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244W.2/5">Extended schools are a key mechanism through which Government provide support to children and young people and their families. The Government's aim is that at least half of all primary schools and a third of all secondary schools should be providing access to the full core offer by the end of September 2008. In the West Midlands Coventry has already exceeded this figure, and is delivering the offer in over 70 per cent of schools in the area (compared to a national average of 45 per cent.).</p>

The regional guidelines are apportioned to mineral planning authorities in the region by the Regional Planning Body, taking into account advice from the mineral planning authorities and the South East of England Regional Aggregates Working Party.

The Government do not hold information on allotment provision in local authorities, although we do collate information on the disposal of allotments. To improve information available on green spaces, including allotments, we have commissioned the development of a green space database. This will be an interactive mapping tool which will bring together several datasets and provide the opportunity for local authorities, and other users, to access and input information on quality and provision of green space, including allotments. The newly revised good practice guide, Growing in the community, published by the Local Government Association in March 2008, includes information on how local authorities can better maintain allotment sites and provide extra resources to do so. Local authorities have the freedom to manage their own resources. It is up to them to determine their spending priorities within the resources available to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248W.5/1">Zero carbon homes mean that over a year, the net carbon emissions from all energy use in the home are zero. This would include energy use from cooking, washing and electronic appliances as well as space heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and hot water. This was set out in the policy statement 'Building A Greener Future' published in July 2007 which confirmed the Government's commitment to zero carbon homes from 2016.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.6/1">Communities and Local Government contributes to local projects to support the social interaction of elderly people living alone in a variety of ways, including through housing and related support services. For example, the Supporting People Programme, created in 2003, which is a grant programme administered through top tier local authorities, helps over 840,000 older people through housing support services to live independently in their home and community. Together, local authorities spent over &pound;300 million on housing support services for older people in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.6/2">We recently published &quot;Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods&mdash;A National Strategy? for Housing in an Ageing Society&quot; which promotes improved social inclusion and participation of older people through better housing in age friendly communities. This includes the promotion of Lifetime Homes and Neighbourhoods, better home repairs and adaptations services. Additional funding of &pound;33 million between 2008-10 will go to support local agencies, such as Home Improvement Agencies, to help older people with minor repairs and adaptations. Good practice examples included in this strategy show how these and other agencies can provide a vital link to help people to access other support services to increase participation in the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267W.3/1">Ordnance Survey has operated a Mapping for Emergencies Service since 1988 following the Lockerbie Bomb disaster. The service provides a 24 x 7 help-line through which designated authorities dealing with responses to a wide range of civil contingencies can request mapping and geographical information to support early response. The information is delivered free of charge to the requester either directly, or through members of Ordnance Survey's High Street network of specialist Mapping and Data Centres and Licensed Partner community. The information may be in digital or hard copy form. Some pre-processing, analysis or combination with other data may be undertaken to provide the Emergency Responders with information best suited to the needs of the situation they face.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267W.3/2">Recent examples of service provision include mapping to support management of exclusion zones for animal disease control, police operations in connection with the Ipswich murder cases, civil contingency operations connected with the beaching of the container vessel MSC Napoli, and in response to the summer flooding in the south-west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267W.3/3">From 1999, the costs of the service were funded through the National Interest Mapping Services Agreement (NIMSA). Since NIMSA ended in December 2006, Ordnance Survey has received no direct funding for the service, which has been supported from its general trading revenue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.0/1">In April 2007, Ministers asked Ordnance Survey and the Shareholder Executive to work together to prepare a more precise articulation of Ordnance Survey's Public Task as set out in the Ordnance Survey Framework Document 2004. This work was undertaken between April and June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.0/2">Ministers approved the revised Public Task document in July 2007 before the Cambridge University study was commissioned. The Shareholder Executive conducted discussions with senior officials in Ordnance Survey and the Department for Communities and Local Government before submitting the Public Task document to Ministers. Neither the Office of Public Sector Information nor the Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information were consulted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.3/1">The Planning Inspectorate receives about 2,000 appeals a month and aims to register these within three working days. As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-28">28 March 2008</phrase>, some 1,530 new planning appeals had not been registered, the oldest of which were received on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-29">29 February</phrase>. The inspectorate is working hard to retrieve the situation and has introduced measures to allow it to direct more resources into eliminating the backlog. These have seen the number of appeals waiting to be registered fall from over 2000 in December 2007 to the present figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.3/2">Target handling times set by Ministers vary according to the nature and complexity of the planning appeal and the method used to process it. For example, in February, the average time taken following registration to decide appeals proceeding by the written representations method was 18 weeks. For appeals proceeding by hearing or inquiry method, it was 39 weeks. Further details of performance in relation to planning appeals can be found on the inspectorate website:</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.0/1">The Secretary of State has called in four planning applications under the Town and Country Planning (Flooding) (England) Direction 2007, (&quot;the Direction&quot;). This requires local planning authorities to send details of all applications for major development they are minded to approve where the Environment Agency has an objection, to the Secretary of State to consider whether or not they should be called-in for decision. Since 2007, the Secretary of State has called-in a further four planning applications, not under the Direction, where flooding was a main issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.0/2">The 13 cases referred to in the Environment Agency's HLT5 Report 2006-07, were granted planning permission by the respective local planning authorities before the Direction came into force. The Environment Agency's objections to those applications are tabled as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.0/3">The Direction requires that where a local planning authority wants to grant planning permission for a major development to which the Environment Agency objects, the authority and the Agency must discuss and agree a course of action which would allow the Agency's objection to be withdrawn. Such discussions are proving fruitful in resolving flood risk issues, and have allowed most of the planning applications referred to the Secretary of State, to be returned to the local planning authorities for decision.</p>

A FRA was subsequently submitted; however the Environment Agency maintained its earlier objection on the grounds that the FRA had not considered the flood risk posed by a breach in the banks of the nearby River Trent. However, the Environment Agency did not object to the allocation of the site in the (now adopted) Local Plan, and the site benefits from an extant planning permission. The LPA considered it unreasonable to refuse the application, given the earlier approval and the Local Plan status.</td> </tr>

The Environment Agency therefore considered the site inappropriate for single storey development. Site already has an extant planning permission for a similar proposal before the LPA's own flood risk assessment had been prepared. Despite the flood risk, the LPA considered it unreasonable to refuse the new application, given the earlier approval.</td> </tr>

The assessment identifies the site as being within the 'critical velocity zone'&mdash;the highest subdivision of risk as set out in the assessment. Given the predicted speed/depths of floodwater and the risk to life and property, the Environment Agency advised the LPA that residential development was generally not suitable in this area and objected. However, the site had an extant planning permission dating back to 1994, prior to the consideration of flood risk, and the LPA granted planning permission on the basis that this application represented a betterment in flood risk terms compared with that 1994 permission.</td> </tr>

The assessment identifies the site as being within the 'Rapid Inundation Zone'&mdash;where flood waters are greater than 0.5 m and/or have a velocity of greater than 1 m/second. Given the predicted speed/depths of floodwater and the risk to life and property, the Environment Agency advised the LPA that it could not support an application for a new caravan site in such flood depth zones, and objected.

The LPA approved the application without re-consulting the Environment Agency, as a proposal on the same site had been upheld at appeal in 1998, when an Inspector found that 'no demonstrable harm' would result from that development, although in that case the site was to have been raised (hence appropriately defended). This appeal decision predates Government policy on development and flood risk, and the need for FRAs. A permanent permission application has subsequently been submitted and approved. A FRA was submitted with this application allowing the Environment Agency to remove its objection.</td> </tr>

From the information submitted it was not clear whether the bridge proposal would impede flood flows by encroaching into FZ3. Although the Environment Agency responded late to this consultation, our response was in time to influence the decision. Delegated decision, so our concerns were not reported to committee.</td> </tr>

The Environment Agency therefore objected on the grounds that no FRA had been prepared to accompany the application, in accordance with PPG25. Our objection was not reported upon in processing the planning application. As a result, the fact that the FRA had never been received was not picked up, and the Environment Agency's objection was never recorded.</td> </tr>

The LPA approved the proposal without requesting a FRA from the developer, or re-consulting the Environment Agency.

The applicant was required therefore to provide a Flood Risk Assessment to accompany the application, as per Government guidance. Initially the Environment Agency requested further information about whether a FRA had been carried out, and requested an extension to the consultation period. There is no record of any extension being agreed, and the Environment Agency finally submitted a late response (June 2006) objecting to the proposal on the ground that no FRA had been submitted. The LPA did not approve the proposal until February 2007. Environment Agency concerns were not reported to committee.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1270W.0/20"> <td>West Berkshire District Council</td> <td>Hungerford. Erection of 36 residential units with associated car parking.</td> <td>1</td> <td>An Outline Planning Permission was granted in 2005 for 16 dwellings, which the Environment Agency provided comments on in 2002. As the site lies within Flood Zone 1 the Environment Agency requested a surface water condition, which was applied to the extant permission. A subsequent planning application was submitted for 36 residential units in 2006. Although the applicant provided a Flood Risk Assessment in accordance with Government guidance, the Environment Agency objected as it was not satisfied with the surface water drainage strategy submitted as part of the FRA. The development could present a flood risk to others by generating surface water run-off. The Environment Agency's objection was reported to the Planning Committee in August 2006. The objection was not resolved before planning permission was granted. The Council applied a condition requiring full details of the surface water drainage system to be submitted before development commenced on the site. Despite ongoing negotiations the proposed surface water drainage system still does not meet Environment Agency requirements.</td> </tr>

There will be a hearing into the 'soundness' of the plan, where any person who has requested to be heard may appear before the Inspector.

	<p pid="b.1283W.2/1">Our policy is not to adopt a universal screening programme for alcohol misuse, as the evidence base indicates this would not be cost-effective. Instead, we are encouraging health care professionals and others to implement opportunistic alcohol case identification and to deliver brief advice about alcohol. This can take place at any opportunity when an individual is consulting with a health care professional or indeed any agency about a health issue, which may have a link to excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/2">International research has shown that this approach works well in primary care. We believe these results would be replicated in some targeted clinics within secondary care, such as genito-urinary medicine, fracture clinics or facial injury clinics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/3">While there is good evidence confirming the value of this approach, there are some gaps in the research. This is why the Department has commissioned a programme of research into opportunistic alcohol case identification and delivering brief advice that is now under way in a selection of general practitioner (GP) practices, accident and emergency departments and probation departments. The purpose of this research is to refine which identification tool works best in which setting, with which target groups, and what methods of providing advice are most effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/4">We have put in place from April 2008, a new national health service indicator to measure the change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol-related harm&mdash;the first ever national commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol health harms. This indicator is expected to encourage primary care trusts to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much linked to advice and support from GPs or other health care staff. This has been shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems.</p>

These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/>  Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.

			<tr pid="b.1291W.2/55"> <td colspan="5"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. <i> Coverage and data quality:</i><br/> The maternity tail data coverage is not as complete as the rest of HES data. There are a number of reasons for the coverage and data quality issues such as:<br/> trusts submitting a significantly higher number of delivery episodes compared to birth episodes;<br/> trusts failing to submit data on the number of birth episodes where they record a high number of delivery episodes;<br/> trusts failing to submit delivery - the reason for this is that approximately 20 trusts have a stand alone maternity system which is not linked to the Patient Administration System;<br/> trusts identifying a high number of maternity beds available, but not recording any information about deliveries or births;<br/> trusts identifying that they have no maternity beds available, but recording a high number of birth and delivery episodes; and<br/> Some trusts have space in their maternity system to record nine birth tails, whereas other systems have space for 18. As deliveries, miscarriages and abortions are all recorded in the birth tail, there are cases where nine tails is not enough to record all of the relevant data.<br/> 2. Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, coverage of hospital deliveries was 72.6 per cent., on average, whereas that of home deliveries was 13.6 per cent., on average. The incomplete coverage problem is significantly compounded by the data quality issues outlined.<br/> 3. <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 4. <i> FCE:</i><br/> A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> 5. <i> All Diagnoses count of episodes:</i><br/> These figures represent a count of all FCE's where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br/> International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-IO diagnosis codes used:<br/> P96.1 Neonatal withdrawal symptoms form maternal use of drugs of addiction.<br/> P96.2 Withdrawal symptoms form therapeutic use of drugs in newborn.<br/> 6. <i> Low Numbers:</i><br/> Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with '*' (an asterisk).<br/> 7. <i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="b.1294W.0/73"> <td colspan="7"><sup>(1 )</sup>For all years the total number of cases is higher when looking at the yearly total broken down by drug use compared to the yearly figure broken down by region. This is because there will be several cases where the mother has been diagnosed as using more than one type of drug and those drugs have been recognised. International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis code F19.2 Mental and behavioural disorders due to multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances is only used when patterns of psychoactive substance-taking are chaotic and indiscriminate or when the contributions of different psychoactive substances are inextricably mixed.<br/> <i> Coverage and data quality:</i><br/> The maternity tail data coverage is not as complete as the rest of HES data. There are a number of reasons for the coverage and data quality issues such as:<br/> trusts submitting a significantly higher number of delivery episodes compared to birth episodes;<br/> trusts failing to submit data on the number of birth episodes where they record a high number of delivery episodes;<br/> trusts failing to submit delivery&mdash;the reason for this is that approximately 20 trusts have a stand alone maternity system which is not linked to the Patient Administration System;<br/> trusts identifying a high number of maternity beds available, but not recording any information about deliveries or births;<br/> trusts identifying that they have no maternity beds available, but recording a high number of birth and delivery episodes; and<br/> some trusts have space in their maternity system to record nine birth tails, whereas other systems have space for 18. As deliveries, miscarriages and abortions are all recorded in the birth tail, there are cases where nine tails is not enough to record all of the relevant data.<br/> Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, coverage of hospital deliveries was 72.6 per cent. on average, whereas that of home deliveries was 13.6 per cent. on average. The incomplete coverage problem is significantly compounded by the data quality issues outlined above.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE):</i><br/> A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> <i> Secondary Diagnoses:</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (6 prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> ICD-10 code used:<br/> Z37. Outcome of delivery (must always been found in the first secondary position)<br/> <i> All Diagnoses count of episodes:</i><br/> These figures represent a count of all FCE's where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 secondary (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br/> ICD-10 diagnosis codes used (and must be accompanied by secondary diagnosis code):<br/> F10.2 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol, dependence syndrome;<br/> F11.2 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of opioids, dependence syndrome;<br/> F12.2 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of cannabinoids, dependence syndrome;<br/> F13.2 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of sedatives or hypnotics, dependence syndrome;<br/> F14.2 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of cocaine, dependence syndrome;</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1311W.2/1">Data on acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) are not collected by the Home Office as they are voluntary agreements and therefore not suitable for central data collection. Surveys carried out by the Home Office of the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) indicated that over 25,000 ABCs have been made since October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.2/2">A National Audit Office study in December 2006 found that such interventions were highly effective in combating antisocial behaviour. 65 per cent. of people stopped behaving antisocially after one intervention; 86 per cent. after two; and 93 per cent. after three.</p>

	<p pid="b.1326W.2/1">The legislation that allows us to request that unlawfully terrorism related material is modified or removed from the internet is Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2006. Section 3 allows a constable to serve a notice where he or she believes illegal terrorism related material is available on the internet, on the person(s) responsible for that material. The notice requires that the terrorism related material be removed or modified within two working days. The preferred route of the police (recommended in the guidelines on using Section 3 notices) is not to issue formal Section 3 notices in the first instance, but to use informal contact with communication service providers instead. To date this has proved effective, but statistics covering the number of sites removed through such informal contact are not available. The police have no record of any Section 3 notices being issued, and statistics on the use of Section 3 notices are not collected by the Home Office.</p>

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.

	<p pid="b.1331W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/2">The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) does not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a sound measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/3">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2005-06&quot;, published by the DWP. This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the number and proportion of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportion in persistent poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/4">The available information, derived from the DWP's &quot;Family Resources Survey&quot; (FRS), is given in the following tables. However, it should be noted with regards to the information in the tables that robust estimates are not available for each individual region for owner-occupied households below 40 per cent. of contemporary median income because of small samples.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/5">Although the question asks for the number of owner-occupied households who are unemployed, the tables show the number of workless households&mdash;the reason for this is given in note 7.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/6">The question does not specify whether the basis for income should be before or after housing costs have been deducted&mdash;so both sets of figures have been given.</p>

Averages based on three survey years are given, because the sample sizes for individual regions for single years are too small to produce robust annual estimates.<br/> 2. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br/> 3. Income includes housing benefit, where applicable. Housing costs include rents, where applicable. This definition is standard international best practice.<br/> 4. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br/> 5. The national median income of the survey year in question has been used (i.e. the 2003-04 median income is the basis of the results for the 2003-04 survey year) instead of using a fixed median for a particular year. This is consistent with the preferred way of measuring poverty.<br/> 6. Owner-occupied households are defined as households that are either owned outright or are being bought with a mortgage.<br/> 7. A household is defined as workless if no one within the household is classified as working. So 'workless' embraces all the 'not working' categories: unemployed, retired, student, looking after family/home, permanently sick/disabled, temporarily sick/injured and other inactive. DWP prefer to answer this PQ in a manner consistent with their publications. In any case, if they had limited the analysis to just 'unemployed', the sample size would have been too small to produce anything robust or meaningful.<br/> 8. Within households, pensioners are excluded from the classifications if they are not working, and are included if they are working. For example, a household with a pensioner in work, but a working age person not in work, would be in the working households category. This is consistent with the definition of the economic status of the household used in the &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; publication.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1331W.2/64"> <td colspan="4">9. Figures are given in million, rounded to the nearest 100,000 households. Some figures may not sum due to rounding.<br/> 10. This response includes a lower income threshold of 40 per cent. of the contemporary median income. The data for families with an income lower than 50 per cent. of median is not considered to be accurate as an indicator of living standards. Many of these households while having very low incomes would not be considered poor, but who do genuinely have few sources of income in the short-run. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the FRS may not actually have the lowest living standards.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Family Resources Survey 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1340W.2/4" class="italic"> Mobile telephone licences</p>
	<p pid="b.1340W.2/5">The auction of wireless telegraphy licences for 3G mobile telephony raised &pound;22,477.4 million in May 2000. Ofcom has since held three further auctions of licences on a technology and application neutral basis in frequency bands suitable for mobile communications (in May 2006, October 2006 and May 2007) raising a total of &pound;5.64 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1340W.2/6">The aim of the auctions was not to raise revenue but to secure optimal use of the radio spectrum. Receipts from spectrum awards are passed to the Consolidated Fund. The Consolidated Fund receives the proceeds of taxation and certain other Government receipts and finances the nation's general expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1340W.5/1">It is not possible using landfill tax receipts data to determine how much revenue is received from local authorities. This is because registered landfill site operators pay the tax to HM Revenue and Customs and pass on the cost to their customers through the disposal charges they set. The origin of the landfilled waste is not recorded on the tax return.</p>
