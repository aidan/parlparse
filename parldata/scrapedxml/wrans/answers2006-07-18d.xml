	<p pid="d.259W.3/1">After decades of conflict, the lack of investment in basic infrastructure, poor governance and drought, much of Afghanistan's productivity has been lost or re-directed towards poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. As 70 per cent. of the population are rural, agriculture provides the best opportunity for alternative income generation.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.3/2">Helmand province was once one of the most agriculturally advanced and productive areas in Afghanistan. It might have the potential to be so again. For examples, the DFID-funded research into alternative livelihoods programme (RALF) is looking at the export potential of grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms egg plants and okra in Helmand and has made contacts with raisin importers, which involves organic and fair trade. The programme is also evaluating at least 10 different small scale agri-processing industries such as tomato paste production.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.3/3">Growth in small and medium enterprises and construction has the potential to bring new employment opportunities in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. DFID supports the micro finance investment support facility programme, which provides much needed credit for investment in agriculture, manufacturing, retail and service industries. To date, the programme has brought financial services for some 161,000 people in and around half of the provinces of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.3/4">The development of Afghanistan's natural resources could also provide alternative jobs. Afghanistan possesses energy and mineral resources, many of which are underdeveloped, such as coal, gas, oil, precious metals and semi-precious stones. DFID is funding the British Geological Survey to strengthen the Afghan Geological Survey to develop and promote the mining sector.</p>

	<p pid="d.259W.6/1">DFID has provided over &pound;1.1 million for land mine clearance work in Angola since 2003. A further &pound;400,000 will be spent this year to support land mine clearance activities in the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.6/2">DFID is currently funding the work of two mine action NGOs operating in Angola&mdash;the Halo Trust and the Mine Awareness Group. Most of this work is taking place in areas where humanitarian operations are ongoing in order to allow UN Agencies such as the World Food Programme to access populations in need, and to do so safely.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.6/3">DFID's aid programme in Angola is focused on providing support to meet urgent humanitarian needs. Funding for transport infrastructure has been made in the context of support provided for humanitarian programming. DFID provided &pound;1.15 million to the WFP last year to support the construction of bridges to enable quicker humanitarian access to populations in need. This support has also reduced costs because aid can now travel by road instead of only by air transport.</p>
	<p pid="d.259W.6/4">Support for infrastructure development in southern Africa has been identified as a priority area in DFID's southern Africa regional plan. Angola will benefit from this work, which is currently at the design stage.</p>

We expect that it will make recommendations on how the UN can support the African Union, and ultimately take over in Darfur. We do not know yet what form the report will take. It may be an oral briefing, a letter from Kofi Annan or a formal written report. Assuming any written report is made public, I will arrange for copies to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.260W.5/1">DFID is co-financing a Concern Universal project with the European Union Water Facility. The project is in two districts of Malawi and will deliver 550 boreholes, household sanitation, and training, and help build capacity in the districts. DFID is contributing &pound;620,000 over five years, which is 25 per cent. of the overall funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.5/2">DFID has agreed to co-finance a project in 13 districts of Malawi if the NGO consortium involved can secure European Union Water Facility funding. The consortium of six NGOs is led by Concern Universal and also includes Oxfam, Emmanuel International and World Vision. This project will work with local government and is expected to deliver over 3,000 functioning boreholes and safe sanitation for 250,000 people. DFID has agreed to contribute &pound;860,000 over five years which is 25 per cent. of the overall funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.5/3">DFID is funding WaterAid to complete a nationwide digital map showing who has and does not have access to a safe water supply. This tool will help the Government and others to concentrate their efforts on supplying water to those who have no access at present. DFID is spending &pound;65,000 on this work.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.5/4">As part of support to primary education, DFID has been funding improvements to primary school water supply and sanitation for the past nine years. In 2005, DFID spent approximately &pound;1,000,000 on primary school water supply and sanitation in Malawi. Apart from their health benefits, the availability of latrines and their sensitive siting is one of a number of factors that can help keep girls at school.</p>

	<p pid="d.261W.2/1">DFID has a rising aid programme in Somalia. Subject to political and other developments within Somalia, this year we plan to disburse approximately &pound;15.5 million, of which around 40 per cent. is likely to be spent in Somaliland. This is planned to rise further next year, again with a substantial portion benefiting Somaliland&mdash;either as support for specific Somaliland activities or as part of a Somalia-wide programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.2/2">Our programmes in Somalia are focused around three objectives agreed:</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.2/3" class="indent">i. To help achieve a just and viable political settlement in Somalia. Programmes include a Dialogue for Peace project and Democratisation project through WSP International.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.2/4" class="indent">ii. To work with others to establish the basis for effective development assistance, with an initial focus on improving governance and service delivery. Programmes include a partnership agreement with UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for support to primary education and a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Rule of Law Programme supporting re-establishment and strengthening of police services and justice systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.2/5" class="indent">iii. To ensure timely provision of humanitarian relief. For example, we provided approximately &pound;13 million in response to the recent drought in the Horn of Africa, specifically for relief in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="d.261W.2/6">We do not provide bilateral aid directly to any Somali authority; however, projects under the objectives above, undertaken by the UN and NGOs, involve collaboration with local and regional authorities and the Transitional Federal Government in their delivery.</p>

	<p pid="d.264W.8/2">Existing regulations require the use of lights on pedal cycles between sunset and sunrise: non-compliance is an offence. Requiring the fitment of operational lights at point of sale would not ensure that the lights were thereafter maintained in working order, nor would it ensure that riders turned them on. However, such regulation would deprive cyclists of choice, as there are several legally acceptable varieties of cycle lights, ranging from dynamo to battery-operated and steady to flashing, from which cyclists are currently free to choose.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.8/3">Our policy on cycle helmets is to persuade cyclists to protect themselves by using them, but providing helmets with each new bicycle would not guarantee that they would be used. The Government will keep their policies in this&mdash;as in all areas&mdash;under review in the light of discussion in Parliament and elsewhere.</p>

Coaches are clearly high occupancy vehicles but they are speed restricted, which could therefore impede the flow of traffic in the HOV lane. A key consideration is whether the proposed HOV lane is on the outside of the motorway (as proposed for M1 junction 7 to 10) or the inside of the motorway (as proposed for M62/M606).</p>

Market research strongly indicates that motorists are overwhelmingly interested in seeing information about the 'point of use' of costs of their car. Therefore the default is to display the fuel costs and other direct costs. Showing full costs as the default would result in this functionality not being used by the majority of motorists, thus negating any potential effect on their travel choice.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.2/3">Users do have the option to select an estimate of the total running costs. This is based on advice and information provided by the major motoring organisations and provides a figure which reflects the total cost of motoring, on a per mile basis. If the user chooses this option, then fuel costs, the exceptional costs and the total ownership costs are displayed.</p>

This relates to the provision of workplace assessments to identify individual needs and recommend special aids and equipment and, where applicable, the provision of assistance with the cost of providing reasonable adjustments. While the scheme also assists with the cost of travel to work, the Department has no knowledge of assistance provided for NIO staff, as individuals must apply direct to the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.281W.9/1">The advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) is that we should not vaccinate poultry in advance of an avian influenza outbreak, or as an immediate disease control response. Although currently available vaccines are able to reduce mortality, it is possible that some vaccinated birds would still be capable of transmitting the disease if they become infected, but might not display symptoms of disease. This would increase the time taken to detect and eradicate the virus. High standards of surveillance and biosecurity, early reporting of suspect cases and culling remain the most effective ways of preventing avian influenza and tackling an outbreak.</p>
	<p pid="d.281W.9/2">However, as I informed the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-11">11 July</phrase>, in order to be fully prepared we have invited tenders to supply us with a further 10 million doses of avian influenza vaccine for potential use in poultry and other captive birds. This is not a change in policy. The CVO has recommended this step as part of sensible contingency planning in the light of uncertainties about the future spread and nature of the virus, and the possibility of as yet unforeseen circumstances. The vaccine would only be used if a risk assessment and scientific evidence indicated it would help to prevent disease spread.</p>

	<p pid="d.282W.12/1">The Department's annual reports contain information on departmental management and public service delivery, including on measures taken to improve efficiency and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.12/2">For the years 1997-98 and 1998-99, value for money and efficiency savings were not reported separately in the Department's annual reports but were contained within the chapters on the management of the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.12/3">During the period covered by the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review (1999-2002), the Department had a strategic efficiency target to achieve savings of 2.5 per cent. of its running costs each year. In 1999-2000 DTI achieved a saving of 2.6 per cent. of running costs (&pound;10.6 million on projected costs of &pound;406.6 million); and in 2000-01 a saving of 4.6 per cent. (&pound;19.3 million on projected costs of &pound;418.8 million).</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.12/4">The CSR98 efficiency target was replaced for the 2000 Spending Review period (2001-04) by a Public Service Agreement Target to &quot;achieve value for money improvements of 2.5 per cent. a year across the Department&quot;, which was carried over into the 2002 Spending Review (2003-06). In 2001-02 value for money improvements under this target amounted to 3.79 per cent. (&pound;16 million on projected costs of &pound;422.3 million); and in 2002-03 amounted to 4.5 per cent. (&pound;20.2 million on projected costs of &pound;449.9 million).</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.12/5">Value for money improvements related to administration under the SR2002 PSA12 value for the money target amounted to &pound;35.4 million in 2003-04 and &pound;351.7 million in 2004-05. The Department's performance for 2005-06 against this PSA target will be covered in the 2006 departmental report, which was due to be published in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.282W.12/6">In the 2004 Spending Review the Department committed to achieve annual efficiencies of at least &pound;380 million by 2007-08. The 2005 Autumn Performance Report, published last December, provides the most recent assessment of the Department's performance against this target. &pound;27.97 million efficiency gains related to administration spend were achieved by the end of Quarter 2.</p>

	<p pid="d.294W.5/1">Responsibility for tackling fuel poverty in England is shared between the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Following the Energy Review, we will be taking forward work with energy suppliers and other key players to examine how the continuing challenge of fuel poverty can be best addressed. The Energy Review also commits us to looking hard at how we can maximise the contribution made by our existing schemes. The Department of Trade and Industry will play an important role in this analysis.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs leads on the Warm Front scheme in England. The Warm Front scheme has resulted in improvements to the energy efficiency of the housing of those on a range of qualifying benefits and has provided assistance to over a million vulnerable households since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/3">The Department of Trade and Industry itself has a number of policies to tackle the issue of fuel poverty. It has liaised closely with energy suppliers on the development of the Home Heat Helpline, which provides vulnerable customers and their representatives with a central point of information relating to the help available from their energy supplier and Government. It has encouraged the introduction of social tariffs and price freezes for fuel poor and low income customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/4">The Department's Design and Demonstration Unit is a team of private sector secondees that works in support of Energy White Paper objectives. As part of the Unit's work, it has designed and delivered projects to provide gas connections to deprived communities, and it is now developing community projects utilising renewable technologies.</p>

	<p pid="d.294W.8/1">I am not aware of any data source that provides information on rural and non-rural petrol prices. There is anecdotal evidence that petrol prices in rural areas are likely to be higher than non-rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.8/2">There are a variety of reasons why this is likely to be the case. These include:</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.8/3" class="indent">Fuel throughput, in that the higher the throughput the lower the retail margin required to give a return on the investment. Rural garages are likely to have lower throughputs.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.8/4" class="indent">Bulk delivery charges, many sites have relatively small storage tanks since they are cheaper to install. However, they require more frequent replenishment and this results in some sites paying higher delivery charges. Again smaller tanks are likely to be more prevalent is smaller, rural petrol stations.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.8/5" class="indent">Competition; large, particularly supermarket sites in close proximity to one another in urban areas do tend to lead to lower prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.8/6">Regional petrol prices are available on the AA website at <a href="http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuel/index.html">http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuel/index.html</a>.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-18d.85082.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-18d.300W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="300W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060718/text/60718w0009.htm#06071921005250">
	<p pid="d.300W.0/1">The UK's gas import dependence is set to rise to 80-90 per cent. by 2020, of which a significant proportion is expected to be imported from the European mainland through existing and planned interconnection capacity. The International Energy Agency forecast that the EU will import 25 per cent. of its gas needs from Russia by 2030. It is, therefore, possible that some Russian gas will be imported into the UK, albeit indirectly and commingled with gas from other sources (such as Norway, the Netherlands and LNG from outside Europe) as part of the European gas system.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/2">The contractual origin of imports into the UK is a decision for companies operating in the UK's liberalised gas market, taking into account elements such as cost, reliability, availability and the need for a diverse range of sources to provide security of supply. Given that there is no direct physical interconnection capacity with Russia and contractual flows do not necessarily follow physical flows, estimates of the type requested are not made.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/3">Given that the UK does not import directly from Russia, any impact on the UK from Russia's legislation or compliance with international agreements such as the Energy Charter Treaty will be felt most directly through its effect on European markets. As such, the UK will continue to press for open, competitive and liberalised European energy markets.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/4">In the short term, we expect the Russian gas export laws to have very little real effect on European security of supply, as Gazprom's already holds a defacto monopoly on exports by virtue of their network ownership. Longer-term effects are unclear; however, should gas transit through Russia become too commercially unattractive, Caspian and Central Asian producers will begin to seek alternative supply routes for their products to European and global markets.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/5">The proposed legislative changes surrounding Russia's subsoil law continue to be subject to discussion in the Russian government. The DTI and FCO are in contact with UK businesses involved in the Russian Energy market, in order to remain updated on the impact that any final series of laws may have.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/6">The UK, with other EU member states, will continue to encourage Russia to liberalise its domestic markets and provide fair and open access to its resources and pipelines in order to foster further competition in energy supplies into Europe and to ensure best use is made of its finite resources.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/7">The UK, with other G7 members, has encouraged Russia to move forward during its G8 presidency and ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, of which it is already a signatory and applies on a provisional basis. We would envisage that these Global Energy Security discussions will continue during the Russian presidency of the G8.</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/8">Russia has called for the negotiations on the Transit Protocol to be completed before it can ratify the full Treaty. Through the EU, we continue to work with Russia towards an agreed text for the Transit Protocol while at the same time emphasising to Russia the importance of open, transparent, efficient and competitive markets at all stages of the energy supply chain as the key to global energy security..</p>
	<p pid="d.300W.0/9">Whilst the absence of ratification may bring some uncertainty to the rights of both foreign and domestic investors, it is important to note that the UK has a separate bi- lateral investment Treaty with Russia that protects the investment of UK firms.</p>

	<p pid="d.307W.5/2">Meetings between officials from the then ODPM and Swindon borough council during 2004 and 2005 were intended to encourage a sustained focus by the Council on overall improvement of its performance. By December 2005, Swindon had improved from a Comprehensive Performance Assessment rating of &quot;poor&quot; to achieve a rating of two stars and &quot;improving well&quot;. In the light of this improved performance, ODPM's close engagement with Swindon borough council ceased in early 2006 as it was considered to have achieved its objectives. Swindon continues to receive support, where necessary, from the Government Office for the South West.</p>

	<p pid="d.307W.9/1">Standard 8 of the National Service Framework (NSF) for Children, Young People and Maternity Services, targeted at local authorities and others, is for disabled children and young people and those with complex health needs. Children and young people receive co-ordinated, high-quality child and family-centred services that are based on assessed needs, promote social inclusion and, where possible, enable them and their families to live ordinary lives.</p>
	<p pid="d.307W.9/2">The NSF has been supported by a number of exemplars, including one on autism. This sets out an optimal pathway for a boy with autism, beginning at the age of three, from initial concern and contact with primary care, through a developmental and a multi-agency assessment, the drawing up of a family support plan and early educational intervention and on to the transitions between primary and secondary school and secondary school and adult life.</p>
	<p pid="d.307W.9/3">Local authorities have a duty under the Education Act 1996, where necessary, to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with special educational needs (SEN), including those with autistic spectrum disorders. When doing so, local authorities have to have regard to the SEN Code of Practice. &quot;Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Good Practice Guidance&quot; (2002, Department for Education and Skills and Department of Health) is also available for local authorities. It includes pointers to good practice on identification.</p>

	<p pid="d.310W.2/11" class="indent">This figure is not kept as a statistic or performance indicator. The notional average for purposes of workload calculation is 25 hours, though with the complexity of cases increasing, this is likely to be an underestimate. A great number of cases that were once the subject of s7 reports are now dealt with earlier and quicker in our dispute resolution programmes. This in turn means the fewer cases subject to s7 reports are those much harder to resolve, and consequently, they take longer. In practice, the variation in cases is large, between 20 hours at the lower end and over 100 hours for the hardest cases.</p>

	<p pid="d.312W.5/1">There are many opportunities in the school curriculum for raising awareness of physical, medical and mental disabilities. Through the non-statutory Personal, Social and Health Education framework and statutory National Curriculum Citizenship Education, pupils are taught that differences and similarities between people arise from a number of factors, including disability, and about the need for mutual respect and understanding. Pupils are encouraged to reflect on spiritual, moral, social, and cultural issues, using imagination to understand other people's experiences. They are taught about the causes, symptoms and treatments for stress and depression, and to identify strategies for prevention and management and how to seek professional advice confidently and find information about health. National Curriculum Science also examines how human health is affected by a range of environmental and inherited factors.</p>

	<p pid="d.324W.6/2">The Ethnic Minority Employment Task Force (EMETF) has met regularly since its inception in 2003. Details of its work to fulfil the recommendations of the Strategy Unit's report, &quot;Ethnic Minorities and the Labour Market&quot; (March 2003), have been presented annually to the Economic Affairs, Productivity and Competitiveness (EAPC) by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and are available at <a href="http://www.emetaskforce.gov.uk">www.emetaskforce.gov.uk</a> and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.6/3">In 2005, the Task Force was also given responsibility for taking forward the main conclusions of the National Employment Panel's report: &quot;Enterprising People: Enterprising Places&quot; (May 2005). Current priorities include work on the City Strategy; developing an outreach service to focus on non-working ethnic minority partners in low income households; expanding the data and research evidence base; and developing the opportunities presented by the Olympics to raise ethnic minority employment.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.6/4">The third EMETF annual report will be published later this year and will include the findings of the independent review to be undertaken in the Autumn. The EMETF is supported and advised by the Ethnic Minority Advisory Group (EMAG) which has a membership comprising members of the ethnic minority voluntary, business and training sectors, faith groups, academics and its chair sits on the EMETF.</p>

The Secretary of State also has reserve powers under the Gambling Act 2005 to make regulations with regard to the form, content, timing and location of gambling advertising. She will not hesitate to use these powers if it becomes clear that self-regulation is not sufficient to protect children and vulnerable people from exploitation.

	<p pid="d.328W.0/1">The PKF report recommended that there were particular efficiencies to be found within the stock procurement systems. The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) therefore commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake a detailed study of the potential for efficiencies in this area and to develop a model to realise them. PwC will report on its proposals shortly. Work will then follow to implement its proposed model.</p>
	<p pid="d.328W.0/2">We envisage that the work on stock procurement will provide lessons that could be transferred to other areas of public library management and service delivery&mdash;for example, in increased joint working and procurement of services such as marketing materials and reading promotions.</p>

	<p pid="d.337W.6/1">The UK remains deeply concerned about Eritrea's human rights record. The detention without charge by the Eritrean government of members of minority religious groups, journalists, leading political figures and members of civil society is unacceptable and contravenes international human rights agreements to which Eritrea is a party. We raise our concerns with the Eritrean government at every suitable opportunity. Our new Ambassador in Asmara has done so during his introductory meetings with the Eritrean authorities since his arrival in April 2006. We also work with our EU partners in reminding Eritrea of its human rights obligations including through the ongoing EU/Eritrea Political Dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="d.338W.6/1">We have a number of concerns about the human rights situation in Haiti, many of which are linked to the political instability and violence that the country has experienced in recent years. Several of the allegations of abuse relate to actions by the police and the judicial system. These include excessive use of force, involvement in kidnappings, detainment without trial, existence of political prisoners and violence against women. Supporting the reform of the police, prisons and judicial system is therefore a major priority for the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. The determination expressed by the recently elected President Pr&eacute;val to tackle human rights problems in Haiti has been encouraging.</p>

	<p pid="d.339W.9/1">In the fragile peace following its brutal civil war, the human rights situation in Sierra Leone is slowly improving. However, many of the root causes of conflict, including abject poverty, corruption and a lack of access to justice remain. These continue to have an impact on the spectrum of human rights.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.9/2">The government continue to rebuild its institutions and UK programmes to retrain and restructure the armed forces and police have made a big impact on security, to the extent that UN peacekeepers left at the end of 2005. But Sierra Leoneans are still denied many basic rights, notably in the justice sector, which is inefficient and corruptible. We support a Justice Sector Development Programme aiming to tackle this and an Anti-Corruption Commission to tackle wider malfeasance. There is a free press, but the government can still react harshly to criticism.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.9/3">We worked hard, with other partners, to achieve the transfer of Charles Taylor to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which is a major success for defending human rights and ending impunity in the region. We want to ensure that the trial continues to have wide coverage in Sierra Leone so that the people feel that they retain ownership of the process.</p>

The NHS is responsible for the health care of ex-service personnel but information on referrals of Gulf veterans is not available.

	<p pid="d.348W.11/2">There are 12 Royal Navy Merlin Mkl helicopters not currently included in the Lockheed Martin upgrade programme (known as the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme). A decision is currently expected to be made in late 2008 as to whether to add 8 of these 12 to the programme. Should a decision be taken not to add these aircraft to the programme they would remain in the RN Merlin fleet and a decision would be taken on their out-of-service date around 2015. Inclusion in the programme would extend their out-of-service date to 2029.</p>
	<p pid="d.348W.11/3">There are no plans to add the other four RN Merlin Mkl helicopters to the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme. These are currently used as trials aircraft either based at Agusta Westland Ltd. at Yeovil, Somerset or at RNAS Culdrose. A decision on the out-of-service date of these four aircraft is also expected to be taken around 2015.</p>

However, frequent contact is maintained between officials from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Communities and Local Government regarding veterans housing matters. Our main focus is on improving access to housing for Service personnel while they are still serving or are at the point of leaving the Service. This applies to both single Service personnel and those with families, and is intended to facilitate a smooth transition to civilian life. Measures already in place to assist all personnel leaving the Services include the provision of comprehensive information and advice on housing options and the MOD Nominations Scheme, which facilitates access for Service leavers to housing with 43 registered social landlords and councils across the UK. In recognition of their specific needs, the Single Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-Services provides an advice and placement service for single Service leavers.</p>
	<p pid="d.353W.9/2">Through the Veterans Agency helpline and website, liaison with the ex-Service charities and other agencies, and various communications initiatives, we aim to increase awareness among veterans of the support available and improve access to help on housing and other matters. We also support a number of initiatives to prevent and tackle homelessness among existing veterans.</p>

	<p pid="d.354W.3/1">The most recent data available that allow assessment to be made of the number of households with no access to a bank account are to be found in the Family Resources Survey from 2002-03. This indicates that 8 per cent. of households in the United Kingdom had no bank account of any kind. This equated to 1.9 million households containing around 2.8 million adults. The data are broken down to Government office regional level. This shows 9 per cent. of households in Yorkshire and the Humber were unbanked. The data can also be broken down by the age of the household reference person (the owner of the household or the one with the highest income). This shows that 27 per cent. of unbanked households had a household reference person over the age of 65.</p>

The taskforce recently made its first annual report, which concluded that steady progress has been made towards the goal but also encouraged banks to continue to address the difficulties faced in opening a bank account.</p>

The sub-functions presented include schools, tertiary education and training spending. For earlier years we do not hold a consistent series with Table 3.4 at the detailed sub-function level and so the information is not available.

	<p pid="d.356W.11/3">Total Expenditure on Services by country and region is available in chapter 8 of PESA 2005 (chapter 7 of PESA 2006). These regional spending statistics use the concept of 'identifiable' spending where Government spending is allocated to the region or country that benefits from the spending. Some spending cannot be allocated to a region or country as it is for the benefit of the UK as a whole (e.g. defence spending). Tables 8.5 to 8.10 present England spending on Education and Training for 1999-2000 to 2004-05 on this identifiable, who benefits, basis. We do not currently produce these regional analyses at a sub-function level, although it is something we are considering for the future.

	<p pid="d.357W.5/4" class="indent">The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and ONS are in regular contact at a working level to discuss a range of statistical issues around population. None of these discussions will be about the local government financial settlement which is the responsibility of DCLG and not a matter for ONS. In addition the ONS' National Statistics Centre for Demography hosts the Central and Local Government Information Partnership (CLiP) Population Subgroup. This is the forum ONS uses to discuss statistical issues pertaining to the estimation of population with central and local government. DCLG are represented on this group.</p>
	<p pid="d.357W.5/5" class="indent">ONS produces the mid year population estimates on a consistent basis, for all local authorities in England and Wales. These are the best available estimates at the time of their publication. They are based on the UN definition of a long term migrant i.e someone who changes their country of usual residence for a period of at least a year. The 2005 Mid Year Estimates, due to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-24">24 August 2006</phrase>, will include an estimate of the number of long term immigrants from the EU accession countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.384W.3/1">Information on completed private finance initiative (PFI) projects which have gone over budget or opened late is not routinely collected centrally. To provide such information for each of the past five years would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.384W.3/2">A key aspect of PFI is the transfer of risk of projects going over budget. Therefore, any cost overruns will be borne by the private sector provider, not the public sector. The private sector is only paid once the facility is built and operational to the agreed standard and is subject to penalties and deductions if services falls below agreed standard.</p>

	<p pid="d.385W.2/1">In the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper published in 2004, we set out our decision that national health service buildings would be smoke-free by the end of 2006, ahead of the requirements set out in the Health Bill, which will see virtually all enclosed public places and workplaces become smoke-free from summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.385W.2/2">The removal of smoking from NHS buildings will not only result in protection from the harms associated with secondhand smoke for staff, patients and visitors to NHS buildings, but will result in greater safety, for example, by the reduction in the danger of fire.

	<p pid="d.386W.6/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="d.386W.6/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 200 people in Yeovil. Once in work, new deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="d.386W.6/3">People aged 50 and over, including those in Yeovil, are also eligible for help from new deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated on new deal 25 plus, are already required to attend the gateway stage of the new deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="d.386W.6/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the New deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. Yeovil was included in the pilot which offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Interim results are positive and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we intend to commence a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="d.386W.6/5">Between 1979 and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits trebled. Since then, growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly and, in November 2005, there were 2.71 million people claiming incapacity benefits, a fall of 61,000 over the year. 46 per cent. of those claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age although, between 2000 and 2005, the number of people in this age group fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the incapacity benefits case load.</p>
	<p pid="d.386W.6/6">We still clearly have more work to do and, like other age groups, people aged 50 and over will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new incapacity benefit (IB) customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a 'Choices Package' of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis. Pathways has already begun helping people in the Yeovil area, having rolled out there in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.386W.6/7">Through our Age Positive Campaign we are working with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and best practice on age in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>

It is not possible to identify those convicted in Peterborough constituency, or Peterborough city council, as the data are not collected at this level of detail.

	<p pid="d.395W.4/2">In addition to this, the penalty notice for disorder scheme was brought into effect in all police forces in England and Wales during 2004. Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons committing specified minor offences with a fixed penalty notice. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence. In 2004 25,591 penalty notices were issued in England for the offence of being drunk and disorderly. Provisional data for 2005 show that 34,238 penalty notices were issued in England for this offence. It is not possible to identify the number of penalty notices issued in Peterborough as centrally held data are not collected at that level of detail.</p>

	<p pid="d.398W.0/2">Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides an interpretation of Article 33(2) of the 1951 Convention and defines the term 'particularly serious crime' for the purposes of Article 33(2) as one for which the person concerned has received a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years, or has been convicted of an offence specified by order of the Secretary of State, whatever the length of sentence imposed. An automatic presumption is made, which is rebuttable, that such a person poses a danger to the community.</p>

	<p pid="d.399W.17/1">Any death of a child or young person in custody is thoroughly investigated. (Fortunately such deaths are comparatively rare.) The main form of public inquiry into any death is the inquest. Developments in case law in recent years have greatly extended the scope of inquests into deaths in custody, so that they can now inquire into a wide range of possible contributory factors (although sentencing policy will rarely, if ever, be a directly contributory factor to a death in an individual case). In addition, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman conducts his own independent inquiry into any death of a young person in a young offender institution or a secure training centre; and the Local Safeguarding Children's Board is likely to commission a serious case review under Part 8 of the joint Department for Education and Skills/Home Office/Department of Health guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999). Many of the young people who become involved in serious or persistent offending are at risk of self-harm, whether or not they are in custody. It is not possible to quantify how many young people's health, including mental health, has been positively assisted by care received while in custody. There is no reason to believe that sentencing policy is increasing the rate of mortality of young people under 18.</p>

In the event that any such licence conditions are breached, the offender is liable to be recalled to prison upon the recommendation of the probation officer in order to protect the public. Once the licence is revoked and the offender recalled, the police are notified, in order to ensure a swift return to custody.</p>

	<p pid="d.414W.12/1">Towards the end of May 2006 there were around 300 prisoners in open prisons in England and Wales with a foreign nationality. The figures have been drawn from the prisons' administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system.</p>
	<p pid="d.414W.12/2">Foreign nationals are subject to the same risk assessment process as any other prisoner before allocation to open conditions. The overriding purpose of the security classification must be to ensure that prisoners are retained in custody with a level of security that is consistent with the need to protect the public. Following a review of the criteria for the categorisation of foreign national prisoners and their allocation to open conditions in May 2006, the Prison Service concluded that no changes were required of the policy. However, Governors have been instructed to take into account the impact of recent public statements regarding the likelihood of deportation on the risk of absconding when considering foreign national prisoners for Category D status and allocation to open conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.414W.12/3">All life-sentenced foreign nationals and those sentenced for serious offences were returned from open conditions to closed during May and have been subject to an individual risk assessment in consultation with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate before a final decision as to whether or not they are suitable to return to open conditions.</p>

	<p pid="d.416W.2/1">As stated in the Government's White Paper (Proposals for Regulation of the Private Security Industry in England and Wales, CM 4254) in March 1999, accurate statistics on the size of the private security industry have always been difficult to obtain. The most recent estimate contained in the White Paper was that in 1994 there were 162,000 licensable people, based on research by the Policy Studies Institute.</p>
	<p pid="d.416W.2/2">In their 2004-05 business plan the Security Industry Authority (SIA) estimated that the total licensable population was just over 221,000. The SIA has continued to update its estimates in the light of operational experience and the current estimate is that about 183,000 individuals require a licence. The majority of this change is due to the revision of the estimated size of the door supervisor sector. A breakdown of these figures by each type of licence is in the following table.</p>

Arrest data for ticket-touting offences during 2005-06 football season are currently being collated and will be published later this year. Measures within the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will extend coverage of ticket touting offences to the internet when the unauthorised sale of tickets for a regulated football match takes place within England or Wales.</p>

	<p pid="d.424W.11/1">Key policy requirements in relation to maintaining family contact through social visits, correspondence and by telephone are subject to review through local and national audit processes. In addition, establishments are, on occasion, subject to thorough inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons. Independent monitoring boards are also able to highlight good practice or areas of concern in their annual reports to the Secretary of State. Units accommodating under 18-year-olds are subject to monitoring by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="d.425W.2/2">The &pound;500,000 allocated in June 2005 was available to the Youth Justice Board (YJB) until <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> to fund individual support orders (ISOs) delivered by local youth offending teams (YOTs) to support juveniles with antisocial behaviour orders. 31 applications for funding in respect of ISOs have been received by the YJB for a total of &pound;62,000 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.425W.2/3">As part of their plans for using the &pound;45 million prevention budget for the period to March 2008, seven YOTs have included specific schemes for ISO interventions. All YOTs, however, are required to support interventions in support of ISOs whether or not there is a specific scheme. Such support may be delivered through another programme being funded through an allocation from this budget, such as a youth inclusion programme or a youth inclusion and support panel, or it may be provided through an existing programme. The use of ISOs is being actively promoted by the YJB and the Home Office, as an aid to helping YOTs fulfil their role in tackling antisocial behaviour, and action is in hand to ensure a better uptake.</p>
