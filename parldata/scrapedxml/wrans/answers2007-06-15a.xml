Any proposed changes to Green Belt boundaries should also be made through the development plan process as set out in PPG2.</p>

	<p pid="a.1332W.6/2">The draft regional spatial strategy does not contain site specific proposals. It will be for the local planning authorities to identify specific site allocations sites in their local development documents to accommodate the housing provision in the final RSS. However, the draft RSS identifies two broad 'Areas of Search' for sustainable urban extensions, to the north of Gloucester and to the north west of Cheltenham. Both 'Areas of Search' extend into the neighbouring Tewkesbury district and both would require changes to be made to the general extent of the green belt. The draft RSS also indicates possible additions, as well as deletions, to the general extent of the green belt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332W.6/3">The draft RSS is currently at Examination in Public before an independent Panel. The Panel is expectedto submit its report, with recommendations, to Government later this year. The Government will then consider that report and their response to it. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to make a statement at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.2/1">We have no plans to introduce penalties for failure to comply with a completion notice. Completion notices are rare, but effective in most cases. If a completion notice is ignored, the relevant planning permission ceases to be valid, except insofar as it authorises the development already carried out. Any further development carried out after the period specified in the completion notice is over may be liable to enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.2/2">It would be impracticable to give the local planning authority power to compel the completion of a development once started, for example where the developer lacked the finance to complete the work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.2/3">However, a local planning authority may compel the removal of any partially erected buildings by making a discontinuance order under section 102 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. If an order, confirmed by the Secretary of State, is not complied with, the authority can enforce it in accordancewith sections 189 and 190 of the Act. Where a discontinuance order has not been complied with, section 190 of the 1990 Act enables the local planning authority to take the steps required under the order (such as removal of buildings, works or any plant or machinery, or steps to protect the environment), and to recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so from the owner of the land.</p>

	<p pid="a.1340W.2/2">English Partnerships are running the Design for Manufacture competition on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. All English Partnerships' costs are expected to be balanced out by receipts of more than &pound;50 million from the sale of the land. This exceeds the reserve price across this portfolio of sites by more than &pound;3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/3">The competition involved additional costs compared to ordinary site disposals. These costs are for specialist technical advice to ensure the quality of these innovative homes (&pound;470,000), for monitoring and evaluation to learn lessons from the construction phase (&pound;70,000) and for research and information (&pound;136,400). This latter category includes holding a public exhibition attended by over 5,000 people and circulating some 30,000 copies of the document setting out the lessons learnt so far from the competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/4">Part of the competition involved a target construction cost of &pound;60,000 for a high-quality 76.5 sq metre home, with larger and smaller homes being built at a similar cost-efficiency. The competition is creating 10 new mixed communities developments with homes of different sizes and tenures to suit families andsingle people. Overall, 50 per cent. of the homesbeing provided will be affordable, including shared ownership/equity, social housing, low cost home ownership and other supported housing such as for the elderly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/5">I refer the hon. Member to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the answer givento the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1890W, which set out precise details of one of the sites in the competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/6">The other nine sites are at different stages of construction and are spread around the country. The prices of the units for sale will reflect the land value, the local market at the time they go on sale and the equity share as well as the construction cost. In total only about half the homes will be for sale at full market price.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340W.2/7">Based on current sales prices we anticipate that on every site where homes are being sold, there will be homes available at shared ownership or shared equity stakes of between &pound;60,000 and &pound;70,000. The exception is on the Hastings site where all the homes will be for affordable rent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1348W.0/2">The Digital UK/Ofcom Tracker data for Q1 2007 shows that 97 per cent. of people in Copeland are aware of switchover. The indicative awareness figure for those aged 55 plus in Copeland is 98 per cent. compared to 92 per cent. of 16-34 year olds. In addition to working with major charities assisting elderly people such as Age Concern, Digital UK is communicating directly with elderly residents in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.0/3">All households in the area, including older people, have received the Border leaflet, a letter about the switchover, and will receive a leaflet three monthsout with detailed information on how to switch. Households will also receive a reminder one month prior to switchover. Captions are appearing on TV screens to remind people of the date of switchover.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348W.0/4">Developed by the DTI and promoted by Digital UK, the 'digital tick' logo is used by all major electrical retailers and manufacturers to mark digital television equipment (TVs, set-top boxes and recorders). Retailers will be the first port of call for many consumers. Digital UK has developed a Switchover Training scheme for retail staff, which is being used by thousands of staff nationwide. Trained staff can be identified by badges carrying the 'digital tick' logo. All four retailers in the area have agreed to train all their staff in the next one-two months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1349W.2/2">The UK has in place a robust regime for the promotion of effective competition in all markets and for the effective control of mergers. The UK's independent competition regulators, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, have powers to enforce the prohibitions in competition law on anti-competitive agreements and behaviour and to investigate markets and take appropriate action to remedy problems that may exist in those markets. They also have powers to assess the effect of mergers on competition in relevant markets. For mergers involving newspapers or other media enterprises, there is also provision under the Enterprise Act 2002 for the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to intervene in order to require a separate consideration of the effect of the merger on the public interest&mdash;including on the plurality of different persons having control of media enterprises.</p>

Dr. Ian Palmer has been working one day a week at the MAP for nearly a year in addition to duties within the NHS. He will now be employed at the MAP on a full-time basis to see patients referred for mental or general health assessments. Dr. Palmer is a general practitioner and a consultant psychiatrist with a military background. He is supported in his role by his full-time secretary. We will monitor carefully the number of referrals and increase the staff resources, if required.</p>

We do not collect information about the numbers of children whose parents provide education at home, and it would be impractical to do so given the transient nature of some of this type of provision. A recent study on the prevalence of home education in England, conducted by York Consulting estimated that there were around 16,000 children being educated at home that were known to the local authority. We have not made any estimate of the number of home educated children that are not known to their local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.1359W.5/1">It is not possible to establish such data other than as part of a research programme where all animals are slaughtered and the disease status of each animal can be irrefutably established. No such technique is available but immunological tests are considered the best indicator of infected status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.5/2">There are two immunologically based diagnostic tests used in the Great Britain (GB) bovine tuberculosis (bTB) testing programme. The primary screening test for bTB in cattle in the UK (and Ireland) is the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, which is commonly known as the tuberculin &quot;skin test&quot;. In October 2006, the Government extended the use of the gamma interferon (g-IFN) diagnostic blood test, alongside the skin test (as permitted by EU legislation), in certain prescribed circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.5/3">Research shows that when the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in GB there is a one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in any herd. The skin test is designed to detect an immune response at a relatively early stage in the infection process. Therefore, the percentage of test reactors without visible tuberculous lesions is not an indicator of the false positive rate for this test.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.5/4">Various studies have shown that the sensitivity of the skin test (i.e. its ability to identify infected animals as positives) varies between 77 per cent. and 95 per cent., i.e. it can be expected to miss about one or two inevery 10 infected cattle on a single round of testing (10-20 per cent. false negative rate).</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.5/5">For all diagnostic tests there is a trade off between sensitivity and specificity, so different interpretations of the test can be used under different disease situations. Sensitivity is enhanced in herds with post-mortem or culture-confirmed infection by application of severe interpretation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.5/6">With regard to the g-IFN blood test, performance evaluation carried out in a number of countries shows that at the laboratory cut offs used in GB, it has a sensitivity comparable to or marginally better than that of the SICCT (between 73 and 100 per cent., with a median value of about 87 per cent.). Because the two tests detect slightly different sub-groups of infected cattle, by combining the two tests a higher overall sensitivity can be achieved. A trial in GB, established to evaluate the specificity of the blood test, confirmed the findings of previous studies by concluding that the commercially available blood test had a specificity of between 95-97 per cent. (i.e. there is a likelihood that slightly more false positive reactors are identified when the gamma test is applied, as opposed to the skin test). It is for these reasons that the g-IFN blood test cannot be used for routine surveillance and is best used in parallel in infected herds to maximise the detection of infected animals.</p>

	<p pid="a.1360W.2/1">The UK Climate Change programme, revised in 2006, sets out the Government's policies and measures to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions up to 2010. The target to reduce emissions to 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010 was always designed to be stretching and as we have acknowledged, it looks increasingly difficult to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.2/2">Our latest projections, published in the recent Energy White Paper, suggest that our CO2 emissions, including the impact of the EU Emissions Trading scheme, could fall to about 16 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This would represent definite progress towards the domestic target. It would also mean that we had reduced our emissions of the basket of greenhouse gases to more than 23 per cent. below base year levels, a percentage reduction almost double what we are required to achieve under the Kyoto protocol.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.2/3">However, it does show why we need to do much more to reduce emissions. The long-term framework thatthe Climate Change Bill will provide, and the new measures announced in the Energy White Paper, which will further reduce emissions up to 2020, are therefore essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.2/4">If every household, business and community took measures to reduce their CO2 emissions by reducing energy used in the home and in buildings, and by changing how journeys are made, we could stillmake further progress towards our 2010 target. The Government are continuing to encourage and enable those choices and changes in behaviour through initiatives such as the &quot;Act on CO2&quot; campaign, and by funding the work of the Carbon Trust and Energy Saving Trust.</p>

	<p pid="a.1362W.6/1">In Phase I (2005-07) of the EU Emissions Trading scheme (EU ETS), the UK National Allocation plan (NAP) is set to deliver emission savings of 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). For Phase II (2008-12), our cap is set to deliver emission savings of 145 million tonnes of CO2 over a five year period. Overall, the EU member states have to date emitted around 220MtCO2 below the total cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.6/2">The results to date have shown the trading mechanism and institutional framework is viable and functioning as envisaged. We believe this is a solid base on which to build for the future. In the UK, compliance has been excellent. In 2006, all operators surrendered sufficient allowances within the deadlines. There have been no successful legal challenges to the national distribution of allowances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.6/3">In Phase II, the cap on the total number of allowances allocated to installations in the UK will be 246.17 million allowances (tonnes of CO2) each year. The EU ETS however, is a trading scheme and under the scheme rules, operators may emit more or less than the allocated amount and purchase or sell allowances to meet their requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1371W.5/2">Action to reduce the amount of waste produced in the first instance is driven by regional and local strategies and supported by nationally funded programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/3">The amount of waste collected from households per head is measured under local authority (LA) best value performance indicator (BVPI) 84a. BVPIs have statutory performance targets and are monitored by the Audit Commission. As a standardised suite of performance indicators, BVPIs help central Government and the public to monitor, analyse and compare the achievements of LAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/4">In addition, the Government are providing funding and support to LAs to help them promote and develop more sustainable waste management practices such as recycling, reuse and waste minimisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/5">The Waste Minimisation Programme, run bythe DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), is working to stem the growth of household waste. This is part of a package of measures to enable the UK to meet the requirements of the Landfill Directive and move towards sustainable waste management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/6">As part of its Waste Minimisation Programme, WRAP is working with 13 major retailers to reduce the amount of waste from supermarkets. This includes looking at ways to redesign packaging, as well as providing support for research and development into waste minimisation. It is also working with LAs to establish greater participation in recycling and home composting. This is achieved by WRAP through a variety of means, for example through LA advice and training; food waste collection trials with selected authorities; funding support for campaigns to boost recycling participation in local areas; and a targeted National Home Composting Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/7">LAs have also received &pound;45 million in 2005-06,&pound;105 million in 2006-07 and &pound;110 million in 2007-08 under the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant to help them develop new and more efficient ways to deliver waste reduction and increase recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/8">The recently published Waste Strategy 2007 puts forward a range of measures to further reduce waste arisings and build on recent improvements in recycling. A greater focus on waste prevention has been recognised through a new target to reduce the amount of household waste not reused, recycled or composted, from over 22.2 million tonnes in 2000 by 29 per cent. to 15.8 million tonnes in 2010, with an aspiration to reduce it to 12.2 million tonnes in 2020&mdash;a reduction of 45 per cent. This is equivalent to a fall of 50 per cent. per person (from 450 kilograms per person in 2000 to 225 kilograms in 2020). The strategy also sets higher national targets for household waste recycling and composting to reach at least 40 per cent. by 2010,45 per cent. by 2015 and 50 per cent. by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.5/9">There are no specific penalties to encourage LAs to reduce their collected waste volumes. The Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme (LATS) places limits on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste that authorities can landfill. LAs that exceed limits are liable to a penalty of &pound;150 per tonne. Minimising municipal waste arisings helps LAs meet their LATS obligations and so avoid incurring penalties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1372W.2/1">The Government strongly supports the composting of organic waste. This is an important component of meeting targets for recycling and composting, as well as those under the landfill directive to reduce the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1372W.2/2">Composting of green waste is classified as awaste recovery operation under the waste framework directive and is carried out under a waste management license issued by the Environment Agency (EA) or a registered exemption from the need for a license. The EA is the competent authority responsible for carrying out regular inspections on such sites, including those in Bedfordshire, to assess compliance with the license conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1372W.2/3">Sites operating under a waste management licence must recover or dispose of waste without causing harm to human health or pollution of the environment. This includes causing a nuisance through noise or odour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1372W.2/4">The EU Animal By-Products Regulation also applies to the composting of some materials. The regulation permits low-risk animal by-products ('Category 3' material) to be composted or treated in an approved composting or biogas plant and treated to an EU standard. Alternative treatment standards are due to be introduced later this year. However, these must demonstrate the capability to meet a specified level of pathogen reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1372W.2/5">In addition, the DEFRA funded Business Resource Efficiency and Waste programme (BREW), the Waste and Resources Action programme (WRAP) and the EA have developed a quality protocol for compost in consultation with industry and other interested parties. The protocol sets criteria for, and allows, the full recovery, production and use of quality compost from waste organic materials without the need for further regulation beyond the point of production.</p>

This work led to the publication of the Entec Report: &quot;A sustainability impact study of additional housing scenarios in England&quot;, in December 2005. The comprehensive package of environmental measures announced as part of the Government's response to the Barker review was informed by this analysis. Close inter-departmental liaison is ongoing.</p>

We understand that they are a temporary measure to create secure neighbourhoods as part of a much wider range of measures being takenas part of the Iraqi-led Baghdad security plan. This plan, and the increase in US troop numbers in and around Baghdad, are designed to improve the security situation in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.1375W.6/2">It is too early to judge the success of the plan, not least because not all the additional US military units are in place. However, early indications show some signs for encouragement. Whilst the incidence of high profile suicide attacks remains of deep concern, other forms of sectarian violence are below pre-plan levels and the Iraqi security forces have so far performed well. Ultimately, efforts to improve security in Baghdadare designed to create the conditions in which Iraqis themselves can make progress on reconciliationand power-sharing, and we continue to provide encouragement and practical support to this process.</p>

The ACPP has also provided funding for UK military training teams based in Africa to support pre-deployment training for approximately 4,000 AMIS peacekeepers drawn from Nigeria, Rwanda, Ghana and Gambia.

The ACPP has subsequently funded work to help the AU explain the benefits of the DPA to the people of Darfur, and for an expert to support the AU in preparing the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation.

On behalf of the EU the presidency, through its Ambassadorsor local representatives, has engaged directly with governments in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region to express the EU's concern at human rights abuses within Zimbabwe, which many African Governments share. The EU troika held a formal dialogue with South Africa on<phrase class="date" code="2007-05-14">14 May</phrase> at which Ministers discussed Zimbabwe. Both sides agreed that meaningful internal dialogue in Zimbabwe is crucial to the resolution of the crisis. The EU troika met with the African Union (AU) delegation at ministerial level on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May</phrase>. The AU noted its continuing support for the SADC initiative and President Mbeki's role. The EU awaits the outcome of this initiative with interest and will return to the situation in Zimbabwe at the UN Human Rights Council in September, following the EU statement in March condemning state-sponsored violence. The UK will continue to ensure that opportunities available at EU level are taken to raise the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe and to highlight the EU's condemnation of ongoing political violence and human rights abuses.</p>

Where we receive sufficient and accurate information concerning the presence of those children and family members in the UK, we actively investigate the sources of financing for their study and presence to see whether it breaches the terms of the asset freeze under the EU's targeted measures.

	<p pid="a.1384W.5/1">The Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD) incidents panel advises on the assessment and management of risk to patients who may potentially have been exposed to CJD following medical interventions. In December 2003, following the first suspected case of variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Diseases (vCJD) transmission through whole blood transfusion, the first patient notification exercise was undertaken to notify recipients of blood components donated by people who later developed vCJD. There are currently around 24 people in this group who are still alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/2">Since then, three other notification exercises have been implemented in respect of recipients of certain plasma products. There are approximately 5,000 people in this group, which includes patients with haemophilia A and B and Von Willebrand's Disease to whom it was indicated that they had received United Kingdom sourced plasma derived vCJD implicated products during the period 1980-2001, and would therefore be considered at risk of vCJD for public health purposes. Additionally notification has been given to about 100 blood donors to patients who later developed vCJD.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.5/3">All the information documents used for these notification exercises are available on the Health Protection Agency website at:</p>

However, NHS Direct, NHS Direct on line and NHS Direct interactive have been established to provide advice and information on health and self-care. Through these services, people suffering from hay fever have access to information to help them manage their condition and minimise their exposure to pollen.

The Mobile Phone Crime Reduction Charter was launched by industry leaders in July 2006 and successfully achieved its target of blocking over 80 per cent. of stolen handsets within48 hours. The Government and Metropolitan police fund a National Mobile Phone Crime Unit to provide a national centre of excellence and operational support around the country. We have robust legislation in place to target criminals who re-programme stolen handsets. The Government are continuing to engage industry on the issue of better crime proofing handsets as they become increasingly multi-functional in the future.</p>

During a six week grace period from March-May 2007, 200,000 refugees returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan with assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Statistics indicate that Kabul, Nangahar and Kunduz are absorbing the largest number of returnees at 51 per cent. UNHCR state they are coping well with the influx of returnees and are facilitating safe returns, which includes addressing any problems returnees may face on their journey back to Afghanistan, and providing any support once they have arrived at their final destination.</p>

	<p pid="a.1399W.7/4">Severe weather conditions like the recent rains and snow melt in Helmand caused considerable flooding. The Provincial Government response was supportedby the UN, which has provided assistance to 735 households (5,145 people).

One of the intended project outcomes is an increased local capacity for sustainable environmental management, achieved through improved community skills for good environmental management; better planning by communities of the use of their local natural resources; and the introduction of energy-efficient technologies and community forestry initiatives to reduce the demand for wood for fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.2/2">DFID has also provided a grant of &pound;580,000 over three years to the non-governmental organisation Forest Trends, to assess the impacts of the Chinese timber market throughout SE Asia, including in Burma. Copies of their reports are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1400W.2/4">The British Embassy in Rangoon has recently provided a grant of &pound;32,000 from the Grassroots Development Programme (GDP) fund to support seven environmental projects in Burma. The main objectives of the projects are to enhance village livelihoods through an improved management of agriculture, natural resource and agro forestry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1401W.5/2"><i> </i>The heading &quot;grants and other aid in kind&quot; is used for statistical purposes to classify DFID bilateral assistance which is not covered by the main aid-type categories such as financial aid (including budget support), technical co-operation and humanitarian assistance. In addition to funding for partnership programme agreements and other civil society organisations this category will include, amongst other things, a growing proportion of DFID bilateral support which is disbursed through international institutions and multilateral organisations. This funding is additional to core contributions to these organisations which are reported separately. For example in Sudan, DFID has committed &pound;47 million over three years to two multi-donor trust funds administered through the World Bank. But, in general, projects and programmes coded under this heading are too diverse to provide a meaningful summary or an isolated cause for the overall increase. However, DFID is in the process of reassessing the way it categorises this element of its aid programme to provide a more useful breakdown for users in future reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.1406W.3/17">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register may not have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2005.</p>

Member to the replies I gave her on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June 2007</phrase>, <i> Official R</i><i> eport</i>, column 1266W, covering the question of amending the Nightwear (Safety) Regulations 1985 to make it compulsory for children's pyjamas to meet the flammability requirements of the regulations. Regarding the reason for differentiating between pyjamas and nightdresses, a line was drawn between them on the basis that nightdresses involve free-flowing designs which are more likely to catch light from open fires. Nightdresses which comply with the flammability test of the regulations tend to be made from man-made fibres such as polyester. Pyjamas and nightdresses made from cotton would need to be treated with flame retardant chemicals in order to pass the same test. Such chemicals can affect the feel and comfortability of the fabric, and could pose problems for allergy sufferers. It is important to note that even chemically treated fabrics, and those with natural flame resistance, will not be completely safe from ignition, so parental guidance and supervision has a key role here, too. Legislation has to seek to provide a balance between appropriate levels of fire safety and health/comfortability requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1416W.8/2"><i> </i>The most recent estimates are based on the Maternity and Paternity rights and benefits in Britain: Survey of Parents, conducted in 2005. The survey is based on a random sample of mothers who had a baby in December 2003 and their partners. Of mothers in paid work, all took at least some of their entitlement to maternity leave, and 98 per cent. received some form of maternity pay; approximately 2 per cent. of mothers in paid work did not receive maternity pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1416W.8/3">Of fathers in paid work, 93 per cent. said they had taken some leave around the time of the birth. Of these, around 80 per cent. said they had used at least some of their statutory paid paternity leave entitlement which was brought in 2003. The remainder took other forms of leave. No estimate has been made of the take-up of unpaid paternity, although almost all fathers who qualify for paternity leave will also qualify for Statutory Paternity leave.</p>

	<p pid="a.1416W.11/2">DTI has not identified any locations for new nuclear power stations. Any new nuclear power stations would be built by the private sector but no decisions would be taken on any potential location for a new nuclear power station pending the carrying out of a full strategic siting assessment (SSA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1416W.11/3">DTI is consulting on a proposed process for carrying out an SSA. If the Government confirms its preliminary view that it is in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations, DTI would consult separately on the siting criteria that would underpin such an assessment. Such criteria would include demographic considerations, including with regard to population density and distribution. In addition to the SSA, any proposed new nuclear sites would need to comply with the rigorous site-specific safety and environmental requirements of the independent regulators.</p>

	<p pid="a.1417W.3/2">Following consultation with the hon. Member, the question will be answered with respect to nuclear material unaccounted for (MUF). MUF is the inventory difference that occurs when the result of a physical inventory of nuclear material is compared with the book inventory. The difference may be negative (an apparent loss) or positive (an apparent gain). MUF is a recognised feature of accounting for nuclear material at processing plants and is caused primarily by the uncertainties inherent in the techniques used to measure nuclear material. An explanation of MUF is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1417W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/safeguards/muf.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/safeguards/muf.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1417W.3/4">There should be no such MUF for nuclear power stations. Nuclear material in the form of discrete items (fuel elements) is added to the inventory on receipt at the power station site and subtracted from that inventory when fuel is shipped from the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1417W.3/5">Nuclear materials balance figures for UK sites where nuclear material is processed, and hence MUF arises, are published annually. For figures since 1974, I refer the hon. Member to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the answer given to the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-15">15 June 2004</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 820W.

This includes encouraging the greater use in public sector construction projects of recycled demolition waste rather than virgin aggregates. WRAP's target for its 2006-08 business plan is for &pound;10 billion worth of construction projects to set requirements for waste minimisation, recycling and recycled content. WRAP is making good progress towards achieving this target, and is working with other programmes to ensure that these commitments are put into effect.</p>
