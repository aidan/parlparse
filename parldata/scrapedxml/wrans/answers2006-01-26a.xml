We regularly raise our concerns with the Burmese authorities. We believe if Burma is to attain the State Peace and Development Council's (SPDC) stated goal of becoming a 'modern, developed and democratic nation', and promote successful national reconciliation, this will require a more open and inclusive political process than is currently being pursued by the SPDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.2236W.12/2">We are particularly concerned that there is an increasing risk of a breakdown of relations between the SPDC and a number of ethnic ceasefire groups, including the Shan, Kachin, and Mon. We believe that the SPDC should take steps to restore confidence with these groups, inter alia through the immediate release of the Shan leaders who received heavy sentences in 2005, and an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the killing by SPDC troops of five Kachin Independence Organisation members and a civilian on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-02">2 January</phrase>.</p>

Years of conflict, exacerbated by the collapse of the state and chronic poverty, have resulted in abuses of humanitarian standards and insufficient government funds to maintain prisons. We have repeatedly called on the DRC authorities to respect international humanitarian law and Human Rights Conventions.

	<p pid="a.2241W.6/1">As G8 lead nation on counter narcotics in Afghanistan, the UK and the international community are supporting the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) to deliver their National Drug Control Strategy and to bring about a sustainable reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium. To that end, the UK spent &pound;24,442,350 on counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan in 2004&ndash;05. This included the running of seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter Narcotics Police, support for interdiction operations, resulting in major seizures of opiates, the provision of a mobile forensic laboratory and help to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.</p>
	<p pid="a.2241W.6/2">Over the next three financial years, the UK is providing more than &pound;270 million. This is a funding increase, agreed by the Domestic and Overseas Policy Cabinet Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>, of &pound;115 million. &pound;130 million of the funding will be provided by the Department for International Development, with the rest coming from other Government Departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. In this three year period, we will focus on the following three key priorities, which we judge will make the greatest impact: targeting the trafficker and the top end of the drugs trade; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihood opportunities; and developing strong and effective counter narcotics institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2241W.6/3">In November 2005, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed the poppy cultivation figures for 2004&ndash;05 from their annual survey. UNODC reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&ndash;04 (production of 4,200 metric tonnes) to 104,000 ha in 2004&ndash;05 (4,100 metric tonnes). Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for the increased yield. While there remains a risk that cultivation may increase again this year, our goal is to ensure that the downward trend in cultivation is maintained in the long term. We are working hard with the GoA and other international partners to ensure that it is able to deliver on this goal.</p>

We have received no representations in the past 12 months on behalf of prisoners released into the community as part of the gacaca process. Fears among the population about the punishments believed to be meted out by gacaca courts led to around 15,000 Rwandans fleeing to neighbouring countries in the past six months.

Ms McDermott appealed the decision but, as the appeal was held after the date of the conference, the appeal therefore became obsolete. She was deported on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-02">2 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2244W.2/2">Ms McDermott has previously tried to enter the Occupied Territories in May 2005 and was refused for the same reasons. In June 2005, Our Deputy Head of Mission wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Ms McDermott's behalf, asking for her to be allowed to enter Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.2268W.5/1">The Government note the decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and will, of course, follow the guidance it has given. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will now consider the detail of the ruling in order to determine the extent to which it applies to their previous decisions. The amounts claimed as recoverable VAT by the three traders total almost &pound;40 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2268W.5/2">It is not possible to give a precise figure of the total amount that may be repaid to all traders affected by the decision, as the status of each case is being reviewed in the light of the ECJ's guidance and other action to protect the revenue may be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.2268W.5/3">The Government remain determined to tackle Missing Trader Intra Community (MTIC) VAT fraud and the criminals perpetrating it. HMRC is intensifying its operational activities throughout the UK and its cooperation with other countries to combat this fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.2268W.5/4">In order to strengthen further our strategy to combat VAT fraud, the Government have made an application to the European Commission (EC) for a derogation from the provisions of the EC sixth VAT directive to enable it to introduce a reverse charge procedure for transactions between VAT-registered businesses in certain goods. The Government consider this measure to be a proportionate response to MTIC fraud. This is only one facet of a comprehensive strategy designed to thwart MTIC fraud by taking the criminal profit out of the transaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.2268W.5/5">This measure will be targeted on those goods used in MTIC fraud, in particular mobile telephones, computer chips and some other similar electronic items. However, the Government will also be monitoring very closely how those carrying out this fraud react to this measure and will not hesitate to act to prevent any further threats to the tax system.</p>
