Regrettably overfishing has occurred in the past and it is something we wish to avoid in the future. As a result, the UK will argue that a reformed common fisheries policy must be better suited to ensure the rational exploitation of fisheries resources and that sustainability is paramount in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.955W.9/2">Nutrient runoff, whether from agricultural or other sources, represents a serious risk to the health of our waters and the oceans.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.9/3">The Government are committed to ensuring that farmers have access to the best available advice on good nutrient management. This will make sure that nutrients&#8212;from both mineral and organic fertilisers&#8212;are managed in a way that optimises their uptake by crops, and minimises their loss to the environment. The trend over the last 14 years shows an overall reduction in the amount of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus applied to land. However, the standard of nutrient management in the UK needs to continue to improve if farming is to become more competitive and profitable, and produce more food in a way that protects the environment and biodiversity and uses natural resources sustainably.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.9/4">We are acting to implement the requirements under EU and UK laws to achieve good ecological status in our waters, and ensure that the UK's drinking water supply is of a consistently high quality. We are constantly reviewing policy on this area; nutrient runoff was identified as an issue in the Natural Environment White Paper, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June</phrase>. We committed to:</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.9/5">&#8220;develop a strategy to identify and address the most significant diffuse sources of water pollution from non-agricultural sources.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.9/6">As I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-23">23 March</phrase>, the Government intend to use a new catchment-based approach to implementing the River Basin Management Plans that are required under the water framework directive. The Environment Agency has established 10 pilot test catchments to validate this approach. Measures to help control nutrient runoff from farms are included in the &#163;110 million funding announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-13">13 April</phrase>. This includes some capital grants for farmers in certain areas under the Catchment Sensitive Farming project.</p>

Our Estimate for 2011-12 was recently approved by the Speaker's Committee for the IPSA, although the Committee put &#163;16.572m of the Estimate in reserve in anticipation that demand will fall short of the full budgetary provision available.</p>

I am watching closely the progress of ongoing discussions between the various parties, but especially in those cases where no deal has yet, been agreed in principle. Although it is better for both sides to come to agreement between themselves, rather than have political interference, all options remain open to me. However, time is moving on and I am expecting significant progress in the next three months to get the remaining deals agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.969W.0/1">Following consultation with the rail industry and passenger groups, the Government decided to maintain the decision taken in 2009 by the previous Administration to exempt domestic services from the non-core elements of the Rail Passengers' Rights and Obligations Regulation for a period of five years up to December 2014. We believe that the marginal benefits of fully extending the pan-European regime to domestic passengers would be outweighed by the costs to Government and industry. It would also conflict with our intention to reduce regulatory burdens and with our franchise reform agenda. The UK already has a well-established regime for protecting the rights of domestic rail passengers, including by providing assistance to persons with reduced mobility and disabilities, protecting passengers in case of delay and ensuring a convenient handling of their claims in case of an accident.</p>

This will help communities to challenge local service providers on issues such as speed limits. Decisions on speed limits should be based upon comprehensive analysis of all the costs and benefits.

	<p pid="a.975W.7/2">Queries have been raised about the 2010/11 funding allocations to Academies in North Yorkshire and Hampshire local authorities, and we are looking into these issues. No Academies in North Yorkshire have been allocated funding under the Building Schools for the Future programme. In Hampshire, Havant Academy had its capital allocation reviewed as part of the curtailment of BSF, and was awarded funding in December 2010.</p>

In 2011/12, which is a transitional year, the majority of young people in their second or third year of study who might be expected to apply for a bursary will be supported via the national administration arrangements. As a result, the amount that will be allocated directly to schools, colleges and training providers is less than the full value of the 16-19 Bursary Fund. The allocation has been calculated so as to enable schools, colleges and training providers to pay guaranteed bursaries to all young people in vulnerable groups, discretionary bursaries to young people in their first year of post-16 study, and 'top up' weekly payments to those who are currently in receipt of EMA should they consider it appropriate to do so.</p>

Schools are required to teach a broad and balanced curriculum, which may include such skills, but they are free to use their professional judgment on how this is organised and delivered. Building on the statutory curriculum, which is comprised of the basic school curriculum and National Curriculum, we believe it should be for individual schools to determine a curriculum structure that best meets the needs of their pupils.</p>

New programmes of study for any other subjects that are to form part of the new national curriculum will be made available to schools by September 2013, with teaching in maintained schools from September 2014. Beyond this, the review will also advise on matters relating to the implementation of the new national curriculum as described in its remit.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.8/2">The call for evidence for phase 1 of the review closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-14">14 April</phrase> and we are currently analysing responses. The call for evidence summary report will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.8/3">The review is continuing its work to analyse curricular design in the most successful international education jurisdictions, and is feeding that analysis into the development of new programmes of study for English, mathematics, science and physical education. At the same time it is also considering which other subjects should continue to feature in the national curriculum. It is our intention to publish our proposals early next year, in line with the published timetable.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.2/3">Your recent parliamentary questions have been passed to me, as Her Majesty&#8217;s Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/4">As the regulator for childcare in England, Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children&#8217;s Services and Skills, receives a significant number of concerns or complaints about people running childcare or day nursery businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/5">Ofsted&#8217;s role as a regulator is not to prove or disprove the information provided by complainants. Instead, our responsibility is to consider, in the light of that information, whether the provider is failing to meet, or failed to meet at the time of any incident, the requirements and conditions of their registration. We investigate all concerns raised with us in order to determine whether the provider has breached requirements, and we take action where we find this to be the case. For these reasons we do not hold data that specifically addresses the queries raised. We do not record complaints as founded or unfounded, and neither do we know whether or not a complaint was made maliciously.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/6">Some additional background may be helpful. Between <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, Ofsted looked into 8,750 concerns or complaints received against registered (and unregistered) childcare providers in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/7">In 4,997 cases we found that the provider was meeting all the requirements for continued registration and it was not necessary for us to take any further action. 1,638 cases were referred to other agencies, including the local authority and the Police. The most common type of referral in such cases was to Local Authority Designated Officers (LADOs) to ensure that appropriate safeguarding action could be taken. Various degrees of enforcement action were taken in the other cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/8">A copy of this reply has been sent to Sarah Teather MP, Minister of State for Children and Families, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

Pupils learn to develop the skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic first aid procedures, including, at key stage 4 (ages 15 to 16), resuscitation techniques.</p>

The teaching of religious education remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling.

The ITT target for religious education for courses starting in 2011/12 is 460. The ITT targets beyond this, including religious education, have not yet been assessed but will continue to take account of a number of factors including decreasing secondary pupil numbers. The number of teachers that schools employ in future years will, as now, be a matter for them to decide, according to local needs and subject to statutory requirements on class sizes where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.0/1">The errors that have come to light in GCSEs and A Levels are extremely serious and are unacceptable. As the regulator of awarding organisations and the qualifications they offer, the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) have taken swift and robust action to hold awarding organisations to account for these mistakes, and to check that any mistakes in as yet untaken exams are identified and put right. Ofqual will also be checking the awarding organisations' arrangements for securing redress, to ensure they are fair both to the candidates who were directly affected, and those who were not. The Secretary of State for Education has had regular updates from the chief executive of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, on Ofqual's current action. He has also asked to be kept informed about further steps they will be taking to ensure that awarding organisations do not repeat these mistakes. Fiona Pethick, Director of Regulation at Ofqual has written to the hon. Member providing further details and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Fiona Pethick, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-28">28 June 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/3">I am responding to your parliamentary questions on behalf of Glenys Stacey, the Chief Executive of the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual). Ofqual is the independent regulator of qualifications, examinations and assessments in England and of vocational qualifications in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/4">You will be aware that a number of your parliamentary questions relating to errors in this summer's examination papers have been passed from the Secretary of State to Ofqual to answer as they fall within our regulatory remit. These errors in examination papers are unacceptable and Ofqual is taking action to understand the root cause, ensure candidates affected get as fair a result as possible, and to consider what changes may be needed in future to awarding organisation processes and procedures. Later this week we will be publishing details of our inquiry into these errors.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/5">There are three particular areas where Ofqual is not in a position to answer your questions. First, we do not hold information about which specific individual or centre identified the error. Secondly, we do not hold information about the dates on which checks on examination papers were made, nor do we hold information about the numbers of papers that were or were not re-checked. (Both, ref PQ nos: 62551, 62553, 62552, 62554, 62555, 62556, 62563, 62568,). Thirdly it is not possible to estimate the maximum and average difference to a mark issued as each situation is different. (Ref PQ: 62566).</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/6">Where we are in a position to answer your questions, I have grouped our responses below by theme.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/7">Action Ofqual has taken</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/8">(Ref PQ no: 62561)</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June</phrase> Ofqual wrote to all GCSE and A level awarding organisations to require them to carry out additional quality checks on examinations that had yet to be taken. Each awarding organisation provided Ofqual with written assurances by <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-13">13 June</phrase> that such additional quality checks had been made or would be made before papers were taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/10">When it became apparent that further, avoidable, errors had occurred, I visited OCR to discuss these errors. Glenys Stacey and I also met with the Chief Executive Officers of the Awarding Organisations delivering GCSEs and GCEs last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/11">We have published two statements on our website - one specifically aimed at candidates and another setting out the action we are taking. Ofqual has also published a detailed list of the specific examination papers that have been affected so that candidates can know whether or not they are affected and to know which awarding organisation to contact if they wish for further information.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.0/12">We have announced that we will publish, this week, information about our inquiry into the errors this summer to establish all the facts, identify the root causes and make recommendations for action to help ensure, so far as possible, that such avoidable errors do not happen in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.0/16">The following papers taken by candidates in England had errors in them which were not identified and corrected before the paper was taken. The notification dates are also included.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.2/1">The Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" name="Michael Gove">the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, has held no meetings with third parties outside Government on this issue. The Secretary of State spoke to Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual on Tuesday 21st, Wednesday 22nd, Friday 24th and Saturday 25th June on this matter. The Secretary of State's office does not provide minutes of such meetings, which are based on the provision on private advice to Ministers. I met Andrew Hall, chief executive of AQA informally at a conference organised by Reform on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-28">Tuesday 28 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.2/2">The Department does not collect information on the individual examination papers chosen by schools, or on their conduct of examinations.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.2/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-09">9 June</phrase>, two examination question errors have been reported to the Department. In addition one printing error, which had implications for the majority of questions on a GCSE mathematics paper, has been reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.2/4">The errors that have been identified are unacceptable, and the examination awarding bodies concerned must take full responsibility for measures to ensure that candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged by the errors, and to ensure that it does not happen again. In doing so they must satisfy Ofqual that they are taking appropriate action to mitigate the impact of these errors.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.2/5">To date, Ofqual is concentrating its efforts on the steps awarding organisations need to take now to ensure there are no further mistakes in this summer's series and make sure that awarding bodies are putting in place arrangements for securing redress, to ensure they are fair both to the candidates who were directly affected, and those who weren't. It is extremely important that effective steps are taken to limit the impact on students' marks and grades, and maintain standards overall. Such redress aims to make good so far as is possible. Wider redress measures are broadly a matter for awarding organisations and they have been encouraged by Ofqual to be transparent with candidates about these.</p>

	<p pid="a.991W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-24">24 June 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/3">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/4">Since 2005, maintained school inspections have been carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Ofsted records all judgements made by Inspectors in section 5 inspections, including the judgement for overall effectiveness of the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/5">Maintained schools inspected under section 5 include nursery, primary, secondary (including academies and city technology colleges), special schools and pupil referral units.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/6">Table A below shows the number of maintained schools judged to be outstanding for overall effectiveness at their section 5 inspection during the academic years 2005/06 to 2009/10 inclusive in Kent local authority and Dartford constituency. Equivalent data have also been provided for England for context, and the table shows the total number of inspections in each of these areas in each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/7">In September 2009, Ofsted implemented a policy of more proportionate inspection using risk assessment as an aid to scheduling the inspection of good and outstanding schools. We deliberately set out to inspect a greater proportion of previously satisfactory or inadequate schools each year and a smaller proportion of previously good or outstanding schools. The sample of schools inspected is therefore skewed and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the very different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/8">Statistics covering the outcomes of all inspections carried out in each academic year since 2005/06 can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/9"><a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Documents-by-type/Statistics/Maintained-schools/Inspection-outcomes">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Documents-by-type/Statistics/Maintained-schools/Inspection-outcomes</a></p>

In May, myself and officials met with key industry and resident partners, and officials met separately with local authority partners and representatives of holiday caravan owners, to help inform the consultation and gain a better understanding of the expectations and aspirations of our partners in this sector of the housing market.

The Government have brought forward amendments to the Bill for consideration by the House of Lords at Report Stage in that House. These amendments would extend the eligibility criteria by allowing a person who has previously held the office of constable to be appointed.

	<p pid="a.1006W.9/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what the incidence of cancer was in each (a) constituency, (b) primary care trust area, (c) hospital trust area, (d) region and (e) social demographic group in the most recent period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.9/4">The latest available figures for newly diagnosed cases of cancer (incidence) are for the year 2008. Please note that these numbers may not be the same as the number of people diagnosed with cancer, because one person may be diagnosed with more than one cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.9/5">The tables provide the number of newly diagnosed cases of cancer in each parliamentary constituency (Table 1), primary care organisation (Table 2) and region in England for the year 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.9/6">Copies of Tables 1 and 2 have been placed in the House of Commons library. Table 3 is included in this answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006W.9/7">ONS does not publish figures on cancer incidence by hospital trust area or social demographic group. NHS hospital trusts are commissioned by primary care organisations to provide health services. Whilst primary care organisations have geographical boundaries, hospital trusts do not. Information on cancer incidence by social demographic group is not available, as this information is not routinely recorded on individual cancer registrations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice has plans to generate low carbon energy from its estate which we can export to the grid. In association with Partnerships for Renewables the National Offender Management Service's planning application for wind energy generation at Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, was approved in May 2011. Partnerships for Renewables will discharge the planning conditions for this project during 2011-12 with site preparation and construction scheduled for early 2013.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021W.3/1">Management information held centrally indicates that there are at least 245 voluntary and community sector organisations, social enterprises and charities which support the rehabilitation of offenders in prisons, and 79 private sector organisations supporting rehabilitation activities in prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021W.6/1">There are approximately 3,700 incidents reported annually in open prisons and prisons with an open element. These are reported on the HM Prison Service Incident Reporting System.

	<p pid="a.1022W.2/2">The first payment by results pilot was launched in September 2010, the Social Impact Bond at HMP Peterborough. Other pilots have been agreed and will commence shortly. This includes pilot local approaches to reduce demand for criminal justice services in London and Manchester and a pilot at HMP Doncaster that will aim to reduce the reoffending of released offenders. The formal start date of these pilots is due to be July 2011 and October 2011 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.2/3">As sufficient offenders have not yet passed through the scheme, it is too early to assess of the effectiveness of the Social Impact Bond in reducing demand for offender services. A report by RAND Europe on the set up of the HMP Peterborough pilot was published last month and an interim report on the first cohort of offenders through the pilot is expected in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.5/1">There are no current plans to commission research into the reading ability of prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.5/2">However, in 2010 the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, working closely together with the Ministry of Justice, did commission a scoping study to explore the feasibility of undertaking a survey of prisoners and offenders in the community to examine their literacy and numeracy levels. The study concluded that while it would be possible to measure the skills levels of adult custody and community offenders as well as young offenders in custody, robustly sampling young offenders in the community would be difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.5/3">Neither the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills nor the Ministry of Justice currently have funding set aside to undertake a basic skills survey of offenders in the current financial year. However, this work will be considered against other policy priorities in future research-planning rounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1027W.2/1">Responsibility for this issue is devolved to the governments of the Overseas Territories. However the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is working with the Department for Energy and Climate Change to ensure support to the Overseas Territories, in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprints. Funding from the joint FCO-Department for International Development and Overseas Territories Environment Programme has been used in support of renewable energy initiatives. I raised this issue during the Overseas Territories Consultative Council in November last year, to which all the leaders and premiers from the Overseas Territories were invited.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034W.2/1">We are aware that there have been attempts to destroy the tunnels in Gaza. The UK recognises that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/2">We remain clear that the situation in Gaza is both a tragedy and unsustainable. While there is no humanitarian crisis, there is an enduring need for humanitarian aid. We have also been clear that actions by both Israel and Hamas have contributed to this situation. Working closely with the EU and Quartet, we continue to call on Israel to ease restrictions on access and enable a return to economic normality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.2/3">Israel's decision to move from a list of 120 permitted goods to a list of specific prohibited items was a positive step. However there has been no fundamental change in the crossings regime and economic stagnation and de-development in Gaza remain the norm. We are clear that more needs to be done, particularly to enable exports, accelerate key imports for reconstruction and ensure free movement of people. Without economic growth in Gaza, there is a risk of fostering a more broadly radicalised environment. An improved economy and a resurgence of Gaza's pragmatic business fraternity are not only essential for the people of Gaza, but are also firmly in Israel's security interests.</p>

We were encouraged by the communiqu&#233; following the recent Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit in Sandton, which re-emphasised the importance of free and fair elections under conditions of a level playing field. As guarantor of the Global Political Agreement, SADC has an important role to play in helping Zimbabwe to make progress towards such elections.

	<p pid="a.1037W.9/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Noel Shanahan</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what powers the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has to identify the whereabouts of absent fathers who (a) regularly travel to and from the UK (b) have recently been in prison and (c) have been granted asylum in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/5">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) has jurisdiction, i.e. legal authority, to make a maintenance calculation and collect child support maintenance only when the parent with care, the non-resident parent and the qualifying child are all habitually resident in the United Kingdom (UK). Habitual residence is a legal concept which means more than simply 'where you live'. A person can habitually reside in more than one country or in none. Habitual residence can continue during an absence from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/6">In instances where we have jurisdiction, the Commission can use its information seeking powers enshrined in child support legislation<sup>(1)</sup> to identify and trace the non-resident parent. Caseworkers can use a range of tools to trace non-resident parents; For example our Common Enquiry Service enables caseworkers to consider information from Income Support; Incapacity Benefit/Severe Disablement Allowance/Maternity Allowance; Working Families Tax Credits and Job Seekers Allowance systems. If the Caseworker is unable to locate a non-resident parent using the Common Enquiry Service, they will use a system that provides links to credit reference agency data. Caseworkers can also approach the HM Revenue and Customs to request a search on their tax and other databases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/7">Although, the powers to obtain information to identify and trace a non-resident are now given to the Commission, it is the Child Support Agency (the operating arms of the Commission) that currently exercises them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/8">Whilst not powers specifically, relating to tracing non-resident parents, the Commission also has further powers to require information to be provided from a range of people or organisations that either have the information in their possession or can reasonably be expected to obtain it. These include powers to require information to be provided from:</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/9">The parties to the case, i.e., the parent with care and the non-resident parent;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/10">An alleged parent that has denied parentage of a child;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/11">Employers;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/12">Companies or partnerships;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/13">Accountants;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/14">Court officials;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/15">Crown employees;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/16">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA);</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/17">Any Agency of the Department for Work and Pensions;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/18">Local authorities;</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/19">Deposit takers&#8212;including banks and building societies; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/20">Gas and electricity providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/21">We presently do not have arrangements in place for tracking non-resident parents who travel into and out of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/22">Where we have evidence that the non-resident parent in question is in prison or has recently been in prison the Commission can make a referral to the Prison Service to access its database to trace the whereabouts of the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/23">Non-resident parents who have been granted asylum in the UK are considered to be legally resident. The Commission can therefore use its powers to trace and identify them for child maintenance purposes as it does any other non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.9/24">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1040W.2/1">Personal independence payment is intended to support people with long-term health conditions or disabilities. A qualifying period of six months helps us achieve this. When taken together with the six month prospective test, the six month qualifying period brings our definition of long-term disability closer in line with that from the Equality Act 2010. As now, people will not always have to wait six months before being paid personal independence payment if some, or all, of the qualifying period has been satisfied by the time they submit their claim.</p>

Some organisations were in favour of our proposals regarding the qualifying period and the fact that it would align with the definition of long-term disability. Others argued against the proposal on the grounds that some health conditions and impairments, such as cancer, have a sudden onset and individuals incur extra costs very soon after diagnosis. The Government's response to the consultation on disability living allowance reform (Cm 8051) includes some representations from organisations on this issue. The document is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

The legislation governing the administration of elections and the Electoral Commission's accompanying guidance provide a platform from which Returning Officers can provide services to electors in a consistent manner. There can also be local factors that affect how elections are delivered and allowing some discretion to Returning Officers can be beneficial.

Those recommendations reduce the number of senior military and civilian posts in the Department. However, Lord Levene recommended retaining the Second Permanent Secretary post&#8212;and the Vice Chief of Defence Staff post&#8212;on the basis that, without them, the loading and span of control on the Permanent Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Staff would be unsustainable. Recognising the amount of change the Department will be embarking on, Lord Levene also recommended that we take stock of progress after about two years and consider whether the proposed structure and role of the Head Office, including the requirement, role and seniority of both the Second Permanent Secretary and the Vice Chief of Defence Staff remain valid.</p>

In the &#8220;Government response to the NHS Future Forum report&#8221;, <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-20">20 June</phrase>, we agreed to retain and strengthen existing networks so that they cover many more areas of specialist care, and to give them a stronger role in commissioning in support of the NHS Commissioning Board and local clinical commissioning groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.2/1">The additional funding for social care has been allocated in two distinct ways, through formula grant to local authorities and from the national health service to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/2">In 2011-12, an additional &#163;530 million was allocated to local government in addition to existing departmental grants for social care. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding was allocated to local authorities through the local government formula grant. Formula grant is not hypothecated for different services and it is therefore not possible to determine how much of the additional funding through local government has been allocated for social care. However, we do receive local authorities&#8217; budgeted spend on adult social care through the revenue accounts data returns in June of each year. This data is publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/3">In addition to funding through formula grant, the Government provided a specific allocation of &#163;648 million to primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2011-12 for measures that support social care, which also benefit health. As part of our planning and assurance processes for 2011-12, we are holding strategic health authorities (SHA) to account for ensuring that arrangements are in place between local authorities and PCTs for the funding to be transferred and objectives for the investment agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/4">Local authorities (LAs) and the NHS have been working together to agree how this funding should be best used to support social care services. NHS planning assurance showed that all SHAs had confirmed there were local plans in place to agree the transfer. We will continue to get information on the progress of the money as the NHS financial reporting year progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/5">In addition to this funding, the Government allocated &#163;150 million to PCTs in 2011-12 to develop local re-ablement services in the context of the post-discharge support plans submitted to SHAs last December. It is for PCTs and LAs locally to agree the plans for this funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/6">In 2010-11, by making efficiency savings to central programmes, the Department made available an extra &#163;162 million to local health and care services to spend in 2010-11 on front-line services. In addition, &#163;70 million was made available for re-ablement services in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/7">The breakdown of the &#163;162 million 2010-11 and &#163;648 million 2011-12 allocations to PCTs for social care can be found in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.6/1">The parliamentary ombudsman recommended that the aim of the payment scheme should be</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.6/3">The Government have accepted that those who invested in Equitable Life from September 1992 may have suffered relative loss as a result of maladministration. That is on the basis that September 1992 was the earliest date by which the regulatory returns they may have used to inform their decision to invest would have been different if maladministration had not occurred, and therefore that they might have decided to invest their funds in another company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.6/4">This was not the case for with profit annuitants who invested prior to September 1992, and therefore no loss calculations have been done for these with profit annuitants on a similar basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.2/2">Where carers have the primary responsibility for bringing up a child, there is UK-wide financial provision through child benefit and child tax credit, which can be paid on the same terms as to a parent. Child benefit and child tax credit guarantee support for the first child of over &#163;4,000 a year for carers on very low incomes. Guardian's allowance can also be paid where both parents are deceased or, in prescribed circumstances, where only one parent is deceased. In order to prevent double provision, this support is not provided where the accommodation or maintenance of a looked-after-child is provided from public funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.5/1">Support for children through the care system is a devolved matter. In England, family and friends carers of looked after children must be approved as foster carers and receive support as other foster carers do. Responsibility for maintaining a looked after child lies with the child's local authority and therefore the cost to the foster carer of caring for the child is paid to them in the form of a fostering allowance. The Government set a national minimum fostering allowance. The fostering allowance should be calculated according to criteria that do not discriminate against foster carers that are related to the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.5/2">Family and friends carers of children who are not looked after by the English local authority may be eligible for child-related benefits, such as child benefit and the child tax credit. In order to prevent double provision, this support is not provided where the accommodation or maintenance of a looked after child is provided from public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1087W.5/3">The Children Act 1989 also allows local authorities in England to provide support, including financial support, to family and friends carers of children who are not looked after, if the child is assessed as being in need. Local authorities may also provide financial support to family and friends carers who hold a residence or special guardianship order or who become adopters. Statutory guidance that came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase> requires English local authorities to have clear and transparent published policies about how they support family and friends carers of children in need in different legal circumstances.</p>
