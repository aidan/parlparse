It was working at initial operating capability (IOC) in early February this year, and by the end of that month was at full operational capability (FOC) with the addition of the telemedicine link capability back to the UK. The link enables experts in the UK to advise doctors locally about detailed diagnosis and treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.3/1">The UK-led provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in the Helmand province of southern Afghanistan has a comprehensive approach to security and reconstruction, based on the joint UK plan for Helmand. This comprehensive approach is essential to create the conditions necessary for both security and for long-term development. The PRT includes military and civilian representatives from Estonia, Denmark, the United States and the UK. From the UK, DFID, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU), work together with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to deliver the four strands of the joint UK plan for Helmand; security, governance, social and economic development, and counter-narcotics.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.3/2">The closely integrated civil/military structure currently used by the UK is widely regarded as a model of good practice to support the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) in establishing a secure environment where reconstruction and development can take place. There are no plans to separate the security and reconstruction roles of the UK PRT and therefore we have not assessed the potential impact of this.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.6/1">DFID is working to increase life expectancy through a variety of activities including support for the provision of clean water and sanitation, large-scale immunisation and insecticide-treated bednets programmes and addressing related maternal mortality. Safe hygiene practice and improved access to clean water and sanitation are also vital for reducing child mortality. DFID produced the Water Action Plan in March 2004, and we will double our spending on water and sanitation to &pound;95 million by 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.6/2">In Nigeria we are providing &pound;20 million to rebuild routine immunisation services and a further &pound;80 million for malaria control. In Tanzania we continue to provide support for the social marketing of bednets as part of the national Insecticide Treated Net Programme, and in Sierra Leone we are designing a new long term Child Survival and Maternal Health Programme with the World Bank and national partners. In Malawi we are contributing &pound;100 million over six years to the Government's essential health and human resource programme, and significant progress has been made on child survival through immunisation and malaria programmes. Similarly in Zambia we are major donors to the National Strategic Health Plan, which includes a focus on improving child health through expanded vaccination, curative care and improving access to services. In Kenya we are supporting a sector wide approach for the long term strengthening of the health system and improved service delivery. We have funded the development of a number of plans in human resources, procurement and financial management. We are also concentrating much support on the prevention of malaria, the major cause of mortality in children in Kenya. By the end of 2007 we will have spent more than &pound;45 million on insecticide treated bednets and distributed 11 million nets, saving approximately 167,000 lives. DFID is indirectly supporting South Africa's efforts to reverse under-five mortality rates through the &pound;30 million, five year HIV/AIDS Multi-Sectoral Support Programme (MSP). Our support to the Maternal Child and Women Health Unit in the Department of Health supports research in the area of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), the development of fertility options policy, and research on barriers to antiretroviral uptake among children and pregnant women.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.6/3">DFID continues to provide strong support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM), and also played a central role in the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) which issued its first bonds in November 2006. This will disburse $4 billion over the next 10 years and is estimated will save 10 million lives, including five million children before 2015. DFID also recently pledged long term support to UNITAID, the International Drug Purchase Facility, starting with a &pound;15 million contribution in 2007, to ensure poor countries benefit from lower prices for drugs to treat AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.2/1">Recognising that Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, DFID provides support through the wider international community's efforts to help lift Haiti out of poverty. Last year Haiti became a member of the Caribbean Development bank and in recognition of this DFID increased its contribution to the bank's low interest poverty-focused funds to just over &pound;23 million, &pound;3 million of which was earmarked to projects in Haiti. DFID officials recently met with four senior officials from the Haitian Central bank and the Ministry of Finance to discuss the type of poverty-reducing support and projects they would like the bank to provide in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/2">Most recently we have placed a DFID staff member in the Canadian Development Agency based in Port-au-Prince. The objective of this post is, to improve the effectiveness of the international community's development assistance to Haiti, to coordinate the UK response to any humanitarian disaster and to facilitate the integration of disaster risk reduction activities into development and humanitarian programmes. The latter is key to reducing poverty in the long term as Haiti is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, such as floods, which hit the poor the hardest.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/3">We believe we will have greatest impact on the international development effort in Haiti by helping to improve the effectiveness of the large amounts of foreign aid that are already available. Much of this comes from regional and international institutions such as the World Bank, European Commission, United Nations and Inter-American Development bank, of which the UK contributes sizeable shares to each. The weakness of Haiti's institutions, including the administration, and the country's history of turbulence means it is vital that all donors coordinate their activities and align their assistance behind the Government's own objectives for reducing poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.2/4">The UK supports debt cancellation for Haiti as soon as possible. Haiti began to receive interim debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative in November last year. Its debt service payments have therefore already been considerably reduced. Haiti is now making progress towards completion point of the HIPC initiative when it will receive $140 million worth of debt cancellation (in 2005 net present value terms). At HIPC completion point, Haiti will also qualify for 100 per cent. debt cancellation at the World Bank and IMF under the multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI worth a further $243 million (in 2005 net present value terms), as well as additional debt cancellation at the Inter-American Development bank (IADB).</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.2/1">According to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) figures, between <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-21">21 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> a total of 54,187 unregistered Afghan refugees have been deported through the crossing points of Islam Qala (Herat province)&mdash;19,311&mdash;and Zaranj (Nimroz province)&mdash;34,876. An additional estimated total of 487 families have arrived in the Farah province.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/2">The deportations are taking place as part of a concerted drive by the Iranian authorities to curb illegal migration from Afghanistan to Iran. As such it can be anticipated that they will continue for several more months. The current deportation exercise seems to be concentrating on Iran's south eastern provinces, notably Sistan Baluchistan. To date UNHCR has not identified any significant incidence of registered refugees being deported from Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/3">UNHCR reports that in general, the local authorities in Zaranj (Nimroz province) and Islam Qala (Herat province) are coping adequately with the influx. Sizeable deportations through these border crossings have been a regular occurrence for many years. The deportees are being accommodated in public buildings and tents. Water, sanitation facilities, and food are being provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/4">The humanitarian situation in the Farah province is of more concern. A recent joint mission of UNHCR, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) to Farah, established that families are being deported through an unofficial crossing point at Shaghali in the Farah province. They are currently being housed in temporary construction sites. It has been agreed that UNHCR, UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) will provide initial assistance to the deportees of one month's food rations, non-food items, and family kits. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) is also undertaking a mission to the border areas to collect information from the deportees on human rights and protection issues and to compile a report.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/5">While DFID is not directly engaged in providing humanitarian assistance to refugees in the Herat, Nimroz and Farah provinces, we are in close contact with UN agencies, and continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.637W.2/2">The Cabinet Office Code sets out the following reasons why a consultation may last for a period of less than 12 weeks: timetables are set out in statute; they are governed by EU or other international processes; they are tied to the Budget or other annual financial cycles; they are about measures where there is a health and safety or security dimension; or some other urgent requirement for the introduction of new measures. In addition, where re-consultation takes place on the basis of amendments made in the light of earlier consultation, a shorter period may also be appropriate. In DEFRA, proposals for a consultation period of less than 12 weeks are dealt with on a case by case basis and require approval by Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.2/1">Since October 2006, Environmental Stewardship is administered by Natural England on behalf of DEFRA.

	<p pid="a.638W.2/2">The Government are, however, anxious to encourage those who have been delivering significant environmental benefits under earlier schemes to continue to do so within the opportunities now available. Members of former schemes may also be more aware of the potential of the current schemes and hence more likely to apply. The applications database does not record information about previous scheme membership.</p>

Member for Cotswold of 27 March 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1496W, on independent living funds, what action was taken as a result of the theft; whether those whose personal data were stolen were informed; how many people's personal data were on the tape; whether those whose personal data were stolen have since been victims of identity fraud; when the theft was discovered and how long after the theft occurred the discovery was made; what type of personal data were stolen; and if he will make a statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.641W.2/1">Following the incident last year, the trustees of the ILFs' immediately instigated a full end-to-end review of IT security, as a precautionary measure. This review was carried out in consultation with experts in the field of IT and data security.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/2">All those whose personal data was contained on the stolen tape were informed of the incident in writing. The ILFs' also set up a telephone help line to help customers who had additional queries.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/3">The stolen tape contained the personal data of approximately 30,000 people, including all current customers of the ILFs', as well as ILF staff and a number of former customers of the funds, whose details are retained in line with strict data retention policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/4">To date, there has been no evidence to suggest that anyone has been the victim of identity fraud as a consequence of this incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/5">The theft, which involved a forced entry to a data transport and storage contractor's van, while the tape was in transit to the ILFs' office, occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-21">21 September 2006</phrase> and was discovered, reported to the police and notified to the ILFs' management in less than two hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/6">The exact amount of personal data stolen, varied from person to person but the range of data included names, addresses, dates of birth, national insurance numbers and bank account details.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/7">After receiving advice from a range of security professionals, the date of this incident was not made public. There was no information in the public domain to link the incident to the ILFs' and to release the date of the incident then, could have increased the risk of an attempt to access the data on the stolen tape.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.2/8">We consider that due to the length of time since the incident, the risk now of the data being compromised is low. Accordingly, the date of the incident has now been made public.</p>

	<p pid="a.645W.6/1">In order to determine the likely cost of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), data were collected on the numbers and characteristics of 380 affected pension schemes and specific data were collected on some 1,300 members of a smaller number of these schemes expected to be representative of the overall eligible membership. These sample data have then been fed into an actuarial model developed by the Government Actuary's Department to generate detailed time profiles of costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.645W.6/2">The actuarial model calculates the amount of pension that would be paid in each year to each individual in the sample, reflecting the design of the FAS. The key pieces of information used to calculate these costs are: age, retirement age, accrued pension, percentage of pension lost and the likely longevity of eligible members and any survivors. The results, in terms of likely cash flow in each year, are scaled up to the level of the total assumed numbers of affected scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="a.645W.6/3">The main assumptions used in the calculations, based on the best available evidence are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.645W.6/4" class="indent">125,000 eligible pensioner and non-pensioner members;</p>
	<p pid="a.645W.6/5" class="indent">an average funding level of schemes in respect of non-pensioner members of 30 per cent. to 35 per cent.;</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.5/1">As announced in February in our review of the Government's &quot;Road Safety Strategy&quot;, I have asked the Driving Standards Agency to undertake a fundamental review of the way people learn to drive as part of our efforts to reduce road traffic casualties. This will include ensuring that the driving test provides an effective and efficient coverage of the syllabus and demonstrates that a candidate has the required level of competence.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.5/2">In Great Britain the requirements for the driving test, both the theory and practical elements, are set out in the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 (as amended). Any proposed changes will be subject to public consultation before decisions are reached and amending regulations laid in Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.5/1">The Department's Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) has a specific responsibility to help ensure that all commercial vehicles and drivers comply with the law, irrespective of whether their operating base is in the UK, or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.5/2">However, in recognition of the concern that a greater proportion of vehicles and drivers on international journeys break the rules, last year we provided for VOSA to increase the level of roadside enforcement resources they have available in the south-east. This enabled VOSA to double the number of enforcement checks on potentially non-compliant vehicles during the last financial year, and will enable them to increase the number of checks by a further 20 per cent. in the current financial year. VOSA is extending the work of the South East International Transport Pilot nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.5/3">In addition to providing for a greater level of enforcement activity in the south-east, we also intend to introduce regulations at the earliest opportunity that will enable both the police and VOSA to issue fixed penalties and take a deposit from offenders on-the-spot in any case where they do not have a satisfactory address in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.5/4">Enforcement officers will, in future, also be able to immobilise a vehicle in any case where the offender is likely to refuse to pay a deposit, or to drive away in contravention of any prohibition which has been issued, either in respect of the driver, or in any case where the vehicle has been deemed unfit to continue with its journey.</p>

	<p pid="a.662W.3/1">The Government have set a number of targets on adoption.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/2">The following target was included in the Department of Health publication 'Improvement, Expansion and Reform: The Next Three Years (Priorities and Planning Framework 2003-06)':</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/3">&quot;Maintain current levels of adoption placement stability (as measured by the proportion of placements for adoption ending with the making of an adoption order) so that quality is not compromised whilst increasing the use of adoption as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/4" class="indent">By 2004-05 increase by 40 per cent. the number of looked after children who are adopted, and aim to exceed this by achieving, if possible, a 50 per cent. increase by 2006, up from 2,700 in 1999-2000. All councils will bring their practice up to the current level of the best performers.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/5" class="indent">By 2004-05 increase to 95 per cent. the proportion of looked after children placed for adoption within 12 months of the decision that adoption is in the child's best interests, up from 81 per cent. in 2000-01, and maintain this level (95 per cent.) up to 2006, by locally applying the timescales in the national adoption standards, taking account of the individual child's needs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/6">The period during which this target operated came to an end in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/7">The target helped significantly to raise the number of adoptions of looked after children, where adoption was in the child's best interests. Between 2000-01 and 2004-05 the proportion of looked after children placed for adoption within 12 months of the decision that adoption was in the child's best interests remained stable at around 80 per cent.. We will be reviewing the factors that influenced performance against this target in light of the full implementation and bedding down of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/8">In addition, in 2004, the following Department for Education and Skills Public Service Agreement target was introduced:</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/9" class="indent">&quot;To narrow the gap in educational achievement between looked after children and their peers, and improve their educational support and the stability of their lives, so that by 2008, 80 per cent. of children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 or more years will have been living in the same placement for at least two years, or are placed for adoption.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.662W.3/10">The percentage of looked after children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 or more years and who have been living in the same placement for at least two years, or placed for adoption, has remained stable at around 65 per cent. since this target was introduced. As a result, we have undertaken intensive targeted work with a number of local authorities to help support them in improving placement stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.663W.2/1">Officials in my Department and in the Learning and Skills Council have discussed with Skills for Care, the Sector Skills Council for the care sector, how the national employer training programme in England, Train to Gain, could be made more relevant to the needs of employers and employees within the care sector, and are currently considering proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.2/2">In England, Train to Gain offers employers in all sectors easy access, via a free skills brokerage service, to a full range of training provision including fully subsidised training leading to a Skills for Life or first full level 2 qualification, such as a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) at level 2. At the end of March 2007 a total of 6,550 employers from the health and social work sector had been engaged by Train to Gain which, at 21 per cent., represents the largest level of sectoral engagement in the programme. That is consistent with Train to Gain's predecessor&mdash;the Employer Training Pilots&mdash;where the care sector represented 26 per cent. of participating employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.2/3">From September 2006, all adults in England who do not have a full qualification at level 2 are entitled to free tuition to get one, even if they do not work for an employer who is involved with the Train to Gain programme. They can access this level 2 entitlement through their local further education college or a range of other publicly funded training providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.2/4">The Department of Health, together with 13 other Government Departments, has recently made a Skills Pledge commitment to train those staff members without a first full level 2 qualification and we anticipate this will lead to benefits for others who work in its sector including carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.666W.0/1">The curriculum delivered to young people in custody is guided by &quot;The Offender's Learning Journey (juveniles)&quot; in young offender institutions (under the Learning and Skills Council's Offender Learning and Skills Service) and the National Specification for Learning and Skills in secure training centres and secure children's homes. It specifies a curriculum balance of approximately one third basic skills, one third academic or vocational subjects and one third physical education, arts, information and communications technology, and personal, social and health education. The learning is based on young person's needs to support progression to education, training or employment on release, alongside a daily literacy and numeracy session and an hour per month with a career guidance professional.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.0/2">In young offender institutions education is provided under the Offenders Learning and Skills Service (OLASS) contracts managed and funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC contracts with further education colleges as well as private providers to deliver the teaching. Latest Youth Justice Board performance statistics for 2005-06 indicate that young people received an average of 28.24 hours per week of education, training and personal development activity, against a target of 25 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.0/3">Secure training centres are privately run; two contract with further education providers to deliver their education, one contracts with a private provider and the other delivers education in-house.

	<p pid="a.666W.0/4">Teachers in secure children's homes are usually recruited directly by their local authority. Latest figures show that 79.9 per cent. of young people in secure children's homes received 30 hours or more education, training and personal development activity a week.</p>

	<p pid="a.666W.3/1">All approved foster carers receive an allowance in respect of each looked after child in their care. The level and structure of payments are at the discretion of local authorities and independent fostering providers. However, to create a fairer system of payments across the country, we have announced new national minimum allowance rates for foster carers. From April 2007, the national minimum allowance, which is subject to regional variation, is &pound;100-&pound;116 per week for a baby, rising to &pound;151-&pound;176 per week for an older teenager</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/2">With regard to residence orders, local authorities have a power to pay an allowance, which is most often used to enable children to leave care to live with relatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/3">In addition, local authorities are required to make arrangements for the provision of special guardianship support services as prescribed by the Special Guardianship Regulations 2005; these include financial support. Before making any decision about financial support, local authorities are required to consider the needs of the child and the resources available to the special guardian. We have developed a model means test to assist local authorities in calculating appropriate levels of financial support for both adoption and special guardianship.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/2">The Department for Education and Skills leads the cross-government programme Every Child Matters; Change for Children but it is not responsible for all aspects of policy on children. The Department of Health is responsible for the health of disabled children and for wheelchair services for adults and children. It therefore leads the Be Healthy strand of the Every Child Matters programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/3">The Department has made it clear that eligibility for services and support is for councils to determine in a locally consistent manner. We believe that local-decision making by councils is an important means by which local people have the opportunity to influence decisions about resources, charging and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/4">The Care Services Improvement Partnership (CSIP) report 'Out and About', which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-20">20 October 2006</phrase>, highlights the importance of services being committed to standard 8 of the Children's National Service Framework (NSF). The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) will be referring to the best practice checklist, contained in the report, as part of their inspection process and will be specifically including wheelchair services.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/5">The Transforming Community Equipment and Wheelchair Services (TCEWS) programme is looking at how best to address the issues the services face through development of a new delivery model in collaboration with stakeholders. The Department for Education and Skills is working closely with us on this ongoing programme of work. We anticipate that the new model will be capable of implementation by April 2008</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/6">The TCEWS programme was able to develop two potential models for wheelchair services in collaboration with users and their carers, seven wheelchair services, the wheelchair services managers and to refine the potential models with practitioners and suppliers. Further data is required before recommendations can be made for the way forward. A further data gathering exercise has been approved and an update will be provided in autumn 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/7">As part of our commitment set out in the Children's NSF, we presented, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-16">16 April 2006</phrase>, a new self-assessment tool for commissioners of children's and young people's health services. The tool will play an important role in ensuring that all commissioners are equipped and able to deliver improved quality and outcomes for services for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/8">We are currently consulting on the Commissioning Framework for Health and Well-being which sets out how local commissioners can successfully commission services that improve health and well-being and help people remain independent. It also consults on a new duty for local authorities and primary care trusts to work together on a joint strategic needs assessment. This will outline current and predicted needs of the local population so providers can best promote the health and well-being, of their local populations, particularly those groups that currently get a poor response from services.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/9">Every Child Matters aims to improve outcomes for disabled children through better integration of services, at strategic and operational levels, including the pooling of budgets. The introduction of children's trust arrangements should see services coming together to provide more joined-up and coherent services and make a major contribution to the NSF standard eight vision for equipment provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/10">The Department does not collect centrally the average waiting times for children and young people under the age of 18 following assessment to receive a lightweight manual and a powered indoor and outdoor wheelchair in each of the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.5/11">The Department does not collect centrally the data for the percentage of children under the age of 18 years who met local eligibility criteria received a powered indoor and outdoor wheelchair within three months, six months and one year of an assessment in the last three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.3/2">Matters concerning the distribution of this particular report, and the evidential basis for judgments within it, are for Ofsted.

	<p pid="a.670W.3/5" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/6" class="indent">You asked what the evidential basis was for the statement made by Ofsted in its report, &quot;Time for Change? Personal, Social and Health Education (HMI070049)&quot;, that school nurses are providing an important service by offering the morning after pill to pupils; whom Ofsted consulted before making this statement; how many copies of the report were (i) published, (ii) sold and (iii) provided free of charge by Ofsted; how many copies of the report were provided to the Department; at what cost to (A) the Department and (B) Ofsted; how members of the public may obtain the report; at what cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/7" class="indent">Our report states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/8" class="indent">&quot;school nurses can also provide a valuable service, particularly in terms of providing emergency hormonal contraception and advising on other forms of contraception&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/9" class="indent">This is in line with non-statutory guidance published by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES). The DfES publication &quot;Teenage Pregnancy Next Steps: Guidance for Local Authorities and Primary Care Trusts on Effective Delivery of Local Strategies&quot; (2006) sets out the key findings from 'deep dive' reviews carried out by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit to identify factors responsible for the significant variation in performance between local areas, including between areas that are statistically similar. The guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Provision of young people focused contraception/sexual health services, trusted by teenagers and well known by professionals working with them&quot;. This was the factor most commonly cited as having the biggest impact on conception rate reductions in the high performing areas. Features of successful services reflected the &quot;Best practice guidance on the provision of effective contraception and advice services for young people&quot;, issued by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit in 2000: easy accessibility in the right location with opening hours convenient to young people; provision of the full range of contraceptive methods, including long acting methods; a strong focus on sexual health promotion (as well as reactive services) through, for example, outreach work in schools, work with professionals to improve their ability to engage with young people on sexual health issues; and through highly visible publicity. Effective services also had a strong focus on meeting the specific needs of young men. All high-performing areas also had condom distribution schemes involving a wide range of local agencies and/or access to emergency contraception in non-clinical settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/11" class="indent">Ofsted's own discussions with young people suggest they want and trust services in schools and welcome and recognise the commitment that schools show to meeting their wider health needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.3/12" class="indent">The report is only available on the Ofsted website <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>. It can be accessed at no cost to members of the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.671W.2/1">We published Youth Matters: Next Steps in March 2006, setting out our plans to reform services for young people, particularly to narrow the gap between the most disadvantaged and the rest. Considerable progress has been made to implement these policies over the past year. We have introduced new legislation (Education and Inspections Act 2006) which places a duty on all local authorities to secure access for young people in their area to sufficient positive activities and publicise these. Young people up and down the country are accessing the Youth Opportunity and Youth Capital funds&mdash;enabling them to undertake wider activities and decide how the additional &pound;115 million investment should be spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.2/2">The Government established the new charity, v, which has been tasked with encouraging more young people to volunteer. Significant progress has been made to reach a target of one million new young volunteers and attract private sector finance for these new opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.2/3">Through our reforms to targeted youth support, we are improving the range and coherence of services that support vulnerable young people in their pivotal teenage years. 14 children's trusts took part in the targeted support pathfinders during 2006 and guidance on developing targeted services was published in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.2/4">Integrated youth support services will be in place throughout England by 2008. For Connexions, this means a major transition whereby the funding and responsibility for securing delivery of services, currently held by 47 Connexions partnerships, will pass to 150 local authorities working through children's trust arrangements by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.2/5">We are also developing new quality standards for young people's information advice and guidance (IAG) and the new standards will be published by July 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.671W.2/6">After careful consideration, we no longer intend to run the youth opportunity card pilots. We will continue to explore ways of improving the choices for young people in things to do and places to go while enabling them to have an increasing influence and a real say in what is provided.</p>

As part of this process, the GLRO has undertaken a detailed study of the design of the ballot papers, including user testing of different possible formats (four for the mayoral election and two for the assembly). Equally, the work on developing the new GLA elections rules will specifically look at the provisions for counting of votes to maximise transparency of the count process.

	<p pid="a.683W.2/1">One of the aims of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 (EA Act) was to improve electoral registration. Section 9 of the EA Act sets out the necessary steps that all Electoral Registration Officers must take to maintain the electoral register.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/2">These steps include sending the canvass form more than once to any address, conducting house to house inquiries and making contact by such means as appropriate. Each local authority has adopted an approach that is appropriate to their local circumstances, within the context of the necessary steps.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/3">A later registration date was also available for the May 2007 local elections allowing electors to register up to 11 days before the poll.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/4">Section 67 of the EA Act requires the Electoral Commission to set and monitor performance standards for electoral services and this will also help to monitor and improve electoral registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/5">As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase> the number of registered electors in Barnet had increased by 5,580. We have not taken any specific action to improve postal vote registration, as how an elector chooses to vote is a matter of choice for the elector. A person can now apply for a postal vote at the same time as they apply to register to vote. The annual canvass form now includes a tick box for this purpose and the poll card issued to electors also provides information about how to apply for a postal vote. The requirement for the applicant to provide a signature and date of birth is also an improvement to the security of the postal vote process.</p>

The figures are taken from volumes of the Prison Statistics in England Wales for the years between 1999 and 2002, and volumes of the Offender Management Caseload Statistics between 2003 and 2005.

Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system, and although shown to the last individual the figures may not be accurate to that level. As noted in the footnote to table 10.19 in the 2005 table, the reasons for recall from Home Detention Curfew are sometimes confused with the reason for the original imprisonment, and inquiries show that that is the case with the two sexual offenders in the table for that year. Further investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded do not relate to the offence for which they were sentenced and subsequently released on Home Detention Curfew, but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence.</p>

	<p pid="a.691W.5/2">A reduced VAT rate of 5 per cent. applies to the conversion of a non-residential building into a communal residential building, such as a care home, if the care home is not intended for use as a hospital or similar institution.</p>
	<p pid="a.691W.5/3">Under agreements with our European partners, entered into by successive Governments, we are not able to extend existing VAT zero rates or introduce any new ones. While the application of VAT reliefs and reduced rates is also limited by these agreements, all taxes are kept under review and any changes are announced by the Chancellor as part of the Budget process.</p>

I met with a group of Congolese parliamentarians from a cross-section of political parties in March when they visited the UK to see how the opposition works.

We understand that Mr. Dhabihu'llah Mahrami died in custody on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>. Mr. Mahrami's case had previously appeared on the EU list of cases of concern used in the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue. The EU raised the death of Mr. Mahrami in a meeting with the Iranian authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase> and handed over a note verbale requesting further information. We have not received specific reports about the treatment of the family home since his death, but would be prepared to consider further action as appropriate. We are also concerned about reports that Iranian newspapers, including hardline <i> Keyhan</i>, have been carrying out a propaganda campaign against the Baha'i community. We raised our concerns about this in an EU d&eacute;marche last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.2/3">The Government continues to press the Iranian authorities to take seriously their international human rights obligations, uphold the right to freedom of religion and belief, as described in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and address the discrimination suffered by Iranian Baha'is.

The Serious Crimes Unit of the Basra police was widely associated with violent corruption, and was disbanded in December 2006. A functioning Iraqi Department of Internal Affairs, reporting directly to the central government, has been established to investigate, arrest and prosecute corrupt police officers. The UK is supporting the work of this unit directly. In addition, UK police mentors are actively engaged in building the leadership and specialist skills of the Basra police.</p>

	<p pid="a.700W.8/1">There are widely varying reports of the number of Ethiopian troops operating in Somalia. We do not know the exact figure as we have no presence in Somalia and we are not aware of Ethiopia confirming the numbers it has in Somalia. However, our best estimate at this stage is that there are likely to be around 4,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/2">However, the Ethiopian action in Somalia has resulted in the Transitional Federal Government, the only mechanism through which to restore peace, stability and governance to Somalia, re-establishing itself in Mogadishu and securing authority over the rest of south and central Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/3">We want Ethiopian troops to withdraw as soon as they can, as Ethiopia has said it wants to. The deployment of the African Union stabilisation force, authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 1744, will help create the conditions for this withdrawal to take place. This is an important step in maintaining security and preventing a return to civil war.</p>

	<p pid="a.701W.15/1">In 2006-07 Stoke-on-Trent received &pound;5,097,375 Supporting People programme grant. In 2007-08 this allocation was increased by 7.5 per cent. giving a grant of &pound;5,479,678. Stoke-on-Trent also received &pound;330,816 Supporting People administration grant in 2006-07 and have been allocated the same amount in 2007-08 as a contribution towards the costs of running this programme. Communities and Local Government, as with most other departments across Whitehall, are currently in negotiation with Treasury regarding the future allocation of resources over the next spending review period. I am therefore unable to say, at this stage, what the Supporting People allocation will be for any local authority beyond 2008. However, both Communities and Local Government and Treasury attach a great deal of importance to this programme and will continue to support investment in supported housing.</p>

This measure provides one indication of the level of deprivation within the local authority and takes on board both the most deprived and least deprived small areas within the locality to arrive at the average.</p>

A similar national target was established for antisocial behaviour; perceptions of antisocial behaviour have fallen from 21 per cent. to 18 per cent. since 2002-3.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.2/3">The current set of PSAs are in their final year: from April 2008 it is proposed that a new set of Government PSAs will come into operation. As part of the process for establishing the successor to the existing crime reduction target, the Home Office is reviewing the impact of the targets that have gone before and what the most appropriate targets will be going forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.5/3">Once the minimum term has been served an offender is entitled to have his detention reviewed by the independent Parole Board.

However, when setting the minimum term the judge said his order for a minimum of 40 years to be served &quot;offers little or no hope of the defendant's eventual release&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.710W.5/2">There are no plans to end the Contact Supplementary Hours (CSH) scheme. While the Service remains committed to filling all funded posts, the time delays involved in between recruitment and delivery to a fully trained officer is considerable (usually six months). Often this delay is inconsistent with a short term operational need, such as the requirement to open new accommodation, in response to a sudden rise in the prison population or the need to re-role an establishment at short notice. Accordingly CSH has become an essential tool to maintain the operational capability of the Service, being essential to filling staff vacancies prior to recruitment. Participation on the scheme by individual staff members is entirely voluntary.</p>

Survival for lung cancer increased slightly, by half a percentage point in men and by just over 1 percentage point in women. For prostate cancer, there was a rise of 6 percentage points, but much of this was due to the increasingly widespread use of prostate-specific antigen testing.</p>

This is in line with other revenue allocations that are made using the fair funding formula that directs funding to towards those areas with the greatest need. This approach was agreed with SHAs.</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.5/1">The National Health Service Confidentiality Code of Practice, published in November 2003, provides guidance on required practice for those who work within or under contract to NHS organisations about the safeguarding of confidentiality, and patients' consent to the use of their health records.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.5/2">The guidance includes an explanation of the main relevant legal requirements, and examples of appropriate information disclosure decisions in practice. The guidance applies equally to clinicians, managers, and all other staff in both primary and secondary care settings whose work involves access to personal information and, where appropriate, includes staff in the private and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.5/3">A full version of the code can be downloaded from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/06/92/54/04069254.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/06/92/54/04069254.pdf</a>.

The code is applicable irrespective of the method by which patient information is supplied to a third party.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.5/4">Strong disincentives exist which protect against abuse of patient confidentiality. NHS organisations are responsible, as employers, for the actions taken on their behalf by their employees, and for disciplining their staff when they behave inappropriately. Accessing personal information without a legitimate reason constitutes a breach of the code. Staff who breach patient confidentiality are subject to professional disciplinary measures. Offending doctors and nurses will be reported to their professional regulatory bodies and may face additional disciplinary action, including losing their licence to practice. Separate legal penalties for individuals and organisations misusing personal health and other information are provided for under section 60 of the Data Protection Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.11/1">No estimate has been made specifically on the likely impart of smokefree legislation on cancer rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.11/2">The Government's independent Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health has concluded on the basis of an extensive review of medical and scientific evidence that there is an overall 24 per cent. increased risk of lung cancer in non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke. In March 2005, the <i> British Medical Journal</i> published a research paper by Professor K. Jamrozik suggesting that across the United Kingdom, exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace is to be responsible for the deaths of more than two employed people per working day, 617 deaths a year. Of this number, the research attributed 160 deaths from exposure to secondhand smoke to lung cancer (a copy of this article is available in the Library).</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.11/3">While the primary aim of smokefree legislation is to protect employees and members of the public from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke in enclosed workplaces and public places, the Department also anticipates that many smokers will be motivated by the implementation of the new law to quit smoking. The Department estimates that the new smokefree law might reduce smoking prevalence among the general population in England by around 1.7 percentage points, or an estimated 600,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.11/4">While smoking is closely related to lung cancer with 87 per cent. of all deaths from lung cancer being attributable to smoking, smoking is also a cause of other types of cancer including cancers of the oesophagus, bladder, kidney, stomach and pancreas. The expected reduction in smoking prevalence from the implementation of smokefree legislation will help to reduce rates of smoking-related cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.745W.0/1">The Department for Education and Skills leads the cross-government programme Every Child Matters; Change for Children but it is not responsible for all aspects of policy on children. The Department of Health is responsible for the health of disabled children and for wheelchair services for adults and children. It therefore leads the Be Healthy strand of the Every Child Matters programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/2">The Department has made it clear that eligibility for services and support is for councils to determine in a locally consistent manner. We believe that local-decision making by councils is an important means by which local people have the opportunity to influence decisions about resources, charging and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/3">The Care Services Improvement Partnership (CSIP) report &quot;Out and About&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-20">20 October 2006</phrase>, highlights the importance of services being committed to standard 8 of the Children's National Service Framework (NSF). The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) will be referring to the best practice checklist, contained in the report, as part of their inspection process and will be specifically including wheelchair services.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/4">The Transforming Community Equipment and Wheelchair Services (TCEWS) programme is looking at how best to address the issues the services face through development of a new delivery model in collaboration with stakeholders. The Department for Education and Skills is working closely with us on this ongoing programme of work. We anticipate that the new model will be capable of implementation by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/5">The TCEWS programme was able to develop two potential models for wheelchair services in collaboration with users and their carers, seven wheelchair services, the wheelchair services managers and to refine the potential models with practitioners and suppliers. Further data is required before recommendations can be made for the way forward. A further data gathering exercise has been approved and an update will be provided in autumn 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/6">As part of our commitment set out in the Children's NSF, we presented, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-16">16 April 2006</phrase>, a new self-assessment tool for commissioners of children's and young people's health services. The tool will play an important role in ensuring that all commissioners are equipped and able to deliver improved quality and outcomes for services for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/7">We are currently consulting on the Commissioning Framework for Health and Wellbeing which sets out how local commissioners can successfully commission services that improve health and well-being and help people remain independent. It also consults on a new duty for local authorities and primary care trusts to work together on a joint strategic needs assessment. This will outline current and predicted needs of the local population so providers can best promote the health and wellbeing of their local populations, particularly those groups that currently get a poor response from services.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/8">Every Child Matters aims to improve outcomes for disabled children through better integration of services, at strategic and operational levels, including the pooling of budgets. The introduction of children's trust arrangements should see services coming together to provide more joined-up and coherent services and make a major contribution to the NSF standard eight vision for equipment provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/9">The Department does not collect centrally the average waiting times for children and young people under the age of 18 following assessment to receive a lightweight manual and a powered indoor and outdoor wheelchair in each of the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.0/10">The Department does not collect centrally the data for the percentage of children under the age of 18 years who met local eligibility criteria received a powered indoor and outdoor wheelchair within three months, six months and one year of an assessment in the last three years.</p>
