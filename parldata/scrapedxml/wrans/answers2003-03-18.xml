	<p pid=".619W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-27">27 July 2001</phrase> that the M42 between Junctions 3a and 7 had been chosen as a pilot site for Active Traffic Management (ATM). The pilot offers the potential to allow carefully controlled use of the hard shoulder as a running lane during congested periods. The outcome of the pilot will be assessed very thoroughly before any policy decision is taken about the more general use of the hard shoulder as a running lane. The hard shoulder is routinely used as a running lane during motorway maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/2">The Health and Safety Executive regularly provide input into the standards applied when the hard shoulder is used as a running lane during motorway maintenance. They will be consulted about its use as part of the M42 ATM Project when the Highways Agency has developed its proposals more fully.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/3">The Highways Agency has met with and discussed the proposals for the M42 ATM with the local fire service. There is a programme of ongoing liaison with the emergency services to discuss matters in more detail.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/4">The Highways Agency has arranged a number of exhibitions and local presentations and has generally received favourable feedback on the proposals to use the hard shoulder as a running lane on the M42. As part of this assessment a range of surveys will be undertaken to assess motorists' opinions on the scheme. A driver simulator has also been developed and this was displayed at the 2002 Birmingham International Motor Show. Again, a favourable response to the use of the hard shoulder was received.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/5">The controlled use of the hard shoulder in the M42 ATM Project is not expected to result in an increase in the costs to the public funds with regard to insurance, medical costs, care of dependants or time off work. Extensive monitoring as part of the M42 ATM Project will be undertaken to quantify the actual impact of the scheme. The proposals are subject to an ongoing assessment and safety audits have already been undertaken as part of the design process.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/6">The proposal for use of the hard shoulder under controlled motorway conditions on the M42 is being designed with safety in mind. Hard shoulder running will only be allowed when a lower speed limit is in place and control room staff have ensured that the hard shoulder is clear. There will be emergency refuge areas, equipped with emergency roadside telephones, installed at regular intervals for motorists that breakdown or require assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/7">I have asked the Highways Agency to place in the Library copies of the reports, listed as follows, that have been assessed in relation to the use of the hard shoulder as a running lane.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/8" class="indent">(a) Safety Review of Making Better Use Techniques&mdash;Final Report.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/9" class="indent">(b) PR/T/168/2001 Development of the Candidate Operational Regimes and the Assessment Strategy for the M42 Active Traffic Management (ATM) Project&mdash;Review of innovative schemes for lane, speed and incident management.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.0/11" class="indent">(d) 42691/03A/012&mdash;Operational Team Visit to Utrecht Traffic Information Centre.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/12">It is not envisaged that there will be an increase in the injury accident rate through the controlled use of the hard shoulder for the M42 ATM project. Extensive monitoring of the M42 project will be undertaken to quantify the actual impact of the scheme on safety. The safety of drivers and those concerned with the operation and maintenance of the road will be a major consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/13">The Highways Agency is in the process of discussions with various motoring organisations about different aspects proposed for the M42 pilot. These discussions are on-going.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/14">The M42 ATM Project has received initial funding of &pound;40 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund to cover the ATM infrastructure construction costs. An initial estimate of &pound;3.2 million per annum was made for the future maintenance and operational costs for the project.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/15">No meetings have yet been held with the Transport and General Workers Union or other trade unions to discuss the safety implications of hard shoulder running in general or on the M42 ATM Project. The advanced signalling and monitoring equipment being installed on the M42 will provide the ability to close lanes and provide advanced warning of incidents on the M42. This infrastructure will allow the protection of road users involved in incidents and will support existing maintenance activities which is likely to be especially beneficial in reducing risk to traffic management operatives.</p>

First, because EU access to NATO operational planning is assured (i.e. continuous and guaranteed), NATO agreement is not required for any EU requests for NATO planning support; every WEU request would have required specific NAC approval. Second, there is a presumption that those NATO assets and capabilities that have been pre-identified will indeed be available to the EU.

	<p pid=".626W.8/2">The Ministry of Defence does not recognise &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; as a medical condition. It accepts that some veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf Conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is related to their Gulf experience. A large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms have been reported by some Gulf veterans as well recognised medical conditions. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or 'syndrome'. The MOD's approach must be guided by findings from the scientific and medical community. Primary health care records for the 53, 000 or so veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict are held by their doctors and are not accessible centrally for reason of patient confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.8/3">When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the MOD has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability arising to pay compensation we do so. The MOD has received about 2,000 notices of intention to claim from Gulf veterans, and members of their families in respect of illness allegedly arising from the Gulf conflict, but no writs or formal claims have yet been received. No compensation has therefore been paid following claims for Gulf veterans' illnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.8/4">The fact that there is, at present, no proper basis for recognising &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot; as an appropriate diagnostic label does not prevent a Gulf veteran from getting a war pension. A war pension can be paid for any disablement provided that a causal link to Service is accepted. Over 1,200 war pensions have been awarded to Gulf veterans by the Veterans Agency.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence recognises the strong science and technology capability of United Kingdom universities as a source of innovation and knowledge of relevant research in the wider non-defence community. It is for this reason that MOD encourages universities to participate in the Defence Technology Centre Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.2/2">The MOD has placed almost all of its research work over the past five years with DERA and, since July 2001, with DSTL and QinetiQ. In turn these organisations have sub-contracted with academia in a manner which ensures that the Department's needs are met in an integrated and cost effective manner. MOD does not hold centrally information about the numbers of sub-contracts placed by our contractors with either academia or industry and this could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.2/3">Information is available, however, for contracts placed directly by the Department with academia for the past four years since the decision was made to increase the level of competition for research work. To date three universities have been awarded contracts valued at &pound;591,000. In addition 10 UK universities have received &pound;2.619 million for their role in successful consortia bidding into the research programme. A breakdown of these figures is given in the following table.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.3/1">Currently the Port Health Authorities, Local Authorities and the State Veterinary Service lead on enforcement of controls for detecting smuggled meat. They are supported in this by Customs, who deployed extra resources in this role in 2002. Defra has been funding additional enforcement activity this financial year through temporary Local Authority staff and overtime.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.3/2">Following the Cabinet Office review of enforcement structures, responsibility for all anti-smuggling activity is to be transferred to HM Customs as soon as practicable, and we are working on a Service Level Agreement. Defra has been leading on implementing the Government's action plan, including a risk assessment, detector dog pilot and design of publicity material. Customs have been providing support. A comprehensive centralised database of seizures has been set up to share information and inform decisions on the targeting of resources.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.3/3">The Food Standards Agency is an independent agency accountable to an independent board, with responsibility for food safety matters. It co-ordinates the activities of Local Authorities, including Port Health Authorities, on food safety matters and has lead policy responsibility for controls at the border on products of non-animal origin and fish. The Agency is concerned with checks to verify compliance with food safety standards, and has produced a 10-point plan in relation to imported food, including illegal food imports. The Agency is also working closely with Defra on the action plan.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.2/1">In January 2000 the Government announced their aim for renewables to supply 10 per cent. of UK electricity in 2010, subject to the costs being acceptable to the consumer. We believe that renewable sources of energy will increasingly demonstrate that they can meet our energy needs at both an economically acceptable cost and in a carbon free way. On that basis, our aspiration is by 2020 to double renewables' share of electricity from our 2010 target and we will pursue policies to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/2">More than half the emissions reductions in our Climate Change Programme&mdash;around 10 million tonnes of carbon per annum&mdash;is expected to come from energy efficiency. Further ahead, we believe that energy efficiency can contribute around half of the additional 15&ndash;25 million tonnes of annual carbon savings we are likely to need by 2020. A strategy for achieving these savings is set out in the Energy White Paper.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.5/1">Despite a detailed search, my officials can find no record of a Home Health Programme. Turning to sustainable energy projects in general, the majority operate on a national basis, providing assistance to households and communities across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/2">To encourage sustainable energy projects:</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/3" class="indent">We are spending &pound;50 million over two years on the UK wide Community Energy programme which promotes community heating. So far &pound;8.5million of grants have been approved. Two of these grants have been for innovative energy from waste schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/4" class="indent">The Energy Crops Scheme has allocated &pound;650,000 of grants to promote the establishment of energy crops in England.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/5" class="indent">We fund the Countryside Agency's Community Renewables Initiative, which promotes the establishment of local renewable energy schemes in England.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/6" class="indent">The DTI fund both the UK wide Bio Energy Capital Grants Scheme and the UK wide &pound;10 million Clear Skies initiative. Both are relatively new initiatives. The Bio Energy Capital Grants scheme aims to ensure the development of 100MW biomass heating provision at all scales, while Clear Skies provides advice and support for the installation of household and renewable community renewable schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/7">To encourage domestic energy savings and health initiatives:</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/8" class="indent">We fund the Warm Front grant scheme which assisted over 500,000 households living in Fuel Poverty by installing energy efficiency measures. This indicates that the Government are making good progress toward meeting its target of assisting 600,000 homes by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/9" class="indent">The Government have established the Energy Efficiency Commitment. The Commitment requires electricity and gas suppliers to achieve targets for the promotion of improvements in energy efficiency, with an emphasis on helping lower income customers. The overall target on all suppliers is a combined saving of 62 fuel-standardised terawatt hours.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/10" class="indent">Defra and DTI are funding a pilot Warm Zones initiative in five areas in England. The zones attempt to identify all fuel poor households in an area, and ensure that existing schemes are used to improve the energy efficiency of those homes. The pilot is being evaluated at present and an interim report is expected shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.2/2">Following a public consultation, the New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme was launched in June 2000. The scheme, now marketed as Warm Front, introduced heating measures, boiler repairs and replacements. Only those over 60 on a qualifying benefit are eligible for central heating system installations, under Warm Front Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.2/3">As a result, the grant maximum increased from &pound;315 to &pound;1,000 in 2000 and to &pound;1,500 in 2001 for under 60s households. The grant maximum for over 60s households is &pound;2,500. Revised regulations were issued to enable these amendments.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.2/4">All installations under Warm Front are guaranteed for a year by Eaga Partnership and TXU Warm Front Ltd. who manage the scheme. All materials used are guaranteed by the manufacturer for a year, with the exception of storage heaters which are guaranteed for two years.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.5/1">I represented the UK at Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-04">4 March 2003</phrase>, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. The Council reached a political agreement on one legislative measure, and also considered a number of other important issues.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/2">The Council reached a political agreement on the Forest Focus Regulation, which concerns forest monitoring, with the UK among its supporters. Italy, Spain, and Portugal would have preferred greater support for fire prevention measures, and therefore abstained. The Commission also withheld its support.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/3">We debated the Commission's proposals to revise the Bathing Water Directive, which would raise the required bathing water quality standards across the EU. There was general support for high standards where this would benefit the public, but widespread concern that the measures should be proportionate to the public health benefits sought, and flexible in their application. My right hon. Friend, the Minister for the Environment expressed concern over the soundness of the Commission's cost benefit analysis, and explained that, in the UK, illness related to bathing in sea waters is not a problem serious enough to feature in the public health surveillance system. Most bathing waters in the UK would already meet the higher standards proposed, but there would be high costs involved in ensuring compliance at all times for about 15 per cent. of beaches in England and Wales. There was a risk therefore that the proposals as currently drafted would incur disproportionate costs of compliance for comparatively little benefit. Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Germany, France and Austria all expressed similar concerns. There was wide support for more flexibility in the use of management measures to implement the Directive. Most states also asked for greater clarity of definitions. There was no support for extending the scope of the Directive to waters used for other recreational purposes, and this was accepted by the Commission. The Presidency concluded that Council had given a sufficient steer for further progress to be achieved by the next Council, in June.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/4">Council also debated the proposed Environmental Liability Directive, and in particular the issues of financial security and biodiversity. I made it clear that the UK insurance industry did not support compulsory financial security. It would make little sense to make financial security compulsory if the market is unable to provide the necessary cover. There was support for this line of reasoning from Ireland, France, Italy, Netherlands, the Commission and Germany. There was also some support for a compromise proposed by the Greek Presidency, that compulsory financial security should be phased in. This was not an option I was able to support. On biodiversity, I put forward the view, also supported by France and Germany, that to be insurable and provide certainty, the scope of the Directive should be site-based. The remaining Members favoured extending the scope of the directive to cover all EU-protected biodiversity wherever it may, with an option to include nationally protected species too. The Presidency concluded that progress had been made towards reaching political agreement in June.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/5">We agreed Council Conclusions calling for a community strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment. The Commission reported on action taken in relation to the Prestige incident, and will present a full report to the European Council later this month. Council accepted a Spanish request asking the Commission to consider liability and sanctions in relation to the safety of marine transport. France and Spain also reported on the progress of clean-up operations.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/6">We also discussed the Council's contribution on Sustainable Development for the Spring European Council, and agreed a lengthy set of Conclusions, which included an emphasis on the need for implementation of the commitments made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg last September, and on the importance of encouraging the development of environmental technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/7">Council also adopted Conclusions on the Fifth Pan-European Ministerial Conference &quot;Environment for Europe&quot;, to be held in Kiev in May.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/8">The Commission gave an update on approvals of Genetically Modified Organisms, and their co-existence with conventional crops. It was announced that an option paper on co-existence by Commissioner Fischler would be released on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-05">5 March</phrase>, and a Round Table discussion would follow at the end of April.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/9">On approvals, Commissioner Walstrom noted that there are currently 19 applications in the process, which should be dealt with on a case by case basis. I supported the position of the Commission, along with Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland, that existing legislation is adequate for an orderly return to decision making. A number of other member states continued to argue against proceeding with authorisations until the new traceability and labelling rules come into force. The Commissioner explained that it was unlikely that any authorisation would complete the process before the traceability and labelling rules came into force in any event. She emphasised the need to move the process forward, and that there is no justification for further delay.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/10">Denmark sought clarification from the Commission concerning its guidelines on the presence of metabolites in groundwater. The Commission confirmed that these are not legally binding, and that the expected groundwater directive will look into this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/11">The Commission reported that it was on track with its long-awaited chemicals package, with an early interim consultation, followed by adoption by the Commission in early summer. It also formally presented its proposals on ozone depleting substances, a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds in paints.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.5/12">Over lunch we discussed progress towards ratification of the Kyoto protocol.</p>

	<p pid=".644W.2/1">We have seen a report that the Soil Association and the Fairtrade Foundation were planning to announce an extension of the Fairtrade mark to British produce but I am unaware of any representations to government on this matter. For its part the Government are striving to rid agriculture of the constraints of price protection and production-related subsidies and to reconnect farmers with their markets. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food launched last December aims to help deliver this objective and sets out how Government, industry and others can work together to secure a more positive future for the food and farming industries. It contains a number of measures to help farmers reconnect with their customers and the rest of the food chain, to improve co-operation and performance, and to enhance training and opportunities to learn from best practice. The Government also remain determined to secure market-oriented reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy and through the WTO.</p>

Using the fund as a mechanism for compensating operators for revoking permissions was not raised in either consultation and does not, therefore, feature in the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.2/1">Professor Montgomery's report, entitled &quot;The Northern Ireland Irish Hare Survey 2002&quot;, was received by my Department on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-14">14 February 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.2/2">The report provides a current population estimate and compares these results with data collected in a 1997 survey. It also assesses the merits of two survey techniques and makes recommendations for future Irish hare monitoring. Professor Montgomery's team concludes that a method of survey known as 'Night Driven Transect Survey' allows a reliable estimate of hare abundance to be calculated.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.2/3">The 2002 Night Driven Transect Survey produced an average density estimate of one hare per square kilometre in Northern Ireland, an estimate similar to that reported in 1997. The present report concludes that hares are widespread and are found most frequently in upland areas. Hares were more frequently recorded in County Antrim during the survey and were less frequent in County Tyrone. The survey technique is not a census and so the sample survey gives an estimate of 14,000 hares for Northern Ireland, with lower 95 per cent. confidence limit of 7,000 and an upper confidence limit of 25,200.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.2/4">Professor Montgomery concludes, &quot;That the population of Irish hares appears to be stable, albeit at a low density.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".652W.2/5">The contract also required the Queen's University Team to make recommendations for practical measures which could improve the status of the Irish Hare in the medium to long term. One of the recommendations was as follows: &quot;Removal of the Irish Hare from the quarry list and protection given under the Wildlife Order.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".652W.2/6">In the Irish Hare Species Action Plan, published by DOE in October 2000, a number of actions are listed for consideration. Section 5 deals with Policy and Legislation and Action 5.1.3 recommends that DOE &quot;Review, and if necessary, increase the level of protection given to the Irish Hare in the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985&quot;. My Department has appointed consultants to consider the implications of local Biodiversity Action Plan recommendations on the legal status of species, including the Irish hare, and recommend changes where appropriate. I will ensure that the consultants give very careful consideration to Professor Montgomery's recommendation to remove the Irish Hare from the quarry list. The report resulting from this contract is due in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.2/7">My Department will consider carefully any changes which are proposed to the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985 Schedules or to the Game Preservation Act (NI) 1928 (as amended by the Game LawAmendment Act 1951 and The Game Preservation (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 2002) and will bring forward any amendments considered necessary in the usual way.</p>

I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to The House on the results of the survey.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.2/2">The Irish hare, Lepus timidus hibernicus, is an endemic sub-species, confined to Ireland, of the mountain hare, which has a widespread distribution across northern Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.2/3">The best evidence available suggests a major decline in Irish hare numbers in Northern Ireland during the latter half of the 20th century. This decline has been largely attributed to a loss of suitable habitat brought about mainly by agricultural intensification and changing patterns of grassland management.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.2/4">A comprehensive estimate of the population density of Irish hares throughout Northern Ireland was published in 1997. That survey reported that the Irish hare had a widespread distribution and occurred at low densities.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.2/5">The Environment and Heritage Service responded to the findings of the report by publishing a Species Action Plan in 2000 that listed a number of specific measures geared &quot;to maintain the existing range and to demonstrate a population increase by 2005; and to double the present population by 2010 over as much of the range as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".653W.2/6">To assess achievement of the Species Action Plan targets, and to have current information on the distribution and abundance of Irish hares, requires a system of regular and effective monitoring of population density and distribution.</p>

It also assesses the merits of two survey techniques and makes recommendations for future Irish hare monitoring.

	<p pid=".657W.2/1">Our increased investment in personal social services in England in recent years will benefit people with autism as well as everyone else who needs them. Details are set out in the table. Amounts for specific conditions are not separately identified within allocations to social services departments. Health bodies and local authorities should ensure that the particular health and social care needs of each person with autism and Asperger's Syndrome are met with genuine choices for both clients and families, through the most appropriate community based services, in a cost-effective way.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/2">In 1999&ndash;2000, we introduced the new children's services grant, whose purpose is to help local authorities implement the Quality Protects programme and in particular to improve the life chances of looked after children and children in need. Disabled children, including those with autism, have been made a priority area in the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/3">Since the carers grant was introduced in 1999, it has provided an extra &pound;225 million over four years to increase the number of breaks for carers. In recognition of the importance placed on supporting carers, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, announced in July 2002 that the grant has been extended for a further three years to 2005&ndash;06. During this time it will provide extended care and 130,000 further breaks to carers.</p>

Industry estimates suggest that up to 5 per cent. of the market may be affected, indicating a value in the region of &pound;16.75 million.</p>

	<p pid=".670W.3/1">Disabled children receive a range of care and support from the national health service and social services departments. This includes: medical and nursing support; family support, including short-term breaks and domiciliary care; advice and guidance; residential provision; self-care and independent skills training; drop-in clubs and groups; activities at family centres and transition support services.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.3/2">As part of the Government's &pound;885 million &quot;Quality Protects&quot; programme, we set national objectives for children's social services. Through inspections monitoring and annual reviews, the Department's social services inspectorate monitors progress by individual authorities towards the achievement of these objectives. They include specific sub-objectives for disabled children, which are a priority area in the &quot;Quality Protects&quot; programme.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.3/3">Last year's &quot;Quality Protects&quot; management action plans (MAPS) show that local authorities are beginning to improve the services they provide to disabled children, including the provision of more family support services, such as home-based respite care and sitting services, and better planning and delivery of services jointly with health and education. There has also been an increase in the number of families being supported. In late 2001, the children in need survey found that social services were supporting 29,700 disabled children: a 2 per cent. increase on the position in 2000. The introduction of direct payments for parents with disabled children is enabling greater choice and greater control over the way services are delivered. Next year, in 2003&ndash;04, the &quot;Quality Protects&quot; money earmarked for disabled children will double: from &pound;15 million to &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.3/4">We are also increasing the provision of short-term breaks through the carers' grant, which was first introduced in 1999 in order to provide breaks for carers, including parents of disabled children. Last year children's social services provided 52,400 carers with short-term breaks funded by this grant: an increase of 21,400 from the previous year. The majority of those receiving a short-term break were parents of disabled children. The grant is increasing on a yearly basis. This year the grant is &pound;85 million. Next year it will rise to &pound;100 million, and by 2005&ndash;06 it will have risen to &pound;185 million.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.3/5">The Government are providing funding to Contact a Family, of &pound;500,00 per annum, to run a national information centre for parents of disabled children. The free 0808 national telephone help and advice line has been widely used. In the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>, it had received nearly 9,000 calls. By the end of 2004, it is estimated that this figure will have risen to 21,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".670W.3/6">Ministers and officials hold regular discussions with groups representing parents of disabled children about the development and implementation of policy including the implementation of the &quot;Quality Protects&quot; programme and the development of the children's national service framework (NSF). We have set up an external working group to develop NSF standards for disabled children. This includes two parents of disabled children and representatives from the Council for Disabled Children, Contact a Family, SCOPE, MENCAP and the Association of Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus.</p>

	<p pid=".674W.14/4" class="indent">Estimates for council taxes are based on the analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2000&ndash;01&quot; produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on April 19th 2002 and in Economic Trends in the May 2002 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Family Expenditure Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.14/5" class="indent">The attached table shows the estimated gross and net council tax for all households in Great Britain and for each income decile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. As council tax does not exist in Northern Ireland, the figures shown relate to Great Britain only. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less benefits and discounts.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.14/6" class="indent">Council tax benefit is available to low income households to help them meet their local tax liability. The Family Expenditure Survey collects data on the amount of council tax benefit received by households who take up their entitlement. Where a household reports taking up their council tax benefit entitlement, this has been deducted from the council tax liability to produce the net figures.</p>

The Inland Revenue has a number of systems and operational processes in place to continually validate and review the accuracy of each National Insurance record. The Government's plans to encourage more employers to submit payroll data electronically should also help to improve the accuracy of National Insurance records. In addition to the routine validation checks, the Inland Revenue visit employers to check the accuracy of their records, guard against fraud and to provide support to help them get things right.</p>

This accounts for almost all of the change seen in Table B9. These revisions are balanced by changes in the public expenditure element of tax credits, and have no overall impact on the current balance or net borrowing. In 2003&ndash;04, the tax credit line in Table B17 (&pound;11.7 billion) mainly consists of the public expenditure elements of the new tax credits (&pound;7.6 billion) and child allowances in Income Support and Jobseekers' Allowance (&pound;3.7 billion).

	<p pid=".684W.0/1">The small percentage of miscalculations in assessing applications for Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) arise for a variety of reasons, most commonly problems with the accuracy of the calculation of weekly or monthly earnings in the period leading up to the application. For the new Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, which supersede WFTC, entitlement is not based on earnings for a specified period immediately before the claim. Therefore, the reason for miscalculation within WFTC should be eliminated in future.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.0/2">For the 2001&ndash;02 financial year, the latest full year for which figures are available, over 90 per cent. of all WFTC applications were correctly assessed to the nearest penny. In those cases where a miscalculation is detected, action is taken to correct all underpayments and any overpayments that exceed one pound per week. No information is available on the cost of correcting these mistakes. As confirmed by the National Audit Office, the level of errors made in assessing WFTC applications is low in proportion to the aggregate amount paid.</p>

We have already demonstrated this support through our securing exemption from the Climate Change Levy for electricity generated from CMM in last year's budget, and this is currently being cleared with the European Commission. In addition, we concluded from our investigations that the environmental benefits of CMM-use can also be rewarded using the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and hence we support the study DEFRA has commissioned to determine a baseline for CMM emissions that could enable it to qualify for this Scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.6/2">The 3.4GHz licence packaging was designed to increase competition and availability of broadband services across the UK. The licence regions were drawn up following market and economic studies to be as economically viable and inclusive as possible, maximising the potential development of sustainable wireless services and the broadband market throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.6/3">Dividing up spectrum at 3.4GHz along the lines of funded regions, as suggested by the Welsh National Assembly, would produce more areas of the UK with no coverage. It would also lead to a lower capacity&mdash;that is, fewer broadband customers in Wales who can be supported, given the spectrum available.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.9/2">Consultation on the allocation of 3.4GHz public fixed wireless access (PFWA) licences began on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-19">19 December 2000</phrase>, when the Radiocommunications Agency (&quot;RA&quot;), on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, published a consultative document entitled &quot;3.4 and 10 GHz: Scenarios for Spectrum Packaging and Delivery&quot;. This consultation document presented a number of scenarios for packaging and delivering licences to establish and use stations and apparatus for wireless telegraphy in the 3.4 and 10GHz bands for the provision of Fixed Wireless Access services (&quot;FWA&quot;).</p>
	<p pid=".687W.9/3">Following a detailed review of the responses to the December consultation document and the completion of further technical studies in the 3.4GHz and 10GHz bands a further consultation document, &quot;PFWA: Proposal by the RA to package and deliver licences at 3.4GHz&quot;, published in April 2002, set out the proposal to award spectrum licences for the 3.4GHz band.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.9/4">Both consultations were carried out nationally and all Government Departments and devolved Administrations were invited, along with industry and the public, to be involved and comment on the proposals. Among the many comments received and meetings held, RA received input and held discussions with officials of the National Assembly for Wales on numerous occasions. This included a proposal from the Welsh Assembly Government for two licences to match EU objective funding areas in Wales. This proposal was included in the public consultation process alongside those of the Scottish Administration and RA.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.9/5">Of the responses to the consultation, only one industry response expressed support for the proposals from the devolved Administrations, MLL, a telecoms provider with operations in Wales. One industry response to Government's consultation commented &quot;creating two purely Welsh regions could result in insufficient market potential in viable geographic coverage spreads to justify serious bidding&quot;. The Welsh Advisory Committee on Telecommunications, part of the Welsh National Assembly, also expressed support.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.9/6">Since the timetable of the award was announced there have been representations from Welsh National Assembly members about licence areas. Further consideration has been given to this issue but I believe the packaging, which has been accepted by the majority of industry, will produce the best outcome both for Wales and for the UK as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.9/7">In particular, it will enable a larger number of users to be supported in Wales, given the spectrum available, than the alternative proposal.</p>

Each programme funds a number of projects.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.2/2">I believe that my hon. Friend has a particular interest in the LINK Basic Technologies for Industrial Applications programme. Within this programme, all projects are assessed by an independent panel against the criteria for support for the programme, which are included in the guidance notes to applicants and published on the programme website at <a href="http://www.basictechnologies.gov.uk">www.basictechnologies.gov.uk</a>. Aspects considered in assessing project proposals include: the level of innovation including the potential for a step-change in industrial capability; the risks and likely rewards in using the new technology; the feasibility of the proposed approach; the quality, relevant expertise and resources of the consortium; the range of potential beneficiaries; the strength of the UK science base in the technical areas involved; the potential for lasting benefit to UK capability beyond the life of the project; and the level of wider industrial interest.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.2/3">The programme coordinator provides feedback on the panel's recommendations to all applicants and has been asked to point out both the strengths and weaknesses in the proposal in line with the assessment criteria above. Where possible, guidance is also provided to the unsuccessful applicants on other possible sources of funding where these can be identified. As 140 outline proposals were received under the current call, it was not possible to provide immediate detailed written feedback to all applicants. However, applicants could telephone or e-mail the coordinator for further feedback on the panel's recommendation and over 50 consortia did. With funds available to offer support to less than 20 projects, only the projects which best met all the criteria were invited to come forward as full proposals and inevitably some good projects were rejected.</p>

	<p pid=".690W.2/3">Initial outline proposals, consisting of a 3-page project description with a covering application form, are submitted to the programme co-ordinators by the advertised closing date. These proposals are then circulated to an appraisal panel of independent industrial and academic experts, who assess the proposals against the programme's criteria for support, in particular, the degree of innovation and the potential long-term wider benefit for UK productivity. The panel, which has an independent chairman from industry, meets to review the proposals and recommends those which it considers should come forward as full proposals, bearing in mind the funds available for commitment. The project applicants are then informed of the panel's recommendation by e-mail. A telephone contact number and e-mail address are provided for applicants who wish to seek further feedback or discuss the panel's recommendation. The target for the process from closing date to notification is 30 working days, which was achieved in the call currently under way which involved 140 applications.

The full application consists of a 10-page project description with technical annexes plus a LINK summary application form and application forms from each of the consortium members summarising company and financial information. The full proposals are again circulated to the appraisal panel and additional input is sought from other experts where appropriate. The panel meets to review all the proposals and recommends to DTI those which should be supported. The proposals are ranked to enable the available funds to be assigned to the strongest proposals. The applicants are notified of the recommendations of the panel which indicate that, subject to satisfactory financial arrangements being completed, the project will be offered grant support. The target to complete the process from closing date to notification is 40 working days.</p>

	<p pid=".691W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-26">26 February</phrase> I made the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations which will update and consolidate the regulation of security in the UK's civil nuclear industry. The regulations carry forward the main substance of the current regulatory regime, but bring the existing requirements together to provide a single, comprehensive legislative basis for regulation. They set requirements for the protection of nuclear and radiological material, whether on sites or in transit, against the risks of theft or sabotage, and for the protection of sensitive nuclear information, such as site security arrangements and proliferation-sensitive information.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.8/2">The regulations were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February</phrase> and most of the provisions are due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-22">22 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.8/3">It is likely that the regulations will lead to minor additional one-off compliance costs to industry as a whole of around &pound;190,000, and annually recurring costs to industry as a whole of around &pound;115,000. There are also likely to be minor additional one-off costs to Government. The likely costs and benefits of the regulations are set out in a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Copies of this were placed in the Libraries of the House when the regulations were laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.8/4">Seven additional posts were made available in the Office for Civil Nuclear Security from 2002&ndash;03, to increase capacity in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001 and in anticipation of the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 coming into force.</p>

The second round, in the summer, will focus on how the NDA might work with stakeholders with a view to developing a draft stakeholder engagement framework which the NDA can build on once it is in place. This programme of regional events supplements existing arrangements for bilateral dialogue with stakeholders through the BNFL Stakeholder Dialogue and regular meetings with the nuclear regulators, trade unions, BNFL and UKAEA staff, Interested local authorities, environmental groups and the local liaison committees for individual sites.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.0/2">The Home Secretary is sympathetically considering a request from the Attorney General (which has the support of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice) to add certain racially aggravated offences to the scheme. This request followed a specific recommendation in a report of a thematic inspection of casework with an ethnic minority dimension, conducted by Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.0/3">An amendment was tabled during the Committee Stage of the Courts Bill in another place, to add burglary to the scheme, but this was defeated on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-18">18 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.0/4">The Home Secretary will continue to consider whether any additional offences should be added, and will liaise fully with the Attorney General, Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice in such deliberations.</p>

	<p pid=".698W.3/2">From November 2002, the Home Department has been responsible for The Queen's Golden Jubilee Award (for voluntary service by groups in the community). This new, annual Award, which was launched in April 2002, is for outstanding voluntary groups of two or more people who have been operating in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, normally for a period of three years or more. Winning groups and the individuals who nominated them for consideration will be informed in confidence shortly before the public announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-02">2 June 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/3" class="italic">The Philip Lawrence Awards</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/4">The Philip Lawrence Awards were established in 1996. They celebrate annually outstanding citizenship in their communities by young people. They are awarded in November or December of each year.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/5" class="italic">Home Office Police Research Award Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/6">The Home Office Police Research Awards have been granted every year since 1987. The Awards provide Home Office funding and support for police staff to carry out research and/or development projects. All individuals submitting an application are provided with feedback. Those who are successful undergo an induction training event whilst those who are unsuccessful are given suggestions, if and when appropriate, on how to improve their proposals for a future application.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/7">Host police force areas are notified together with the candidates. <i>The Ferrers Trophy</i></p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/8">The Ferrers Trophy is awarded annually to the 'National Special of the Year'. There are also awards for Highly Commended and Team entries. They are open to all special constables and teams of special constables in England and Wales. The awards ceremony is held in June of each year.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/9" class="italic">The Tilley Award</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/10">The Tilley Award is open to all United Kingdom police forces for excellence in problem oriented policing. It was established in 1999. Winners and runners up are notified of the results in July with a formal announcement in September of each year.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/11">The Prison Service has several award schemes for staff and prisoners. For staff they are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/12" class="italic">Butler Trust&mdash;Greening award</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/13">A new award for staff who have contributed towards improving the Prison Service's environmental performance was announced in August 2002 and the first winners will be presented with their awards in late March.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/14" class="italic">Staff Ideas Themed Competition &quot;Making Prisons Greener&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/15">In September 2001, the Prison Service launched its second central staff ideas themed competition &quot;Making Prisons Greener&quot;. All the ideas have been featured in more detail in the Greening Operations Team's quarterly newsletter and in its annual environmental report published in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/16" class="italic">Design a poster competition</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/17">The Prison Service, as part of its campaign to promote awareness of environmental matters among staff, launched a design a poster competition in 2001. This was aimed at staff and their families who were asked to submit designs for greening and energy efficiency posters to be used across the Service. The winning designs were used to produce posters that have been distributed to every prison and Service Headquarters.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/18" class="italic">The Elton Trophy Competition</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/19">The Elton Trophy Competition is an annual award scheme rewarding highly creditable performance in prison workshops. Eligibility for nomination was restricted to industrial workshops until 2002 when the scope was expanded to allow nominations from craft, charity and vocational training workshops.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/20">Commendation awards are also made to individual members of staff directly linked to workshops who have contributed significantly to a workshop's success.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/21">The Prison Service introduced performance arrangements in April 2001. These provide practical guidance on approaches to recognising individual performance outside the staff appraisal system. The arrangements encourage managers to recognise and acknowledge good performance by their staff. The methods suggested vary from a simple &quot;thank you&quot;, to the award of vouchers to one-off financial rewards. There are a number of strands to the arrangements and consist of the following:</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/22" class="italic">Prison Officer of the Year Award</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/23">This is an annual event introduced in 2002 as a method of &quot;recognising, rewarding and celebrating the outstanding achievements of prison officers throughout the Service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/24" class="italic">Butler Trust Award</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/25">The Trust was established as a registered charity in 1985 to promote and encourage positive prison regimes. An independent annual award scheme was set up to recognise exceptionally dedicated and often creative work undertaken by any person working in the Prison Service. The Service's performance recognition arrangements encourage nominations for the award.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/26" class="italic">Staff Ideas Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/27">Staff are encouraged to contribute to the Ideas Scheme which has been extant for a number of years. The scheme exists on two tiers. Firstly, there is local consideration of ideas specific to the local working environment. Secondly, there is national consideration of service-wide ideas that would have implications for policy or regular working practice. The objective of the scheme is to improve policy developments and make practices and procedures more effective and cost-efficient. Ideas are recognised with monetary awards from &pound;25 up to &pound;3,000, or with a small encouragement gift such as a pen.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/28">Prisoner award schemes for prisoners consist of the following:</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/29" class="italic">Bricklaying Competition</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/30">The Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit (PLSU) based in the Department for Education and Skills contributes towards annual bricklaying competitions for prisoners. These competitions, which are recognised by UK Skills, are administered using National Skills Competition guidelines and judged independently by the Guild of Bricklayers. The winning team from the Scottish Prison Service Competition is invited to compete in the final for prisons in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/31" class="italic">Koestler Award Trust</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/32">PLSU also supports the Koestler Award Trust, which runs an annual competition in a wide range of creative arts for those in prisons, young offender institutions, high security psychiatric hospitals and secure units. 64 judges, working for free, send critical comments to the entrants which encourages communication between the artist, the Trust and the Education Co-ordinator and tutors in establishments. The work is judged in May and June and certificates sent to the award-winners in July. Award cheques are sent to Governors to be credited to the prisoner's private cash.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/33">Koestler's annual exhibition of award-winning work is held in September.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/34" class="italic">Windlesham Trophy</p>
	<p pid=".698W.3/35">The Windlesham Trophy is awarded every year to the prison judged to have the best kept gardens. The scheme includes individual commendation awards. These recognise exceptional talent, or an outstanding contribution to a garden's success, or input into prisoner training or rehabilitation. The competition is open to all prison establishments in England and Wales. The results are published throughout the Prison Service in the first week of August each year. The Royal Horticultural Society provides a panel of three experts to judge the final round. There is press interest local to the winning establishment, and occasional interest from national and specialist gardening press.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.2/2">In the event of any overseas nuclear incident (arising from an accident or a deliberate act) the Government's National Response Plan for Overseas Nuclear Accidents and RIMNET would be activated. A copy of this plan is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/3">The UK Government would expect to receive notification of such an incident via the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), European Commission Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE), bilateral agreements between Governments for exchange of information (France, Denmark, Holland, Norway and Russia are signatories) or an alert from one or more of the 93 gamma dose rate monitoring sites that comprise the UK's national radiation monitoring network (RIMNET).</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/4">An assessment of the likely impact of any release of radioactivity on the UK would be made immediately using all available information together with dispersion prediction modelling provided by the Meteorological Office. Using global weather information the current and forecast meteorological scenario would provide early estimates of the trajectory and the time of impact in the UK. This information when combined with environmental monitoring will allow the Government to assess projected levels of contamination and likely coverage.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/5">A Technical Co-ordination Centre would be set up in the purpose-built Defra emergency room in London, from where a team of officials experienced in dealing with emergencies would co-ordinate the response to the incident. Public information and advice based on this information would be prepared and distributed from the Technical Co-ordination Centre to all the authorities and organisations with responsibilities for protecting the public and the environment including those on the Isle of Wight if the island was likely to be affected.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.5/1">Information on the number of employers in the United Kingdom who are found to have employed illegal immigrants is not collected centrally and therefore not available.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.5/2">Information on persons proceeded against for employing a person subject to immigration control is contained in the attached table and published annually in the Command publication &quot;Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom&quot;, which is available in the Library and from the Home Office website: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.5/3">We recognised in our White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&quot; that section 8 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1996 had not proved to be an effective deterrent in the prevention of illegal migrant working. We also outlined in our White Paper a new and comprehensive strategy for tackling the damaging consequences of illegal working which addressed the root of the problem. Work is on-going in three areas: strengthening present enforcement arrangements; facilitating effective joint working across Government; and working with business and trade unions to improve compliance.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.5/4">In November 2002, I established an Illegal Working Steering Group, which includes representatives from a range of business sectors, the Trades Union's Congress and Commission for Racial Equality. The group has the potential to become a key player in the prevention of illegal working, by ensuring that there is greater awareness of the problems that this form of illegality creates. The group will also be involved in ensuring that the guidance for complying with the amended legislation will be clear, concise and practical.</p>

	<p pid=".709W.2/1">Information is not available in the form requested, as costs of health care have not been identified separately in the past. A report by the Joint Prison Service and National Health Service Executive Working Group &quot;The Future Organisation of Prison Health Care&quot; in 1999, estimated that that Prison Service establishments spent about &pound;85 million on prisoners' health care in 1997&ndash;98. A questionnaire completed by establishments in 2002&ndash;03 estimated that the cost of healthcare in English prison establishments in 2002&ndash;03 was about &pound;113 million, although these two figures are not directly comparable. The following is a breakdown of questionnaire returns by prison establishment. For private prisons, payments are made for the contracted service and the health care element is not separately identified.</p>

	<p pid=".716W.6/1">The extent to which childcare commitments contribute directly to ability to work is a complex issue. Lone parents who work, as well as those who do not, report child care as a barrier to work. In a recent survey 52 per cent. of non-working lone parents reported a lack of child care in their area, compared to 45 per cent. of working lone parents; and 53 per cent. of non-working lone parents did not want to leave their child with anyone else, compared to 44 per cent. of working lone parents.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.6/2">Information on the percentage of lone parents who have to give up work due to lack of available child care is not available. The most common reasons given for giving up work are health (27 per cent.), a personal decision to leave (15 per cent.) and being made redundant (12 per cent.). 6 per cent. of lone parents gave the breakdown of their child care arrangements as the reason for leaving work, but this does not mean necessarily that there was no child care available.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.6/3">The New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) is providing specialist advice and support, including help with child care, to help lone parents make the move into work. Recent evaluation has shown that participation in NDLP more than doubles lone parents chances of moving into work. We are making work possible for lone parents by providing available affordable childcare through initiatives such as the National Childcare Strategy and our new Tax Credits are making sure that that work pays.</p>

Information on the funding received by CESI is commercial in confidence. In addition, innovation funding has been made available to Jobcentre Plus Districts to deliver a series of Innovation Laboratories' to stimulate innovation and creativity at a local level.

Liberia is used as a base by rebels fighting in the West of Cote d'Ivoire, and there are large numbers of Liberian mercenaries fighting for both sides.

Liberia remains a serious threat to the stability of the sub-region. It has been involved in incursions into Guinea and is now being used as a base by rebels in Cote d'Ivoire. The sanctions are focused specifically on President Taylor and his ministers. We believe that they should be maintained until Liberia ends its efforts to destabilise the region.</p>

	<p pid=".729W.5/1">The Government conducted a consultation exercise following publication of Sir Robin Auld's Review of the Criminal Courts. This informed the White Paper &quot;Justice for All&quot; published in July 2002 in which the Government said it wanted the unified courts administration to be developed by those closest to the business. As a result, the Central Council of Magistrates' Courts' Committees and the Association of Justices' Chief Executives both sit on the steering group overseeing the development of the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.5/2">Local consultation is a key part of the overall consultation process. A series of one-day discussion groups across the country is being run by my Department. Court users, the local magistracy, the judiciary and court staff are represented on these groups. They are considering, amongst other things, include how the size and membership of court administration councils might vary across the country according to local circumstances, and how these members should be appointed. The results from these groups will be fed into the development of the court administration councils and will also be reported to Parliament during the parliamentary passage of the Courts Bill.</p>

The choices facing poor countries, particularly around equity of access to treatment are difficult. In our view an open debate in countries, involving all sectors of society, will be critical in determining those priorities and responses.

	<p pid=".731W.3/1">According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), over 500,000 people have been displaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the beginning of 2002, due mainly to intensified violence in the north-eastern Ituri and eastern South Kivu regions Despite the ceasefire and withdrawal of foreign troops, over 2.5 million of about 50 million Congolese are now displaced. Main causes have been fighting between rebel groups, attacks on civilians and resource plundering. Current UN OCHA statistics as at August 2002 show the following breakdown of internally displaced people (IDPs): Equateur: 85,000 IDPs; Orientale: 250,000 IDPs; North Kivu: 760,000 IDPs; South Kivu: 435,000 IDPs; Katanga: 415,000 IDPs; Maniema: 160,000 IDPs; Eastern Kasai &amp; Western Kasai: 130,000 IDPs; Kinshasa: 40,000 IDPs. This does not take into account the more recent displacements since then including those as a result of the recent fighting in Ituri and in Bunia.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.5/1">So far, 26 countries out of a total of 37 eligible countries have qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and will receive over US$62 billion in debt relief. Of these, seven countries (Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda) have reached Completion Point and have received irrevocable debt relief. The remaining 19 (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) are receiving interim relief on their debt repayments. We expect the bulk of these countries to reach Completion Point within the next two years when they, too, will receive full debt relief. It is difficult to predict when the other 11 countries will qualify for HIPC relief, as many are still affected by conflict and governance problems. We expect the Democratic Republic of the Congo to reach its Decision Point in the coming months, and the Central African Republic, Comoros and Cote d'lvoire to do so later this year but, in some cases, this will depend on progress towards peace. The remaining countries (Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) are a long way from qualifying, as they are affected by conflict or have serious governance concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".733W.2/1">The enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is based on a set of clear and transparent rules, which countries entering the Initiative must meet. The IMF and the World bank work jointly with the governments of eligible countries on a debt sustainability analysis to determine their levels of debt. To qualify for relief, a country must have a debt sustainability ratio above one or other of the following HIPC thresholds: a debt stock of more than 150 per cent. of exports or of more than 250 per cent. of government revenue. Relief is provided to bring debt ratios down to these levels. This analysis is based on actual data on average exports over the previous three years and on central government revenues over the most recent year. Debt ratios reflect the impact of HIV/AIDS, droughts, and external shocks, such as changes in commodity prices, on a country's economy. Under the HIPC Initiative, additional relief&mdash;so called 'topping up'&mdash;can, when appropriate, be provided at Completion Point to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The UK is pressing for greater flexibility to ensure that this is provided wherever it is needed.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.2/1">Zambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe have been deeply affected by a food security crisis brought about in part by an HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. This crisis has increased the number of people in poverty and deepened the poverty of those already poor. There are significant challenges in establishing and targeting households that are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, not least because of the stigma attached to the disease. There is also significant variation of need and general agreement that income support per se would therefore not be the most effective assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.2/2">Vulnerability assessments for all six countries show that HIV/AIDS affected households suffer from depletion of assets, reduced income, and increased expenditure on health and funerals, and that the presence of orphans decreases food security and other resources in already stressed households. HIV/AIDS affected households need support to counteract these impacts. This could be provided through home-based care that included community support, basic health care, sufficient food, help with income generation and assistance with access to education. DFID is working with governments in the region to reduce the vulnerability of poor households by improving rural livelihoods, strengthening community safety nets and delivering more and better basic services, taking particular account of the needs of households affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid=".736W.0/1">My Department has provided &pound;12.5 million for research into indigenous staples (sorghum and millet) in Southern African countries over the last 10 years. We have supported the inclusion of sorghum and millet in seed packs distributed during the humanitarian crisis.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.0/2">While sorghum and millet are more drought resistant than maize there is a problem of sustainability due to a general preference for maize. This affects the marketability of sorghum and millet and the extent to which they can become a part of a country's longer-term food strategy. We are following closely a joint CARE/FAO study in Zambia, which is assessing future market opportunities for sorghum and millet.</p>

These required local housing authorities to take a more strategic approach to preventing and tackling homelessness, placed stronger duties on authorities to help homeless people, and extended the groups of homeless applicants who have a priority need for accommodation, including, among others, people vulnerable as a result of fleeing their home because of violence. The Homelessness Directorate will be allocating &pound;70 million in 2003&ndash;04 to local authorities to help them address homelessness. This will include some support for domestic violence schemes where local authorities have identified this as a priority.</p>
	<p pid=".738W.2/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also announced at the end of last year a &pound;7 million capital investment programme through the Housing Corporation to extend and renovate the national network of women's refuges in England. Initial allocations are being agreed with the Housing Corporation for 2003&ndash;04 and it is hoped that further schemes will be supported in the following two years.</p>
	<p pid=".738W.2/5">The Supporting People programme, which begins on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April</phrase>, will put in place a new integrated policy and funding framework for housing-related support services, including those for people experiencing domestic violence. Current annual expenditure is &pound;34 million for a total of 5,000 places. Local authorities have now submitted their shadow Supporting People strategies. These are currently being analysed and will provide valuable data on the supply of refuge and support services for people experiencing domestic violence, so helping to inform and direct future action.</p>
	<p pid=".738W.2/6">Supporting People guides have also been issued on addressing the accommodation and support needs of households experiencing domestic violence; and two dedicated co-ordinators are working with providers and local authorities to ensure that the sector is prepared for the new programme.</p>

There were no changes in funding and function between 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000 that needed reflecting in adjusted grants for 1998&ndash;99 to allow a like-for-like comparison; the actual 1998&ndash;99 values have therefore been used in this case.</p>
	<p pid=".741W.5/3">In 2003&ndash;04, SSAs were replaced with Formula Spending Shares (FSSs). The 2003&ndash;04 total FSS figure has been compared to the FSS comparitor for 2002&ndash;03 in order to give a like-for-like comparison. The FSS comparitor for 2002&ndash;03 is similar to the adjusted 2002&ndash;03 SSA but with the increased resource equalisation also applied.</p>
	<p pid=".741W.5/4">The adjusted 1997&ndash;98 total SSA figure for Torbay was calculated using the same formulae as for other education authorities, but assuming that the <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase> Local government reorganisations occurred a year earlier.</p>

	<p pid=".749W.2/1">Independent research &quot;The Evaluation of the Low Cost Home Ownership Programme&quot; commissioned by the former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (now the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) and the Welsh Assembly Government was published in September 2002. Shared ownership was one of the components of the study, and the main messages from the research were that consumer satisfaction with low cost home ownership schemes was high and that schemes represented good value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".749W.2/2">The issues will now be taken forward by the Home Ownership Task Force announced in &quot;Sustainable communities: building for the future&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-05">5 February</phrase>. The terms of reference for the task force will be announced shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".750W.0/1">The available information is in the following tables. The figures given are for formula grant, which comprises revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and Standard Service Assessment reduction grants (where appropriate).</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/2">There have been many changes to the functions and funding of local government services over the last ten years, and like-for-like comparisons of grants between years cannot be made for years when changes have taken place unless figures are adjusted to take account of the changes.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/3">For years from 1999&ndash;2000, adjusted figures for individual shire county councils exist because they were needed to allow like-for-like comparisons as part of the floors and ceilings calculations.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/4">For years before 1999&ndash;2000, adjusted grant figures for individual shire county councils do not exist. A like-for-like comparison between 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000 can, however, be made using unadjusted figures. This is because there were no changes in function or funding between 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000 that needed reflecting by adjusting the grant figures for 1998&ndash;99.</p>
