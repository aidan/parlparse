	<p pid="a.423W.9/1">The provisions to which the hon. Member refers form part of a proposal from the European Commission for a new control regulation which was published last November. The original proposal was for sales notes to be submitted electronically by all buyers within two hours of sale. We have sought stakeholders' views on this and all other aspects of the proposal. In a revised proposal, recently published by the Commission after discussions with member states, the time limit for the submission of sales notes has been increased to six hours and an exemption has been provided from the need to submit sales notes electronically for businesses with an annual financial turnover in fisheries products of less than 200,000 euros. This revised proposal will be subject to further negotiation with member states and will not be adopted before October at the earliest. I would point out that failure by a buyer to comply with requirements relating to the submission of sales notes would not result in vessels being required to stop fishing.</p>

Their latest report relating to 2008 found that the global collective effort is yielding results and that progress is being made globally towards achieving many of the MDGs even in some of the more challenging regions. A number of targets are expected to be reached by their target dates in 2015. The report is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.433W.0/1">Since October 2008, more than 284,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) have been registered in Government controlled IDP camps. Freedom of movement is denied in the camps except for some vulnerable groups and the elderly. The remaining IDPs are under military guard. Protection in the camps is a matter of concern. The Department for International Development (DFID) is particularly concerned for the war wounded, malnourished and those separated from their families&mdash;including unaccompanied children. The camps are overcrowded and have poor water and sanitation facilitates. Hospitals, such as those in Vavuniya and Mannar, are also overcrowded, having more patients than they can effectively treat.</p>

Unfortunately, since initial discussions earlier this year the Government of Eritrea has twice refused to have human rights included on the Article 8 Dialogue agenda for discussion.</p>

	<p pid="a.439W.8/1">During the recent conflict in Sri Lanka there have been many conflicting reports of the number of civilians killed by both sides, particularly in the final weeks of the fighting. As the conflict took place without independent monitoring and with severe restrictions on the media, it is very difficult to estimate the number of casualties or who were responsible. As such, we fully endorse the EU's call for an independent inquiry into the recent conflict in Sri Lanka. This would play an important part in the post-conflict reconciliation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.441W.8/2"><i> </i>Through its Global Political Agreement (GPA), the Inclusive Government (IG) has committed itself to a package of reforms that will restore security and welfare to Zimbabwe's people, and promote respect for human rights and the rule of law. It has made an effective start to this work: a credible short term economic recovery plan (STERP) has been published and is beginning to be acted upon, and the payment of public workers has seen some civic organs functioning again. However several vital aspects of the GPA remain to be implemented; the continued harassment of human rights defenders, arbitrary arrests and intimidation, increased farm invasions and lack of press freedom all remain a concern. Without major progress in these areas the IG will not have kept its promises to the Zimbabwean people, and the international community will be unable fully to re-engage with Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.441W.8/3">Tensions and differences of attitude to reform and its pace remain; not surprising when the IG brings together erstwhile political foes. We will continue to look actively for ways of supporting the IG in its efforts to achieve reforms, offering assistance which promotes and strengthens positive change. We are in regular contact with the Government to discuss how this can best be achieved and maintain close dialogue on this with our EU and international partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.451W.7/1">The visit of the Cabinet to Southampton on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-23">23 February 2009</phrase> was one of several ministerial visits across the region; there was a public engagement event with around 140 local people and a formal Cabinet meeting. The cost of the public engagement event and the Cabinet meeting was approximately &pound;103,802, excluding VAT. This figure includes the cost of hiring the venue, catering, associated security and delegate management. There are no separate figures for the Cabinet meeting. In addition, Departments and agencies will have incurred costs in terms of travel, staff time and other support. The cost of any security provided by the police is a matter for the relevant police force.</p>

One application was from the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI). The ENFSI group has been awarded EC funding to improve the efficiency of DNA data exchange throughout Europe. In order to do this, it is necessary to build a computer simulation model to determine the current efficiency of DNA databases and to carry out a predictive analysis of the effect of not increasing the number of European core loci (i.e. the number of elements of DNA which are common to different countries' profiling systems).

Such searches are approved only in serious cases and can provide police with a lead on the identity of an offender by providing matches with possible family members.

	<p pid="a.458W.0/1">ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) guidance states that ANPR data may be retained for an initial 90 days after collection for viewing by authorised persons for post crime interrogation and investigation. Data more than 90 days old may then be retained for up to two years if the operational need remains. However these data are partitioned from general viewing, access is only permitted for major and serious investigations and requires authorisation in each case by a senior officer. This is in line with responsibilities under the Data Protection Act (1984 and 1998).</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.0/2">The National ANPR Data Centre is currently under development and test. Once in live operational use, ANPR data will be deleted as required by police forces in discharging their responsibilities under the Act. Data not required to be retained for operational purposes will be deleted automatically after a prescribed period, and this period will be determined through agreement between the Association of Chief Police Officers, the National Policing Improvement Agency and the Information Commissioner's Office.</p>

The decision enables the UK to conduct, alongside the US, a joint Initial Operational Test and Evaluation programme and entails the acquisition of three aircraft, provision of training equipment and support during the trials and a further two years contributions to the Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006. Subject to successful testing, we plan to buy further production aircraft incrementally to build up to Initial and then Full Operating Capability.</p>

Prior to the formation of UCAS in 1994, figures were published separately for the two admission systems, the Universities Central Council on Admissions (UCCA) and the Polytechnic and College Admission Service (PCAS).

			<tr pid="a.473W.3/47"> <td colspan="3"><i> Notes:</i><i>   Consultant main specialty</i><i> </i>This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Care is needed when analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as &quot;acute&quot;). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information. <i> Ungrossed data</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed). Finished Consultant Episode (FCE A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. The figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. <i> Primary diagnosis</i><i> </i>The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. *The following ICD-10 codes have been used: Q20&mdash;Congenital malformations of cardiac chambers and connections Q21&mdash;Congenital malformations of cardiac septa Q22&mdash;Congenital malformations of pulmonary and tricuspid valves Q23&mdash;Congenital malformations of aortic and mitral valves Q24&mdash;Other congenital malformations of heart. <i> Data quality</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Small numbers</i> To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed. <i> PCT/SHA data quality</i> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of ail finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data. <i> Hospital providers</i> A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include Treatment Centres (TC). Treatment Centres (also known as Diagnostic Centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients. Some Treatment Centres are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the health care provider's data. It does this by adding TC to the trust code; if there is more than one per Trust T1, T2, T3 etc. are suggested unless already in use by the trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an 'X'. Hospital providers beginning with an 'N' indicates an independent sector health care provider. <i> Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.478W.8/1">With an innovative system such as the full National Pandemic Flu Service it was essential that there was rigorous scrutiny to ensure that the system would both work and offer value for money to the United Kingdom taxpayer. This inevitably led to some delays in signing the contract with British Telecom. The contract for the development of the system was signed with BT in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.8/2">The contingency arrangements, should the current outbreak spread at a more rapid rate, are that an interim National Pandemic Flu Service has been put in place to supplement the assessment and authorisation processes . The interim service has been tested and consists of a phone service that the public can access through a single 0800 number, and a supporting website application. That will mean that people can have their symptoms assessed either over the phone or online. If it is established that they have developed swine flu, they will be issued with an authorisation number that they will then be able to use to access antivirals in a timely and appropriate way.</p>

It is less effective in preventing respiratory disease, which is the more common form in adults.

For 'Sexual offences' the figure was 300 (6 per cent. of the number of persons bailed for this offence type). For all offences, the figure was 51,500 (11 per cent. of persons bailed) (Criminal Statistics, England and Wales, table 4.10). These figures include those also held in custody for some but not the whole period of the proceedings. These remands data are not comparable with other court proceedings data.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.3/3">The Ministry of Justice holds no data on how many defendants breached their bail conditions. Breach of bail conditions is not an offence and therefore carries no penalty. Any person who breaches a bail condition is liable to immediate arrest and it is the responsibility of the court to re-consider bail as a whole and decide whether to grant bail again on the same or different conditions or to remand into custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.485W.0/1">The number of defendants who were proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for 'violence against the person' and 'sexual offences', England and Wales, for the year 2007 (latest available) can be viewed in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/2">Charging data are not held by the Ministry of Justice, so proceeded against data have been provided in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/3">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/4">Court proceedings data for 2008 will be available in the autumn of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/5">The annual publication &quot;Criminal Statistics&quot; contains estimates of the number of defendants in certain offence groups who were bailed by the courts. The estimated number of defendants who were granted bail at all magistrates courts in England and Wales during 2007 in connection with offences in the &quot;Violence against the person and Sexual offences&quot; groups was 43,200 and 4,800 respectively (Criminal Statistics, England and Wales, table 4.10). These figures include those also held in custody for some but not the whole period of the proceedings. Data for 2008 will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/6">These data are not comparable with the court proceedings data presented elsewhere in this answer, therefore they cannot be used to compute the proportions of defendants granted or refused bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/7">The court may withhold bail if it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail, the defendant would abscond, commit an offence, interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. In making its decision the court must consider all the circumstances of the case as appear to be relevant. This will include the nature and seriousness of the alleged offence and the weight of the evidence against the defendant, the defendant's character, antecedents, associations, community ties and past record of complying with bail, as well as any other factors which appear relevant to the court. Data on bail collected centrally by my Department do not include information on the reasons given for refusing bail. This information would have to be retrieved by inspecting individual court records which could be achieved only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.498W.14/1">Public confidence in the criminal justice system (CJS) is measured using the British crime survey (BCS). In the year to March 2008 44 per cent. of people were confident that the CJS is effective in bringing people who commit crimes to justice. This rose from 39 per cent. in 2003, and met the Government's target for the period 2003&mdash;2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.14/2">The BCS now includes measures of public confidence in both the fairness and the effectiveness of the CJS as a whole. During the period from October 2007 to March 2008, 56 per cent. of people were confident that the CJS as a whole is fair and 37 per cent. were confident that it is effective. From April to December 2008 the level of confidence in fairness increased to 58 per cent., while confidence in effectiveness has so far remained stable.</p>

The number of offenders using high visibility clothing is not recorded. The last period for which figures are available is March, when 76.25 per cent. of the hours worked by offenders on Community Payback projects potentially in view of the public, were undertaken using distinctive clothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.5/2">Exemptions to the use of distinctive clothing may be granted where convincing evidence is provided on the basis of health and safety concerns, or business risk to the organisation benefiting from the work. Probation areas have successfully engaged with beneficiary organisations to increase the proportion of hours worked using distinctive high visibility clothing. The hours worked using distinctive clothing increased from 210,974 hours in December 2008 to 401,680 in March 2009. Distinctive clothing is not worn on work projects taking place on enclose premises, such as workshops, where the work done by offenders is not potentially in view of the public.</p>

The Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 made discrimination and harassment because of sexual orientation unlawful in employment and vocational training. The Government Equalities Office has made a commitment in its business plan for 2009-10 to work in partnership across Government to reduce homophobia in the workplace and to support employers to develop lesbian, gay and bisexual-friendly workplaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.5/2">The Equality Bill, currently before Parliament, will introduces a public sector equality duty, which will require public bodies to consider lesbian, gay and bisexual employees' needs when carrying out their functions.</p>
