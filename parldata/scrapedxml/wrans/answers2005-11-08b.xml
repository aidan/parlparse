In addition, the Department for Education and Skills is awarding small capital grants (from a fund of &pound;20 million a year) to schools with approved school travel plans to enable them to make improvements to school sites that will encourage sustainable travel to school. Both funding for school travel advisers and small capital grants was originally awarded for the period April 2004 to March 2006 but was extended earlier this year to March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.5/1">The OFT is a regulatory body which is charged with certain responsibilities set out in statute. Under the Consumer Credit Act many types of business&mdash;including home credit companies&mdash;have to obtain a licence from the OFT. Under the Competition Act and Enterprise Act the OFT is responsible for competition law.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.5/2">These functions are consistent as the OFT seeks to make markets work well and the CCA and competition powers both contribute to this aim. Therefore it is highly unlikely that any conflict of interest should arise.</p>

Any targets set by the independent adjudicator are a matter for him on the basis of the best information then available.</p>
	<p pid="b.299W.8/2">The pace at which local loops are unbundled is a product of the regulatory framework set by Ofcom; the development of scale processes which is for BT, the industry and the adjudicator within that regulatory framework; and investment decisions by current and prospective LLU operators. I understand that lines are currently being unbundled at the rate of 4,000 a week; a rate that is expected by the adjudicator to rise substantially in the near term as existing broadband operators bulk migrate their customer base to LLU and as significant new operators invest in the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.306W.3/2">The 2003 Act is only one element of the Government's approach to tackling alcohol abuse. For example, the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy is founded on improving education and heath intervention, and the Violent Crime Bill will introduce a new closure power where premises are found to have sold alcohol persistently to people under 18-years-old.</p>

These resources will be allocated to individual countries in line with DFID's resource allocation process. To help inform the decision, DFID uses a financial model to generate suggested allocations for bilateral country programmes. This model takes account of both the extent of a country's poverty and the likely effectiveness of UK aid in reducing that poverty. Vulnerability to economic shocks and the amount of aid which countries are likely to receive from other donors are also taken into account, alongside a number of other factors. Country-by-country, these include the effectiveness of multilateral channels, conflict and reconstruction needs, inequality and social exclusion, our historical engagement and the political environment. In line with our new policy on conditionality, aid allocations are subject to developing country governments' commitment to poverty reduction, sound financial management, and human rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.308W.3/1">The United Kingdom impacts on development through many of its policies, not just those relating to aid. DFID therefore works closely with other Government Departments on issues such as trade, agriculture, migration and security, to improve the development impact of UK policies. DFID works particularly closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) because of its political role and presence in developing countries. We do this through several mechanisms at Whitehall and country level. For example, the global and Africa conflict prevention pools bring together the FCO, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and DFID to improve the UK's response to countries affected by conflict. We post development experts into embassies, and in the case of Sudan, have set up a joint FCO-DFID unit. These mechanisms have helped to promote closer understanding and working between the Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.3/2">UK Government Departments make assessments of their own performance against their objectives (as expressed in their public service agreements (PSA) twice annually. These assessments are published in the departmental reports and autumn performance reports which are available in the Libraries of the House. Where Departments share public service agreement targets, these assessments of progress are made jointly. The FCO therefore makes its own assessment of progress against its PSA target on sustainable development, which is their target most closely related to international development. DFID, the FCO and the MOD make a joint assessment of progress against the shared conflict prevention target, and DFID, the FCO and the Department of Trade and Industry make a joint assessment of progress against the shared target on international trade. The next assessment will be provided in the autumn performance report 2005, which will be published in December.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.3/3">Both DFID and the FCO closely monitor our working relationship and an action plan is in place to improve in collaborative working, both in the UK and overseas. We are reviewing how best to work with the FCO at country level. DFID country offices may be co-located with a British embassy or high commission, or may operate from stand-alone premises, depending on local circumstances. Whether co-located or not, there is close co-operation between the embassy/high commission and the DFID country office. This includes the sharing of analysis of local political, economic and development issues, of mutual benefit to the work of both Departments. Efforts to monitor collaboration at country level forms part of our work on improving the impact of the overall UK policy on development.</p>

	<p pid="b.309W.8/1">A detailed independent review of our humanitarian response in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India has been completed. This confirmed that DFID projects were appropriate to the relief needs of the affected populations, and were effectively implemented in a way which maximised their impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.8/2">DFID has allocated &pound;65 million to meet reconstruction needs in the tsunami affected countries. Of this, &pound;41 million has been committed; the use of the balance will depend on evidence of where this funding can be most appropriately used. Assessment of the use of these funds will begin once they have been fully committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.8/3">The Government of Sri Lanka, together with donors, is currently reviewing the impact of all tsunami recovery programmes. This review is expected to be completed by the end of November, and as well as detailing successes will also identify areas where increased effort is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.8/4">The European Court Authorities are currently evaluating the humanitarian programmes of ECHO (Humanitarian Aid Department of the European Commission). However, their report is not yet available. No assessment has yet been made of EU funded reconstruction programmes as much of this work is still underway.</p>

	<p pid="b.310W.2/1">DFID provides a significant part of its funding directly to Government budgets in support of their overall strategies for poverty reduction (Poverty Reduction Budget Support). DFID provided &pound;339 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;423 million in 2004&ndash;05 in this way. Partner Governments may use some part of this funding directly for TB control activities, or for building up health services to diagnose and treat TB as well as other major causes of ill health. It is not currently possible to provide accurate estimates of the proportion of PRBS which is spent directly on TB control and treatment. This is because national Governments do not have financial accounting systems that trace the proportion of direct budget support spent on individual diseases.</p>

Since then we have set in train some major packages of rationalisation and, as reported in the Stewardship Report on the Defence Estate 2004, we have used the baseline data collected during the Core Sites work to help inform our planning toward an estate of the right size and quality. We are working now on producing a rationalisation plan to cover the whole estate that, once initiated, will facilitate further consolidation of defence activity on to a smaller number of more densely utilised locations. Future operational needs, technological advances, and organisational change will be key factors in our planning for the future estate. Each rationalisation proposal that emerges will be subject to full consultation in the normal way.</p>

	<p pid="b.315W.0/1">The Department is not researching into chemtrails from aircraft as they are not scientifically recognised phenomena. However, condensation trails (contrails) are known to exist and have been documented since the 1940s. Contrails are composed of ice crystals forming on the small particles and water vapour emitted by aircraft as the result of the combustion process, they form behind high-flying aircraft depending on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="b.315W.0/2">A major scientific report, &quot;Aviation and the Global Atmosphere&quot;, was published in 1999 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report assessed the current contribution of aviation to climate change and, based on a range of scenarios and assumptions, forecast its contribution up to 2050. It estimated that contrails covered about 0.1 per cent. of the Earth's surface in 1992 and projected this cover would grow to 0.5 per cent. by 2050 (on middle range assumptions). More recently this work has been updated from the results of the EU 5th Framework Project, TRADEOFF.</p>
	<p pid="b.315W.0/3">Contrails continue to be the subject of research to help better understand both how they are formed and what effects they have on the atmosphere.</p>

	<p pid="b.315W.3/1">The survival of avian influenza viruses in the environment will be influenced by the strain of the virus, whether they are held in water or faeces, the host from which the faeces came, the physical properties of the faeces and the ambient temperature. The scientific literature gives a range, with different strains of virus from 12 to 36 hours at 37C for chicken faeces artificially infected with Low Pathogenic H7N2 to at least 105 days in wet faeces under field conditions with High Pathogenic H5N2.</p>

	<p pid="b.319W.5/1">The Government support the use of woodfuel for the generation of heat, combined heat and power (CHP), and electricity. We are working closely with industry and others to develop markets and promote uptake. Householders and community organisations can apply for funding under DTI's &pound;12.5 million Clear Skies Initiative to install renewable energy schemes, including wood-fuelled boiler systems. Defra's &pound;60 million Community Energy programme provides capital grants to install new and refurbish old community heating networks, including renewable energy systems. DTI and the Big Lottery Fund's Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme has allocated &pound;66 million of funding to develop end-use markets for biomass, including woodfuel, in the heat, CHP and electricity generation sectors. Grants are also available from the regional development agencies. Co-firing of woodfuel with fossil fuels in conventional power stations is a developing end-use. Support to help develop the supply chain for woodfuel has been made available under the &pound;3.5 million Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme. The Community Renewables Initiative's local support teams are working to develop local woodfuel projects in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.5/2">We recognise that there are issues that make it difficult to encourage the confidence needed for the development of woodfuel markets. The Biomass Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, was set up a year ago to identify the barriers to developing biomass energy, including woodfuel, and to recommend ways to overcome the problems. Their report was published on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>. The Government has committed itself to publishing a full response to the report within the next six months.</p>

Estimates from experts vary, depending on assumptions made. In broad terms, it might be possible to achieve savings of around 30 per cent. if all technical measures were implemented, regardless of cost, across the sector as a whole.

This reflects the fact that flood defence legislation is based on &quot;permissive powers&quot; i.e. that bodies such as the Environment Agency are empowered to undertake flood defence works but are not obligated to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.320W.11/1">The recent European Court of Justice ruling turned down an application by Austria for a derogation from Directive 2001/18/EC to declare the region of Upper Austria a GM-free zone. The court's ruling was based on the fact that the Austrian Government failed to prove that the region of Upper Austria had a unique ecosystem which might justify a specific local risk assessment. Under existing EU law, in order to declare a GM-free zone, that is a region where GM crops cannot be cultivated, a member state has to prove that there are special reasons to introduce national measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.11/2">Under current EU law, as agreed by EU member states, the only legitimate grounds for narrowing the geographical scope of an approval to prevent cultivation in a defined zone are the production of clear evidence that the GM crop involved poses a particular risk to the specific area in question. In the Austrian case, the European Court of Justice found that Austria had not demonstrated the existence of any such risks to the region of Upper Austria.</p>

	<p pid="b.321W.5/2">The following table shows projected UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and percentage reductions during the commitment period obtained by assuming that the linear trend in emissions of the last <i>(a)</i> five years, <i>(b)</i> four years, <i>(c)</i> three years, <i>(d)</i> two years and <i>(e)</i> one year continue, based on the most recent published UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory data, which cover the period 1990 to 2003. The table indicates that the UK will exceed the reduction target in each projection except for case <i>(e)</i> where one year's difference in emissions is used to indicate the trend. Case <i>(e)</i> is the least robust projection as it is most susceptible to interannual variability due to fuel price relativities, external temperatures and other effects. On the basis of projections provided to the European Union in June, we expect to exceed the Kyoto commitment by about 8 percentage points, and the review of the UK Climate Change Programme currently is assessing the actions needed to put the UK back on course to meet our domestic target of achieving a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010, which would further increase the safety margin.</p>

	<p pid="b.324W.2/1">Operational responsibility for managing the risk from coastal erosion in England rests with maritime district councils who, in partnership with the Environment Agency and other bodies with coastal defence responsibilities, take an integrated and long-term view of managing coastlines through Shoreline Management Plans. These plans, in line with Government policy, consider the implications of coastal processes, including erosion. More detailed coastal strategies are then developed, taking into account economic, social and environmental matters. These detailed strategies consider the specific needs of key coastal installations, such as nuclear power stations, Sellafield and the Low-level Waste Repository (LLWR) at Drigg.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/2">The safety of nuclear installations in the UK is regulated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which requires operators to produce safety cases which address a range of internal and external hazards, including flooding. Safety cases are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changing conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/3">HSE, the Environment Agency, maritime district councils and operators ensure, through consultation on the development of Shoreline Management Plans, that the plans do not compromise the needs of nuclear sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/4">The impact of coastal erosion on the LLWR has also been considered as part of a Post-Closure Safety Case for the site, submitted to the Environment Agency by British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited (BNGSL) in September 2002. BNGSL's assessment predicts that the LLWR could be destroyed by coastal erosion in 500 to 5,000 years if no action were taken to maintain the coastline.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/5">The Environment Agency will shortly issue its decision on future regulation of the LLWR, and is proposing to require BNGSL to consider a number of options to reduce predicted impacts.</p>

	<p pid="b.325W.2/1">In December 2004, the Government issued a consultation paper on the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations, which will apply waste management controls to agricultural waste. Included in this consultation paper was a chapter proposing that a Producer Responsibility scheme should be introduced, under which the producers of non-packaging farm plastics, such as silage wrap and crop covers, would be obligated to pay for their collection and recovery or disposal. The main question posed was whether such a system should be voluntary or mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.2/2">I am now considering the way forward together with ministerial colleagues in light of the responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.2/3">Packaging plastics are already covered by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).

The financial systems do not in every respect separately identify the cost of flowers, so that identifying total expenditure figures for earlier years would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.334W.2/1">The European Commission has recently launched a comprehensive evaluation process to cover all aspects of the Dublin arrangements, including the operation of the secure electronic communications network for Dublin II requests (&quot;DubliNet&quot;) and the supporting Eurodac fingerprint database. The resulting report, expected in 2006, will analyse the impact of the Dublin arrangements to draw conclusions on the added value of Dublin II and the Eurodac Regulation EC No. 2725/2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.334W.2/2">The second Annual Report to the Council and the European Parliament on the activities of the Eurodac Central Unit concluded that Eurodac represents an extremely important tool for a faster and more efficient application of the Dublin arrangements. The report also notes that Eurodac data provide a sound indicator of the phenomenon of &quot;asylum shopping&quot; in member states. Copies of the report can be found in the Libraries. The Home Office's assessment of the report is set out in Explanatory Memorandum 10464/05 sent to the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-14">14 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.334W.2/3">Our own assessment of the new Dublin arrangements, supported by Eurodac is favourable. Dublin II and Eurodac enabled us to return 1,982 applicants in 2004 to other European countries without considering their claims ourselves. This is far more effective than the gentleman's agreement which applied until 1997, under which fewer people were removed in a year than the Dublin arrangements have enabled us to remove in a month. While it is not possible to prove to what extent asylum shopping that would otherwise have happened is not happening as a result of the new arrangements, asylum intake across the EU15 has fallen by 21 per cent. between 2003 and 2004 (source IRSS).</p>
	<p pid="b.334W.2/4">On the question of refugees in orbit, the Dublin II Regulation is based on a mechanism to identify the member state responsible for determining an asylum claim and provides guarantees that identified state will take charge of or take back an asylum seeker within prescribed time limits. In addition, unlike the old Dublin Convention, the regulation reflects the agreement that member states fully accept to take responsibility for an asylum applicant where a procedural time limit is breached. This ensures that asylum applicants do not face prolonged periods of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="b.337W.0/1">The National Asylum Support Service's (NASS) target for deciding applications for support under section 4 is five working days which has routinely been met in the past year. However, a very significant increase in applications meant that NASS could no longer meet this target in all cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.337W.0/2">Increased recruitment and training of staff has improved performance. NASS expects to routinely be meeting the five days target by the end of this calendar year. In the meantime, special arrangements have been made with the voluntary sector (who represent the great majority of section 4 applicants) to prioritise the very urgent cases. These cases, which typically comprise about 20 per cent. of the weekly intake, are being decided on the same day they are received or the day after.</p>

	<p pid="b.343W.9/1">Details of an affordable charge for a stand-alone identity card have already been released, in line with the commitment given by the Home Secretary in June. Decisions regarding the detailed charging strategy have not yet been made. As the Home Secretary stated in June, the actual charges will be determined at the time of introduction of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.9/2">Additionally, the Identity Cards Bill was recently amended by the Government so that Clause 37(7) of the Bill allows for an affirmative resolution procedure to take place the first time a resolution is laid before Parliament setting the charge for identity cards. This will give Parliament greater scope for debate when this occurs.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.9/3">The actual amount charged to a person will depend on future policy decisions on charging within the scope allowed by the Identity Cards Bill. Issues which the Government wishes to explore further on charging include:</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.9/4" class="indent">refining estimates of revenues for the verification service as potential users develop more detailed plans for how they will use the scheme;</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.9/5" class="indent">whether and to what extent offering cards at lower cost, for example to people on low incomes, may be possible;</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.9/6" class="indent">cost estimates for some components of the scheme may change once the Home Office engages formally with suppliers as part of the procurement process.</p>

This date will obviously influence the start date of the project and the timing of any benefits being realised.</p>
	<p pid="b.344W.5/2">The graph as it stands is flexible, as it represents annual movements in the benefits accrual. Therefore a reader of the graph could predict any start date for identity cards roll out, and then understand from the graph the progression of benefit accrual from that date.</p>
	<p pid="b.344W.5/3">The underlying analysis for this graph contains detail that currently could be prejudicial to the future procurement of the identity card scheme, which is driven by Royal Assent being granted.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.5/1">The UK does not recognise Northern Cyprus. There are no formal arrangements in place to directly exchange information on those who have committed sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/2">No reciprocal measures exist between the UK and the Republic of Cyprus (southern Cyprus). However, in the UK, offenders who are subject to the notification requirements of Part two of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (which are often known as the sex offenders register) must notify the police of any intention to travel overseas for a period of three days or more. When an offender notifies his intention to travel overseas the local police force will make a judgment as to whether, in their opinion, the authorities in the country concerned should be informed that the offender is travelling. If they decide that they should, then this information is passed to the National Criminal Intelligence Service who will then inform the destination country if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the offender will present a risk of offending within that community. The Republic of Cyprus does not have a similar requirement on offenders and so they would not routinely know if an offender was planning to travel, and would not be able to inform the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.5/3">The UK or the Republic of Cyprus may also request criminal record information on a national of the other state under the terms of the 1959 Council of Europe Mutual Legal Assistance Convention and the EU Council Decision on the exchange of information on extracted from the criminal record.</p>

The basis of the appeal was that failed asylum seekers are at real risk of mistreatment on return from the UK to Zimbabwe. The AIT's country guidance determination was promulgated on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.5/2">The Tribunal found that the particular way we were enforcing returns of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers from the UK to Harare airport put them at risk. We will not be enforcing returns to Zimbabwe while we work to resolve the concerns identified by the Tribunal about the way we do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.353W.5/3">The Tribunal did not find that Zimbabwe was unsafe generally for failed asylum seekers or that those who return there voluntarily are at risk. Failed asylum seekers have no right to remain in the UK and we continue to expect them to return.</p>

	<p pid="b.353W.5/5">We do not believe that this determination requires us, as a matter of law, to grant refugee status or any other form of leave to remain to failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers. We have already argued successfully before the Tribunal in one individual case since the country guidance case was promulgated that, in the light of the Government's commitment not to enforce returns while we work to identify a route and method which does not expose returnees to a risk contrary to our international obligations, Zimbabwean asylum claims must be decided on their individual facts.</p>

	<p pid="b.362W.5/1">The European Commission has requested a further &euro;6 million from the EU budget to support work on the Future of Europe debate. The EU's budget for 2006 must be agreed between the European Council and the European Parliament. The Commission initiated this process by proposing a Preliminary Draft Budget, which was amended by the Council in its first reading on <phrase class="date" code="">15 July</phrase> to form the Draft Budget. The European Parliament agreed its own amendments to the Draft Budget on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>, and the Council will conclude its second reading on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>. The budget will then go back to the European Parliament, hopefully for approval at its plenary on 13&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>. In this context, the UK has worked closely with other member states to find agreement on the 2006 budget, but no member state has yet made any specific representations on the &euro;6 million requested by the European Commission to support work on the Future of Europe debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.369W.2/2">The Government have decided to offer settlement on claims for discrimination relating to widowed mothers' allowance and widow's payment, but only to those widowers who have an admissible case in the European Court of Human Rights and who satisfy the benefit conditions and made their original claim at the correct time. Widowers who were unsuccessful in the recent cases before the House of Lords were able to take their case to Europe provided they did so by <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-04">4 November 2005</phrase> (six months from the House of Lords ruling).

Any claims received from widowers at Jobcentre Plus or social security offices will be subject to the usual late claim rules and will be disallowed because they are out of time. In deciding on this approach we have been guided by previous admissibility decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in widowers' cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.371W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Gateshead, East and Washington, West will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 29 per cent. of adults and 6 per cent. of children in north-east region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/5">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.8 million; in Gateshead, East and Washington, West, the proportion in employment has risen to 76.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/6">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.4 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with over 2,780 in Gateshead, East and Washington, West alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/7">Significant progress has been made in tackling child poverty and the latest figures (for 2003&ndash;04) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02, increasing above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 1,800 families in Gateshead, East and Washington, West.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/8">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the least well off pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;11 billion extra in 2005&ndash;06 on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997. Almost half of this spending going to the least well off third.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/9">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of May 2005, around 5,300 pensioners in Gateshead, East and Washington, West are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;36.44 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/10">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2005&ndash;06) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for 2005&ndash;06, eligible households with someone aged 65 or over, not receiving the guarantee element of pension credit will receive a one-off payment of &pound;200 to help with their council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment, and one-off payment of &pound;50 for pensioner households with someone aged 70 and over in receipt of the pension credit guarantee in recognition of the fact that the oldest and poorest pensioners are likely to be disproportionately affected by the rise in cost of living expenses.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/11">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80+ annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.371W.2/12">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 7 per cent. respectively. Some 15,200 pensioners in Gateshead, East and Washington, West have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid="b.379W.5/4">The UK state pension is currently paid in over 150 countries outside the EEA with which the UK do not have a reciprocal agreement covering the uprating of pensions. The fundamental requirements for any reciprocal agreement on the uprating of pensions are that the 'other' country has a system for paying the equivalent of the UK state pension and that there is reciprocity of costs.

	<p pid="b.383W.9/2">The LSC recognises that there is currently an imbalance between the adequacy of legal advice provision in the South Yorkshire and Humber area as compared to West Yorkshire, with a degree of unmet need occurring in South Yorkshire and Humber.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.9/3">As a result, the LSC is currently tendering for 3,335 additional New Matter Starts, which increases the amount of legal aid work suppliers can do to match demand, in immigration to ensure adequate provision of publicly funded immigration and asylum services across the Yorkshire region. The emphasis will be on Hull for the Humber area, and on Sheffield for the South Yorkshire area.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.9/4">In addition, the LSC has worked with the Immigration Advisory Service (IAS), a national supplier of legal services, to establish an outreach service run in conjunction with members of the local Community Legal Service Partnership. This service has been extremely successful and has recently extended its availability to two days per week.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.6/1">We seek advice on threat assessments of avian influenza from the World Health Organisation (WHO). The strain of avian influenza in Turkey is very similar to that currently circulating in South East Asia. The WHO advised in May that the viruses are continuing to evolve and pose a continuing and potentially growing pandemic threat. It is monitoring the situation but has not raised the alert level.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.6/2">Experts are concerned that the H5N1 virus has demonstrated the ability to jump the species barrier to cause disease and death in humans, but there is no confirmed evidence of person to person transmission of this virus. Thus, the risk of a human pandemic of H5N1 is considered to be low.</p>

	<p pid="b.389W.11/1">The National Health Service Cancer Plan, published in 2000, stated that we would extend invitations for breast screening to women aged 65 to 70 and introduce two-view mammography at all screening rounds. Over 98 per cent. of local screening programmes have now implemented these changes. However, the changes together represent a 40 per cent. increase in the workload of the programme. We are aware that this has had an impact on some services maintaining the three-year interval for screening and we are taking steps to bring all screening intervals back to three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.390W.8/1">The vaccines in development are a preventative measure; however, they are only effective against approximately 80 per cent. of human papilloma viruses thought to be linked to cancer; they need to be given to women and girls before they become sexually active and we do not yet know how long they are effective for. We would therefore expect little or no effect on the cervical screening programme for a decade or more after the introduction of any vaccination programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.8/2">Cervical screening currently remains the most effective way of preventing cervical cancer and the programme continues to encourage strongly all women between 25 and 64 to attend for regular screening when invited.

	<p pid="b.392W.6/1">The newly introduced category M of generic medicines has two objectives: to reduce the cost of annual reimbursement to community pharmacy in England by &pound;300 million and to set reimbursement prices of individual medicines in a manner which reflects the underlying market prices. This category of the tariff is recalculated quarterly in the light of the best estimate of the achieved reduction in cost: in that sense, the area is reviewed quarterly and is meeting its objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.6/2">Category M reimbursement prices are reflective of the underlying market prices and are intentionally set at a level which leaves unrecovered discount available to community pharmacies as part of the new pharmacy contractual framework. The prices of over-the-counter medicines are determined by a consumer market in which the Department has no economic locus. There is, therefore, little expectation that prices of medicines available over the counter would coincide with the category M reimbursement prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.393W.14/2">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible within the national health service for commissioning and funding services for their resident population, including palliative care. The Government have met their commitment in the NHS Cancer Plan to invest an extra &pound;50 million per annum in specialist palliative care. Over half of this additional funding went to the voluntary sector, mainly hospices, in 2003&ndash;04. PCTs, having assessed their local priorities, can invest more. This investment must be in line with local strategic plans and an assessment of need, which may, or may not indicate the need to provide more specialist palliative care beds.</p>

	<p pid="b.394W.5/2">In any period in which a trust reports a deficit, it is required to have an agreed recovery plan in place to restore financial balance. Such a plan might include postponement of capital investment or postponement of private finance initiative (PFI) developments that are being worked up, but there is no requirement that recovery plans must envisage postponement of investment decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.5/3">Before a large and complex scheme, such as that in development by East and North Hertfordshire national health service trust can advertise in the Official Journal of the European Union for potential PFI partners, it must demonstrate convincingly in its outline business case (OBC) that it will be able to afford its scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.5/4">It is therefore conceivable that, in the year in which the OBC is submitted, the trust could still have a deficit, but it would have to demonstrate that it had a robust financial plan both to recover its deficit and go on to afford the eventual unitary payment of its scheme. It would also need to demonstrate an ability to achieve its financial plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.5/5">PFI contractors will have their own financial criteria that they expect a NHS trust to meet before they will have sufficient confidence to bid for its scheme. We would expect these to be no less stringent than the above.</p>

By the end of 2005, no patient will have to wait more than 13 weeks for an out-patient appointment or more than six months for surgery, and most waits will be much shorter than this.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.5/4">In many cases, surgery can stop the visual disturbances getting worse and can help sight to recover to a high standard. The final visual outcome, however, will depend on the size of the hole that has been treated. For those individuals whose sight is still affected after surgery, low vision aids may be of help. The NHS hospital eye service provides optical devices and loans low vision aids, such as high-powered reading lenses, hand-held and stand magnifiers and telescopes, to people with visual impairment. In addition, some primary care trusts have local arrangements for the provision of low vision aids through community based opticians.</p>

	<p pid="b.402W.6/4">While there are a number of NHS and NHS/independent sector (IS) partnership schemes in development, it has been recognised that there is unequal access to current provision. To address this, &pound;20 million capital funding will be made available to the NHS over two years for investment in PET-CT scanners. An additional 25,000 scans will be purchased annually over five years from the IS as part of the wider IS diagnostic procurement.</p>

	<p pid="b.404W.0/1">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have recently submitted their proposals for the re-configuration of primary care trusts (PCTs), which set out how they intend to strengthen their commissioning function. These proposals will be assessed by an independent external panel drawn from and representing a wide range of stakeholder interests. The panel will determine whether the SHA proposals meet the criteria stipulated in the document, &quot;Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot;, published in July 2005. If the criteria are judged to have been met, the proposals will go forward to a three month public consultation, in which the wider impact of PCT re-configuration will be considered, including issues surrounding co-terminosity with local authorities and other local partner organisations. No decisions on the reorganisation of PCTs will be taken until this process has been completed,Similarly, no decisions on the future provision of community and primary healthcare services will be taken until after the White Paper on community healthcare services has been published. The White Paper will be informed by the results of the &quot;Your Health, Your Care, Your Say&quot; listening exercise, which is currently under way. Clinical services will continue to be provided by PCTs unless and until those PCTs decide otherwise. These decisions would be driven locally, following our White Paper deliberations and will only be implemented following full local public and staff consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.404W.3/15">If a SHA or PCI reports a deficit position in one year, that deficit is recovered by deducting it from the resources available to it in the subsequent year. Therefore, its current performance represents its cumulative position.</p>
	<p pid="b.404W.3/16">If, on the other hand, a NHS trust reports a deficit, it has its income reduced in the following year. In addition to this, it has a statutory duty to make good that deficit by reporting a surplus to offset it within the following two years, or four years by exception. It is the net deficit incurred during these years that is defined as the cumulative deficit for NHS trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.404W.3/17">The financial position of the NHS as a whole ended 2004&ndash;05 with an overall deficit of around &pound;250 million. This has to be seen in relation to the overall NHS spending; it represents only around 0.4 per cent. of resources. This and the latest available data on the 2004&ndash;05 financial position for all NHS organisations&mdash;SHAs, PCTs and NHS trusts&mdash;was put in the public domain on <phrase class="date" code="">19 September</phrase>. It was based on the 2004&ndash;05 summarisation schedules that were released to the <i>Financial Times</i> and made available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.404W.3/18">It is the responsibility of SHAs to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each and every body achieves financial balance. However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level. In circumstances where a surplus cannot be generated in the following year, SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.</p>

The charity is keen that there should be clear notices wherever sunbeds are used describing those most at risk of skin cancer and advising against their use, especially for young people under 16 years. Cancer Research UK is currently itself in discussions with the sunbed industry about self-regulation and about improving information for both staff and customers, including the displaying of information. The Health and Safety Executive also issued guidelines in 1995 on the use of sunbeds both for operators and customers, with the recommendation that the guidance should be made available to the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.409W.12/1">The Police Reform Act 2002 as amended by the Serious and Organised Crime Act 2005 and the Police Act 2005 creates a statutory duty on the police to refer to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) incidents when persons have died following some form of direct or indirect contact with the police and there is reason to believe that the contact may have caused or contributed to the death. It is then for the IPCC to oversee the investigation into the death with the appropriate level of external supervision.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.12/2">The evidence will be considered by the IPCC to decide whether the evidence indicates that a person whose conduct was under investigation may have committed a criminal offence. If the IPCC decides that this threshold has been reached then the file should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether or not any individual should be charged.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.12/3">A Crown prosecutor will then review the evidence against the guidance contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The Code has two stages to a decision to prosecute.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.12/4">The prosecutor will first consider whether or not there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each defendant on each charge. In undertaking this consideration of the evidence the prosecutor must consider what the defence case may be, including a defence case of self-defence, and how that is likely to affect the prosecution case.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.12/5">If the case does pass the evidential test then the reviewing prosecutor must consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest. The prosecutor will consider what if any public interest factors may weigh either in favour of, or against, a prosecution. A prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against a prosecution, which clearly outweigh those tending in favour.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.12/6">The policy guidelines set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors are kept under review. The last review, which included a public consultation exercise, took place in 2004 with the current edition of the Code having been published in November 2004. It is a publicly available document issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. There are no immediate plans for the Code to be reviewed.</p>

	<p pid="b.420W.5/1">The Department of the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service took over responsibility for the regulation of illegal waste activity, including incidents of illegal dumping of material originating in the Republic of Ireland, in October 2002. Between that date and the end of 2004, some 250,000 tonnes of biodegradable ROI waste was detected in Northern Ireland. It is not possible to determine the year in which the waste was disposed of, so the figure cannot be broken down into annual tonnages. An updated amount to reflect the period up to end 2005 is being calculated and will be available early in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.421W.0/3">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what the total cost has been of upgrading roads and footpaths at <i>(a)</i> Lagan College and <i>(b)</i> the Millennium Primary School in the Strangford constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.0/4">I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.0/5">Following the receipt of a number of requests from various interested parties, Roads Service carried out a minor works improvement scheme at the junction of Manse Road and Glencregagh Road at a cost of &pound;660,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.0/6">The scheme, which was completed in 2004, included the provision of a new widened and realigned carriageway; right turn pockets at Lagan College and Glencregagh Road; improved sightlines at the Manse Road/Glencregagh Road junction; and the construction of approximately 1.3 km of new footway to provide continuous pedestrian access on Manse Road between Four Winds Roundabout and Lagan College.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.0/7">Colleagues in the Department of Education (DE) have also confirmed that road improvement works were carried out at the site of the new Millennium Primary School in 2003 as a condition of the school's planning approval. These works, which were necessary to ensure satisfactory means of access in the interests of road safety and the convenience of road users, cost approximately &pound;330,000 and were funded by DE.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.0/8">Subsequent to the school opening, it became apparent that drivers were not observing the signs and road markings and that safety was being threatened by illegal overtaking manoeuvres in the vicinity of the school. To address this, Roads Service installed further traffic islands, signs, road markings and lighting at a cost of &pound;29,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.421W.0/9">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

The symptoms of this illness can be severe however many adverse effects can be reduced or avoided by prompt diagnosis, sustained intervention and monitoring.

	<p pid="b.428W.8/5" class="indent">In relation to the provision of traffic calming measures, I am sure you will appreciate that, although the funding allocated to traffic calming has been increased significantly year on year, demand far outstrips our capacity to meet all such requests and priorities have to be established. We do this by taking account of a number of factors: the accident history of the site, with additional weighting being applied to collisions involving vulnerable road users; the speed, volume and type of traffic; and the characteristics of the general area. Of these we give the highest priority to safety because we believe it is only right to treat sites with an accident history before those with a reasonably good safety record. Implicitly, this assessment process takes cognisance of the overall cost of road traffic collisions to society in general. This approach has led to a substantial reduction in collisions and personal injuries at those sites, over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.428W.8/6" class="indent">Table A attached lists the locations of traffic calming schemes Roads Service has programmed for completion this financial year. Our programme of traffic calming works for 2006/2007 has not yet been finalised and Table B attached is a preliminary list of schemes under consideration at this stage. Naturally, implementation of these schemes will be subject to the successful completion of the statutory processes including local consultation and the resolution of any objections.</p>

For this reason the provisions of the Road Safety Bill do not, in general, apply to Northern Ireland. There is a general convention to replicate, where possible, the position in Great Britain and this will be done through the draft Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 that was issued for public consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase> with a closing date for comments of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.8/2">The Road Safety Bill seeks to extend Part 2 of the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001(c.3) (regulation of number plate suppliers) to Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is a reserved matter that cannot be included in the draft Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order.</p>

	<p pid="b.441W.2/1">Prevailing planning policy for telecommunications development in Northern Ireland, set out in Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 10 'Telecommunications', already strongly encourages the sharing of masts where this represents the best environmental option in a particular case.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.2/2">To promote sharing through the planning process, the PPS advises that all applications for new masts should be accompanied by evidence that the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or other structure has been explored and should outline the specific reasons why this course of action is not possible. Where the evidence regarding the consideration of alternative options is not considered satisfactory, then planning permission can be refused.</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.5/1">It will be for each local authority, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to extended services through schools. As part of that strategy, local authorities and schools will need to take into account a number of factors such as what services are already available in the local community, levels of deprivation and how the proposed extended services will be delivered. Funding will be released to schools in accordance with that strategy. The aim is to avoid schools 'bidding' for funding but ensure that funding is released against the priorities identified. A key priority will be to fill gaps in services, such as child care. We anticipate that there will be gaps in services in many deprived communities and hence these areas will be prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.5/2">The Government's aim is that half of all primary schools and a third of all secondary schools will be offering access to a core set of extended services by 2008. We anticipate that many of then will be located in areas of high deprivation (in allocating the funding we have factored in deprivation levels into the distribution formula). We are providing &pound;840 million to support the development of extended services.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.5/3">For some of these services, such as child care, we expect them to become sustainable longer term by charging. Parents on low income may be eligible to apply for the child care element of the working tax credit to support the cost of school based child care. Local authorities are well placed to provide schools and parents with advice on accessing the tax credits available and can work with schools to encourage greater take up of tax credits in deprived communities. We will expect children from unwaged families to access a good range of study support activities free of charge through schools. In addition to the resources that schools already have within their existing budgets for study support programmes, the Government is investing a further &pound;335 million by 2007&ndash;08 for secondary schools to develop a more personalised programme of study support. For those schools with the highest number of pupils who have fallen behind in their learning, the Government will provide a further &pound;60 million shared between the primary and secondary sectors in each of 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. Every school should therefore be well placed to ensure that every child in their school has access, free of charge, to the study support that they need. For other services such as health and social care and adult learning opportunities, local authorities, using children's trust arrangements, will be able to provide resources to support services in deprived areas where that is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.448W.2/1">My department has made available &pound;680 million over the next two years for schools and local authorities to deliver extended services. This is in addition to the &pound;160 million that we have already spent. This funding can be used flexibly by local authorities and schools to overcome any barriers to the development of extended services. We anticipate that some of this funding will be used to ensure that staff working in extended services get the training and support they need in their roles, including on important issues such as health and safety requirements. We have made it clear from the outset that there is no expectation that teachers will deliver these services. Schools will need to work with existing providers from both the private and voluntary sectors and other children's services and make good use of their expertise and skills. It may also be the case that, following consultation, some existing school support staff may be interested in taking up some of these roles. We have also appointed the National Remodelling Team, within the Training and Development Agency, to work with schools to ensure that they have the right skills in place for developing extended services.</p>

	<p pid="b.451W.2/2">The Department for Education and Skills has not commissioned research specifically on grandparents who are raising their children full-time. The Department regularly reviews available research evidence on different aspects of parenting, including fostering by relatives, to inform policy development. It recently published a comprehensive review of research on foster care <sup>1</sup> which includes evidence on the role of relatives as foster carers. Nearly half of these relatives are grandparents.</p>

The LSC's Administration Budget for 2005&ndash;06 is almost &pound;255 million. The Administration Budget for future years was set out in the Secretary of State's Grant Letter issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>.

This reflects efficiency savings already agreed. It is too early to say what further savings will arise. The overall Administration Budget will be reassessed when the results of the consultation on the LSC's &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, particularly its restructuring, are finalised.

	<p pid="b.454W.5/1">The Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative aimed to create 45,000 new full-time child care and early education places for children aged 0 to 5 in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas in England by March 2004. &pound;100 million of capital funding from the New Opportunities Fund (now the Big Lottery Fund), &pound;28 million of Sure Start capital and &pound;243 million of start-up revenue funding from the Sure Start Unit was made available to 142 of the 150 local authorities to support the development and delivery of these places. The places have been developed through a diverse range of local and national providers and are intended to be responsive to local needs and preferences. By end March 2005, over 49,000 places across over 1,390 neighbourhood nursery projects had been delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.5/2">Information on the number of nursery places open as part of the Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative in each participating local authority in 2004&ndash;05 is in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.5/3">Information on the average cost per place in each area is not available. One of the conditions set for all providers taking part in the Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative was that fees charged should not exceed the level of help available to parents towards the costs of child care through the working tax credit for the period that the nursery received its initial start-up funding from the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.5/2">My Department have no plans to review the policy regarding the three year residency requirement. We do recognise the needs of the NHS and social services, however, publicly funded education and training cannot be made available for non-EU nationals. All adults seeking to qualify for publicly funded education and training must satisfy the three year residency rule or other criteria specified by the Learning and Skills Council which funds post-16 learning in England. This requirement applies equally to UK citizens who have not been resident in the UK/EEU. This long standing residency requirement reflects the Government's view that it is reasonable to expect a person to have established a relevant connection with the UK before being allowed to benefit from funding provided by UK taxpayers.</p>

	<p pid="b.460W.2/2">Many schools have tailored the curriculum and teaching methods to meet the needs of pupils with great success for many years. We now want this to be common practice across all schools, particularly for children at either end of the ability spectrum whose needs can be the most challenging to meet.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.2/3">It is for schools to determine their strategies and priorities for workforce deployment to deliver personalised learning. Schools are in the best position to identify their pupils' teaching and learning needs; and with the support of the Government's Primary and Secondary National Strategies, to determine how best to invest their resources and to access workforce development programmes to deliver them. Many schools are employing staff other than teachers to support pupils and teachers as part of a professional school team.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.2/4">We will support schools by allocating &pound;335 million by 2007&ndash;08, specifically earmarked within our Dedicated Schools Grant, to provide the resources secondary schools need to deliver personalised learning in key stage 3. For those schools with the highest numbers of children who have fallen behind we will provide a further targeted &pound;60 million in each of 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, shared across the primary and secondary sectors, to provide more effective one-to-one and small group tuition.</p>
	<p pid="b.460W.2/5">Through the National Strategies we will provide new resources and best practice guidance so that all schools will have a workforce that is well-equipped to tailor teaching and learning for those pupils who have fallen behind in English and maths. This will include material on the use of ICT and ways to engage and support parents in contributing to their children's learning. We propose to introduce a national training programme so that every school will have an expert leading professional to drive personalisation across the whole school, make best use of the new resources available and personalise learning to the needs of each pupil.</p>

	<p pid="b.462W.3/1">Many schools have tailored the curriculum and teaching methods to meet the needs of pupils with great success for many years. We now want this to be common practice across all schools, particularly for children at either end of the ability spectrum whose needs can be the most challenging to meet.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.3/2">We will therefore allocate &pound;335 million by 2007&ndash;08, specifically earmarked within our Dedicated Schools Grant, to provide the resources secondary schools need to start delivering personalised learning for pupils in Key Stage 3, particularly for those who have fallen behind in literacy and numeracy and for those who are gifted or talented. For those schools with the highest numbers of children who have fallen behind we will provide a further targeted &pound;60 million in each of 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, shared across the primary and secondary sectors, to provide more effective one-to-one and small group tuition. We will also provide all schools with best practice materials, guidance and access to training on the most effective teaching and learning strategies to personalise learning to the needs of each pupil.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.3/3">Through School Improvement Partners and the new Ofsted inspection regime we will challenge every school to demonstrate they are planning and delivering effective tailored teaching and learning for every child, including the gift and talented. And the achievement and attainment tables for 2006 will show schools' success in ensuring pupils achieve not only five good GCSEs but also in the fundamentals of English and mathematics.</p>
