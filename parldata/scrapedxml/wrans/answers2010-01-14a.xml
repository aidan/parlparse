	<p pid="a.1071W.5/1">The Highways Agency has undertaken a number of trials and carried out research regarding a number of its information services. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/2" class="italic"> Traffic England Website</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/3">Prior to the new website being launched in April 2009, customer panels were held to test the functionality and understanding of the new site. Following this feedback, changes were made to the design and functionality of the website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/4" class="italic"> Atlas Professional Website</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/5">(A website aimed at professional users such as Travel News Media) The Highways Agency recently carried out an evaluation of this website with users via an online questionnaire. The Agency also asked users for their comments on new functionality that could be offered on this site, which were received positively and this site is due to be refreshed with new functionality later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/6" class="italic"> Variable Message Signs (VMS)</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/7">The Agency undertakes National Road Users Satisfaction Surveys on a regular basis which includes questions regarding the accuracy of messages shown on our VMS regarding incidents ahead and these results are used to inform improvements to accuracy of messages. In addition, we also seek feedback about whether road users receive sufficient information about incidents and how they receive this information. This is then fed back to our teams to improve the way information is disseminated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/8" class="italic"> Travel Times on Variable Message Signs (TTVMS)</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/9">This service was trialled on sections of the motorway network from July 2006 until September 2007. Following customer surveys the majority of respondents thought showing travel and delay time messages was a good idea, found them useful and easy to read and understand. Following this, TTVMS was implemented across the whole HA network.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/10" class="italic"> Highways Agency Information Points</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/11">A Highways Agency Information Point (HAIP) is a real-time system, providing road users with a unique platform for receiving information on the state of the road network ahead. An initial HAIP prototype was trialled at Hopwood Services on the M42 in 2005, following this success further HAIPs were installed across motorway service areas and truck stops. Following research into drivers' reactions to HAIPs, they have now been updated and now contain a non-interactive single display system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/12" class="italic"> Traffic Radio</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/13">Spoken information service trials took place during 2005 and 2007 and this demonstrated the viability of a 'dip in/dip out' radio service providing constantly updated traffic information on a national and regional basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/14" class="italic"> CCTV</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/15">A partnership trial with two companies, MxData and the BBC was held in 2006. The Highways Agency created two accounts to access the existing HANET service allowing each organisation to take, store and forward images to the public. During the trial period, a report from MxData showed an overwhelming positive response.</p>

	<p pid="a.1075W.4/1">Agri-environment schemes, such as Environmental Stewardship, are one of a number of measures aimed at helping to meet DEFRA's target of reversing the decline in farmland birds by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.4/2">Following recommendations from the Review of Progress of Environmental Stewardship (2008), we plan to improve the scheme's delivery of farmland bird habitats by introducing new options, such as extended overwintered stubble, and modifying existing ones. We are also promoting better uptake of options of specific benefit to farmland birds through increased training and information provision for Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) through, for example, Natural England's ELS Training and Information Programme. We have also improved the targeting for Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) for which farmland birds are a key priority and the subject of a number of specific projects promoting HLS across England, such as the South West Farmland Birds Initiative. Implementation of the review recommendations has already begun and further changes will be implemented during 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.4/3">Natural England has a target to increase the total area of agricultural land in England being managed under agri-environment schemes to 70 per cent. by March 2011. This, in itself, should help deliver increased habitats for farmland birds. Natural England also has a target in 2009-10 to deliver a further 4,100ha of key arable farmland bird options through Environmental Stewardship-a 20 per cent. increase above the March 2008 baseline.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.4/4">The industry-led voluntary Campaign for the Farmed Environment should help to retain and exceed the environmental benefits provided by former set-aside land. The campaign promotes activities by farmers and land managers to secure environmental benefits in relation to farmland birds, resource protection and biodiversity provision. It includes a number of targets for June 2012 which will be of direct benefit to farmland birds, such as doubling the uptake of ELS in-field options, covering 40,000 hectares on top of current levels, and increasing uncropped land by 20,000 hectares from January 2008 levels. Natural England has also recently produced a joint leaflet-Farming for Birds-with the campaign and other partner organisations, such as the RSPB, aimed at improving ELS option selection and location in order to help increase farmland bird populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078W.0/14">CEFAS has relatively higher non consolidated pay when compared as a percentage against the DEFRA Network, because they have specifically worked to structure a total rewards package with a greater non consolidated pay element, that is directly performance based and must be re-earned each year. This places a greater link between performance and reward and while their percentage of non consolidated pay is larger than others this is more than offset by their consolidated pay (i.e. salaries) which is low relative to the DEFRA Network and Whitehall.</p>

The Government want to reduce the number of procedures that are defined in legislation as 'mutilations' and protect the welfare of laying hens, but a balance has to be struck between reducing the number of procedures carried out and ensuring that the birds do not suffer worse welfare insults, such as feather pecking and cannibalism.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.8/4">A recent report, 'UK Timber Industry Certification' by Timbertrends, concluded that in 2008 the proportion of certified products available to the UK timber supply chain by forest certification scheme was distributed: FSC 51.5 per cent. PEFC 31.5 per cent. other schemes 0.5 per cent. and 33.2 per cent. not certified. We assume that the proportion of certified timber and wood products purchased (with category A evidence) by the public sector reflects availability and with two thirds being FSC and one third being PEFC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.8/5">This proportion also corresponds with CPETs experience. It should however be noted that the report quoted assessed the timber industry and for other product groups such as paper and furniture the proportions might not be the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.1086W.9/1">The Government believe that managed migration is a valuable source of skills and labour to the British economy and there are recognised routes into the UK for those seeking to work. However, entering the country for economic reasons is not the same as seeking asylum, and it is important to maintain the distinction between the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.9/2">Giving asylum seekers or failed asylum seekers permission to work would be likely to encourage asylum applications from those without a well-founded fear of persecution, hence slowing down the processing of applications made by genuine refugees and undermining the integrity of the managed migration system. Indeed, asylum intake has dropped significantly since the policy change in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.9/3">This is why we do not generally allow asylum seekers to work while their claim for asylum is under consideration. The only exception is asylum seekers who have been waiting 12 months for a decision where this delay cannot be attributed to them. This is consistent with our obligations under the EC reception directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1087W.5/1">No formal estimate has been made to date. However, the Government consider that while allowing asylum seekers to work may increase tax revenue this has to be balanced finely against the very real concern that allowing employment will act as a pull factor, and that the UK may subsequently receive an increase in the number of unfounded asylum applications as a result. We also have to consider the potential that this may have to delay the processing of asylum claims which would lead to more hardship, not less and more demands on the public purse as well as an increase in exploitation by traffickers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1098W.14/1">The information requested is given in the tables. 34,972 missing persons cases have been recorded by the Missing Persons Bureau between <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-16">16 December 2009</phrase>. Of these 17,641 are British, 14,365 are non-British. No nationality data is available for 2,966 cases. Note that these figures relate to incidents of missing rather than individuals; the same person can go missing several times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.14/2">30,540 (87 per cent.) of these cases have subsequently been marked as 'closed' on the database (i.e. the missing person has returned or been located). Research suggests<sup>(1)</sup> that 99 per cent. of missing persons are located within one year of going missing. Not all cancellations are received by the Bureau. As force compliance with the code increases the percentage of closed cases on HERMES will increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.14/3"><sup>(1)</sup> Tarling, R. and Burrows, J. (2004)) The nature and outcome of going missing: the challenge of developing effective risk assessment procedures', International Journal of Police Science and Management, Vol.6, No. 1, 16-26</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.14/4">Data relating to missing cases by nationality (UK, non-UK or unknown) and age are given in the tables placed in the House Library. 'Closed' refers to the status of cases where the individual was subsequently found. Data relating to 'age' are given at the date the person went missing. Ages have been grouped together and where there are small numbers of cases (under five) in individual cells exact figures have not been provided to protect identity and maintain confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.14/5">The HERMES database used for the recording of missing persons data is an operational database used for policing purposes. The data are normally only used for management information and are not subject to the detailed checks that apply to national statistics publications. The data are therefore provisional and may be subject to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098W.14/6">A code of practice for the collection of missing persons data was introduced in April 2009. Although limited data has been collected as some police forces have implemented the code, it is unlikely that any meaningful and complete national picture of missing persons will be available until early summer 2010, when all police forces will become compliant with the code. Meanwhile the available figures can be regarded as indicative only.</p>

The following table details Service Family Accommodation (SFA) in the UK that has been unused for between one and five years. It has not been possible separately to identify SFA in England. The majority of these properties are owned by Annington Homes Ltd. (AHL) and are leased to the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.1103W.8/12">SFA properties that have been void for the longest periods are those that are mainly held awaiting large future redeployments of personnel, pending return to AHL or awaiting demolition, or where decisions on the future of MOD sites have yet to be made. SFA may also be void where there is likely to be a long-term (rather than short-term) need for SFA in that area or where major modernisation or upgrade work is to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1103W.8/13">In those areas where void SFA is required in the long-term but not in the short to medium-term, the Department is actively seeking arrangements with local authorities, housing associations and private landlords to temporarily sub let properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1103W.8/14">In 2008 the proportion of void SFA reached 21 per cent. Although extremely challenging, the MOD is driving heard to reduce the percentage of voids to the target management margin of 10 per cent. by 2012.</p>

The Disability Employment Adviser will work with the customer to agree an action plan to help get them into work. They can advise on suitable employment opportunities and approach employers on the customer's behalf. If more in depth support is needed they can arrange for an occupational health assessment and help to be provided by a work psychologist.</p>

It does this through a system of grants towards the cost of providing support, such as a job coach to settle an autistic customer into work. The customer can also be supported at work by Access to Work paying for awareness training on autism to be delivered to the customer's work colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113W.2/1">The Government have already put in place a number of programmes in which unemployed people undertake work experience and volunteering placements that deliver benefit to the community. However, the overriding aim of these programmes is always to provide activities that will equip jobseekers with the right skills and experience to help them move back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.2/2">Through our New Deal programmes, many thousands of jobseekers have been involved in activities that have delivered benefit to their local community or the environment. The Community Task Force, due to be launched at the end of this month as part of the Young Person's Guarantee, will match young unemployed people to work experience placements that deliver community benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.2/3">And in April last year, we launched a scheme to match jobseekers who have been unemployed for six months to relevant work-focussed volunteering opportunities, many of which also deliver environmental or community benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.2/4">We do not specify the exact nature of the placements that should be delivered through these programmes, rather ask providers to match jobseekers with placements that will best equip them to return to work. It is possible that activities such as snow clearance could be included in a programme of community works at a local level, but this would depend on local conditions and providers' view of the activities that best suit their client group.</p>

	<p pid="a.1116W.2/1">We are taking decisive steps to reduce the level of unemployment. As part of the Government's commitment to support people into work, &#163;5 billion has been made available since November 2008 to offer extra support to jobseekers to help them find work at all stages of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/2">The Department has quadrupled the available funding for the Rapid Response Service, which provides advice and support to customers facing redundancy. Also, we launched an enhanced offer to all jobseekers at day one of their claim which includes targeted group sessions in jobsearch techniques, access to local employment partnership vacancies and help with the costs of getting back to work through the Adviser Discretionary Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/3">At the six month point in a claim, all jobseekers now have access to a substantial package of extra support including recruitment subsidies, work-focussed training places, volunteering opportunities and support to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/4">If an individual remains on benefits after 12 months they will be referred to the provider-led flexible new deal programme (currently being delivered in half of the country) and will receive tailored, responsive support to help them get into work. In areas where the flexible new deal is yet to be introduced, customers will access more intensive back to work support through the original new deal programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/5">The Government have also targeted significant new resource on young people in recognition of the particular challenges young people face during a recession. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-29">29 July</phrase>, the Government launched a campaign called Backing Young Britain, calling on businesses, charities and government bodies to create more opportunities for young people, such as internships, work experience placements, links to mentors and apprenticeships. Almost 12,000 graduate internships have already become available and thousands more opportunities will follow early in 2010. Over 360 organisations are supporting the campaign, with numbers growing all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/6">Furthermore, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase>, we announced in the White Paper &quot;Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment&quot; that from January 2010, we will introduce a stronger Young Person's Guarantee, so that all 18 to 24-year-olds who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months will be guaranteed a job, work placement or work-related skills training. In addition, we will offer all young people access to a named personal adviser at the start of their claim and build in more time with an adviser throughout their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/7">As part of that guarantee, the Future Jobs Fund will create 170,000 jobs: 120,000 jobs for young people, and the remaining 50,000 jobs for people of all ages in unemployment hotspots throughout the country. These are real paid jobs-this is job creation, not an employment programme. The first five bidding rounds are already creating up to 98,000 jobs and the first jobs started in October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/8">Further measures to tackle unemployment were also announced in the White Paper. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/9" class="indent">from early 2010, access to the self-employment credit will be available from 13 weeks of unemployment;</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/10" class="indent">for customers aged 50 and over, we will provide new specialist back to work support by using external providers to address their specific needs; widen access to work trials and ensure that those with significant barriers to employment get early access to the six month offer;</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/11" class="indent">an enhancement of the better off in work credit, so that it will ensure that long- term benefit recipients will be at least &#163;40 a week better off in work. Implementation of the new credit will begin in October 2010; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.2/12" class="indent">a commitment to implement from October 2011 an improved earnings disregard for lone parents with children aged less than seven-a new tapered disregard will be tested in the progression to work pathfinders.</p>

In order to provide certainty to investors, wholesale revisions to the banding regime (ROCs/MWh for each technology) will only be made in accordance with a scheduled banding review. Details of any changes to banding levels following a scheduled banding review will be published 18 months before they will take effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1118W.6/2">In response to evidence of a significant increase in the costs of offshore wind projects reaching financial close, we conducted an early review of the banding level for offshore wind. As part of the review process, we consulted during summer 2009 on two proposals for providing an uplift in support for offshore wind projects: one based around the timing of contract-signing and completing a foundation in the water, and an alternative proposal based around accreditation. These proposals were intended to ensure that any additional support was directed at those projects which we believed would not otherwise be able to proceed. In light of responses to the consultation, we decided to determine eligibility based on accreditation, in line with established RO policy for all other technologies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1119W.2/2">ETSU-R-97 describes a framework for the measurement of wind farm noise and gives indicative noise levels thought to offer a reasonable degree of protection to wind farm neighbours, without placing unreasonable restrictions on wind farm development or adding unduly to the costs and administrative burdens on wind farm developers or local authorities. The suggested noise limits in ETSU and their reasonableness have been evaluated with regard to regulating the development of wind energy in the public interest. We have no robust new evidence to suggest that the current guidance is not achieving its aim.</p>

A total of &#163;34 million capital was allocated and 511 units of accommodation were refurbished or newly built.

In Coventry &#163;849,229 (2007-08) was spent on housing related support services for women at risk of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1129W.5/4">This Government take extremely seriously the issue of protection for people at risk of domestic violence and we must understand whether there is appropriate provision out there. That is why we have commissioned new research which will identify the current housing options available to households at risk of domestic violence, and to assess whether this provision meets current need. This will report next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1134W.9/1">At Budget ECOFIN (<phrase class="date" code="2010-11-18">18 November</phrase>) the UK secured a 2010 budget that was below the level of the Commission's proposals and almost &#8364;5 billion (4 per cent.) lower than proposed by the European Parliament, saving the UK taxpayer almost &#163;0.5 billion. This is in line with our overriding objectives of promoting Budget discipline and value for money for taxpayers. This outcome has been made possible through close engagement with the Commission and our European partners throughout the 2010 budget negotiations process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134W.9/2">The UK is required to make contributions to the EC Budget under obligations imposed by the Treaties. The European Communities Act, Section 2 in particular gives effect within the UK to Community law. Contributions to the annual EC Budget are determined in accordance with the Own Resources Decision (ORD), unanimously agreed by all member states and ratified in accordance with their constitutional requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1135W.2/1">The Chancellor announced at Budget 2009 the revised 'tackling alcohol fraud' strategy which has three principal themes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/2" class="indent">Strengthening our operational responses;</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/3" class="indent">Reducing opportunities for fraud;</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/4" class="indent">Closing off illicit supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/5">The strategy is set out in further detail in &quot;Renewal of the Tackling Alcohol Fraud strategy&quot;, published in April 2009 and available at</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hmrc.go.uk">www.hmrc.go.uk</a>-budget_2009/tackling_alcohol_2850.htm</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/7">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is making good progress on all three strands of this strategy. The regulatory framework is being strengthened to reduce opportunities for fraud; the new operational model for HIV1RC to respond to fraud using new approaches and the full range of HMRC's powers is on track to be implemented from April 2010; and HMRC is working with the large brewers and wholesale buying groups on developing practical measures to close off illicit supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/8">HMRC co-operates with its European counterparts on excise matters, including alcohol fraud, under the terms of EC Council Regulation 2073/2004 (on the administrative co-operation in excise matters) and the Naples II Convention. Additionally, over the past eight years the UK has worked with counterpart revenue authorities on the development of the EU-wide Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). This provides an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise goods in duty suspension within the EU and comes into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1135W.2/9">In the period from <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December 2009</phrase> HMRC received approximately 650 allegations relating to alcohol. All allegations are actioned. A range of responses, including formal investigations, are considered as appropriate depending on the seriousness of the allegation and quality of intelligence provided. For operational reasons and to protect third party confidentiality HMRC cannot comment on how many allegations have been formally investigated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137W.14/1">The application of VAT throughout the EU is governed by agreements between the UK and its EU partners. Under these agreements, the UK is allowed to keep its existing zero rates, but may not extend their scope or introduce new ones. Therefore, it would not now be possible for the UK to remove VAT from goods supplied by appliance contractors which are not already zero-rated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146W.5/31">For both press officers and communications officers, the number of staff employed at the end of each financial year may not be typical of numbers employed in other months of the year so a comparison of average costs based on the table above is misleading. Average staff numbers are not available for the whole period for press and communications staff separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146W.5/32">The increase in expenditure on communications officers in MOJ HQ reflects the significantly increased size and remit of MOJ compared to its predecessor, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and a consequent need to increase the capability of staff employed. To meet this challenge, a number of communications-led projects were undertaken which required the employment of specialist contractors by the MOJ HQ communications directorate for a limited period of time which further increased costs in 2008-09 on a one-off basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146W.5/33">Expenditure on communications officers by the National Offender Management Service is not directly comparable between years.

HMPS was merged with the National Probation Service and some former headquarters functions from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.1158W.0/2">An indicator measuring the proportion of children and young people supervised by Youth Offending Teams who are in suitable full-time education, training or employment (ETE) by the end of their sentence now forms part of the local authority National Indicator Set. The indicator counts only children and young people in full-time, not part-time ETE, and only those who go into full-time ETE by the end of their sentence, not those who do so after the sentence closes. It counts both those completing sentences served entirely in the community and those completing the YOT-supervised community element that forms part of custodial sentences. During 2006-07, the baseline year for this indicator, performance was at 67.4 per cent. During 2007-08, this increased by 2.4 percentage points to 69.8 per cent. and during 2008-09 this increased by a further 2.4 percentage points to 72.2 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1159W.0/1">The Youth Justice Board does not specify the levels of staff required at secure children's homes (SCHs), instead specifying the service to be delivered. However, many SCHs are able to deliver one-to-one supervision to large numbers of young people for substantial parts of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1159W.0/2">The YJB does not set precise staff to trainee ratios for secure training centres (STCs); instead, they agree with providers the minimum staffing levels necessary to ensure effective supervision. Broadly speaking, the minimum staffing levels are three members of custody staff to young people living in a group of eight, and two members of custody staff to young people living in a group of six. In practice, during the core part of the day when young people are in education or activities, there are likely to be more staff engaging with them.</p>

Young offenders held in adult categorised establishments are not included. Unified staff relates to those staff that are officer or governor grades. The data have been supplied by the National Offender Management Service and have been drawn from administrative IT systems, which, as with any large-scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing and may be subject to change over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1159W.0/4">The figures for SCHs, STCs and YOIs are not directly comparable. The figures for YOIs relate to all unified staff employed in the establishment, while the ratios for SCHs and STCs relate only to staff engaging directly with young people.</p>
