	<p pid="c.2243W.6/1">DFID attaches great importance to helping developing countries adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. DFID is a leading supporter of international and national efforts to assess and reduce the impact of climate change efforts to eradicate poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.2243W.6/2">Work to assess the potential impact of climate change on the incidence and intensity of droughts in Africa is in its early stages. We are helping African planners develop their national climate change adaptation strategies through three means: <i>(a)</i> provision of funds through the United Nations to help Africa adapt, including &pound;10 million over three years (2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;88) to the United Nations Climate Change Convention's Special Climate Change Fund; <i>(b)</i> helping to improve African climate monitoring networks and develop African regional climate centres through the G8 Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) initiative and <i>(c)</i> DFID's climate change research strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.2243W.6/3">During 2005, the UK also led the G8 to commit to improving the way we manage climate risk when providing development assistance. The UK aims to have climate risk management procedures for overseas aid in place by 2008, in line with the Commission for Africa recommendation.

	<p pid="c.2245W.2/1">The 2002 census in the Dominican Republic records that only 80,000 people identified themselves as being born outside of the country. However, Amnesty International estimates that there are between 700,000 and 800,000 people of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, out of a total population of 8.56 million. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimate that the prevalence of HIV infection is below 2 per cent. nationally but this figure is up to 5 per cent. in the bateyes (local communities) living near sugar plantations, where a significant proportion of immigrants of Haitian descent live.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.2/2">While the Presidential AIDS Council (COPRESIDA) made significant progress towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care in the last three years, and has a policy of universal provision of anti-retroviral treatment (ARV), there is no specific policy of providing ARVs to non-nationals. The total number of people living with HIV and AIDS, who require ARV treatment, is not known. At January 2006, some 2,700 patients were receiving ARVs, likely to be substantially less than 50 per cent. of those in need of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.2/3">Amnesty International is planning to issue a report on HIV and human rights in the Dominican Republic in May. It is expected to find that the treatment, care and prevention services for HIV and AIDS in the bateyes, where many Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent live, is very limited.</p>

	<p pid="c.2245W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports local communities in Latin America through its work with the International Finance Institutions (IFI), particularly the World Bank and the Inter American Development Bank (IADB), and through direct support to non-governmental organisations (NGO)s. The range of community involvement in IFI supported and civil society programmes is illustrated by the following examples.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.5/2">Through engagement with the IADB and the World Bank, DFID is supporting greater involvement of civil society and local communities in IFI programmes and processes, such as consultations around development and evaluation of IFI country strategies. In Brazil, the UK is helping local communities give their own assessment of the impact of the Federal Government's conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Familia. This programme provides a monthly cash benefit to a current total of 8.7 million poor families across the country, which is conditional on children attending school and immunisation programmes. The UK is also contributing to a programme to enhance the capacity of indigenous people's organisations throughout Amazonia. Indigenous leaders meet regularly, receive training together, and consider how to promote their entitlements to services and to strengthen social cohesion in Amazon communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.5/3">DFID supports the IADB to promote community participation in the design and implementation of its programmes in Central America. For example, support was recently provided to local communities in the remote cross-border area between Honduras (El Paraiso) and Nicaragua (Nueva Segovia) to strengthen cross-border development plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.5/4">With civil society in Brazil, the UK is working with local communities to raise awareness of how institutional racism can be a barrier to poor people in the Afro-Brazilian population receiving the public services to which they are entitled. This work has been implemented through new partnerships between municipal authorities and civil society organisations in two states in the poor North East of Brazil, Pernambuco and Bahia, through the Programme to Combat Institutionalised Racism.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.5/5">In the Andes region, DFID is working to strengthen awareness among civil society and community groups of their right to information about policy processes and to engage with policy makers, both within Government and donors. In Peru, DFID's rights-based approach to development put working with local communities central to its purpose. The substantial partnership between Oxfam and DFID through the Derechos, Inclusion y Desarrollo (Rights, Inclusion and Development) programme has taken DFID's support on these issues right down to the community level.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.5/6">In Nicaragua, DFID contributes to the multi-donor civil society fund in Nicaragua administered by the local in-country offices of Oxfam Great Britain and Trocaire. This fund is designed to provide direct grants to local grassroots civil society to help them build governance from the bottom up and engage in development planning processes as well as social auditing of Government development programmes. DFID has supported the IADB to strengthen civil society through co-operation with local communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2245W.5/7">DFID also provides direct support to civil society in Latin America through Partnership Programme Arrangements with six international NGOs and through the Civil Society Challenge Fund. Many of the activities supported through these channels would involve local communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.2247W.2/1">Latin America has high levels of persistent and severe poverty and inequality. According to 2004 national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, 42.9 per cent. of the population of Latin America live in poverty and 18.6 per cent. live in extreme poverty. The levels of extreme poverty are higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2247W.2/2">DFID's strategy for Middle Income Countries (MIC) provides the framework for how DFID works to reduce poverty and inequality in Latin America. DFID's main financial contributions to Latin America are through direct contributions to the multilateral institutions (the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations). As recommended by the MICs Strategy, DFID uses its bilateral programme (&pound;11 million in 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;12 million in 2006&ndash;07) for Latin America to maximise the effectiveness of our multilateral contribution by working to enhance the overall impact of the international system in the region. DFID's assistance to Latin America from 2004&ndash;07 is set out in the Regional Assistance Plan, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.2247W.2/3">DFID is working with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the World Bank to strengthen their focus and impact on poverty, inequality and exclusion. DFID assistance to the IADB and the World Bank aims to strengthen the access of poor and excluded people to local and national markets, to the benefits of international trade, and to accountable and more responsive public systems. A recent example of support to the IADB was in the development of an indigenous people's strategy, which sets out how the World Bank should assess the impact of new programmes and loans on indigenous people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2247W.2/4">DFID is working to improve the ability of Governments to develop and monitor poverty reduction strategies and the extent to which donor assistance is consistent with these strategies by promoting and exchanging regional lesson learning. DFID is also facilitating lesson sharing on global policy issues including trade, HIV and AIDS and global environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.2247W.2/5">DFID also is providing over &pound;10 million in 2005&ndash;06 to British non-governmental organisations (NGO)s in the region by funding projects through its Civil Society Challenge Fund and through its Partnership Programme Agreements with six international NGOs.</p>

	<p pid="c.2248W.0/1">Lack of access to affordable credit is a persistent constraint to livelihoods of the poor in Latin America. For both formal and informal small scale enterprises, which are the main employers of the poor in urban and rural areas, limited forms of formal collateral exclude them from access to borrowing from the formal financial sector. Microfinance institutions have an important role to play in meeting this gap for small enterprises and producers. However, microfinance institutions can also have high transaction and operation costs and frequently rely on external, often donor, financing.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.0/2">Many donors, including the International Financial Institutions, are working on instruments that will guarantee loans to the poor, as well institutional models that will enable larger financial institutions to extend financial services to poorer communities and small enterprises. In the meantime, microfinance institutions continue to play a crucial role in meeting the demands of the poor for financial services tailored to their particular needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.0/3">If microfinance remains reliant on donor grants, it will always be limited and not reach the scale possible through involvement of the private sector. By combining the strengths of microfinance non-governmental organisations (NGO)s (microfinance expertise, community presence, commitment to serving very poor people) and those of banks (financial resources, information technology, payment systems), massive increases can be made in providing microfinance to the poor. The experience of ICICI Bank in India, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and Bancosol in Bolivia clearly demonstrate this. ProFund Internacional (ProFund), based in Costa Rica, targets the small and microenterprises (SMEs) of Latin America and the Caribbean. Major shareholders of ProFund include the InterAmerican Development Bank, IFC/The World Bank Group and CDC.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.0/4">Globally, DFID has supported microfinance and financial sector projects in 25 countries. In Latin America, DFID is working closely with partner governments to improve the institutional framework within which microfinance institutions operate. DFID's Regional Assistance Plan for Latin America aims to improve the impact of International Finance Institutions (particularly the World Bank and Inter American Development Bank (IADB) on poverty and inequality. This includes working with the IADB and the World Bank to strengthen the access of poor and excluded people to local and national markets, including access to micro-credit. In Nicaragua, DFID is providing $150,000 to an International Finance Corporation initiative to support the microfinance industry to develop new products and lending models specifically targeted at the small enterprise sector. In Bolivia, DFID is in dialogue with the new Government on the institutional structure for microfinance, informed by an analysis of models for credit services to poor rural producers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.0/5">Microfinance has often tended to be a component of wider DFID projects. For example, the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) Alternative Development project in the Lower Huallaga Valley, Peru (completed in 2004), which worked with farmers to increase their incomes from alternative livelihoods and avoid a reactivation of the illegal cultivation of coca. A similar project in San Martin region of Peru included microfinance and supported small-scale production, agro-processing and environmental education to improve incomes and employment of poor producers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.0/6">DFID's fund allocations are determined by country and region rather than by sector. The overall budget for microfinance and the proportion allocated for Latin America is therefore not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.0/7">DFID has Partnership Programme Arrangements (PPAs) with six international NGOs for their programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean. While these PPAs cover a wide range of work, it is expected that the following would include microfinance elements; CARE, CAFOD, Christian Aid and Oxfam.</p>

	<p pid="c.2249W.2/3">Microfinance is widely recognised as useful in contributing to reducing poverty and reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs).

Another example is MicroSave, which promotes the development of savings and other more client-responsive financial services among microfinance institutions.</p>

	<p pid="c.2252W.8/1">There has been some slippage on progress towards Target 4 of DFID's Public Service Agreement Objectives and Targets for 2003 to 2006. Progress with the current round of trade negotiations is the main influence on this target, and this depends on the actions of the EU and others within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). After the failure of the Cancun WTO Ministerial in September 2003, there was no likelihood of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) being completed by <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>. Thus the original target, which was always challenging, was unachievable. However, the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005 delivered enough progress to keep the prospect of concluding the DDA in 2006 alive. The Government are therefore pressing for an outcome to these trade talks which delivers real gains for developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.2253W.0/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/2" class="italic">Darfur</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/3">Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/4">Although the massive humanitarian response in Darfur has had a positive impact on malnutrition and mortality rates, the region remains highly dependant on food aid. This year there is expected to be above average food production, but the ability of Darfur to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas. Even with a good harvest, an estimated three million people in Darfur will still require food aid.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/5">Instability, fighting and banditry in South and West Darfur, particularly along the border zone with Chad, is severely hampering humanitarian agencies operating in those areas. Violence and attacks on humanitarian agencies' staff and assets has lead to a reduction in presence, and total withdrawals in some areas, by both the UN and NGOs, leaving many vulnerable people with a greatly reduced level of assistance. Until a political settlement is reached to end the fighting and re-impose the rule of law, the civilian population of Darfur will continue to bear the heaviest burden.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/6">The UK is the second largest bilateral humanitarian donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since September 2003. These funds have meant that hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care. The UK is also actively supporting the peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria, in the search for a sustainable political settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/7" class="italic">South Sudan</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/8">The humanitarian situation remains fragile. Pockets of instability, noticeably in the Upper Nile, Eastern and Western Equatoria have resulted in continued internal displacement. A recent cholera outbreak in and around Yei and Juba underlines the threat of disease and the imminent rainy season will only serve to increase the difficulties faced by vulnerable people, and the humanitarian agencies ability to assist them.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/9">While this year's harvest is predicted to be good, there will continue to be areas of high vulnerability due to insecurity and poor market access. Malnutrition levels in many areas are commensurate with, and in some cases worse than, those found in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/10">To date, the large number of returns of refugees and internally displaced people predicted by the UN has still not taken place. Although there is still potential for significant movement in the run-up to the rainy season, this is considered unlikely. To support the returns process, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 Work plan, from which the UN humanitarian co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the South.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.0/11">In addition to funding vital non-governmental organisations (NGOs) humanitarian programmes in the South, the UK is providing financial support to an emergency response fund for the South to deal with emergencies, such as the cholera outbreak. For longer term recovery and development, the UK is establishing the &pound;10 million service delivery fund which will act as a bridge to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund while it develops projects for funding to meet longer term development needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.2254W.2/1">DFID have been closely monitoring the cholera outbreak in Southern Sudan since it began late January. The outbreak started in Yei town in Southern Sudan and subsequently spread to Juba and a dozen other towns further East and North. To date (<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March</phrase>) 212 people have died from the disease from a case load of 6,744. The recent outbreak and its subsequent rapid spread to neighbouring towns underlines the threat of disease while the imminent onset of the rainy season will serve to increase the difficulties faced by vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2254W.2/2">DFID has been active in supporting the co-ordination of response efforts in the South and in monitoring the situation. The emergency preparedness and response unit managed by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) together with the World Food Organisation (WHO) have been at the forefront of co-ordinating the response to the outbreak. DFID has been working closely with OCHA providing technical advice, support and funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.2254W.2/3">Through the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) of UNOCHA, DFID has provided over $350,000 to eight UN agencies and non-governmental organisations assisting with the response to the cholera outbreak. An additional $750,000 of DFID funds remains with the ERF for continued assistance to agencies if the disease spreads further.</p>
	<p pid="c.2254W.2/4">In addition to support for such chronic and rapid onset emergencies, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 Work plan, from which the UN humanitarian co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the South including an allocation of US $500,000 to the Emergency Response Fund. The UN humanitarian co-ordinator additionally holds an emergency reserve of $10 million (to which DFID was a significant contributor) which could be accessed to scale up the response to the outbreak should the need arise.</p>

However, many people will be on employment and support allowance for very short periods of time and so carrying out assessments too early in a claim could lead to nugatory assessments taking place.</p>

	<p pid="c.2256W.8/1">Specialist support services are part of the Legal Services Commission's (LSC) special projects budget that was reviewed in the summer 2005. The LSC concluded that as specialist support services provide advice in civil categories of law to other legal advisers and not directly to clients, this did not represent the most cost-effective approach to meet the increasing need for front-line advice. The LSC has therefore decided not to continue funding for specialist support from July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.8/2">The LSC's decision to withdraw funding for specialist support services will refocus resources within the existing civil legal aid budget in England and Wales. It is not intended to increase or decrease costs overall. It will mean that &pound;2.3 million will be redirected to fund direct legal advice in the next financial year, thereby increasing access to legal services for vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.8/3">The LSC invited all the practitioners and specialist advice services funded under the current system to discuss how they can advise clients and consumers directly, rather than through a second-tier system.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.8/4">The Department for Work and Pensions is working with the LSC and the Department for Trade and Industry, as part of a national agenda to tackle rising levels of debt, to pilot a number of innovative new advice services to help people facing financial exclusion, following a &pound;6 million grant from the Treasury's Financial Inclusion Fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.8/5">In terms of advice on benefits and pensions matters, there is already wide expertise and knowledge within the advice sector, and the Department for Work and Pensions, which already has excellent relationships with key national advice providers, will continue to provide for advisers comprehensive information about its legislation and procedures.</p>

	<p pid="c.2257W.2/1">Information is not available on the numbers entering employment as a direct and sole result of the introduction of lone parent Work Focused Interviews, however, research has demonstrated that these interviews have increased participation in new deal for lone parents by approximately 15 per cent. The success of new deal for lone parents has been a major contributing factor to the increase in lone parent employment in every region, the reduction in the number of children in workless households and the reduction in child poverty, and, so far, it has helped more than 423,000 lone parents into work</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/2">Research has also shown that the introduction of Work Focused Interviews (WFIs) for lone parents with ongoing claims has increased the proportion of people leaving income support by between one and two percentage points.</p>

	<p pid="c.2258W.5/3">The new deal for young people national survey <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> which reports on interviews with over 6,000 programme participants, includes a considerable amount of information on the job search activity of people who have taken part in the programme.

	<p pid="c.2258W.5/4">Research from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research <sup>4</sup> published in 2000, reported positively about the impact of new deal for young people.

	<p pid="c.2262W.5/2">As an early step we recently hosted a ticket-touting summit with representatives from the entertainment, cultural and sporting industries to consider a way forward. Subsequently my officials are currently working with other Government Departments, the Office of Fair Trading and the relevant industries to analyse the root causes of the problem and the likely options for action, and they will be reporting their findings back to me in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.2262W.5/3">Among other things a DCMS-led working group will examine the adequacy of existing consumer legislation and how it could be better enforced, in addition to identifying any gaps and loopholes that might need further action.</p>
	<p pid="c.2262W.5/4">Our aim in taking this forward must be to find solutions that protects fans and ensures that our creative, cultural and sporting industries are able to realise legitimate revenue streams. Any proposed solutions must also be both achievable and enforceable. In particular, we shall be looking at the scope for achieving greater clarity and transparency about the sale/resale of ticket sales over the Internet and other channels. And we will also seek to promote greater industry collaboration especially in the area of best practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.2267W.2/1">The Permanent Secretary, in his/her role as Accounting Officer of a Department, is responsible for securing value for money for all departmental expenditure. Guidance requires that payments take account of the 'Better Payment Practice Code' and also covers advance payments which may be sought in return for a price discount. Purchasing guidelines requires Departments to consider discounts as one element of the total cost of the purchase of goods or services. This is facilitated by arrangements which make use of specialist purchasing expertise. Experience suggests, however, that early invoice payment discounts are rarely offered, as standard contract terms tend to be used requiring that invoices are paid within 30 days.</p>

Estimates however have been made of the number of deaths attributable to smoking, by using information on the contribution that smoking makes to specific conditions recorded at death. The Health Development Agency <sup>1</sup> published the most recent estimates for Northern Ireland in 2004.

	<p pid="c.2279W.2/1">Smoking, whether by drivers, escorts, or pupils, is strictly forbidden on all forms of school transport provided by boards. All board tender documents for contract hire buses and taxis stipulate that pupils must travel in a smoke free environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2279W.2/2">If a smoking offence is reported on a board-funded service, then it is treated as serious misconduct. In the case of pupils smoking, the parents are advised of the misconduct in writing. Action is then taken according to the discipline policy of the school that the pupil attends, and according to board procedures. Any recurrence of serious misconduct may result in the withdrawal of the provision of assisted transport.</p>
	<p pid="c.2279W.2/3">Parents and pupils are advised of this policy in the Safe School Travel booklet, which is produced jointly by boards and Translink. This booklet clearly indicates that suitable behaviour by pupils is central to the safety of everyone and specifically advises that a no smoking policy is in operation. In addition to the serious misconduct procedures, smoking on public transport services can be subject to a fine of up to &pound;1,000, imposed by Translink.</p>

	<p pid="c.2281W.3/3">It is not generally possible to link the intensity of individual extreme rainfalls to global climate change. Hadley Centre studies suggest that the frequency of extreme rainfall events, leading to flash flooding, may increase overall in response to global warming; although there will be local and regional variations. UK climate change scenarios issued in 2002 show an increase in the frequency of severe rainfall events across the whole country in the 2080s, compared to today.</p>

	<p pid="c.2282W.2/1">While the Government have set statutory recycling and composting targets for all waste collection authorities in England they do not specify which materials should be collected. However, the Government have, through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), set up the Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE). ROTATE's role is to disseminate information and spread best practice on recyclate collection methodologies throughout the local authority community. One of its messages concerns evidence from research that recyclate collections that include plastics achieve greater householder participation and yield greater quantities of all materials than collections that do not.</p>

Economic modelling undertaken to inform the Government's current waste strategy review suggests that this may increase to about 25 per cent. nationally by 2020.

	<p pid="c.2283W.8/1">The Government are confident that the current water resources planning framework is sufficiently robust to forecast the future demands for water and to manage the supply-demand balance. DEFRA works closely with the water companies and the ODPM to ensure that water needs for new house building are taken into account at an early stage of the planning process and included in a timely manner in the water companies 25 year water resource plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.8/2">The water companies are already statutory consultees on regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks, and should work with plan making bodies in drawing up these plans, so that the necessary coordination can occur. Conversely, the planning authorities will become statutory consultees on the water company water resources management plans, when these plans are put on a statutory basis (expected to be in October 2006). This means that the water companies can be provided with information on proposed large scale developments in their supply areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.8/3">However, new infrastructure is only part of the equation, and the Government are actively pursuing opportunities to reduce unnecessary consumption of water. For example DEFRA has set up the Water Saving Group to investigate further opportunities for more efficient use of water. DEFRA and ODPM will be consulting jointly later this year on mechanisms to improve the efficiency of water use in new-build housing and the Government have recently announced that there will be minimum standards for water efficiency as part of the code for sustainable homes.</p>

	<p pid="c.2285W.9/1">The cost of moving the Highways Agency financial systems to the SAP system is being examined as part of the Department's shared services programme, taking into account the experience of moving the Agency from its legacy cash accounting systems to the Oracle system during 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. As Highways Agency finance will not be migrating to SAP for another three years, the full costs will not be known until detailed technical work, planned for a later stage of the shared services programme, is complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.2285W.9/2">A very broad estimate of the full costs of migrating Highways Agency finance of &pound;10 million to &pound;15 million was given in oral evidence to the Transport Select Committee by the Agency's Finance Director on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>. The migration costs reflected in the interim business case for the shared services programme assumed that it could be done for less, taking into account the work that would already have been carried out in establishing the core SAP platform. The interim business case included a further allowance for optimism bias of &pound;5 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.2286W.2/1">An interim business case for the Department's shared services programme was produced in February 2006, which included initial estimates of the costs of migrating the different business units from their existing accounting and other IT systems to a SAP platform. Some of the business units were already using a version of SAP. This showed that, based on the total estimated economic investment cost of &pound;49.5 million (including 'optimism bias' of &pound;5 million), the programme would pay back in 6 years with a net present value after 10 years of around &pound;46 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.2288W.3/1">For the financial years 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 the OFT expects to make efficiency savings of &pound;6.5 million. These savings will arise from reductions in staffing and related costs, as well as more efficient procurement of goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2288W.3/2">UK Trade and Investment expects to deliver &pound;35 million efficiency savings over the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. Of this, &pound;24 million relates to efficiency savings on the funding streams it receives from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). These funding streams (and hence the expected efficiency savings from these funding streams) relate to staff and associated costs for FCO and DTI staff working for UK Trade and Investment.</p>

As Ofcom has made clear, proposals are designed to preserve the existing system and to improve price transparency for consumers. Ofcom is not planning to create new regional dialling codes. Indeed, the primary aim of Ofcom's proposals for these numbers is to reduce the risk of such changes, now and in the future. The fundamentals of the current plan will remain almost unchanged. Ofcom's plans involve changing the current numbering plan as little as possible while meeting increasing demand for numbers, which are of course a finite resource.

	<p pid="c.2290W.5/1">The revised Northwest Regional Economic Strategy, to be launched in March, sets out the future approach to develop the economy of the region and is the key document in which the RDA's business plan and other documents will be based. The first port of call for business support is the Business Link network within the Local Business Link or through the national website (businesslink.com). Last April oversight of Business Link passed to the RDAs and a review is currently being undertaken by the North West Development Agency (NWDA) of its Business Support and Business Link activities to ensure that these services address the main issues identified in the new Rural Economic Strategy (to be launched in March). The NWDA is also investigating how private sector business support activities can be better incorporated and leveraged by the public sector to improve the overall access, level and quality of service to businesses. Core issues under review include improving client awareness and understanding of services, simplifying services and improving efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.2290W.5/2">Business Link is a national brand&quot; delivered locally, with the RDA responsible for quality delivery. The Business Link service will be a key driver to improving access and the review specifically focuses on how the business model for this service can be extended to increase penetration and access, in part through utilising existing business support structures. The NWDA is also investigating ways in which access and support to 'harder to reach' clients and those with different needs can be improved, such as mainstreaming where appropriate.</p>

Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence's food supply contractor is specifically required to purchase British produce whenever it is competitive to do so and the MOD is working with the Department for Environment Food Rural Affairs and Industry to maximise the competitiveness of British produce.</p>

Ensuring continued close air support to the ISAF is a matter for the NATO force generation process, and the Netherlands have committed six F16s which are due to be fully operational in Kandahar by summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2293W.6/3">The decision to extend the UK Harrier GR7s in theatre from June 2005 until June 2006 was based on the need to cover the period of runway work at Kandahar, the military requirement, and on the relative cost-effectiveness of meeting the requirement in this way. We continue to review the requirement in consultation with NATO and the coalition.</p>

	<p pid="c.2299W.3/1">Stoke Heath young offender institution's anti-bullying strategy has been fully reviewed and now forms part of a violence reduction strategy and an action plan is reviewed monthly. Two units deliver intense intervention to the more serious bullies. Their progress is constantly reviewed. The courses are accredited and audited annually.</p>
	<p pid="c.2299W.3/2">Daily monitoring is recorded in an antisocial behaviour booklet by all staff who have contact with trainees and reviewed every evening by the wing manager and weekly by a board. There is also a self-help group for victims of bullying. Visits to local schools are planned so as to learn from their strategies and methods. A system of rewards and sanctions is being considered to encourage integration to normal location for persistent bullies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2299W.3/3">Brinsford young offender institution's anti-bullying strategy was revised and re-launched following the most recent chief inspector's report. A safeguarding manager has been appointed with responsibility for child protection, violence reduction, anti-bullying and public protection. An anti-bullying co-ordinator post will become full-time and deliver programmes to both perpetrators and victims of bullying. Brinsford is currently working on appointing a safeguarding team. It is planned to introduce an intensive support unit where the perpetrators of bullying will be identified, located and receive appropriate training.</p>

	<p pid="c.2301W.0/1">In 2002&ndash;03, Manchester University carried out an evaluation of the care-planning system in place at that time&mdash;the F2052SH. Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) was developed to address problems identified in that study as well as reflect wider developments in prisoner care. ACCT was introduced into five pilot prisons in January 2004. An internal, interim evaluation was conducted in the summer of 2004 and further improvements were made as a result. A full, independent, study of ACCT was commissioned from a consortium of researchers from Manchester and London Universities. The findings of this evaluation, alongside feedback from establishment staff, Area Safer Custody Advisers and the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) regional leads, will be used to inform a review of ACCT and the suite of ACCT training courses that is being undertaken during 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.0/2">Ongoing analysis of routine monitoring data seeks to monitor the impact ACCT and other initiatives in suicide prevention are having on self-inflicted death and self-harm statistics. However there are a multitude of factors which may explain changes in self-inflicted deaths in particular establishments. Early indications are that the three year rolling average rate of self-inflicted death has fallen by 4 per cent. in the first five pilot prisons to introduce ACCT, and by 12 per cent. in the first 30 prisons to adopt the new system. There have also been encouraging results with regard to self-harm rates at these prisons. This information is provided to the steering board&mdash;on which NIMHE is represented&mdash;that oversaw the development of ACCT and continues to supervise its implementation and review.</p>

Every computer game to be made available in the UK which features gross violence and/or material of a sexual nature must be submitted to the British Board of Film Classification. All videos and cinema films, including animation, are submitted. The BBFC bases its decisions on a set of guidelines which take into account the law, including the Protection of Children Act 1978.

The custodial period will be served in full (less remand time allowed and home detention curfew). Sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the courts. For planning purposes, the impact of custody plus has been assessed under the broad assumption that the majority of those currently getting a custodial sentence of less than 12 months and half of those currently getting a custodial sentence of exactly 12 months will get this sentence. (For those currently getting very short custodial sentences (less than a month) it has been assumed that about half will get a community order or a suspended sentence order.) The distribution of the custodial element of the custody plus sentence has been assumed to follow a similar distribution to that of the sentences it replaces but within the two-13 week band.</p>

	<p pid="c.2308W.8/1">A broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner safer custody (an umbrella term for suicide prevention, self-harm management and violence reduction) strategy is in place. The strategy can be summarised as, 'Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons.' It operates by embedding safer custody as a current through every area of prison life&mdash;including detoxification, health care, staff training, and the built environment&mdash;and applies to all prisoners, regardless of gender.</p>
	<p pid="c.2308W.8/2">Meanwhile a specifically targeted suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy has been developed for women prisoners. This builds upon a number of interventions including individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in women's prisons; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody. &pound;2.5 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to women's prisons to be spent on mental health services and NHS mental health in-reach services are now available in all women's prisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.2308W.8/3">Comprehensive electronic guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been issued; this was developed in close partnership with the Department of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health in England (NIMHE) and aims to be of use to all those working with people who self-harm within a secure environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2308W.8/4">The national Violence Reduction Strategy was launched in May 2004. The national Strategy requires each establishment to have in place a local Violence Reduction Strategy appropriate to needs. A whole prison approach is encouraged, with the aim of reducing violence and fear of violence. A focus on personal safety, supporting victims, and repairing the physical and emotional harm caused by violence or abuse, links closely with the suicide prevention strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.2309W.8/1">The mental health workforce in prisons is trained alongside mental health professionals in the national health service. The majority of healthcare staff will have already gained registered status prior to working within a prison. A small number of staff, usually health care officers and assistants, undertake pre-registration nurse training courses on secondment from prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.2309W.8/2">Mental health awareness training for Prison Service staff falls into two categories. The Government have funded the development of a two-day training course to support the assessment care in custody and teamwork (ACCT) programme, which looks at care planning for at-risk prisoners as part of the Prison Service suicide strategy. This is aimed at Prison Service staff who are going to be ACCT assessors. In addition, we have developed a mental health workbook aimed at the wider custodial workforce. This training is self-directed and is been rolled out initially for six months, to be evaluated, developed and then rolled out fully, so that by April 2007, 20 percent., of staff should have completed a minimum of 10 hours training.</p>

	<p pid="c.2310W.14/15">The Number Eligible column shows the number of complaints out of all those received, that have been eligible for the Ombudsman to investigate. The Ombudsman's terms of reference (and the NPS complaint procedure) require that all three stages of the complaint procedure must have been completed before the Ombudsman may investigate a complaint. The three stages are: informal investigation by the local office, formal investigation by the Chief Officer or a senior officer nominated by the CO, and finally the appeal stage when a panel of three Board members hears the appeal. The Ombudsman may accept complaints that are referred to him within one month of the complainant receiving the result of the Appeal.</p>

The application form is required to capture, as a minimum, details of training, criminality, identity and mental health. The SIA have worked very closely with the industry to identify ways to reduce the rejection rate, and this has resulted in a drop in the rate from 50 per cent. in January 2006 to around 20 per cent. currently.</p>

	<p pid="c.2313W.5/1">Relatively few prisoners, the vast majority of whom are female, account for most self-harm incidents across the prison estate. In 2005, 50 prisoners (1 per cent. of individuals responsible for self-harm incidents) accounted for about 25 per cent. of all reported self-harm incidents; 260 prisoners (5 per cent.) accounted for about 50 per cent. The average number of self-harm incidents per individual who has self-harmed is currently about four per year but 23 prisoners had more than 100 recorded incidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.2313W.5/2">A broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy is in place. The strategy can be summarised as, 'Reducing distress and promoting the well being of all who live and work in prisons.' It operates by embedding 'safer custody' as a current through every area of prison life&mdash;including detoxification, healthcare, staff training, and the built environment. The key intervention currently being introduced across public and private prisons is the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners: Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT). ACCT aims to improve the quality of care by introducing flexible care-planning that is prisoner-centred, supported by improved staff training in assessing and understanding at-risk prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="c.2313W.5/3">Comprehensive electronic guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been issued; this was developed in close partnership with the Department of Health and the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) and aims to be of use to all those working with people who self-harm within a secure environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2313W.5/4">The Prison Service has set up a network of establishments to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice around managing prisoners who self-harm. An information leaflet about managing self-harm written by a prisoner for prisoners includes information on how to manage self-injury and how to get help within the prison context. Touch screen technology is being developed in prisons to inform prisoners of where to obtain support and how to support other prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="c.2319W.2/1">The information requested is shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.2319W.2/2">The national chlamydia screening programme provides opportunistic screening for genital chlamydia infection and is offered to all sexually active women and men aged between 16 and 24-years-old attending a variety of health and non health care settings in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.2319W.2/3">We have rolled out the screening programme successfully to 25 per cent. of primary care trusts and we expect to see screening begin in most areas in April 2006. This is well ahead of the 2007 target.</p>
	<p pid="c.2319W.2/4">The number of programme areas, screening venues and screening tests have increased over time. By the end of the second year, 26 programme areas were in operation and screening occurred in 21 different settings, comprising 872 different venues. Men accounted for 12 per cent. of the total screened. However, provisional data suggest that to December 2005 this figure has increased to 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2319W.2/5">Men have been screened in a variety of non-traditional settings including universities, military bases, prisons, youth offending institutions, work places, pharmacies, the voluntary sector and postal kits as well as through e-mail. Screening has also taken place in traditional health care settings such as general practice, contraceptive and young people's clinics.</p>

	<p pid="c.2321W.0/1">Responsibility for implementing chapter eight of the Coronary Heart Disease National Service Framework (CHD NSF) lies with local national health service service commissioners and providers. Shifting the Balance of Power&quot; has seen money, control and responsibility pass to local health services so that the communities they serve have greater influence over the way local resources are spent and the way local services are run. This will allow greater scope for locally determined targets and priorities to be matched to local needs. The Department is working with local service providers, commissioners and other key stakeholders to support the NHS in implementing chapter eight.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.0/2">For successful delivery, there will need to be effective health commissioning through local delivery planning processes, monitored and accountable through primary care trusts and strategic health authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.2324W.2/1">Most dentists who provide national health service primary dental care services are not paid on a salaried basis, but through a system of NHS fees and other payments that go towards the costs of running a dental practice as well as the dentist's net income.</p>
	<p pid="c.2324W.2/2">The historical estimates of average earnings and expenses for dentists are calculated by the NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre, based on data on gross fees and payments from the Dental Practice Board (DPB) and data from HM Revenue and Customs on expenses.</p>
	<p pid="c.2324W.2/3">DPB payment data show that on average, a dentist with a reasonable NHS commitment in 2004&ndash;05 in the general dental services (GDS) received gross GDS income of about &pound;154,350. Dentists with a reasonable commitment are defined as those with gross fee earnings of &pound;59,100 or more. These averages covered some 7,640 GDS principal dentists who worked throughout the year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="c.2324W.2/4">HM Revenue and Customs information from dentists' tax returns show that the average ratio of expenses to gross earnings for a highly committed NHS dentist is around 52 per cent. (2003&ndash;04 tax year). The same source gives average net income of a highly committed NHS dentist from all sources as &pound;78,600 in the tax year 2003&ndash;04. This information is taken from the tax returns of 392 CDS principal dentists who were in non-associate business arrangements for whom the tax year ended between January and March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2324W.2/5">Based on the data from these sources, the Department estimates that a highly committed NHS dentist earns an average income of around &pound;80,000 in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="c.2325W.0/2">The British Dental Association (BDA) has made recent representations about the contractual requirement for dentists to carry out an agreed number of (weighted) courses of treatment or units of dental activity, in return for their guaranteed annual contract value.</p>
	<p pid="c.2325W.0/3">The Department has indicated to the BDA that we regard the new contracts as offering a good deal for dentists. They will have a guaranteed annual contract value based on their current national health service earnings, which give an average net income of &pound;80,000 per year for a committed NHS dentist, for at least 5 per cent. fewer (weighted) courses of treatment compared with the current general dental services system. The Department has expressed concern that the BDA appears to be overlooking the evidence of the personal dental services pilots, which have shown that abolishing the fee-per-item remuneration system, also supports dentists in carrying out simple courses of treatment, with more time available for preventative work.</p>

	<p pid="c.2327W.2/1">The Mental Health Act 1983 sets out the circumstances in which people with a mental disorder who are being treated compulsorily under that act may receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The act allows ECT to be given to patients who are under compulsory powers when a patient with capacity consents or if the patient's doctor prescribes it and a second opinion appointed doctor agrees to it. The Government are planning to introduce new mental health legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="c.2328W.2/17">A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2328W.2/19">The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episodes statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.2328W.2/21">Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

We intend to introduce a Mental Health Bill into Parliament this session. The race equality impact assessment will be published alongside the Bill when it is introduced in Parliament.</p>

Against a background of above-inflation levels of investment in this area, all NHS trusts are expected to implement a range of improvements in healthcare, including successful pursuit of trust-based targets for reducing <i>methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infection.

	<p pid="c.2334W.2/1">In the White Paper Our health, our care, our say&quot; the Government mapped out a strategy for how we will meet our manifesto commitment on palliative care and set out the key areas of action that we will now develop in partnership with key stakeholders. These are the establishment of end of life care networks; ensuring that all staff who work with people who are dying are properly trained to look after dying patients and their carers; investing in community-based specialist palliative care services and auditing capacity of care provision for disabled children and children with complex health needs. The strategy will be delivered over a three-year period.</p>
	<p pid="c.2334W.2/2">In Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot; we announced that the reconfiguration of primary care trusts (PCTs) would save at least &pound;250 million, which would be channelled back into frontline services. The savings will be available to invest in the local health economy on the agreed Labour party manifesto priorities, including palliative care. Any change in PCT provided services needs to be made by December 2008.</p>

This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data.

The Department allocates funds for the post-16 education and training sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices. Some of the information you require is available on the LSC's website. The LSC was established in 2001 bringing the planning and funding of post-16 education together under one body within a framework set by Government.

	<p pid="c.2341W.2/1">Since it was launched in 2002, almost 30,500 copies of the Department for Education and Skills and Department of Health's Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs): Good Practice Guidance have been distributed on request and free of charge. It is not possible to say how many of these sent to private addresses were ordered on behalf of schools and local authorities, however at least 8,500 have gone to schools and at least 3,700 have gone to local authorities. The guidance has also been available on the Department's website since 2002. Three conferences were held in 2003 in London, Nottingham and Leeds to promote the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.2341W.2/2">Through the work of the Department-funded Special Educational Needs Regional Partnerships the Guidance is being used to audit and develop provision. For example, the West Midlands has developed an early interventions framework for children with ASDs based on the Guidance, the North West is using the guidance to undertake peer supported self-reviews of support services across the region and the South West produced Aiming High&quot;, a video to illustrate the implementation of the guidance in schools. Individual authorities, such as Bolton and Worcestershire, have also worked with the guidance to develop provision in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.2341W.2/3">The Department will, with the Autism Working Group which developed the Good Practice Guidance, look at how use of the Good Practice Guidance and its effectiveness can be evaluated and what can be done to build on it to encourage more good practice throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.2341W.5/1">Access to counselling services is available locally through a number of the Department's programmes including the Connexions Service and the Behaviour and Education Support Teams, Learning Support Units and Learning Mentors established as part of the Behaviour Improvement Programme. Schools and colleges also provide or buy in counselling services for their students. Through the Every Child Matters: Change for Children Programme, multi-agency support teams&mdash;some incorporating both generalist and more specialist counselling and therapeutic skills&mdash;are also developing across local areas. We have provided further encouragement to these developments through our Green Paper, Youth Matters, and the recent establishment of 14 Targeted Youth Support Pathfinders.</p>

	<p pid="c.2342W.8/1">In Hendon constituency the rates of authorised absence (percentage of half days missed in 2004/05) were 5.3 per cent. in maintained primary schools and 5.6 per cent. in maintained secondary schools. The comparative rates for unauthorised absence were 0.9 per cent. in primary schools and 1.1 per cent. in secondary schools. The primary school rates for both authorised and unauthorised absence are above the local authority (Barnet) and National averages. Hendon secondary schools were below the National average for authorised and unauthorised absence, but were above the local authority average for unauthorised absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.8/2">In Hendon constituency in 2003/04 (the most recent year for which figures are available) there were no permanent exclusions from maintained primary or special schools, and nine permanent exclusions from maintained secondary schools (0.11 per cent. of the total number of pupils on the school roll in January 2004). Data are given in the table for exclusions from Hendon secondary schools from 1999/2000 to 2003/04. Over the last three years the rates of permanent exclusions in schools in Hendon have been half of those for Barnet LA and for England, however the figures for Hendon are quite small and can fluctuate over the years.</p>

We do not hold detailed information centrally about the number of schools involved in every type of partnership with public, voluntary and private sector organisations. It is for individual schools' governing bodies to decide whether it is in the best interests of their schools to enter into partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="c.2351W.2/2">The specialist schools programme, in particular, provides opportunities for schools to work in partnership with public, voluntary and private sector organisations and with other schools. We expect that over 80 per cent. of all secondary schools will be specialist by September 2006, including a substantial proportion of foundation schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.2351W.2/3">More generally, the Government are committed to promoting partnership working through Education Improvement Partnerships (EIPs) or other forms of collaboration where this will deliver better outcomes for children. The EIP prospectus encourages partnerships to consider local needs and make alliances which will support the delivery of the outcomes identified. Partnerships should include all appropriate delivery partners, from the public, private or voluntary sector, dependent on the action which the partnership is undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="c.2351W.2/4">Foundation schools may have foundations, that is, charitable bodies which hold their land on trust and appoint governors. Voluntary schools also have foundations. Based on information provided by local authorities, we understand that 96 foundation schools have foundations, comprising around 11 per cent. of the total number of foundation schools.</p>

The regulations set out the minimum requirements for information which schools must include in the pupil's educational record and common transfer file. This, and any additional information held by the school, including information on pupil behaviour and attendance, must be transferred to the pupil's new school as part of the educational record.

	<p pid="c.2361W.2/1">School-based Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators (SENCOs) are selected and appointed by head teachers. There is no specific SENCO qualification they would be expected to have, although we would normally expect a head to appoint someone with a proven track record of successful working with children with SEN and disabilities. Training arrangements for SENCOs would be for local determination, having regard to the knowledge, skills and experience of the person concerned, and the range and complexity of SEN represented within the school.</p>
	<p pid="c.2361W.2/2">The Department's SEN Code of Practice, published in November 2001, contains guidance on the role and responsibilities of SENCOs. The Teacher Training Agency, now the Training and Development Agency for Schools, also published a set of National Standards for SENCOs in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="c.2361W.2/3">In collaboration with the National Association for Special Educational Needs (NASEN), the Department recently convened a series of discussion sessions for primary and secondary SENCOs, designed to identify aspects of good practice in relation to the SENCO role. The results of this work are being disseminated through NASEN publications and otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="c.2361W.2/4">With regard to autism, in 2002 we issued, in partnership with the Department of Health, Autistic Spectrum Disorder Good Practice Guidance. This offered a series of pointers to good practice aimed at schools and SENCOs.</p>

	<p pid="c.2371W.2/1">Last September, I announced that the energy efficiency standards set out in Part L of the Building Regulations are being raised by around 20 per cent. for new housing and by up to 27 per cent. for commercial buildings; these changes come into effect from April 2006. In the response to Barker's review of housing supply published in December 2005 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said that the ODPM would also regulate to achieve water efficiency savings. In addition the Code for Sustainable Homes will set environmental performance standards that are higher than those stipulated by regulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2371W.2/2">The Growth Area programme is an opportunity to promote sustainable construction and can encourage higher standards by including sustainability as one of the key criteria for appraising applications for funding and through guidance to Local Delivery Vehicles.</p>

They are expected to pay particular attention to development proposals for sites where there is reason to suspect contamination, such as from former landfill, and where particularly sensitive uses are proposed, including those involving children. When determining planning applications, local planning authorities should be satisfied that the site concerned is suitable for the new use and that the development does not create unacceptable risks.

	<p pid="c.2375W.2/1">The Planning Inspectorate (PINS) was established as an Executive Agency of the Department of the Environment in April 1992. The chief executive is responsible for the effective management of the inspectorate in accordance with the framework document (which is currently under review) and in accordance with the normal civil service rules on propriety and securing value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.2375W.2/2">The Planning Inspectorate is actively managing improvements to its own performance in arranging hearing and inquiry dates in the face of a continuing high level and variety of casework which places conflicting demands on the available inspector resource.</p>
	<p pid="c.2375W.2/3">Over the period 2001&ndash;02 to 2004&ndash;05, there was an increase of 37 per cent. in the number of planning appeals received. A particular feature of the increased work has been the bulge in appeal receipts that arose between November 2003 and May 2004. As a result of the increase in appeal receipts, a backlog developed. The Planning Inspectorate was tasked by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with clearing the backlog of cases which has been achieved by policy, procedural and other changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2375W.2/4">As part of the Government's response to Kate Barker's Review of Housing Supply the Planning Inspectorate have adopted a target for planning appeals for proposals for 10 or more dwellings to open a hearing or inquiry within 20 weeks of the start date of the case and, in 80 per cent. of the cases, to issue a decision within 10 weeks of the close of the hearing or inquiry.</p>

The right of appeal against refusal of a planning permission is a long-established part of our democratic system. When comprehensive planning controls were first introduced in 1947, Parliament decided that developers should have a right to appeal to the Secretary of State against a decision, or failure to decide an application, which prevented them from developing their land and property as they wished. This right has been carried forward into subsequent legislation and has remained an integral part of the planning system.</p>

	<p pid="c.2380W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.11/2">DFID has been closely monitoring the cholera outbreak in Southern Sudan since it began in late January. The outbreak started in Yei town in southern Sudan and subsequently spread to Juba and a dozen other towns further east and north. To date (<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March 2006</phrase>) 212 people have died from the disease from a case load of 6,744. The recent outbreak and its subsequent rapid spread to neighbouring towns underlines the threat of disease while the imminent onset of the rainy season will serve to increase the difficulties faced by vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.11/3">DFID has been active in supporting the co-ordination of response efforts in the south and in monitoring the situation. The Emergency Preparedness and Response Unit managed by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) together with the World Food Organisation (WHO) have been at the forefront of coordinating the response to the outbreak. DFID has been working closely with OCHA providing technical advice, support and funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.11/4">Through the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) of UNOCHA, DFID has provided over $350,000 to eight UN agencies and non-governmental organisations assisting with the response to the cholera outbreak. An additional $750,000 of FID funds remain with the ERF for continued assistance to agencies if the disease spreads further.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.11/5">To date, the large number of returns of refugees and Internally Displaced People predicted by the UN and others have still not taken place. There is still potential or significant movement in the run up to the rainy season though this is considered unlikely.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.11/6">The outbreak of cholera has affected the returns programme. The return programme for up to 4000 people from Juba to Bor has been suspended because of fears of further disease transmission. With DFID support, various agencies are responding to the cholera outbreak at Lologo returnee way-station near Juba and at Bor way-station which currently holds approximately 1000 returnees. Other DFID supported initiatives include health education, containment centres, and water and sanitation initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.11/7">In addition to supporting such chronic and rapid onset emergencies, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 Work Plan, from which the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the South, including an allocation of US$500,000 to the Emergency Response Fund. The UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator additionally holds an emergency reserve of $10 million (to which DFID was a significant contributor) which could be accessed to scale up the response to the outbreak should the need arise.</p>
