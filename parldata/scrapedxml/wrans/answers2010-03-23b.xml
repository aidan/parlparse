LOCOG's ticketing approach will ensure that it raises the funding required to stage the games and that it provides affordable and accessible tickets to deliver full venues, including Hadleigh Farm. LOCOG is working now to finalise the sports competition schedule and venue seating plans, and this work needs to be completed before LOCOG will know the numbers of seats and tickets. It is critical that as many tickets as possible end up in the hands of the public. Tickets will go on sale in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.160W.5/2">The information requested about tourism funding for Westmorland and Lonsdale is not held centrally. The North West Regional Development Agency (NWRDA) has the primary role in taking forward the north-west regional tourism strategy, and in deciding on investment to promote tourism that would affect Cumbria. The NWRDA spent &#163;14 million in support of tourism in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.160W.5/3">The overall level of public sector investment in UK tourism from local, regional and national sources is likely to exceed &#163;2 billion in the current spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="b.160W.5/4">In partnership with the industry and the wider public sector, DCMS has a clear and coherent policy framework for promoting tourism. The funding provided for the heritage and museums and galleries; for branding and marketing improvements led by VisitBritain and VisitEngland; for the National Skills Strategy for tourism and hospitality; and for the work across Britain to drive up product quality through accommodation grading schemes are all investments by Government which support tourism.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-17">17 March 2010</phrase> David Hanson, Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, announced a further &#163;5.5 million for tackling serious youth violence in 2010-11. &#163;1.5 million of this funding has been made available through the Community Fund, ensuring that 150 voluntary and community sector organisations are able to deliver intensive interventions at a local level to young people involved in serious youth violence, including gangs.</p>

The &#163;17.3 million funding since September 2007 to tackle gangs and serious youth violence has included &#163;1.6 million to the four cities that were the focus of the TGAP programme, London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, to assist in the multi-agency risk management of violent offenders, including gang members. In Merseyside, for instance, this funding has resulted in the UK's first Violent Offender Management Unit. The Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) have also jointly established a team of experts from police forces, local authorities and central Government that will be available to local partnerships to deliver focused advice and guidance on gangs.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.5/3">Further support for local schools, partnerships and practitioners can also be found in guidance on safeguarding children and young people who may be involved in gang activity, recently published jointly by the Home Office and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). This guidance builds on the advice already offered in Tackling Gangs: A Practical Guide, published in 2008, which provides key approaches to help local partnerships devise a gangs strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.162W.2/1">We do not currently have any bilateral agreements in place but we are in negotiation with a number of countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.2/2">We have reached provisional agreement to exchange criminal record information with Australia and New Zealand for employment checking purposes with an applicant's consent. We are aiming to conclude negotiations around the exact mechanisms for doing so by the end of 2010. We have also reached agreements in principle with Ireland and France in relation to those seeking to work with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.2/3">Within the European Union, under the terms of Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between member states, the United Kingdom is told by other member states when a British citizen is convicted of an offence within their jurisdiction. Member states are required to take the necessary measures to comply with this Framework Decision by <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-27">27 April 2012</phrase>. Similarly, information may be received through Interpol channels in relation to British citizens convicted outside the EU. Conviction information received through either channel is recorded on the Police National Computer and so will be disclosed in the same way as convictions in United Kingdom courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.2/4">In many countries individuals, and in some cases third parties, can request criminal records certificates for employment checking purposes. We are currently looking at where we can strengthen the guidance for employers to encourage them to ask to see such certificates, particularly in relation to those seeking work with children and vulnerable adults. We aim to put in place all the information that we have on this process in relation to each country to help employers and prospective employees obtain certificates and understand what is disclosed on them. However, obtaining criminal records is only one aspect of pre-employment checks and good practice is also for employers to obtain character and employment references.</p>

The position of the Governments in Westminster and Wales is that the border should not represent a barrier to provision of health care, and to that end we have worked closely together on the Revised Protocol for Cross-border Healthcare. The Protocol provides increased clarity on commissioning and funding arrangements and on access standards for patients. It ensures patients who live in border regions and who access health services across the border will continue to see improvements to their services. Across the entire UK the Government remain committed to the core defining principles of an NHS funded by tax and free at the point of use.</p>

	<p pid="b.171W.6/1">Supporting Bangladesh to meet the challenges of climate change, including rising land and groundwater salinity, is an important priority for Department for International Development (DFID).</p>
	<p pid="b.171W.6/2">Since 2003, the UK has disbursed &#163;4.6 million to the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) managed by UNDP, which has helped the Government and vulnerable communities to better manage the impact of climate change, including rising salinity. For example, some 34,000 people are benefiting from rainwater harvesting and pond sand filters in Satkhira, one of the worst saline affected districts. We recently committed a further &#163;12 million to a second phase of CDMP, and &#163;60 million to a wider Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Climate Change (subject to approval by the Government of Bangladesh), both of which will be drawn upon for similar activities in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.171W.6/3">The Sanitation, Hygiene and Water Supply Project managed by UNICEF, to which the UK has provided &#163;36 million, is contributing to better national monitoring of water salinity. We are also supporting innovations such as the cultivation of saline- tolerant vegetables in pilot areas.</p>

This obligation applies even if the conviction has been deleted from the Police National Computer. We are aware that a conviction for buggery, before aspects of the offence were decriminalised, may relate to consensual homosexual conduct between adults. Therefore, it is our intention to bring forward an amendment to the Exceptions Order so that an individual does not have to disclose a conviction for buggery where this was for behaviour which has subsequently been decriminalised. However, elements of the offence of buggery under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 remain criminal today; therefore the amendment will not affect the obligation to declare a conviction for buggery where the behaviour which attracted the conviction would still be a criminal offence.</p>

	<p pid="b.188W.2/1">Clause 90 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill was shared with Opposition representatives as it was developed, and was welcomed widely across the House. By requiring returning officers to take reasonable steps to start the counting of votes by 2 am and to give a reasoned account when they fail to do so, the clause creates a clear expectation that, in line with the clearly expressed view of Parliament on this issue, the counting of votes should start by 2 am, where possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.2/2">It is particularly important for the purposes of the new duty that returning officers look carefully at existing arrangements and past practice and consider the additional steps which they can reasonably take in order to start the counting of votes given on ballot papers by 2 am. Past practice is not necessarily a guide to whether the duty to take all reasonable steps to start the count by 2 am will have been fulfilled. Clause 90 would preserve the operational independence of the returning officer, while providing fresh impetus towards counting votes as quickly as possible. In striking this balance, clause 90 respects the important discretion of the returning officer to make decisions to take account of local circumstances, such as the particular geography of a constituency. In this way, the location of the count remains a matter for the returning officer in each case, taking into account both the legislative framework and local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.193W.5/1">Moderation formed part of the Human Resource (HR) procedures put in place by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to facilitate the redeployment of staff from its offices, including Chorley, affected by the decisions arising from the Regional Review Programme undertaken between 2006 and 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/2">The moderation process was developed by HMRC, in consultation with trade unions, to help staff and managers identify whether proposed redeployment options were within the pre-defined Reasonable Daily Travel limits. The process was agreed across the Department together with trade unions, with decisions taken at a local level within line management chains and with independent support and advice to ensure fairness and consistency. Moderation groups were established to make relocation decisions based upon information provided by staff during one-to-one meetings held with their managers.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/3">As part of the moderation process each individual's case was considered individually and personal circumstances were taken into account when deciding if a move was within reasonable daily travelling time for the person concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/4">In February 2008 HMRC announced that Lingmell House would close with the expectation that staff working in customer operations would relocate with their work to customer operations strategic sites in Manchester or Bootle. In line with departmental guidance, customer operations staff working in Lingmell House were then considered for transfer to Manchester and Bootle.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/5">Following one-to-one meetings between managers and staff, decisions were taken by a moderating panel as to whether it was reasonable for an individual to relocate to one of these sites within reasonable daily travel, taking their individual personal circumstances into account. Staff were notified of the outcome of this process by letter in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/6">In July 2008 a second moderation process was mistakenly carried out to consider moves for customer operations staff in the Chorley office to the Tax Credit Office in Preston. As an outcome of this moderation on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-29">29 July 2008</phrase> HMRC wrote to customer operations staff at Lingmell House, Chorley, who were within reasonable daily travel of Preston, to indicate that they could be relocated to the Tax Credit Office at Preston.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/7">The outcome of this second moderation is invalid, as it was not carried out in accordance with the processes agreed between HMRC and departmental trade unions. These processes required that Chorley customer operations staff be moderated within their own business stream-customer operations-and were therefore not eligible to be moderated with the tax credits office in Preston. Changes to the business and staffing requirements in the Tax Credit Office in the second half of 2008 resulted in recruitment of further staff stopping, with no likelihood of future vacancies in that location.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/8">Those staff members unable to travel to their nearest customer operations strategic site at Manchester or Bootle were informed of this in an office meeting in March 2009 and issued with pre-surplus letters on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-17">17 March 2009</phrase> to give them priority access to other jobs or to apply for early release schemes. This decision was taken by HMRC's senior regional manager for customer operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/9">After being made surplus in January 2010 some Chorley customer operations staff and the local trade union representative contacted HMRC to clarify the position with regard to the letter they had received in July 2008 about transferring to TCO Preston. The regional director's support team replied giving more details as to why the second moderation process was invalid and apologised for the confusion and unwarranted expectations that had arisen as a result of this moderation.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/10">At the time of the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January 2010</phrase> that Lingmell House would close during 2010-11, redeployment solutions had been found for 27 of the 39 staff working there. The announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January</phrase> provided staff who were unable to relocate the option to volunteer for compulsory early severance or compulsory early retirement and leave the Department by <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/11">HMRC will continue to help those staff who chose not to take up this option to find redeployment opportunities within the Department or in the wider civil service.</p>

	<p pid="b.200W.2/1">DWP lead the Government's response to some of the biggest issues facing the country-welfare and pension reform-and are a key player in tackling child poverty<sup>(1)</sup>. As the biggest delivery Department in the UK, DWP makes a difference to millions of people every day, helping them to lead safer, fairer and more rewarding lives that are free from poverty. We want to give people more choice and control over their lives and are committed to providing greater choice and personalised support to everyone who needs it so they have the opportunity to get into and remain in work. We believe that work works. Even in economically challenging times we know that work works for the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/2" class="italic"> Support to find work</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since January 1998, the number of people unemployed in Manchester, Gorton has decreased by 10 per cent. to 3,891, and the number unemployed for more than one year has decreased by 63 per cent. to 515. From August 1997 to August 2009 the number of lone parents claiming income support in Manchester, Gorton has decreased by 44 per cent. to 1,890.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/4">Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Since their inception over 2.2 million people in Great Britain have found work with the support of the New Deal, and 6,060 have been helped in Manchester, Gorton.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/5" class="italic"> Support for children</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/6">We introduced a target to halve child poverty by 2010-11 on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Poverty is measured using a headline indicator of the proportion of children in households with an income below 60 per cent. of contemporary household median income before housing costs. This is in line with international best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/7">Statistics on the numbers of children living in poverty are not available at the constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/8" class="italic"> Support for older people</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/9">Since 1997 our strategy has been to target help on the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/10">This year we will be spending over &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than if we had continued with the policies that were in place in 1997. Around half of that money will go to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/11">In 1997 the poorest pensioners, who received income support, lived on &#163;69 a week (&#163;98 in today's prices). Today pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, means no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week, &#163;198.45 for couples. As of August 2009, 5,830 pensioners in Manchester, Gorton are benefiting from pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/12">In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty in UK compared to 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs).</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/13">Statistics on the proportion of pensioners living in relative poverty are not available at the constituency level. But the latest data for the north-west Government office region show that the proportion of pensioners in poverty (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs) fell from 28 per cent. to 18 per cent. since 1997<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/14">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payment which for winter 2009-10 is worth &#163;250 for households with someone aged between 60 to 79 and &#163;400 for households with someone aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than &#163;60 million per year was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-we now spend around &#163;2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In winter 2008-09 (the last winter for which information is available) 10,010 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Manchester, Gorton.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/15">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people can continue to have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the Financial Assistance Scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/16">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people are not left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/17">In total 2,167 people in the north-west Government office region are receiving compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (data not available at constituency level)<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/18">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/19">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/20" class="italic"> Support for disabled people and carers</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.2/21">Since 2001, we have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Manchester, Gorton will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in eight local authority sites from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.202W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase> the Department for Work and Pensions launched its housing benefit consultation exercise: 'Supporting people into work: the next stage of Housing Benefit reform'. The consultation concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-22">22 February 2010</phrase>. The Department will consider the detailed policy design of any new measures, including any changes to the calculation of local housing allowance rates, once it has considered all responses.</p>
	<p pid="b.202W.2/2">The local housing allowance was rolled out from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-07">7 April 2008</phrase> and is a more transparent way of calculating the rent element of housing benefit for people living in the deregulated private rented sector. The local authority uses the appropriate local housing allowance rate, based on the area where the person lives and the size of their household, to determine the maximum amount to be included in the housing benefit calculation. This rate is currently based on the median of rents within the local area. However, customers in some areas have benefited more than others from the local housing allowance, and high rents in some areas have driven up benefit rates. As part of its consultation exercise, the Department for Work and Pensions asked its stakeholders for input into how local housing allowance rates should be set in future to ensure customers can afford decent but not luxurious accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="b.205W.9/2">From November 2009 we have increased the amount of capital completely ignored in the calculation of pension credit and housing and council tax benefit for pensioners from &#163;6,000 to &#163;10,000. This change will benefit around 500,000 pensioners and will mean around 88 per cent. of pension credit recipients will have all of their capital ignored in their pension credit assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.207W.2/1">The Government strongly believe that the best way to tackle adult poverty is through work. Those in work in the long term are better off than on benefits as training, promotion and career opportunities can enable many workers to attain a better standard of living for themselves and their families. We are therefore placing an increased priority on helping all groups of people, including disabled people and those with health conditions, lone parents and long term unemployed people get into rewarding and sustainable jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.207W.2/2">The Government's declared aim is to eradicate child poverty by 2020. Our determination to do so is as firm as ever and this is demonstrated by introducing the Child Poverty Bill. The Child Poverty Bill will bring new impetus to eradicating child poverty by 2020. It will provide a definition of success and sets a framework to guarantee that Government and its partners at national and local levels make a clear and vital contribution towards ending child poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.207W.2/4">Addressing pensioner poverty has been a priority for this Government. We have targeted help on the poorest pensioners, those who need it most, while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.207W.2/5">With the help of targeted support and additional funding there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty (after housing costs) in 2007-08 than in 1998-99.</p>

	<p pid="b.211W.5/1">As the biggest delivery Department in the UK, DWP makes a difference to millions of people every day, helping them to lead safer, fairer and more rewarding lives that are free from poverty. The policies that we have introduced since 1997 have aimed to give people more choice and control over their lives. Through our welfare reform programme, we are committed to providing personalised support to everyone who needs it so they have the opportunity to get into and remain in work.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/2" class="italic"> Support to find work</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/3">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since 1997, the number of people unemployed in Streatham has decreased by 18 per cent. to 4,594, and the number unemployed for more than one year has decreased by 64 per cent. to 725. From May 1997 to May 2009 the number of lone parents claiming income support in Streatham has decreased by 37 per cent. to 2,540.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/4">Our New Deal programmes have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Since their inception over 2.2 million people in the UK have found work with the support of the New Deal, and 6,070 have been helped in Streatham.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/5" class="italic"> Support for children</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/6">We introduced a target to halve child poverty by 2010-11, on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Poverty is measured using a headline indicator of the proportion of children in households with an income below 60 per cent. of contemporary household median income before housing costs. This is in line with international best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/7">Statistics on the numbers of children living in poverty are not available at the constituency level, but the latest information for the Inner London area shows that the proportion of children in poverty has fallen from 39 per cent. to 27 per cent. since 1997<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/8" class="italic"> Support for older people</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/9">Since 1997 our strategy has been to target extra help at the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/10">This year we will spend over &#163;13 billion more on pensioners than if we had continued with the policies that were in place in 1997. Around half of that money will go to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/11">In 1997 the poorest pensioners, who received income support, lived on &#163;69 a week (&#163;98 in today's prices). Today pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, means no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week, or &#163;198.45 for couples. As of May 2009, 4,850 pensioners in Streatham are receiving pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/12">In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners living in relative poverty in the UK than in 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs). Statistics on the numbers of pensioners living in relative poverty are not available at constituency level, but the latest information for the Inner London area shows that the proportion of pensioners in poverty has fallen from 42 per cent. to 29 per cent. since 1997<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/13">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payments which this winter is worth &#163;250 for households aged between 60 to 79 and &#163;400 for households aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than &#163;60 million was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-this year we will be spending around &#163;2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In 2008-09, 12,410 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Streatham.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/14">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the Financial Assistance Scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/15">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people are not left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/16">In total 423 people in the London area are receiving compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (data not available at constituency level)<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/17">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/18">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three-quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/19" class="italic"> Support for disabled people and carers</p>
	<p pid="b.211W.5/20">Since 2001, we have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Streatham will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. Older and less well-off carers are receiving extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.217W.5/2">We continue to give our full support to the UN Sanctions Committee in pursuing and investigating sanctions violations. Following a series of sanctions violations by Iran in 2009 (including the interdictions of weapons from Iran on the Hansa India, Monchegorsk and Francop vessels), the UN Sanctions Committee on Iran issued an Implementation Assistance Notice in January 2010. This urged all UN member states to be especially alert to further violations, in particular to exercise enhanced vigilance over all Islamic Republic of Iran shipping lines activity, including subjecting its cargo to enhanced scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="b.222W.2/8" class="indent">The contract for census processing was awarded to Lockheed Martin UK in August 2008. This is the largest of the census contracts with a value of around f 150m.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/9" class="indent">It is estimated that the cost for the printing of the 2011 Census questionnaires is in the region of &#163;20 million; which would equate to an average cost of around &#163;0.53 per questionnaire.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/10" class="indent">Lockheed Martin UK acts as the prime contractor with several sub contractors undertaking aspects of the work.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/11" class="indent">There are a number of types of census questionnaires. England, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a different question set, and in Wales everything needs to be printed twice, once in English and once in Welsh.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/12" class="indent">Due to the differences in questions and language used across these areas, there will be 17 separate types of questionnaires printed in total. These can be broadly grouped into four categories, and will be printed in the corresponding quantities:</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/13" class="indent">Household questionnaires: around 34 million</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/14" class="indent">Individual questionnaires: around 3 million</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/15" class="indent">Communal Establishment questionnaires: around 144,000</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/16" class="indent">Census Coverage Survey questionnaires: around 600,000</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/17" class="indent">ONS docs not have the costs of printing each specific form type.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/18" class="indent">Storage costs are factored into the fixed price service contract so it is not possible to extract specific costs for the storage of any questionnaires printed in the period up to census day.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/19" class="indent">In addition to the questionnaires there are information guides, translations of the questions into various languages, leaflets, envelopes and other necessary material to accompany the questionnaires; as well as the various administrative forms used by census staff to undertake the census. This amounts to around 50 separate types of document to be printed; and is estimated to total approximately 107 million items, on top of the roughly 1 billion pages of questionnaires.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/20" class="indent">Initial printing of the questionnaires is running from March 2010 to July 2010; once this is complete a second process of overprinting will begin in July 2010, during which individual barcodes, unique identifiers and internet access codes will be printed onto each questionnaire.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/21" class="indent">For this process to be a success the scanning and processing software needs to be developed and rigorously tested. This is a large and involved project and must start in April 2010 for the systems to be ready in time for census day on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-27">27 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.2/22" class="indent">In addition to being needed for the printing timetable, a finalised print-tested questionnaire is needed for the programming of the scanning and printing software and for creating test data for the various stages of testing necessary to ensure that the final processes meet the high standard demanded by the census.</p>

These estimates suggest that the number of people ranges between 400,000 and 580,000, and between 12,000 and 26,000 being diagnosed each year. For example, the National Audit Office report 'Services for People with Rheumatoid Arthritis' estimates that 580,000 adults have rheumatoid arthritis, with approximately 26,000 new diagnoses each year. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guidance on the management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults, published in February 2009, estimates prevalence of 400,000 and annual incidence of 12,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.237W.0/1">The &quot;Sex. Worth talking about&quot; campaign highlights that there are 15 contraceptive options available, including two types of contraceptive pill. It aims to raise awareness of the longer acting methods which are more effective in typical use and are less well known among the public. The campaign is designed to encourage people to investigate all their options and to consider which method might best fit their lifestyle. It advises a discussion with a healthcare professional in order to clarify these options, as medical considerations may impact an individual's final choice. It is too early to know if there has been an effect on usage of the oral contraceptive pill but the annual NHS Contraception Services Report, due October 2010, will be the first indication of any changes in the profile of contraceptive methods chosen by women.</p>

	<p pid="b.238W.3/1">Data on the number of carers (aged 16 and over who are caring for adults aged 18 and over) in receipt of direct payments from councils with adult social services responsibilities (CASSRs) is collected and published by the NHS Information Centre for health and social care. Provisional data on the total numbers of carers in receipt of direct payments during the year <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, by CASSR are available and a copy has been placed in the Library.

	<p pid="b.238W.3/2">The Department has given councils an Adult Social Care Reform Grant of &#163;520 million to spend over three years from April 2008. This will enable them to make their social care services more personalised. It is a local decision about how much the local authority chooses to spend to administer personal budgets, which is only one part of the transformation programme. The Department does not collect prospective information. However, the Association for Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) has estimated that 200,000 people are likely to have a personal budget by April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/3">Although the Department collects information retrospectively on the number of people who receive personal budgets, no official estimate has been made of the number of councils that will have provided personal budgets to 30 per cent, of people eligible to receive community care services by April 2011. ADASS are currently undertaking a survey to identify council's progress and this report will be published in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/4">Councils which do not meet the target will be identified by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as part of their monitoring role. The Department has been working closely with CQC to ensure that a consistent message is delivered to councils.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/5">The following guidance and programmes have been provided to councils to help them operate and use direct payments and personal budgets:</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/6" class="indent">Personal budgets for older people-making it happen (January 2010). This guide focuses on how councils can make personal budgets work well for older people and their families. It looks at how to ensure personal budgets are accessible, simple to use, flexible and help to achieve the things that matter most to the people using them. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/7" class="indent">Personal Budgets: Council Commissioned Services (January 2010). ADASS produced further advice on how personal budgets can work well for people who use council-commissioned services rather than a direct payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/8" class="indent">ADASS and the Department published a set of materials which aim to help councils make progress with implementing 'Putting People First (2007) (PPF)' a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. These bring together the latest learning from councils and are linked to the PPF milestones agreed between ADASS, the Local Government Association and the Department in September 2009. These materials include:</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/9" class="indent">PPF operating models: early learning (October 2009). This resource was published by ADASS which provides advice and examples showing how innovative councils are approaching the transformation of their systems and the lessons they are learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/10" class="indent">Guidance on direct payments: For community care, services for carers and children's services (September 2009). This departmental guidance provides information on how local councils might operate direct payments. It reflects the changes brought about by the new regulations and supersedes the 'Direct Payments guidance: community care, services for carers and children's services (Direct Payments) guidance England 2003'. It also reflects the Government's commitment to support independence, choice and control, as set out in Putting People First; A shared vision and commitment to the transformation of Adult Social Care and Aiming high for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.3/11" class="indent">The Department has also published a self-assessment and action planning guide (May 2007) to support councils and their partners. These local solutions have been collated to form a web-based nation solution set which is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.244W.2/1">In December 2009 the Government launched 'New Horizons: A Shared Vision for Mental Health', a comprehensive programme for improving the mental health and well-being of the population and services for those with poor mental health. It takes a lifespan approach, from laying down the foundations of good mental health in childhood, through promoting and protecting continued well-being into adulthood, to supporting and maintaining resilience in older age.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.2/2">We want to make sure that mental health services move away from arbitrary distinctions between working age adults and older adults. We are working with the Royal College of Psychiatrists and others to assist mental health service providers to develop age-appropriate non-discriminatory services. As a first step, 'New Horizons' provides the descriptors of such services, to assist in this work.</p>

	<p pid="b.253W.9/2">Research carried out for the DTI by Policis in 2004 gave an example of an APR in the legal home credit market of 497 per cent. The Competition Commission investigation of the home credit market in 2006 stated that APRs in the home credit market range from 150 to 500 per cent. One of the remedies introduced by the Commission was the requirement for all home credit providers to include their products on a website, lenders compared, to enable customer comparison of prices. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that the breakeven APR for a not-for-profit home credit company was between 123 and 129 per cent. The OFT is reviewing the high cost credit market, including the home credit market, and they will report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.9/3">The Department commissioned a research report into the scope and extent of illegal money lending in the UK by Policis and the Personal Finance Research Centre (PFRC) in 2006. The total cost of credit charged by illegal money lenders was on average &#163;185 per &#163;100 advanced, approximately three times the cost of credit from the highest cost legal lenders and more than double what people expected to pay. Loan sharks' interest rates can vary from 500 per cent. up to as high as 11 million per cent. in some extreme cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/2">The Government have taken measures that have assisted hundreds of thousands of companies across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/3">Large numbers of businesses have benefited from the actions taken to stabilise the banking system and keep credit flowing.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/4">The Business Payment Support Service, launched in November 2008, supports small businesses to make use of the Time to Pay scheme which allows companies to spread their tax payments over a timetable they can afford. This was extended at PBR 2009. Since its launch, the Government have arranged some 305,000 agreements, with more coming through every day. Some companies have been able to benefit more than once, allowing over 160,000 companies to defer over &#163;5.2 billion in tax. The Business Link Health Checks has provided over 117,000 businesses with free and impartial advice. In addition, regional development agencies help hundreds of thousands of businesses each year. Thousands of businesses have also been able to claim tax relief which has been extended on losses from one to three years. The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme is enabling additional bank lending to thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, extended in PBR 2009. Through Train to Gain, over 80,000 businesses have received support to enable their staff to undergo training. In total, well over 300,000 businesses have received support. And in addition, the PBR 2009 decision to further defer the increase in the Small Companies' Rate of corporation tax from next month, will help around 850,000 small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/5">1.8 million properties owned by business will also be able to improve cash flow by spreading an increase in business rates over the next three years which allows for the deferral of up to &#163;700 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/6">The Growth Capital Fund to attract private sector investment for UK small and medium-sized businesses will be implemented later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/7">The UK Innovation Investment Fund is backing British innovation, currently consisting of &#163;325 million of public and private investment with the potential to raise &#163;1 billion of investment over the next 10 years. The Government are also proposing to reduce the burden of regulation enabling small businesses to get on with their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/8">There are a number of other initiatives to help individuals, especially young people. For example, the Government are:</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/9" class="indent">Building on the September Guarantee that ensures all 16 and 17-year-olds are offered a suitable place in learning, by guaranteeing the offer of a place on an Entry to Employment programme-for those young people aged 16-18 who are not yet ready or able to enter apprenticeship, employment or further learning opportunities;</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/10" class="indent">Providing a new Young Person's guarantee for 18 to 24-year-olds to ensure access to jobs, training and work experience opportunities after six months claiming for jobseeker's allowance; and</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/11" class="indent">Creating an additional 35,000 new advanced apprenticeships for 19 to 30-year-olds over the next two years, almost doubling capacity and creating a new class of British technician-filling a longstanding gap in the British labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.6/12">Further measures will be announced in the Budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.257W.2/1">The Department has received a number of letters from Jewish students following a Jewish student lobby of Parliament about &quot;hate speakers&quot; on some university campuses. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> has also written to me about a reported anti-Israel speaker appearing at two universities.</p>
	<p pid="b.257W.2/2">Decisions about external speakers must rest with universities themselves. In this area universities are bound by the law both in protecting freedom of speech on campus, even if that free expression is controversial, and protecting students and staff against harassment or violence. The Government have made clear that there is no place for anti-Semitism or any other form of racism or intolerance in HE. Universities have access to guidance from both Government and the sector itself on promoting good campus relations, which draw out the considerations institutions need to give to free expression on campus and to addressing illegal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.257W.2/3">There is a very clear dividing line set out in law between political debate, discussion of doctrine or faith and incitement to commit or glorify violence or terrorism. This line should not be thought vague. When the law is broken on campus those responsible must be reported to the relevant authorities. There is both a moral duty and importantly a legal obligation to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.259W.6/2">It is for learners to declare whether or not they consider themselves to have a learning difficulty and/or disability (LDD). As a result, the actual number of learners in this category accessing FE and skills provision will vary from year to year depending on demand, but has been around 200,000 each year from 2006/07 to 2008/09 academic year (the latest whole year for which data is available).</p>
	<p pid="b.259W.6/3">Within this overall total, learners with LDD follow various courses, depending on their personal preferences or the nature of their disability. It is therefore not possible to say how many learners of the total with LDD will pursue courses that would be categorised as Foundation Learning through Adult Learner Responsive route. The Skills Investment Strategy 2010-11, does, however, set out the commitment that the total adult FE and Skills budget will provide sufficient funding to maintain volumes at the level of previous years.</p>

	<p pid="b.260W.5/2">The MRC funds a broad portfolio of diabetes research amounting to &#163;28.1 million in 2008-09, of which &#163;6.5 million was directly relevant to type 1 diabetes.

Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health. The MRC does not normally allocate funds to particular topics, and research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. When appropriate, high quality research in particular areas of strategic importance may be given priority in competition for funds, but research excellence and importance to health continue to be the primary considerations in funding decisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.274W.6/1">Since the then Minister for Local Government and Community Cohesion delivered his speech in February 2006, the Department for Communities and Local Government has published two White Papers and passed two major pieces of legislation, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 and the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 which clearly demonstrate the actions taken to implement &quot;double devolution&quot;. A key element of this work has been the introduction in 2008 of the new local performance framework, which aimed to lessen the burden and bureaucracy of assessment on local government, by reducing the number of performance indicators on which councils are measured from around 1,200 to 188-and replacing the old Comprehensive Performance Assessment with the new, lighter touch, Comprehensive Area Assessment in April last year. We have already reduced the number of inspection days in Councils by a third, while the cost of the independent inspection has been reduced by 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.6/2">We have also increased financial freedom and stability to local government through the first ever three-year finance settlement, reduced ring-fencing, and devolved powers to local authorities, enabling them to create parish councils, make and enforce certain bylaws and increasing their choice in democratic processes such as electoral schemes and leadership style. We have strengthened the opportunity for local people to take action for themselves, promoting the transfer of assets from local government to local people where these could be better run for community benefits, and introducing community contracts, where residents and local agencies agree on the priorities for their area and the action both will take to achieve them. We have funded the Participatory Budgeting Unit to support local authorities in activities to involve local people in prioritising specified budgets and have increased councillors' powers to raise issues up the agenda of the local authority by introducing the Councillor Call for Action, which enables any councillor to refer an issue to the overview and scrutiny committee. We have also recently passed legislation that will give citizens greater power to hold local authorities to account and influence local services. This includes a new duty for local authorities to respond to petitions from local people; and the extension of scrutiny arrangements, enabling local people, through their councillors, to influence decisions which affect their day to day lives and give them more say over what their council is doing for them and complementing measures to increase engagement and empowerment in key local services.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.6/3">The &quot;Strengthening Local Democracy&quot; public consultation last July, and our response published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-05">5 February</phrase>, affirms our continuing commitment to principles of devolution at all levels. In addition, &quot;Putting the Front-line first: Smarter Government&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December</phrase> sets out how Government will meet new challenges and deliver better public services for lower costs by: driving up standards through strengthening the roles of citizens and civic society; freeing up public services by recasting the relationship between the centre and the front-line and streamlining central Government, saving money through sharper delivery.</p>

	<p pid="b.277W.2/29">Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government have put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.279W.8/1">Valuation officers are required under Section 41 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to maintain accurate rating lists. When they become aware that a change is needed, such as that at the ports, they must make the alteration and also specify the date from which the change should become effective for rates charging purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/2">The principles concerning separate rateability where there is &quot;exclusive occupation&quot; and &quot;paramount control&quot; are long established. The leading case on the subject is a House of Lords decision from as far back as 193 6-Westminster Council v. Southern Railway Company and W.H. Smith and Son.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/3">The VOA rated ports and properties within ports for the 2005 list based upon information supplied by the ports operators and indeed a significant number of separate assessments appeared in the rating lists for individual port occupiers at this stage, even before the ports review was initiated.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/4">It was only after the list was compiled that-through routine work to keep the lists up to date-it was found that at Southampton Container Terminal the assessment for the 2000 list may not have correctly reflected the extent to which separate property within the Port of Southampton needed to be assessed. Action was therefore taken by the VOA to amend the list, but this action was strongly disputed by the other parties and legal and valuation argument followed: only once that appeal had been withdrawn, (in April 2006), were the VOA able to satisfy themselves of the correct approach in relation to certain types of port occupation and they immediately instigated the review of ports. Port operators were advised by letter of the ports review and its background in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/5">As a result of the review, which ended in 2008, 725 newly assessed properties were added to the ratings list. The decision to add each of these would have been made by the relevant valuation officer in each instance.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/6">The review of ports by the Valuation Office Agency is to ensure that all individual business properties within and outside ports are rated fairly to ensure that the burden of contributions to funding local government is shared fairly among businesses around the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/7">The Government have listened to the concerns of businesses with significant and unexpected backdated bills, including some businesses within ports. It has legislated to enable such bills to be repaid over an unprecedented eight years rather than in a single instalment, helping affected businesses to manage the impact on their cash flows during the downturn by reducing the amount they are required to pay now by 87.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.279W.8/8">As at October 8l 2009, local authorities have reported that ratepayers occupying 221 properties within ports had fully discharged their backdated liability and ratepayers occupying a further 200 business properties within ports had been granted a schedule of payments.</p>

Data are as reported to Communities and Local Government by the city of York on their 2009-10 National Non-Domestic Rates (NNDR) returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.281W.8/3">No estimates of the average bill in 2010-11 have been made, as these contain not only transitional relief but all other reliefs, some determined at the billing authorities' discretion. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the likely bill of a hereditament and any comparison with the average bill in 2009-10 will be flawed as it cannot take account of all of these reliefs.</p>
	<p pid="b.281W.8/4">However, for the purpose of modelling the 2010 Transitional Relief scheme, my Department has estimated a proxy for rates bills in 2010-11. The Notional Chargeable Amount (NCA) was calculated which for a given year is the product of the rateable value and that year's small business multiplier. The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition. The figure derived from dividing the total of all proxy bills for 2010-11 in the city of York by the number of hereditaments on the draft 2010 rating list used for the Department's 2010 transitional relief modelling is &#163;16,300.</p>

The assumptions underlying this modelling include zero inflation, which does not reflect the latest information available, and adjustments for appeals.

The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.281W.8/8">Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government have put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.283W.0/16">No estimates of the number and proportion of hereditaments in the city of York that will receive an increase or decrease in bill have been made, as these contain not only transitional relief but all other reliefs, some determined at the billing authorities' discretion. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the likely bill of a hereditament.</p>
	<p pid="b.283W.0/17">However, for the purpose of modelling the 2010 Transitional Relief scheme, my Department has estimated a proxy for rates bills in 2009-10 and 2010-11. The Notional Chargeable Amount (NCA) was calculated which for a given year is the product of the rateable value and that year's small business multiplier. The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition. The result of these proxy calculations is shown in table 2 as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.283W.0/39">When calculating the business rates multiplier in a revaluation year, we are required by law to discount the effect of any increases in rateable value. As a result, we have reduced the multiplier by 15 per cent. in 2010-11-taking it to its lowest level for 17 years. This is designed to ensure the Government do not collect an extra penny from revaluation. The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of their property relative to others.</p>
	<p pid="b.283W.0/40">Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government have put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.288W.5/1">Ordnance Survey's policy for the recording of encampments and Traveller camps reflects normal data capture policy. The location of buildings, roads, tracks, hedges, fences and similar structures which meet the relevant map specifications are surveyed and recorded when they are considered to be permanent features in the landscape. Locations of mobile homes are recorded as though they were buildings, but only when they are occupied principally for residential purposes and have a postal address.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/2">Judgments as to permanence and residential status are determined by the surveyor using the detailed mapping specifications, established precedent and experience in interpreting the physical nature of a development.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/3">It is not within Ordnance Survey's remit to make any judgment on the legality or otherwise of any feature or development within the landscape.
