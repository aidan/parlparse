	<p pid="c.1861W.3/1">The potential economic impact of the new A500 through Stoke on Trent was assessed as set out in the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) document &quot;Guidance on the Methodology for Multi-Modal Studies&quot; (GOMMS, 2000).</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.3/2">The GOMMS approach to assessment includes various objectives against which schemes are to be assessed, one of which is Economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.3/3">The Economy objective comprises Transport Economic Efficiency, Reliability and Wider Economic Impacts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.3/4">With regard to Transport Economy Efficiency, the quantitative economic modelling carried out before start of works in 2004 shows that the A500 Scheme has a Benefit to Cost Ratio of 4.0. The Benefit to Cost Ratio is a measure of the economic efficiency, and is calculated by dividing the benefits by the costs, and a BCR of 4 is considered &quot;High&quot; Value for Money.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.3/5">With regard to Reliability, the qualitative assessment shows that the A500 Scheme has a positive &quot;Beneficial&quot; impact.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.3/6">With regard to Wider Economic Impacts, the qualitative assessment shows that the A500 Scheme lies within and will directly serve the Stoke-on-Trent designated regeneration area, and that Development will depend upon the A500 Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.3/7">The results of the assessments are included in an Appraisal Summary Table, which was presented at the Public Inquiry in November 2002.</p>

Its work offers strategic direction in five key sectors&mdash;finance, energy, information and communications technology (ICT), healthcare and water&mdash;areas where the UK has world-class expertise and where Chinese demand is growing rapidly.

Deepening educational links&mdash;particularly in the higher education sector&mdash;is vital to allowing the UK to tap into the large pool of well-qualified Chinese graduates, and to encouraging Chinese students to come to the UK. Greater understanding and interchange will help both our economies profit in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="c.1873W.8/2">The Government published the UK Sustainable Development Strategy &quot;Securing the Futureonly&quot; in March 2005, setting out a range of activities to support this vital agenda. The UK Framework for Sustainable Development, &quot;One future&mdash;different pathsy&quot;, also launched in March 2005, describes the shared understanding and common purpose that exists across departments and in different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.8/3">Sustainable development is promoted and co-ordinated through a number of ministerial and official level working groups across Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.8/4">For example, within the Cabinet there are two committees which have sustainable development issues as part of their remit: the Energy and Environment (EE) Committee and the Sub-Committee on Sustainable Development in Government (EE(SD)). The EE Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister and was established in May 2005 to develop the Government's energy and environmental policies, to monitor the impact on sustainable development of the Government's policies, and to consider issues of climate change, security of supply and affordability of energy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.8/5">I chair the EE(SD) Sub-Committee which has the remit to improve the Government's contribution to sustainable development through the conduct of its business, including through consideration of departmental sustainable development action plans; and to report as necessary to the Energy and Environment Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.8/6">The Sustainable Development Commission is the Government's independent watchdog on sustainable development, reporting to the Prime Minister and the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales. Its recently expanded role includes monitoring cross-Government and departmental progress towards sustainable development.</p>

Whether the existence of overhead power lines would affect the open market value of a dwelling, on which the council tax banding is based, is a question of fact and degree in individual cases. Such matters would be considered by listing officers of the VOA and, if their decision on banding were subject to an appeal, by Valuation Tribunal panels, on a case by case basis. No specific guidance on the effect on valuations for council tax purposes of proximity to overhead power lines has been published by either <i> (a)</i> the VOA or <i> (b)</i> the VTS.

Last year, these included the US101 helicopter, to be used for the US Presidential flight, and an important understanding with Saudi Arabia. This will lead to a greater partnership in modernising the Saudi armed forces, and will sustain the defence relationship for many years to come.</p>

	<p pid="c.1880W.0/1">Government are taking a number of measures to encourage the use of cleaner and more efficient sources of energy such as renewables, combined heat and power (CHP), and carbon abatement technologies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/2">The Government's key mechanism for encouraging renewable generation is the Renewables Obligation (RO) which places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source a specific and annually increasing percentage of their sales from eligible renewable sources. This is set at 6.7 per cent. for 2006-07 and will rise to 15.4 per cent. by 2015-16. The RO together with the Climate Change Levy will be worth up to &pound;l billion per year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/3">Since 2002 the Government have also made available around &pound;500 million of direct funding for emerging renewable and low carbon technologies in the form of capital grants.</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/4">This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/5" class="indent">&pound;117 million in capital grants for round one offshore wind farms;</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/6" class="indent">&pound;66 million for biomass capital grants;</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/7" class="indent">&pound;80 million for Low Carbon Buildings Programme;</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/8" class="indent">&pound;50 million Demonstration Fund for Carbon Abatement Technologies, Hydrogen and Fuel Cells;</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/9" class="indent">&pound;12.5 million for the Clear Skies Programme;</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/10" class="indent">&pound;50 million for Marine Renewables Deployment Fund; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/11" class="indent">&pound;19 million a year for industry-led Research &amp; Development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/12">With regard to Combined Heat and Power (CHP) the Government have added support measures for CHP in the new Climate Change Programme, including a commitment that CHP will be fully considered in the UK's Phase II National Allocation Plan of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Combined heat and power (CHP) can increase the overall efficiency of fuel utilisation to more than 75 per cent. compared with up to 50 per cent. from modern Combined Cycle Gas Turbines. We are also considering whether we can offer support for CHP under the current Energy Review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/13">In 2005 the Government launched the Carbon Abatement Technologies Strategy and the UK's Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy. Carbon Abatement Technologies (CATs) have the potential to significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions by 85 per cent. or more and will enable the cleaner use of coal and allow it to have a role in a sustainable world. The use of hydrogen as a transport fuel could provide significant cost-competitive CO2 reductions by 2030. These strategies include (as listed above) funding for demonstration of hydrogen, fuel cell and carbon abatement technologies (including Cleaner Coal and Carbon Capture and Storage).</p>
	<p pid="c.1880W.0/14">The EU Emissions Trading scheme covers electricity generation and energy intensive industry and requires an allowance to be produced for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. These allowances are tradeable across the EU and will effectively require companies to incorporate the cost of carbon into decision making. This scheme should therefore provide another incentive to invest in cleaner and more efficient sources of energy.</p>

	<p pid="c.1889W.0/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question regarding the number of electors in each ward in Southend West in each of the last 10 years. I am replying in her absence. (78595)</p>
	<p pid="c.1889W.0/4" class="indent">The most recent ward electorate counts are for December 2005. The ward electorate counts for Southend West for the last 10 years are included in the attached table. The ward electorate counts are for parliamentary electors, including attainers. Local government electorate counts are not available at ward level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1889W.0/5" class="indent">It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1899W.9/1">DFID funds antiretroviral treatment in Burma through the joint-donor Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar (FHAM), to which DFID is the largest contributor, providing &pound;10 million over five years. At <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, the FHAM was providing antiretroviral treatment to 2,953 patients. All of those people are able to receive regular clinical follow-up and monitoring, including reliable blood tests, to monitor the efficacy of their treatments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1899W.9/2">Blood tests in the vast majority of cases include CD4 T-cell counts, which is a technique which monitors the response of the patient's immune system to the antiretroviral treatment. Materials and chemical reagents are sourced from reputable suppliers, and training of clinicians and laboratory scientists in these methodologies has been undertaken by the International NGOs involved and by the World Health Organisation (with FHAM funding).</p>
	<p pid="c.1899W.9/3">In the main referral centres in Yangon and Mandalay, automated CD4 counter machines are available and as antiretroviral treatment is provided to new areas in peripheral areas, additional manual CD4 counting equipment and reagents, will be supplied. Those organisations funded by FHAM who provide antiretroviral treatment but do not use CD4 T-cell counts instead test patients' blood using a process of clinical staging, which is also regarded as a good practice means of monitoring treatment efficacy. In addition, the introduction of a further test for the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment is planned for the near future, when HIV viral load testing will be made available at the central National Health Laboratory, with the support of UNICEF.</p>

	<p pid="c.1901W.8/1">My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Health Services led the UK Delegation to the World Health Assembly. The Assembly was overshadowed by the sudden death of the director general (DG), Dr. Lee. However, an acting director general (Anders Nordstrom) was approved and a process for selecting a new DG was agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/2">Overall, it was a very difficult Assembly due to the loss of Dr. Lee. However, agreements were reached, which will improve global public health. The following items were of particular relevance to the development agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/3">The General Programme of Work, which is essentially the World Health Organisation's (WHO) long-term vision (2006-15) was agreed. A key objective for the UK is to see the General Programme of Work linked to a new Medium-Term Strategic Plan which will be developed by 2008; along with the preparation of the next biannual budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/4">A new Global Strategy for the Prevention and control of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) was endorsed. This is an important strategy to re-invigorate and accelerate STI prevention and control, which is urgently required if countries are to achieve universal access to HIV prevention treatment and care, and to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/5">In relation to HIV and AIDS, resolutions were also passed on nutrition and HIV/AIDS, and a resolution to endorse the Global Task Team recommendations on improving AIDS co-ordination among multilateral institutions and international donors. The Health Assembly also supported the WHO to develop a five-year-plan to help achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/6">A resolution was agreed on Intellectual Property Rights to improve access to medicines, vaccines and diagnostics for people in developing countries. The Assembly agreed to establish an intergovernmental working group to draw up a global strategy and plan of action based on the recommendations of the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/7">Other important resolutions for forwarding the development agenda included resolutions on eradication of polio, infant and young child nutrition, and emergency preparedness and response.</p>
	<p pid="c.1901W.8/8">A resolution on the role of nursing and midwifery was agreed, which is linked to the theme of the World Health Report on health work force issues. This is an important contribution to supporting the sustainable development of health systems.</p>

Although the use of these more specific antigens may reduce the small numbers of false positive diagnoses, there is also some loss in sensitivity, that is, the chances of detecting truly infected animals. The available standard commercial assay uses PPD alone.</p>

	<p pid="c.1909W.8/1">The waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive is a producer responsibility directive, which aims to reduce the quantity of waste from electrical and electronic equipment and increase re-use, recovery and recycling. It requires member states to ensure that producers (or third parties acting on their behalf) set up systems to provide for the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE. The directive sets out treatment requirements and recovery targets and it is the producer who is responsible for meeting these.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) announced a review of the policy on implementation of the WEEE directive.

	<p pid="c.1909W.8/3">Additionally, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently completing a major research project to develop a process capable of removing brominated flame retardants from WEEE plastics. Under the requirements of the directive, brominated flame retardants containing plastics have to be treated separately from those not containing them. The project was led by Axion Recycling and has built on technology initially developed by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany.</p>

However, I am aware of the approach to water affordability being taken in Northern Ireland, in particular the new affordability tariff. This is being introduced in response to particular circumstances which do not apply in England and Wales. Northern Ireland has a public sector water service while in England and Wales the industry has been fully privatised since 1989. A parallel cannot be drawn between the positions in Northern Ireland and England.</p>

Overlaps between benefits have been removed.<br/> 3. Figures have been rounded to the nearest ten thousand, due to the estimation procedure to produce the figures for housing benefit and/or council tax benefit.<br/> 4. Beneficiaries is the sum of claimants aged 60 or over and claimants' partners aged 60 or over.<br/> 5. Percentage for population has been calculated using the revised Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates for age group 60 and over, for 1990 to 2004, and Government Actuary's Department 2004-based mid-year population projections for 2005 to 2006.<br/> 6. Figures based on one per cent and five per cent samples are subject to sampling variation. These include all JSA figures, information concerning partners of PC and MIG/IS claimants, and all other figures prior to 2000 except DWA which is derived from 100 per cent. sample data. HB/CTB (all years) and IS (1990 to 1993) are derived from one per cent samples. All other figures were obtained from the WPLS.<br/> 7. CTB data excludes second adult rebate cases.<br/> 8. HB data excludes any extended payment cases.<br/> 9. Jobseeker's allowance replaced income support for the unemployed in October 1996.<br/> 10. Some JSA(IB) claimants may also have entitlement to benefit via the contributory route.<br/> 11. A consistent data series prior to 1990 cannot be provided due to a lack of HB/CTB data, and because overlapping cases cannot be identified.<br/> 12. Estimates for 1990 to 2004 are based on past benefit data. The estimate for 2005 is based on projections for HB and CTB, and past benefit data for other benefits. The estimate for 2006 is based on projections for all benefits.<br/> 13. The increase in beneficiaries from 2004 is due to the introduction of pension credit which is more generous than its predecessors. People aged 65 and over are rewarded for making provision for their retirement through the savings credit. In addition pension credit assumes &pound;1 of income for every &pound;500 of savings above &pound;6,000. This is half the assumed rate of income in the MIG. Pension credit has also been the subject of considerable take-up activity by The Pension Service.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  DWP one per cent. samples (IS.pre 1993,also HB and CCB/CTB), five per cent. samples, and Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS), and DWP projections.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1927W.3/1">Post Office Ltd. made a number of improvements to its PIN pads to ensure its banking services were accessible to as many customers as possible, including those who are blind and partially sighted. Customers using a bank account at the Post Office follow exactly the same routine as those using a Post Office card account. They insert their plastic cards in the same PIN pads before entering their PIN. So any blind or partially sighted people who have used a card account should equally well be able to use a bank account at their post office branch.</p>

	<p pid="c.1929W.5/1">The UK is fulfilling all its obligations under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT), including those on disarmament under Article VI of the treaty. We continue to support the relevant disarmament measures contained in the Final Document from the NPT Review Conference (RevCon) in 2000, including the 13 practical steps towards disarmament, and we have a good record on meeting the priorities they set out. Not all the 13 steps are relevant to the UK, such as those relating to bilateral measures between the US and Russia. However, we have made progress on the majority of the other steps. For example, in 2000 the UK initiated a research programme to study techniques and technologies that could be used to verify nuclear disarmament. Conclusions of this programme were presented to the 2005 NPT RevCon. We continue to call for the entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty as soon as possible and, pending its entry into force, maintain a moratorium on nuclear weapons test explosions and any other nuclear explosions. The UK is also pressing for the immediate commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty, without preconditions, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.</p>

	<p pid="c.1929W.8/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has in place a package of immediate assistance measures to help victims of terrorism overseas and their families in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist incident overseas. This is available in the absence of an insurance policy, employer's scheme or any other form of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1929W.8/2">Depending on the circumstances, the support we offer on top of our normal support may include medical evacuation for people who have been injured or evacuation for people in danger (this may not necessarily be to the UK, but to a safe place in the region); paying immediate medical expenses; transporting bodies or remains back home; paying the return luggage costs of those killed or injured; travel for two members of the victim's family to the site of the attack; and accommodation and travel insurance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1929W.8/3">In addition to this support, victims of major catastrophes overseas, or their families, need further help when they return to the UK. The Humanitarian Assistance Unit in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) works with the relevant agencies and services to help victims to get the aftercare they need.</p>
	<p pid="c.1929W.8/4">The Chancellor announced in the Budget a &pound;1 million initial endowment to a charitable fund to help the British victims of terrorism. The fund will provide rapid relief to meet the immediate financial needs of those caught up in a terrorist attack, whether in the UK or overseas. The DCMS is working in consultation with the voluntary sector, partners in Government and victims' groups to finalise the details and will make a further announcement in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1929W.8/5">Information and logistical support has been improved by the deployment of Rapid Deployment Teams (RDTs) to the areas affected. These volunteers are trained consular officers who travel to the area to assist our embassy/high commission with the incident. Their tasks range from meeting family members to visits to morgues, assisting with medevacs etc. The RDTs also consist of personnel from International SOS and the British Red Cross.</p>

The embassy and its partners work closely with the Venezuelan authorities, national and private companies, and chambers of commerce in Venezuela to identify and report commercial opportunities that could benefit UK enterprises. This year we will support five outward missions to Venezuela by UK small and medium-sized enterprises and two inward missions to the UK by Venezuelan companies seeking joint venture partnerships and alliances.</p>

	<p pid="c.1931W.2/1">The UK has not yet made a full assessment of the various recommendations contained in the report of the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Commission, &quot;Weapons of Terror&quot;. However, we consider it to be a valuable contribution to the continuing discussion of proliferation in many fora around the world and will study it closely.</p>
	<p pid="c.1931W.2/2">The UK takes its disarmament obligations under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) very seriously and we have an excellent record in this area. We have reduced the explosive power of our nuclear forces by over 70 per cent. since the end of the cold war and currently have a stockpile of fewer than 200 operational warheads. We continue to support the relevant measures agreed at the 1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences and have a good record on meeting the priorities they set out. We also remain fully committed to the negative and positive security assurances we gave to non-nuclear weapon States Party to the NPT in 1995.</p>
	<p pid="c.1931W.2/3">The UK is fully committed to progress in multilateral disarmament fora, in particular in the Conference on Disarmament (CD). We continue to press for the immediate commencement of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, without pre-conditions, in the CD. However, we believe that the CD must continue to operate by consensus if we are to make progress on these serious matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.1931W.2/4">The Outer Space Treaty (1967), to which the UK is a Depository, places important constraints on the use of space, prohibiting the deployment of WMD in space and military activity on the moon and other celestial bodies. There is no international consensus on the need to start negotiations on a new international instrument governing the military use of space.</p>

	<p pid="c.1934W.8/1">For more than 70 years hospitals have been able to recover the costs of providing treatment to the victims of road traffic accidents where the injured person successfully claims personal injury compensation from the person responsible for the accident. The arrangements for this were streamlined and centralised through the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 which established a formal recovery scheme, operated on behalf of the Secretary of State by the Compensation Recovery Unit, part of the Department for Work and Pensions. Where a compensation payment is made to a road traffic accident victim by an insurer, the insurer is also obliged under the terms of the scheme to make a payment towards the cost of any hospital treatment the injured person needed, in accordance with a simple tariff system covering in-patient or out-patient treatment as appropriate. The injured person is not required to make any payment towards their own treatment costs under the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1934W.8/2">At present the maximum amount that can be recovered in respect of any injury is &pound;37,100. The tariffs and the maximum amount are uprated each year in line with Hospital and Community Health Services inflation. The amounts recovered in the last three years are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1934W.8/5"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1934W.8/6"> <td>2003-04</td> <td>105,654,936</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1934W.8/7"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>117,504,738</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1934W.8/11">Part 3 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 laid the legislative framework for a wider-ranging NHS Injury Costs Recovery (ICR) scheme to be established, subsuming the existing road traffic accident scheme and extending it to all cases in which personal injury compensation is paid to an injured person who has received national health service hospital treatment. Following a public consultation on draft regulations that will govern the operation of the ICR scheme, it was decided to widen the scope for the scheme to take into account contributory negligence where this has been a factor in the primary compensation claim. The necessary amendment to the 2003 Act is contained in the Health Bill. In order to allow adequate time for the Bill to complete its passage through Parliament and for the amending clause to be brought into effect from the outset of the ICR scheme, the scheme is now expected to be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-29">29 January 2007</phrase>. The intention is to transfer the tariffs and maximum amount from the existing road traffic scheme, together with the introduction of a new tariff covering the cost of ambulance journeys required to take the injured person to hospital. As now, these amounts will be uprated annually.</p>

	<p pid="c.1946W.0/1">A list of names of all the organisations and individuals that responded at one or other stage of the consultation process on the national specification for integrated care records service is not held centrally. Some of the responses were provided by organisations which are no longer active.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/2">The original &quot;National Specification for Integrated Care Records Service (Consultation Draft)&quot; was issued in July 2002 by the NHS Information Authority. Some 190 responses to the document were received from suppliers, clinicians, chief information officers (CIOs), information technology (IT) departments of national health service bodies and others, commenting on such aspects as architecture, functional omissions and the realisation of benefits that such a system would produce. These comments were included and formed the base document for the early draft of the output based specification (OBS). This draft was then refined. The clinical input was provided by almost three hundred individuals, and the IT community (IT managers and CIOs) numbered a further one hundred. A broad spectrum of NHS stakeholders was then engaged to review the draft OBS. The review group encompassed leading clinicians, practitioners, policy advisors, health informaticians and managers and included representatives from the Department, the NHS Information Authority, strategic health authorities, NHS trusts, primary care trusts, general practitioners, academic groups and other Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/3">It is known that many of these people also sought input from colleagues and we estimate that this cascade has resulted in many thousands of individuals having had a material input to the content and quality of the product.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/4">A final list of 239 people was invited to review the OBS, from which a total of 105 formal review documents were received. From the 900 pages reviewed there were 1,175 comments of substance. These comments resulted in a further refined version of the OBS which was then distributed for any final comment. A response to every individual comment was returned to the reviewer in question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/5">Reflecting a level of transparency unprecedented for major projects within Government, the OBS was published to the public domain in July 2003 and is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/">www.dh.gov .uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/6">In addition to many hundreds of internal meetings, there were 44 meetings held by the clinicians from the national programme with important stakeholders and stakeholder groups. These included several chairs of the Royal Colleges, and presentations to many hundreds of clinicians at various locations around the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/7">Data on those consulted on ways of managing the confidentiality of patient health information have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1946W.0/8">23 meetings were carried out as part of the research phase in addition to eight focus groups and 56 face-to-face interviews, involving patients, researchers, suppliers, senior care service managers, and NHS information governance professionals.</p>

PCTs agree service level agreements with national health service providers to ensure the necessary healthcare is available for their populations. If activity is carried out by a NHS provider outside these agreements, for example when an individual is on holiday, then the NHS provider is expected to invoice the individual's PCT for the cost of that activity. No allocations are made to cover the cost of this activity as the cost is already funded from within PCTs' allocations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1957W.0/2">Following external advice procured by the trusts and their strategic health authorities (SHAs), the projects are now being taken forward separately with both trusts aiming to submit the next stage of their plans, their outline business cases (OBCs), to the Department later this year or early next.</p>
	<p pid="c.1957W.0/3">All major private finance initiative (PFI) schemes in procurement are subject to a revalidation exercise we announced in January 2006. Revalidation will involve comparing the schemes against a number of tests, to ensure that they properly take account of the new financial mechanisms operating in the NHS (such as choice and payment by results), and are properly taking account of activity of the shift away from the acute sector envisaged in the recent White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;. The trust's OBC will need to take into account the findings of this work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1957W.0/4">The announcement of decisions following the PFI revalidation will be in two waves. It is anticipated that the announcement for schemes which are most advanced, generally those that have already appointed their preferred bidder, will be in late July. Decisions on the remainder, including East and North Hertfordshire and West Hertfordshire, will be announced later.</p>

The schemes will be promoted as &quot;Housing through Choice&quot; and will be taken forward only where it is practicable, desirable and safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1967W.0/3">In the meantime, the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, having regard to the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement, has signalled that it will engage with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and others to consider how best to facilitate mixed housing schemes in the future. That process will include an assessment of the existing legislation, including the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998, to see if it is necessary, and or appropriate, to amend legislation to facilitate the introduction of mixed housing schemes. Any subsequent proposals to amend the legislation will comply with our national and international obligations and will be subject to full equality, human rights and social need considerations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1974W.5/1">The Department of Education's earmarked budget for parenting initiatives is currently &pound;250,000 per annum and is allocated entirely to the education and library boards. It is primarily a matter for each board to determine how these earmarked resources should be used.</p>
	<p pid="c.1974W.5/2">There are no plans to increase the current level of earmarked funding which the Department of Education makes available to education and library boards for this purpose. However, boards are free to supplement this funding by allocating further resources from within their overall block grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1974W.5/3">Funding has recently been made available to 471 schools from the children and young people funding package for the extended schools programme. This will enable schools to develop, initiatives some of which may involve parents. In addition, a further &pound;10 million has recently issued directly to all schools and it is open to schools to determine whether some of this additional funding should be used to support parenting initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="c.1974W.8/1">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS), in conjunction with the area child protection committees recently published and distributed the 'Safe Parenting Handbook' which provides information and signposting to parents on a range of issues, including positive parenting.</p>
	<p pid="c.1974W.8/2">DHSSPS is also encouraging the ongoing promotion of positive parenting, through Sure Start projects, which offer training and information to parents and workers on alternatives to physical punishment, and through funding to organisations, particularly the Parent's Advice Centre, which develops and runs parenting programmes that promote positive parenting.</p>
	<p pid="c.1974W.8/3">The cost of the 'Safe Parenting Handbook' was &pound;67,570. However, it is not possible to break down the unit cost of each measure undertaken by the aforementioned projects and organisations and, for that reason, the cost of positive parenting could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1984W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary question regarding what plans there are for major road improvements on the coastal route of the Lower Ards Peninsula at Ballywalter and Portavogie in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="c.1984W.5/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Acting Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1984W.5/5" class="indent">The A2 coast road between Ballywalter and Portavogie is inspected regularly in accordance with Roads Service's inspection and repair procedures. The road is considered to be in a generally good condition, although the section between Ballywalter and Ballyhalbert, which is just under 5km in length, is subject to flooding at some locations during periods of heavy rainfall. Roads Service intends to commence drainage improvement works on this section during 2006-07, however, given the overall length of this section of road, it is likely that this work will continue over the next few years, with a longer-term aim to resurface the road. I would add that all proposed works will of course be subject to the availability of funding and other pressures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1984W.5/6" class="indent">The section of the route between Ballyhalbert and Portavogie was resurfaced and had new drainage installed approximately 6 years ago and there are no proposals to carry out major improvement works in 2006-07.</p>

In addition, all new vehicles purchased by the boards have a recorded safety announcement fitted as standard, which reminds pupils of the need to wear their seatbelts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1986W.6/2">When hiring private operator vehicles, boards also endeavour to ensure that they are fitted with seat belts. All taxi operator services, including black taxis, must have seatbelts fitted to be eligible to provide home to school transport services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1986W.6/3">Finally, parents and pupils are advised of the requirement to wear seatbelts in the Safe School Travel booklet, produced jointly by boards and Translink. This booklet clearly indicates that seatbelts, when provided, must be worn at all times whether the pupil travels by bus or taxi.</p>

	<p pid="c.1993W.12/1">There are no plans for an incineration policy in Northern Ireland. In June 2005 The Department of the Environment published guidelines on the 'Best Practicable Environmental Option' for the development of facilities to recover, treat and dispose of waste materials. 'Waste to Energy' options for up to 12 per cent. of municipal solid waste and 17 per cent. of commercial and industrial wastes by 2013 were included. However, the choice of facilities will be left to the discretion of the three district council waste management partnerships&mdash;arc21, the South West Management Partnership and the North West Region Waste Management Group.</p>
	<p pid="c.1993W.12/2">Their statutory plans are currently under review and will take account of the new Waste Management Strategy, 'Towards Resource Management', which was published in March 2006. The Strategy states that Government continues in its firm belief that energy from waste will be a necessary component of the preferred infrastructure, both in terms of its policies on renewable energy and to ensure that Northern Ireland meets its landfill diversion targets.</p>

	<p pid="c.1994W.5/1">Government have recognised that the introduction of water and sewerage charges in Northern Ireland will have an impact on low-income households. To ease the transition, and in recognition of the relatively high levels of poverty and disadvantage in Northern Ireland, the Government's broad objective is to ensure that low-income households, particularly pensioner households, should not need to spend more than 3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1994W.5/2">To achieve this objective, a special affordability tariff has been developed for those households who are entitled to certain social security benefits (housing benefit or rate rebate) or equivalent provision for &quot;relevant children&quot; as defined in the Children (Leaving Care) Act NI 2002, or the new Special Rate Relief Scheme being developed within the context of the reform of rates policy in Northern Ireland. The affordability tariff is a capped tariff which has been calculated by reference to the single person's pension credit guarantee, which is updated by Parliament each year. In 2007-08 this means there will be a maximum water and sewerage bill, for properties valued at &pound;100,000 of approx &pound;180 (which is 3 per cent. of the estimated pension credit guarantee in that year&mdash;around &pound;6,000) with additional protection in the form of lower levels of capped charges set for those with properties valued at less than &pound;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1994W.5/3">Those occupying property valued at less than &pound;70,000 will pay 50 per cent. of the full affordability tariff, while those in property valued between &pound;70,000 and &pound;100,000 will pay 75 per cent. of the tariff. As the charges will be phased in over three years this will mean that the maximum bill for eligible low-income customers in 2007-08 will be &pound;30, &pound;45 or &pound;60, linked to the value of the property, rising to around &pound;95, &pound;145 and &pound;190 in 2009-10, depending on the pension credit guarantee income level at that time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1994W.5/4">The affordability tariff for 2009-10 will be calculated on the basis of the uprated level of the single person pension credit guarantee income level thus continuing to ensure that eligible households will pay no more than 3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage charges. Many households will pay significantly less.</p>
	<p pid="c.1994W.5/5">Data linking individual properties to household income are not available. It is therefore not possible to determine precisely the proportion of the population whose water bill will represent any given percentage of their household income. However it is estimated that around 200,000, close to 30 per cent. of all households will benefit from the affordability tariff and that this number will not change significantly each year. The implementation of the affordability tariff will be closely monitored and reviewed when charges are fully phased in by 2009-10 and the Department will collate all relevant data to assess the scheme against income levels at that time.</p>

	<p pid="c.1995W.3/1">In order to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status, all trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the statutory Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.1995W.3/2">The current standards for teachers are under review. Once revised, it is proposed that they will be strengthened to include a standard which requires teachers to know and comply with current legislation on well being of children and young people, one which requires teachers to know and understand the role of others when dealing with children who have special needs and/or disabilities, and one which requires teachers to communicate effectively with parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1995W.3/3">Induction standards require newly qualified teachers to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement, and in consultation with the SEN co-ordinator (SENCO), can contribute to the planning for individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1995W.3/4">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to identify their development needs through performance management arrangements, and to address identified needs by undertaking appropriate professional development. This could include strengthening knowledge of autism.</p>
	<p pid="c.1995W.3/5">All schools receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="c.1995W.3/6">In 2002 we published jointly with the Department of Health, Autistic Spectrum Disorders Good Practice guidance which offered a series of pointers to good practice aimed at schools and SENCOs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1995W.3/7">The Department's published SEN Strategy, 'Removing Barriers to Achievement' recognised the importance of training and committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to ensure that initial teacher training and programmes of continuing professional development provide a good grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN. We have commissioned the TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainees, newly qualified and established teachers. These initiatives will be implemented over the period 2005-08 at a cost of approximately &pound;1.1 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1998W.2/2">The Government recognises the importance of personal finance education for all young people. The National Curriculum for Citizenship, which is compulsory at key stages 3 and 4 (11 to 16 year olds), includes teaching pupils about how the economy functions, including the role of business and financial services. Pupils are also taught about how public services are financed. In addition, the DfES has asked the QCA, as part of the wider review of GCSE maths and the emphasis on improving functional skills, to consider including financial capability more explicitly in the maths curriculum. In September 2004 we made work-related learning a statutory element of the curriculum, and from September 2005 are funding schools to develop a new focus on enterprise education, defined as enterprise capability supported by better financial capability and economic and business understanding.</p>

Ofsted encourages heads to share their performance and assessment (PANDA) report with their governors.

	<p pid="c.2000W.5/2">The DfES Simplification Plan that will be published later in the year will detail reductions in bureaucracy and administrative burdens that are referred to in this report, some of which have been superseded. The Simplification Plan will detail policies for reducing burdens on 'front line' staff working in the area of education and training across all sectors: public, voluntary, businesses and charities. In schools, our intention is that the Simplification Plan will cover reduced communications from the centre; the New Relationships with Schools programme; funding rationalisation; simplified inspection; less data requests and simplification arising from the Education Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.2000W.5/3">As a Department, we remain determined to make sure our policies have the maximum impact on standards with the minimum burden on schools. That is why we set up the Implementation Review Unit in April 2003 to review the implementation of existing and new policy initiatives, covering all organisations that impact on schools in England. The panel provides feedback on policy implementation, challenges existing systems, and is a sounding board on innovation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2000W.5/4">The Department is also developing the New Relationship with Schools. This has led to a new framework for school inspection and introduced School Improvement Partners to work with headteachers to raise standards and attainment. We have also developed a data protocol with many external partners, to ensure that only essential data is collected, that they are collected by sample wherever possible and that they are collected only once and then used many times.</p>

	<p pid="c.2014W.2/1">One of the main uses of biometric technology in the National Identity scheme is to make it much easier to detect unauthorised attempts by an individual to register more than one identity with the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.2/2">The Government are taking specialist advice with regard to the specification for and implementation of biometric technologies. We are working with leading biometric experts from a number of world-leading institutions in the field, including the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, Cambridge University, San Jose University, the UK National Physical Laboratory and staff from the Communications-Electronic Security Group (CESG, part of GCHQ). This work is further supported by experience gained from colleagues in other schemes internationally, such as those in Hong Kong and the Philippines, as well as those parts of UK Government already using biometric technology, such as the Police Information Technology Organisation and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.2/3">In addition, there is an assurance process to ensure that advice taken on biometrics is robust and appropriate. Sir David King, the Government Chief Scientist, chairs a Biometric Assurance Group which includes other specialists in the biometric field that reviews such matters in relation to the National Identity scheme. Biometric processes will be supervised as well as supported by other more traditional security procedures. For example, during the enrolment process, biometric checks are supported by checks on public and private databases to verify the information provided by applicants. A number of pieces of key supporting documentation may also be examined for consistency by trained examiners equipped to identify forgery. A fraud investigation unit will exist that will supervise enrolment and work with law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious activities. It is the combination of both biometric technologies and such more traditional checks that will provide greater assurance of identity than exists today.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.2/4">A specialist team has been employed to prepare both the security principles and requirements across the National Identity scheme, including biometrics. Their work is being supported by internationally recognised bodies from the fields of national security and law enforcement to technical experts in cryptography and electronic security. In particular, we are working closely with experts from CESG on such issues. This group of experts is highly experienced in dealing with processes and systems that require a high level of security. Security risk assessments have been undertaken on issues such as the physical, logical, procedural, personnel and systems aspects of the National Identity scheme as part of this work and such assessments are updated as the National Identity scheme develops.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.2/5">Finally, the National Identity Register will need to pass an independent security accreditation process under Cabinet Office guidelines before the National Identity scheme can be launched, thus providing a further layer of independent scrutiny .</p>

	<p pid="c.2015W.2/1">The Government takes the problem of identity fraud very seriously and there is a range of criminal offences in place to combat this problem, such as the deception offences in the Theft Act 1968 and 1978. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June 2006</phrase> we also brought into force sections 25 and 26 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which creates new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents. These offences relate to a wide range of identity documents, including passports, driving licences, ID cards and immigration documents. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for an offence of possession with intent to use the document for establishing registrable facts (about the individual), and two years imprisonment for possession without reasonable excuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.2015W.2/2">The number of criminal offences committed each year using the identity of a deceased person is not recorded centrally. But identity fraud questions have been incorporated into the British Crime Survey and the results should give us more information on the number of victims and the types of fraud that are being committed. In addition, CIFAS, the UK's Fraud Prevention Service for the private sector (mainly financial services companies), has conducted research into the extent of impersonation of deceased person fraud and has estimated that there were approximately 17,500 cases in 2001, 35,000 in 2002, 56,000 in 2003 and 70,000 in 2004. The 2004 figure represents 58 per cent. of the estimated 120,000 incidents of identity and impersonation fraud identified by CIFAS members in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2015W.2/3">The Government have been working with the public and private sector to look at ways to reduce impersonation of deceased person fraud. An amendment to the Police and Justice Bill was introduced at Report stage in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-10">10 May 2006</phrase>, which will allow Registrars General in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to supply timely death registration information in bulk to the police and other organisations for use in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.2021W.2/5">From April 2004 until August 2005 the SIA processed 62 per cent. within six weeks and 88 per cent. within nine weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.2021W.2/6">Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system. These have added an additional time of between two and four weeks to the process, so it is now taking up to 10 weeks to process most applications.</p>
