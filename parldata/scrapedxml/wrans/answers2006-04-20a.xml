	<p pid="a.761W.0/1">The charges applied to pre-payment meters reflect the additional costs of the meter itself and the infrastructure required to support it. Any enforced reduction in the charges applied to pre-payment meters would have to be cross-subsidised by other customers, including pensioners and the fuel poor, the majority of whom do not use pre-payment meters. Pre-payment tariffs of individual suppliers vary, and, where customers prefer to retain a pre-payment meter, they may be able to reduce their expenditure by switching supplier.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.3/1">Each of the major domestic energy suppliers offer a number of programmes that assist vulnerable customers in various ways. The actual definition of a social tariff varies from company to company but is generally a lower price tariff directed towards a subset of vulnerable customers. It is for suppliers, not the Government, to design and set such tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.3/2">Although information from individual suppliers about take-up of particular schemes is commercially confidential, an annex to the Government's UK Fuel Poverty Strategy Fourth Annual Progress Report, to be published later this year, will include information about the overall impacts of company schemes in 2004 and 2005. This will include information about actions companies have taken in 2004 and 2005 beyond their Energy Efficiency Priority Group obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.3/3">We continue to encourage energy companies to consider their most vulnerable consumers when considering price or service changes. I therefore welcome the trust funds and social tariffs announced, but continue to urge energy companies to do more.</p>

But, as for all applicants, Macedonia must first meet the membership criteria in full. Good progress is being made in defence reform, although further work is needed. Political conditionality is also important. This includes full implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, and reform of the economy and the judiciary. The proper conduct of parliamentary elections later this year will be an important element in meeting the political conditionality requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.769W.3/2">There were no penalties, and no fixed term for the repayment of the loan referred to in the National Audit Office's Audit. This was the Aquila/Chertsey Loan Note, between the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Qinetiq, which formed part of the receipt from the initial sale of a minority equity interest in Qinetiq to Carlyle in 2003. The loan note was secured against the sale of Qinetiq property at Aquila (Bromley) and Chertsey. No firm schedule of repayments could be laid down as the income from the sale was conditional on the achievement of various stages of planning permission, and so the Budget assumptions were based on estimates of time scales for this planning permission. These original estimates were not achieved, and hence payments to be made by Qinetiq to the MOD slipped.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.3/3">The loan note has been repaid in stages with the bulk of the money, some &pound;43.5 million being paid in September 2005, and the final outstanding amount, some &pound;2.5 million being paid at the end of March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.770W.3/1">DFID is committed to increasing access to reliable and affordable energy as an essential catalyst for reducing poverty and increasing economic growth in developing countries. We agree that renewable energy has an increasingly important role to play in helping developing countries make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.3/2">DFID is working with international networks such as the Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP) and the EU energy initiative (EUEI) to promote access to affordable energy services, drawing on the full menu of technology options, including renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.3/3">DFID has supported the creation of a new &euro;220 million EU energy facility, which will invite calls for proposals later this year. This grant fund aims to improve access to reliable and affordable energy, especially in Africa, and is encouraging viable renewable energy proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.3/4">We are also encouraging the World Bank and other development partners to give renewable energy greater attention as part of their efforts to improve access to energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.3/5">The World Bank is scaling up its financial support for renewable energy and energy efficiency and announced in December 2005, a rise to $299 million for the year to June 2005, compared to an average of $209 million per annum over the previous three years. These figures exclude large hydropower projects and exceed the commitment they made in 2004 to increase their renewable energy and energy efficiency investments by 20 per cent. per annum over the next five years. We very much welcome this increased investment by the World Bank on clean energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.3/6">DFID has provided around &pound;3.4 million for renewable energy research projects in the last eight years. This was spent on the development and promotion of renewable energy, especially for rural communities. It has included a wide range of technologies such as wind, small hydropower, solar and biomass.</p>

	<p pid="a.770W.6/1">The United Kingdom is a major contributor to mine action in Sri Lanka. We have provided &pound;1 million through the United Nations to support demining and mine awareness in conflict affected areas. A further &pound;669,766 has been committed to two non governmental organisations (NGOs), the Mine Action Group and the HALO Trust, for mine action between 2004 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.6/2">The programmes, together with those from the wider international community, have been successful. Deaths from mines have been largely eliminated, although there are still a small number of casualties each year, especially in the far north of Sri Lanka. Nevertheless the Government estimate that some 700,000 to 1,000,000 mines remain to be cleared.</p>
	<p pid="a.770W.6/3">Given the dependence upon mines in militarily significant areas, it will be many more years before Sri Lanka will be landmine free, and before the Government will feel able to sign the Ottawa Treaty. The Government of Sri Lanka is planning to create within the Sri Lankan army, a national capability to pursue mine action work after 2008. DFID will review progress during 2007 and, in the light of this, consider further support.</p>

The UK has helped lead international efforts to address the underlying causes of the problems in northern Uganda and to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected, including the Acholi.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/3">Over the last 12 months we have provided over &pound;20 million in humanitarian assistance; this includes &pound;10.7 million to the World Food Programme to provide food and &pound;6.8 million to support a UN inter-agency programme to address health problems in the camps. We have recently agreed to channel an additional &pound;4.9 million over two years to the United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF) programmes covering water and sanitation and the provision of emergency requirements, such as shelter and protection.</p>

Figures for 1999&ndash;00 to 2001&ndash;02 are drawn from Section 52 (Table 3) Outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 onwards are taken from the recasted Section 52 (Table A) Outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the blank rows.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/57"><sup>(16)</sup> Local Government Reorganisation (LGR) took place on the <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>. What was previously defined as Essex local authority pre LGR was split into Essex, Southend and Thurrock local authorities for the start of the 1998&ndash;99 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/58"><sup>(17)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/59"><sup>(18)</sup> From 2002&ndash;03 the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&ndash;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002&ndash;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&ndash;02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&ndash;03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002&ndash;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/60"><sup>(19)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). From 2002&ndash;03 onwards, certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is no longer available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999&ndash;00), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/61"><sup>(20)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&ndash;00.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/62"><sup>(21)</sup> Spending in 1997&ndash;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&ndash;99.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.2/63"><sup>(22)</sup> The expenditure data for 1999&ndash;00 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.0/1">Yes. It is the local authority which signs the contract with the private sector PFI contractor and which therefore is liable for the payment of the unitary charge for the length of the contract. Schools will remain liable for the agreements they have made with the authority for contributing to the unitary charge. The governing body of each school included in a PFI contract must sign such an agreement before the PFI contract' can be signed. This commitment does not change if the school changes status.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.0/1">The Department does not hold data on the number of hours of school missed due to truancy or the levels of truancy. In 2005, the proportion of half day sessions missed due to unauthorised absence (of which truancy forms a part) in maintained primary schools in Kingston upon Hull North Constituency was 0.60 per cent. and for maintained secondary schools 1.31 per cent. For Kingston upon Hull local authority 0.57 per cent. of half days were missed in primary schools and 2.78 per cent. in secondary schools. The comparative figures for England were 0.43 per cent. for primary schools and 1.23 per cent. for secondary schools. In September 2005, the Government announced a drive against pupils with high unauthorised absences in 146 secondary schools which account for 1 in 5 of all instances of unauthorised absence across the country. We have now extended this to cover 198 secondary schools and an estimated 13,000 pupils. This drive will provide an intensive package of support and challenge to these pupils and their families.</p>

	<p pid="a.799W.5/1">The Youth Opportunity Fund (YOF) and the Youth Capital Fund (YCF), which was also announced in the 'Youth Green Paper: Youth Matters', were allocated to local authorities from April 2006. The funds are designed to enable local authorities to develop new approaches to strategic investment in youth facilities, particularly in deprived neighbourhoods. Extra resource was made available for the YOF and YCF in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report in December 2005. A total of &pound;115 million is available for both funds over 2006&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.5/2">The allocation for both funds for Lancashire local authority is &pound;657,899 a year for two years for the Youth Opportunity Fund and &pound;569,031 a year for two years for the Youth Capital Fund. The funds are ring fenced and can only be spent on activities and facilities that young people want.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.5/3">Each local authority is responsible for disseminating the funds within in its area. Therefore, I am unable to provide information about the amounts allocated below local authority level to show the funding for West Lancashire district council.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.0/1">It is for local housing authorities to satisfy themselves whether individual housing applicants may be owed a duty under part 7 of the Housing Act 1997, and, if so which duty. As part of this, they will need to decide whether an applicant who is eligible for assistance has a priority need for accommodation. In cases where the applicant may have a priority need because of vulnerability due to a medical condition, the authority, may wish to seek a specialist medical opinion to help inform their decision, and should have regard to any medical or social services advice obtained. We have no plans to commission research into the accuracy of such advice at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.0/2">Officials in the Homelessness and Housing Support Directorate work with local authorities to encourage good practice on preventing and administering homelessness. This includes sharing information on a wide range of specialist advisory services which other authorities have found useful. In providing this factual information, officials are advised to avoid making recommendations of any kind, and to stress that it is for authorities to decide which services to use and which providers to employ. Where an authority seeks specialist advice from any organisation to assist in making such decisions, they will need to satisfy themselves that the advice is soundly-based and reliable. Whatever advice is received the ultimate decision on vulnerability must rest with the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.0/3">Applicants have the right to request an authority to review certain decisions, including a decision that the applicant does not have priority need because he or she is not vulnerable. If they are dissatisfied with a decision on review (or a review decision is not made within the prescribed time scale) they have the right to appeal to the county court on a point of law.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.3/41">The proportion of the housing capital receipt that a local authority retains is not simply the gross receipt less the set-aside or pooling liability. Local authorities may reduce the value of the capital receipt by, for instance, the cost of the administration fees involved in the disposal of the asset or other costs, for instance improvements to the asset in the preceding years, before calculating their set-aside or pooling obligation. Hence in the table above the amount retained will not be gross receipts less set-aside or pooled amount but rather gross receipts less deductions (for which we have no data) less set-aside or pooling obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/42">Since 1997 the Government have consistently invested more in housing than they have received in pooled receipts. In 2004&ndash;05 the amount paid to Government from all housing receipts (not just Right to Buy) was &pound;1.7 billion. The amount invested in housing was &pound;4.1 billion ie almost two and a half times the amount received in receipts. The ratio is expected to increase substantially in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.0/40">The proportion of the housing capital receipt that a local authority retains is not simply the gross receipt less the set-aside or pooling liability. Local authorities may reduce the value of the capital receipt by, for instance, the cost of the administration fees involved in the disposal of the asset or other costs, for instance improvements to the asset in the preceding years, before calculating their set-aside or pooling obligation. Hence in the table above the amount retained will not be gross receipts less set-aside or pooled amount but rather gross receipts less deductions (for which we have no data) less set-aside or pooling obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.0/41">Since 1997 the Government have consistently invested more in housing than they have received in housing receipts. In 2004&ndash;05 the amount paid to Government from all housing receipts (not just Right to Buy) was &pound;1.7 billion. The amount invested in housing was &pound;4.1 billion ie almost two and a half times the amount received. The ratio of amount invested to amount received is expected to increase substantially in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.3/1">A wide range of funding streams across government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour at a local level. For example, Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; the Department for Education and Skills (DFES) through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.3/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and their work in tackling litter and fly tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.3/3">The Departmental for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour activity. In relation to specific Home Office funding to tackle anti-social behaviour in the last two financial years we have allocated &pound;25,000 to every CDRP in both England and Wales to fund an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator. This amounts to &pound;9.4 million per annum. Funding for 2005&ndash;06 was part of the Safer, Stronger Communities Fund (SSCF) and this arrangement will continue for the next two years (2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08).</p>
