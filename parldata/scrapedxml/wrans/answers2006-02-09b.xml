The CPS was closely involved in the drafting of the overriding objective, the case management rules and forms. Significant contributions were made on the disclosure and terrorism protocols. The CPS regularly provides comment and suggestions on issues which the Committee are considering. In addition the criminal case management framework complements the rules in setting out the role and responsibilities of the CPS and others involved in managing criminal cases through the courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336W.5/1">Steps are being taken to improve service&mdash;including the timely service of papers by the police. The electronic service of papers is increasingly being used by the CPS in the more complex criminal cases such as complex frauds and complex computer related crimes. The CPS in electronically serving evidence on the court has to ensure that the police have signed paper statements of all witnesses. The statements themselves can then be served electronically on the court and defence; this can be done by CD or e-mail. The signed paper bundle has to be retained by the police.</p>

From April we will start rolling out children's centres beyond the most disadvantaged areas, as part of our drive to have 2,500 children's centres by March 2008. Our goal is to have 3,500 children's centres by 2010, one for every community.</p>

We are also legislating to give school staff an unequivocal power to discipline pupils and extend the use of court orders to reinforce parents' responsibility for behaviour in school.</p>

	<p pid="b.1341W.2/1">As part of its restructuring plans, the Learning and Skills Council proposes to establish 148 local partnership teams which will work closely with their local communities, understand the needs of individuals and employers at grass roots level and build strategic relationships with local schools, colleges and other learning providers. The local partnership teams will work alongside 35 economic development teams which will focus on skills for employment, regeneration and economic development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.2/2">The local partnership and economic development teams will be funded from within the LSC's existing administration budget. The new structure is expected to achieve savings of around &pound;40 million, which can be reinvested in front-line delivery. The final agreed changes will take effect from summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1341W.5/2">The LSC has introduced a new business planning cycle which is helping to strengthen the local, regional and national planning process. The LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities, along with the more detailed guidance in Planning for Success&quot; set out the priorities for the LSC. These provide the strategic framework for the development of local plans, which themselves reflect the key learning and skills priorities for the local area, as well as taking into account key national and regional priorities. National priorities include tackling basic skills and extending a new entitlement for fully funded first full Level 2 qualifications in all regions from September 2006. Through the mechanisms outlined above we anticipate a marked increase in the delivery and achievement of first full Level 2s from 2006&ndash;07 while also supporting progression to Level 3 and higher skills including technician, advanced craft and trade skills and apprenticeships for adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.5/3">The LSC's proposed new structure will help to further strengthen its ability to respond flexibly and rapidly to local priorities, while at the same time providing stronger drivers at regional level.

	<p pid="b.1342W.8/1">It is difficult to generalise about how long it takes people to find jobs after graduation and enter repayment as this is largely dependent on individual circumstances. The annual Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey (conducted by the Higher Education Statistics agency) illustrates this. For the 2003/04 cohort of graduates surveyed six months after graduation, 64 per cent. were in employment, 10 per cent. in employment combined with further study, 14 per cent. in further study, 6 per cent. unemployed, and 6 per cent. were not available for work. Of those in employment who gave details of their salary, nearly two thirds were earning &pound;15,000 or more and were thus eligible to make repayments.</p>

	<p pid="b.1348W.6/2">As with other non-native species of goose that have become naturalised, the Canada goose can have a localised impact on habitats, This can include the destruction of vegetation, as well as competing with native wildfowl for food and resources, such as nest sites. They can also pose a health risk to other animals and humans, for example through deposited faeces. This is why the Canada goose was added to Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It means that Canada geese are subject to the provisions of section 14 of the Act, and it is an offence to release them or allow them to escape into the wild.</p>
	<p pid="b.1348W.6/3">We have recently publicly reviewed the provisions of Part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 including the possible adoption of a general licence to allow the release of certain non-native species that have been rehabilitated. I am currently working up more detailed proposals on these issues for inclusion in a consultation paper that we hope to issue later this year. The Canada goose is one of the possible species under consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.1352W.2/1">We have a PSA target in place that affirms our commitment to eradicate fuel poverty, as far as reasonably practicable, in vulnerable households in England by 2010. More information on the target, which is shared with the Department for Trade and Industry, and information on the targets in place in other parts of the UK, is available in the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy, published in November 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.2/2">The Government's main tool for eradicating fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Warm Front Scheme, which offers a range of heating and insulation measures to householders in receipt of one of a range of qualifying benefits. The Scheme has assisted over one million households since its launch in June 2000. The new phase of the Scheme got under way in June last year, and is better equipped to target and assist those most in need in a sustainable way. The Scheme benefited from a boost in fuel poverty funding in England announced in the 2005 pre-Budget report of &pound;250 million. This is additional to the extra &pound;140 million announced in the last Spending Review and takes DEFRA's total fuel poverty funding over the 2005&ndash;08 period to over &pound;800 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.2/3">We are also working closely with colleagues across Government, not just with DTI but also ODPM, DWP, DH and HMT. Defra has a PSA Management Board that brings senior officials from these Departments together to monitor and tackle the range of issues relating to our targets. This ensures that the full policy agenda is properly considered, moving beyond the central tenets of energy efficiency and energy prices and taking in concerns relating to poor housing, benefit take-up, health risks and wider points relating to deprivation more generally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1356W.0/2">It is not our intention to provide compensation for farmers who have been unable to submit applications for Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) or Organic Entry Level Stewardship (OELS) due to delays with the registration of land parcels on the Rural Land Register (RLR). Well in advance of the launch of the new scheme it was made clear to farmers and land managers that registration of land on the RLR would be a pre-requisite for joining the scheme. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a voluntary environmental scheme and while we are aware that delays with land registration have caused difficulties for some farmers, we believe that reasonable steps have been taken to limit the impact of these delays as far as possible. All applicants who submit a valid application will secure a full five-year agreement, so although their entry to the scheme may have been delayed, they will not be disadvantaged. The Rural Development Service (RDS) will process all valid applications with a view to applying the earliest available monthly start date.</p>

A thorough assessment of the potential plant health risks associated with the import of such material was undertaken as part of the derogation process and stringent measures put in place, both pre-export in Korea and for handling the material on arrival in the EC, to mitigate any potential risk.

	<p pid="b.1361W.2/1">Customers of water and sewerage companies are entitled to guaranteed standards of service, as laid down in the Water Supply and Sewerage Services (Customer Service Standards) Regulations. These regulations, known as the guaranteed standards scheme, set minimum standards of services to be met for all customers and prescribe minimum payments where service is below these standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361W.2/2">The economic regulator Ofwat monitors the level of service provided to customers by water companies. Each company's performance against a number of measures is included in Levels of service for the water industry in England and Wales report 2004&ndash;05&quot;. Performance is measured against a number of indicators. Severn Trent's performance is acceptable or better for each of these measures. At reviews of price limits companies are rewarded for good performance and penalised for poor performance in delivering services to customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361W.2/3">Fair comparisons between companies depend on Ofwat receiving accurate information of a comparable nature from the companies. Following allegations by a member of Severn Trent's staff Ofwat is undertaking an investigation into the accuracy of information submitted by Severn Trent. The Serious Fraud Office is also investigating matters referred to it by Ofwat. Ofwat will shortly be publishing a report on its findings. The company has agreed that if it were found that customers had been overcharged any necessary corrections would be effected in a prompt manner to be agreed with Ofwat.</p>

Many of the schemes have operated successfully for a number of years, supported by funding from a range of different sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.2/2">It is up to each RDA to determine the priorities for its region and, through its corporate plan, how they will achieve their agreed outcomes. A number of RDAs are planning ongoing support for 'wheels to work' schemes in their regions. For example, following a successful evaluation of the region's wheels to work schemes, Advantage West Midlands have determined to ensure a consistent region wide service is in place from the beginning of the 2006&ndash;07 financial year. The Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA) has commissioned a region-wide proposal to deliver a 'wheels to work' scheme across rural areas. This will draw on good practice from the ex-Countryside Agency schemes, which will come to an end on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1363W.2/1">Currently around 400 tonnes of spent fuel is stored in Wales. Spent fuel from Welsh reactors is of the Magnox type and is not regarded as waste and is routinely reprocessed at Sellafield. Reprocessing spent fuel there does create high level waste but there is no high level waste in Wales. More detailed information on the location of spent fuel at specific locations at specific times is not normally made public for security reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.2/2">Data are not separately recorded for the wastes produced at Sellafield as a result of reprocessing spent fuel from Welsh reactors. However, there has been and still is intermediate and low level waste in Wales which arises from both reactor operations and radio-pharmaceutical production. Data from the 1998, 2001 and 2004 UK radioactive waste inventories have been used to generate the following table of wastes in Wales. The cost of obtaining annual figures exceeds the normal threshold.</p>

	<p pid="b.1364W.0/1">The European Commission's proposal to tackle illegal logging, the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, was adopted by Council Conclusions in October 2003. This included proposals for bilateral agreements with timber producing countries and a commitment that the Commission would investigate 'additional options' to tackle illegal logging. Government is frustrated at the time it has taken the European Commission to produce this additional options report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.0/2">One of these 'additional options' could be measures to prohibit the import of all illegal timber into the EU. This option was raised at a European stakeholder consultation meeting held by the European Commission and the UK's Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>. Some support for the proposal was voiced as well as concern that the effective enforcement of such a ban would demand additional evidence on all imports of timber to the EU. As such demands would be unlikely to be required of domestic producers, this could raise the likelihood of a challenge in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.0/3">The European Commission will consider all the options and issues raised at the stakeholder consultation meeting and produce the delayed report on addition options by early summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.0/4">Once the Report is published, Government will review the applicability of the options presented, including compatibility with the World Trade Organisation, before deciding what, if any, additional measures the UK Government will pursue at a national or EU level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1366W.3/2">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales. As part of the Agency's management role it has national and regional water resource strategies, published in 2001, which set out the pressures over the next 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.3/3">A good deal of water is already transferred within water companies' areas of operation, and between companies, to give individual companies greater flexibility to meet local shortages. The Agency's national strategy notes though that water transfers can be a relatively expensive option. Pipelines for long distance transfers are large and their construction may be disruptive. Pumping can consume much energy and add to carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.3/4">Water companies have statutory duties to maintain water supplies. It is for them to plan the investment necessary to deliver their services, including the necessary financial provision, and it is for Ofwat, in the light of companies' plans, to secure that companies carry out and are able to finance their functions. I am not aware that water companies collectively are considering the establishment of a water grid.</p>

	<p pid="b.1367W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.2/2">Applications for consent for wind farms submitted to the DTI are accompanied by an environmental impact assessment that includes details of the likely impact of the project in question on the environment and wildlife, among other things. In considering an application, the Department will consult with a range of stakeholders, including the statutory advisers on nature conservation&mdash;English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales, as appropriate&mdash;as well as others with an interest in the project. This ensures that decisions on whether to grant consent for a wind farm are considered in the light of the best available information about its likely impacts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.2/3">The Department has established a Research Advisory Group to fund research into the impact of wind farms on the environment. This has included a joint study with wind farm developers and DEFRA to collect data on the distribution of sea birds in the three strategic offshore wind farm areas, the results of which will inform decisions on the grant of consent for wind farm projects in those areas. However, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) make clear that the available evidence suggests that appropriately positioned wind farms do not pose a significant hazard for birds. The RSPB's conclusion is supported by a report last year for the Swedish State Energy Authority, which found that only 14 of the total 1.5 million migrating seabirds that each year passes two wind farms at Kalmarsund in south east Sweden are at risk of being killed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.2/4">In any case, the likely impact on wildlife must be kept in context. A paper in Nature, by a large group of scientists including one from the RSPB, indicated that in sample regions covering about 20 per cent. of the Earth's land surface&mdash;15 per cent. to 37 per cent. of species (not just birds) will be committed to extinction as a result of mid-range climate warming scenarios by 2050.</p>

	<p pid="b.1371W.0/1">The DTI commissioned two reports in 2004 in relation to hydrogen: Hydrogen Energy Support in the UK&quot; and A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy in the UK&quot;. These reports have been published on the Department's website <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.0/2">Government research funding includes support for industrial collaborative research and development for fuel cell and hydrogen technologies through the DTI's Technology Programme. The programme seeks to advance these technologies for both stationary power generation and transport applications, with a view to achieving the cost reductions and performance levels necessary for commercial deployment. This support currently amounts to approximately between &pound;2 million&ndash;3 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.0/3">Basic research in universities on both fuel cells and hydrogen is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), including through the SUPERGEN initiative. SUPERGEN supports the UK Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Consortium (UK SHEC) which has received funding of &pound;2.5 million. This programme is supporting projects on: hydrogen generation; hydrogen storage; and socio-economic implications for a hydrogen economy. In addition to SUPERGEN, EPSRC has awarded &pound;1 million to investigate the potential role of formic acid as a chemical method for the storage of hydrogen. &pound;500,000 has been granted to three projects on fundamental science and engineering relevant to the hydrogen economy. EPSRC also contributes to projects through the DTI's Technology Programme. More widely, the research councils EPSRC, ESRC, and NERC have recently established the UK Energy Research Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.0/4">Hydrogen and fuel cell projects are also eligible to apply to the Carbon Trust for research funding.

The demonstration scheme is currently in preparation, and will require EC state aid approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.0/6">The Government have also provided funding of over &pound;450,000 for the trial of three hydrogen-powered fuel cell buses in London as part of the EU CUTE (Clean Urban Transport in Europe) project. &pound;7.5 million of funding has been provided for the fuel cell and low carbon vehicle technology Centre of Excellence (CENEX) based in Loughborough.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.0/7">The Department for Transport announced in January, as part of their Horizons innovative research programme, a competition for projects to investigate the options for the further steps required to move to the adoption of a hydrogen transport infrastructure.

India is a key international partner and we attach great importance to developing our strategic partnership on civil nuclear activities and to stopping onward proliferation. In August 2005, the Government revised the position adopted in 2002 on our policy regarding the export of nuclear related items to India. The restrictions now in force are less stringent than that in force in 2002 and conform to the UK's current international obligations and non-proliferation commitments. The effect of our approach is to refuse only those exports or scientific contacts that are of serious concern, taking into account the circumstances of each particular case.</p>

The Langeled pipeline, which is due to deliver gas to the UK later this year, will also deliver gas from the Norwegian Ormen Lange field when the field begins production in 2007. New pipeline infrastructure will also be built as part of the Statfjord redevelopment and will provide further capacity to deliver gas from major new gas reserves being developed on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.</p>

The goods were not controlled for export from the UK and the exporter was not therefore required to submit an export licence application when he would have been required to provide details of the end-use and end-user of the goods. Subsequent to its interception by the Bulgarian authorities however, DTI was in contact with the exporter who provided full information about the consignment, including its end-user and expected end-use.</p>

At the conclusion of this consultation process the four local planning authorities of Newham, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest and Hackney, in conjunction with Greenwich council, will then make a decision regarding the framework.

	<p pid="b.1383W.6/1">Initial assessment findings from joint missions involving the Government of Bolivia, United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations report that 12,000 families have been affected by the recent floods in Bolivia, brought on by heavy rainfall over the last few weeks. Heavy rains are expected to continue in parts of the country before slowing down towards the end of this week. A total of 2,3000 families are reported to be displaced and in temporary shelters across the affected areas (largely in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni). 2,400 houses have been damaged or destroyed. The immediate relief needs identified are food (for up to 7,000 families), water (for 4,645 families, temporary shelter, mosquito nets and mattresses (for approximately 3,500 families).</p>
	<p pid="b.1383W.6/2">The United States Agency for International Development has already provided $300,000 of relief assistance including sufficient plastic sheeting for 1,000 tents, seven water bladders of 10&ndash;12,000 litres capacity and 3,000 wool blankets. It has also provided 100 tons of food and is considering additional funding. The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs has allocated an emergency grant of $30,000 for the purchase of relief items. The European Commission's humanitarian office is also considering a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383W.6/3">The early response of traditional donors in the region indicates that the immediate emergency needs of affected people appear to have been or will soon be met. However, DFID is continuing to monitor the evolving situation in Bolivia closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1385W.2/1">The UK position on investment, public procurement and competition policy in the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), as published in March 2005, is that these issues should be removed from the negotiations, unless specifically requested by any of the regional groups in the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP). It is for the ACP regional groups to judge the development benefits of any agreements on these issues and the EU should not push for them to be discussed. In addition, we believe that if included, any negotiations on Government procurement should be limited to transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385W.2/2">During the time of the UK presidency in 2005, the European Commission and the ACP did not negotiate on these issues. Some regions have requested to negotiate some of these issues. For example, the Pacific has requested to negotiate investment, while the Caribbean has requested to negotiate all three of the issues. However, while on their jointly agreed agendas, the negotiations on these issues are only just beginning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1386W.5/2">The Freedom of Information Act allows for public authorities to determine when the cost of processing a request will exceed the appropriate limit, which for central Government is set at &pound;600 and for the wider public sector &pound;450. In this instance the public authority may decide to either approach the applicant to help them refine their request and where possible to bring it under the appropriate limit. Alternatively, public authorities may charge the applicant the cost of processing the request. There is, however, no obligation for departments to provide information if the cost of processing the request exceeds the appropriate limit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1386W.8/1">Burma is facing a generalised HIV and AIDS epidemic and has high Malaria and TB infection and mortality rates. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-18">18 August 2005</phrase>, the Global Fund terminated its US$98 million grant to Burma, citing the Burmese authorities' tightening of restrictions on UN and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) (particularly on travel). Some but not all of these restrictions have subsequently been relaxed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.8/2">Although a phase-out plan has been adopted to mitigate the cancellation of the grants, the termination was a significant setback to work to combat the three diseases. DFID has provided technical assistance to the UN resident co-ordinator to help learn from the experience and consider alternative funding arrangements. Working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), DFID has stressed to the authorities, the need to ensure access for the UN and INGO's. DFID and other donors are designing a replacement programme to respond to the three diseases. During design, we are consulting with a wide range of stakeholders and will ensure a focus on transparency, accountability, equity and effective monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1387W.2/1">The Global Fund has a number of fiduciary mechanisms in place to ensure that grant proceeds are used for their intended purpose. The country co-ordinating mechanism, a country-level partnership which includes representatives from both the public and private sectors, is responsible for submitting the initial grant proposal for approval and nominating the principal recipient(s). It also oversees and monitors the progress of the grant during implementation. The global fund and the principal recipient(s) for each grant negotiate a grant agreement which sets out specific, measurable results that will be tracked using a set of key indicators to assess performance against the agree objectives. Principal recipients are legally responsible for local implementation of the grant, including oversight of sub-recipients of grant funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1387W.2/2">The global fund does not have a country presence outside its offices in Geneva. It relies on independent financial advice from local fund agents which are local auditors. In the initial stage, the local fund agent assesses the financial and administrative capacity of the principal recipient. Over the life of the grant, the local fund agent will verify periodic disbursements based on demonstrated progress towards intended results. This performance-based system of grant-making is key to the glob fund's commitment to results. To ensure transparency and reduce fiduciary risks, the global fund compiles key information including results and financial accountability for each grant into a grant performance report which is posted in the global fund's website: <a href="http://www.theglobalfund.org">www.theglobalfund.org</a>.</p>

There is clear evidence that without access to remittances, children's access to education would be severely limited. Remittance transfers can make up as much as 40 per cent. of the household budget for receiving poor families.</p>
	<p pid="b.1390W.5/6">At the level of the economy, research suggests that remittances provide valuable foreign exchange for developing countries, and strengthen the balance of payments. Unlike other financial flows, remittances are counter cyclical, thus alleviating macroeconomic shocks. Remittances can also provide investment capital for economic activity, contributing to economic growth. Where remittance flows are saved rather than spent, they help improve the savings ratios and provide a higher deposit base for the banking system, which is necessary for economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1390W.5/7">DFID has a number of initiatives underway to reduce barriers to remittance flows and improve their developmental impact. In particular, DFID has initiated remittance country partnerships with Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. These partnerships include work to extend access to remittances to poorer and more rural people, encourage greater competition and lower remittance prices, and improve data. DFID also works closely with economists in the World Bank that are researching in depth the impact of remittances on poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1390W.5/8">In terms of work in the UK, DFID has recently set up a task force comprising of banks and money transfer companies, in order to lower remittance prices and improve the services they provide to low income migrants. The task force will implement recommendations from a public/private sector working group report that DFID launched late last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1390W.5/9">DFID initiated a website (<a href="http://www.sendmoneyhome.org">www.sendmoneyhome.org</a>) for those wishing to send remittances to developing countries from the UK, which provides easily available comparative information on remittance prices and providers. The aim is to improve choice and stimulate competition, leading to lower prices and a better service for low income migrants. DFID funded a household survey in the UK among the Bangladeshi community which explores the impact on recipients of remittances to Bangladesh, and has recently commissioned a wider household survey to better quantify remittance flows from key ethnic minority communities within the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1400W.2/1">The US is the G8 lead nation for developing the Afghan national army (ANA), and 27,000 Afghan soldiers have been trained under their auspices. Over 60,000 policemen have been trained by the German-led police reform programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.2/2">The UK has assisted training by providing resources and assisting ANA capacity building within the US-led effort, including NCO training for the ANA and, from April 2006, junior officer training for the ANA. The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) has also provided two civilian advisers to work with the Afghan MOD to help build its capacity, and there are Afghan cadets at Sandhurst.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.2/3">The UK Ministry of Defence does not contribute funds specifically to ANP training, although financial support has been provided by the global conflict prevention pool, which is jointly funded and administered by MOD, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. This breaks down as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1400W.2/15">In addition, the UK has provided senior police advisers based at UK-led provincial reconstruction team and UK forces deployed under the NATO-led international security assistance force (ISAF) help provide the secure environment in which police reform can take place. The UK's provincial reconstruction team in Helmand will include police reform experts, and UK troops will work closely with the ANA as they take on an increasing responsibility for security in the Province.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.2/16">The ISAF has a key role to play in facilitating the development of both the ANA and ANP, enabling them to operate with greater and more co-ordinated effect, thereby bringing security and stability to the entire country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1400W.5/1">So far 27,000 Afghan troops have been trained by the US-led programme for the development of the Afghan national army (ANA). This programme is supported by the UK and other nations. The UK is providing NCO training and from April the UK will also support junior officer training in Kabul. The NATO-led international security assistance force (ISAF) is not part of this programme. However, British forces as part of the ISAF will assist with the training and mentoring of Afghan army units in Helmand Province. The Afghan Minister for Defence recently estimated there were now 34,000 soldiers, NCOs and officers in the ANA.</p>

	<p pid="b.1404W.0/1">It has been a key principle of this Government's approach to the health concerns of veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict that there should be appropriate research into veterans' illnesses and into the factors that may have a bearing on them. Research already sponsored by the Ministry of Defence includes: epidemiological studies; clinical and laboratory tests; a programme of investigation into the possible adverse health effects of the medical countermeasures offered to troops; a systematic review of research literature; and a study of the social aspects of the issue. Most of this work has been completed and published. We have also maintained close contact with the US authorities to ensure visibility and understanding of the extensive programme of research that they have commissioned. The research has shown no evidence of a unique illness associated with service in the Gulf, nor has it identified a specific cause of the illnesses in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1404W.0/2">Independent advice on the direction of this research is provided by the Medical Research Council. The Ministry of Defence is currently considering with the council potential additional studies aimed at improving the long-term health of veterans with persistent symptoms and also of an enzyme involved in metabolising organophosphates. Announcements will be made in due course regarding the outcome of these considerations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1410W.3/32">1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and percentages to the nearest whole number, therefore individual numbers by parliamentary constituencies may not sum to Northern Ireland total.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/33">2. As with any sample survey the numbers and percentages quoted in the table above are subject to a degree of sampling error.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/34">3. A single year's data do not provide robust results at the level of parliamentary constituency. It was therefore necessary to combine two years data to allow robust analysis this level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/35">4. The data were sourced from Households Below Average Income Northern Ireland (HBAI NI). The HBAI NI is based on information collected from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS was first run in NI in 2002&ndash;03. Therefore data is not available prior to 2002&ndash;03. The NBAI was first introduced in Great Britain in 1994&ndash;95.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/36">5. The HBAI is the main source of income poverty measures throughout the UK and is used to monitor the United Kingdom's child poverty targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/37">6. Relative income poverty is defined as having an income less than 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/38">7. Income before housing costs (BHC) includes the following main components: usual net earnings from employment; profit or loss from self-employment (losses are treated as a negative income); all social security benefits (including housing benefit, social fund, maternity, funeral and community care grants but excluding social fund loans) and tax credits; income from occupational and private pensions; investment income; maintenance payments, if a person receives them directly; income from educational grants and scholarships (including, for students, top up loans and parental contributions); the cash value of certain forms of income in kind (free school meals, free welfare milk, free school milk and free TV licence for those aged 75 and over).</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/39">8. Income is net of the following items: income tax payments; national insurance contributions; domestic rates (this includes water and sewerage charges for Northern Ireland); contributions to occupational pension schemes (including all additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to occupational pension schemes, and any contributions to personal pensions); all maintenance and child support payments, which are deducted from the income of the person making the payment and parental contributions to students living away from home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1410W.3/40">9. Income after housing costs (AHC) is derived by deducting a measure of housing costs from BHC income measure. Housing costs include the following: rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, mortgage interest payments (net of tax relief); structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and service charges.</p>

Around 500 schools are operating the standards at present and the remaining schools will be included as soon as possible. Additional funding has been provided to support the initiative which will address not only school meals but will also include other areas of food provision in schools such as tuck shops and vending machines. The Department will shortly be consulting on the timetable for introducing these changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1411W.2/3">In addition, from the 2006&ndash;07 school year the Education and Training Inspectorate will be evaluating the nutritional quality of meals in schools. It will also be examining schools' general approaches to promoting healthy eating.</p>
	<p pid="b.1411W.2/4">Health education is a compulsory element of the curriculum for all pupils. It provides opportunities to learn about a healthy diet and to know and understand the contribution of food to growth, energy and health.</p>

Since that time job advertisements for administrative assistant and administrative officer have carried messages particularly welcoming applications from the Protestant community. Appointments continue to be made strictly on merit from those who apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1411W.5/7">The Service's Article 55 review is currently in train and will examine the latest available figures. I expect to be in a position to provide this report to hon. Members in Northern Ireland later in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1415W.0/1">The Brunswick Street hostel was operated by the Lee Hestia Association Ltd. as a member organisation of the Novas-Ouvertures Group Ltd. Support services in the hostel were funded by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive under the Supporting People programme. The Novas-Ouvertures Group subsequently decided to withdraw its services from Northern Ireland and a number of other areas and the Brunswick Street hostel closed in July 2005. While this is entirely a matter for the Novas-Ouvertures Group, I understand that the decision was taken for business reasons.</p>

	<p pid="b.1416W.3/1">This cannot be determined until the Valuation and Lands Agency completes the revaluation process in the spring of 2006. A study published by the university of Ulster in 2003, using sales information, suggested that the proportion whose bills would decrease following the move to discrete capital based rating would be 61 per cent., while 39 per cent. would face an increased bill. The Department's own analysis supports these estimates and indicates that the proportion of properties which will experience a decrease in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 52 per cent., the proportion that will face an increase in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 35 per cent. and the proportion with no change in bill (that is, between + /- 5 per cent.) is 13 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1416W.3/2">This assumes overall revenues remain static. Furthermore the estimates do not allow for households which may qualify for housing benefit nor does it take into account the moderating impact of a three year transition scheme and any interim arrangements that may be considered for the treatment of district rates.</p>

Nationally the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made available over &pound;5 billion funding for investment by local authorities and housing associations in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 to support key housing priorities, including support for low cost home ownership (LCHO). The homebuy programme offers shared equity to help first time buyers to buy a share of the council or housing association home they rent, or of a newly built home. Allocations for the region will be announced in the next few weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1442W.6/1">The UK, as designated partner nation for counter narcotics, has worked closely with the Government of Afghanistan since 2002. Recently, we supported the Government of Afghanistan in reviewing and updating its National Drugs Control Strategy. The strategy was endorsed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Counter Narcotics, at which HM Ambassador is an observer, and approved by President Karzai in January 2006. The strategy was launched during the Counter Narcotics (CN) session of the London Conference on Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>. It sets out four key priorities, which we believe will help make a greater impact on the trade and sustain the reduction in cultivation we have seen in 2005. These are: targeting traffickers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; developing institutions; and demand reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1442W.6/2">The UK is working very closely with the Government of Afghanistan to help build Afghan capacity to tackle the drugs problem. We are funding a &pound;12.5 million Institution Development project to strengthen the Ministry of Counter Narcotics, established at the end of 2004, and other institutions in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1442W.6/3">We have helped to establish and provide training for the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA)&mdash;the lead drugs law enforcement agency, headquartered in Kabul with seven provincial offices. The CNPA is currently around 500 strong, but will be expanded further to give it the capacity to operate nationwide. The UK is also providing training for the Afghan Special Narcotics Force (ASNF), an elite and highly trained force equipped to tackle high value targets across the country. Since January 2004, the CNPA and ASNF have seized approximately 165 tonnes of opiates, destroyed over 264 drugs labs and made a significant number of arrests.</p>
	<p pid="b.1442W.6/4">We are also working with the international community to recruit and train a counter narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force of Afghan investigators, prosecutors and judges to work with the CNPA, to be able to push through successful drugs investigations and prosecutions. The Criminal Justice Task Force is currently around 80 strong and made its first convictions in May this year for drug trafficking in Kabul. A new drugs law was also passed in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1442W.6/5">As partner nation, the UK is also responsible for co-ordinating international assistance and encouraging the international community to increase their support to counter narcotics activity. To this end, we helped design the Counter Narcotics Trust Fund which was officially launched at the Afghan Ministry of Finance on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-29">29 October 2005</phrase>. The fund will enable the Government of Afghanistan to raise funds from donors specifically for the CN effort and gives them a greater say over how this money is spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1442W.6/6">In support of the Government of Afghanistan's efforts, the UK will spend &pound;270 million over this and the next two financial years, including some &pound;130 million on legal rural livelihoods and institutional development from the Department for International Development.</p>

	<p pid="b.1443W.2/1">The identification of opium supply routes out of Afghanistan is based on seizure rates of opiates along the heroin trafficking routes. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's 2004 Afghanistan Opium Survey showed that of Afghanistan's total opiate exports (500 metric tons of morphine and heroin and close to 100 metric tons of opium), about a quarter is exported via Central Asia (the Northern&quot; or Silk&quot; Route), but the bulk is still exported via Pakistan and Iran to Turkey and into the Balkans, (the Balkan Route&quot;). 90 per cent. of the drugs exported on the Northern Route&quot; are for the Russian market. Most of the opiates exported on the Balkan Route&quot; are destined for Europe. There is some evidence that the Caspian Route&quot;, from Turkmenistan across the Caspian Sea into the Caucasus, is increasingly being used to traffic drugs into Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.1444W.2/1">Afghanistan has been the world's major supplier of illicit opium for a decade. It will take a long time to uproot something so deeply entrenched in Afghanistan's culture and economy. Without a strong state, a fully functioning judiciary or a properly trained and manned police force, Afghan capability to date has been limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1444W.2/2">There is no simple answer to how long the Afghan counter narcotics effort will take. At the opening of the London Conference, President Karzai said</p>
	<p pid="b.1444W.2/3" class="indent">In my view, and in the view of the United Nations that shares it with me, perhaps Afghanistan will need at least 10 years of a strong systematic consistent effort in eradication, in law enforcement and in the provision to the Afghan farmer of an alternative economy in order for us to be free of poppies by that time. So I would give it a decade, at least.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1444W.2/4">It will certainly require a sustained effort by the Afghan Government and the international community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1444W.2/5">But progress is being made. Last year, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&ndash;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&ndash;05. These overall percentages, however, mask significant variations between provinces. For example, Nangarhar (-96 per cent.), Badakshan (-53 per cent.) and Helmand (-10 per cent.) saw the most significant decreases, while other provinces, such as Balkh and Farah, saw increases. Progress was also made in 2005 with the establishment of a Ministry for Counter Narcotics in Afghanistan, the passage of vital counter narcotics legislation, the conviction of over 90 drug traffickers and the seizure of some 160 tonnes of opiates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1444W.2/6">The Government of Afghanistan has, with the support of the UK as designated partner nation for counter narcotics, recently reviewed and updated its National Drugs Control Strategy to ensure its policy approach is the right one. The strategy, which was launched at the London Conference, focuses on four key priorities: targeting the trafficker; building institutions; strengthening rural livelihoods; and reducing domestic demand. The strategy also sets out the basis for a targeted ground based eradication policy and highlights the importance of raising public awareness and improving international and regional co-operation on counter narcotics. The UK is spending over &pound;270 million over the next three years in support of the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1445W.2/1">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. In 2005, UNODC estimated a total of 104,000 hectares of land were under opium poppy cultivation, with the highest levels of cultivation seen in Helmand, Kandahar, Balkh, Farah and Badakshan provinces. Total production was estimated at 4,100 tonnes. These figures represent a 21 percent. reduction on cultivation and a 2.5 percent. reduction on production over 2004 figures. The smaller scale of the decrease in total production resulted from higher yields per hectare arising from good weather conditions and less disease. Full details, including the level of opium cultivation by province from 2002&ndash;05, can be found in the UNODC Afghanistan opium survey, November 2005, or on UNODC's website <a href="http://www.unodc.org">http://www.unodc.org</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1445W.5/1">The Government of Afghanistan is responsible for controlling opium production in Afghanistan. In April 2002, the UK took on G8 lead nation status for counter narcotics with responsibility for coordinating international activity in support of the Government of Afghanistan's counter narcotics campaign. Following endorsement of the Afghanistan compact at the London conference on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>, the UK remains fully committed to this work. We are spending &pound;270 million over this and the next two financial years, including some &pound;130 million on legal rural livelihoods and institutional development from the Department for International Development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.5/2">While we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge, progress is being made. Since the end of 2004, we have seen the establishment of a Ministry for counter narcotics; a 21 percent. reduction in the area of land under opium poppy cultivation; the passage of vital counter narcotics legislation; the conviction of over 90 drug traffickers and an increase in drug related seizures. The UK has also supported the Government of Afghanistan's work to update its national drug control strategy (NDCS) which was approved by President Karzai in January 2006. We believe the updated NDCS represents a more sophisticated approach to tackling the drugs problem which will help the Government of Afghanistan make a greater impact on the trade.</p>

	<p pid="b.1446W.0/1">The UK believes that the Government of Afghanistan's recently updated national drug control strategy represents the best means of securing a sustainable reduction on the production and trafficking of opiates in Afghanistan. The strategy highlights four key priorities. These are: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; developing effective state institutions to combat drugs at the central and provincial level; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment for problem drug users. The strategy also states that there is a role for targeted ground-based eradication where alternative livelihoods exist, in order to incentivise the shift away from poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/2">The UK does not carry out eradication, but we do support Afghan eradication activity where alternative livelihoods exist. We have therefore provided support to the planning, monitoring and targeting work of the Government of Afghanistan's central eradication planning and monitoring cell. We have also funded a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime project to verify governor-led eradication and provided funding to support targeted eradication by the Afghan national police.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/3">On licensing of opium production, the Afghan Minister for counter narcotics has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/4" class="indent">The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad. Without an effective control mechanism, a lot of opium will still be refined into heroin for illicit markets in the West and elsewhere. We could not accept this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/5">The UK agrees with and supports the Government of Afghanistan's position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/6">We do not believe that licensing opium cultivation in Afghanistan is a realistic solution to the problems of the opium economy in Afghanistan. In the absence of a strong state presence throughout the country there is currently too high a risk of diversion of legally produced opium into illegal channels, and overall levels of illicit cultivation could increase as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/7">Helping Afghan farmers develop viable commercial crops as feasible economic alternatives to poppy is an important part of the UK's support. But farmers also need access to credit, land and markets, alternative employment opportunities (on and off the farm) infrastructure such as irrigation and roads to help grow and transport produce; and government emergency mechanisms to ensure food security. The UK is supporting the Government of Afghanistan to deliver in all of these areas, to enforce the Afghan law against growing poppy and inject risk into the system through a credible drugs law enforcement and manual poppy field eradication threat. Only in this way will we make a sustainable impact on cultivation and production.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.0/8">The UK will spend over &pound;270 million over this and the next two financial years in support of the national drugs control strategy. During this period, &pound;130 million will be spent on legal rural livelihoods (including research into alternative crops) and institutional development by the Department for International Development. In 2005&ndash;06 the UK spent &pound;6 million in support of Afghan eradication and related activity and &pound;30 million in support of activity to target the trafficker (for law enforcement and criminal justice action) and the top end of the trade. We envisage that similar budgets will be allocated to these activities in 2006&ndash;08. The UK does not support licensing and no budget was allocated to this as a result.</p>

	<p pid="b.1448W.2/1">There are no United Nations Stabilisation Forces in Afghanistan. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is a UN-authorised NATO force designed to assist the Government of Afghanistan with the maintenance of security. ISAF's role in support of the Government of Afghanistan's counter narcotics campaign is set out in the counter narcotics annex of the NATO Operations Plan (OPLAN). NATO Ministers approved the revised OPLAN in December 2005. ISAF forces will be able to help with the provision of training to Afghan counter-narcotics forces and will when necessary provide support to their operations. They will also help the Afghan Government explain their policies to the Afghan people. ISAF forces will not take part in the eradication of opium poppy or in pre-planned and direct military action against the drugs trade. The British Embassy Drugs Team (BEDT) in Kabul works closely with HQ ISAF in deconflicting and informing the international military forces about counter narcotics activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1448W.2/2">Military forces operating under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) are also authorised to provide support to the Afghan counter narcotics campaign. BEDT again works closely with the US OEF military headquarters, CFC-A, based in Kabul, to encourage coalition forces, as well as ISAF, within means and capabilities, to support the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy. Liaison is particularly close on support for the counter narcotics information campaign and for day-to-day support provided to Afghan counter narcotics forces through the thirteen coalition Provincial Reconstruction Teams based around the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1448W.2/3">There is also a regular Afghan Government/UN/US sponsored forum in Kabul at which the five key pillars of Security Sector Reform (SSR) are discussed with representatives from the US (reform of the military), Germany (Police Reform), Italy (Judicial reform), Japan (disarmament and demobilisation) and the UK (counter narcotics). All five pillars of SSR are inter-connected and are significant in dealing holistically with the opium problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.1451W.2/1">We are aware of the alleged involvement of Hindu Extremist organisations in attacks against Christians and other minority religions in India and we condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their beliefs. In January this year, Mr. V. V Augustine of the National Commission for Minorities visited Dang District where many attacks on minorities have occurred. Police officials assured him that they would uphold law and order during upcoming festivals and maintain a strict vigilance in all 312 villages of the district at all times. The Indian Minister of Home Affairs, Shivraj Patil, has written to Mr. Augustine to confirm that the Home Ministry will provide additional forces if required.

	<p pid="b.1452W.0/1">The nature of Iran's nuclear activities; its long record of concealment and failure to be fully transparent with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); its many breaches of its obligations; and its refusal to take and sustain confidence building steps requested by the IAEA Board of Governors have all contributed to a lack of confidence among the international community that Iran's nuclear programme is, as it claims, for exclusively peaceful purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.0/2">In August 2005, the E3/EU presented proposals covering long-term arrangements for Iran's nuclear programme. These stated that continued confidence building would be required over a significant period of time, and outlined ways in which Iran could build confidence, including by making a binding commitment not to pursue fuel cycle activities other than the construction and operation of light water power and research reactors. They suggested that a final agreement could be reviewed every 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.0/3">Iran left the negotiations in August 2005 when it unilaterally decided to restart uranium conversion activities, contrary to repeated requests by the IAEA board and in violation of the Paris Agreement, which had set out the framework for talks. E3/EU officials held an exploratory meeting with Iran in December 2005 to see if it would be possible to agree a basis for resuming negotiations. The E3/EU stated that it would be essential, inter alia, for Iran not to renege further on its commitment to suspend all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. Iran's subsequent decision to restart enrichment related activity was a further rejection of efforts to seek a diplomatic solution, and has aroused further suspicion of Iran's intentions. We hope that Iran will reinstate a full suspension of enrichment related and reprocessing activities, address in full the outstanding requests of the IAEA Board of Governors and return to negotiations on a long-term agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.0/4">We welcome the resolution adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase>. At the board's request, the United Nations Security Council will now become involved, to reinforce the IAEA's authority. The decision was made necessary by Iran's failure to comply with requests made in previous board resolutions and its failure to take steps that would build confidence that its nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes. The resolution was backed by the great majority of the board's 35 members, and demonstrates the strength of the international community's determination to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East.</p>

	<p pid="b.1456W.6/1">There have been no compulsory redundancies in any of the Department's businesses in Wales as a result of the efficiency programme announced in the 2004 Spending Review. While detailed work force plans continue to be developed, at this time, no compulsory redundancies are planned to be made in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1456W.6/2">The planned reduction in staff numbers is being largely managed through normal staff turnover, controlling recruitment and promotions, and re-deploying staff to fill vacancies. Compulsory redundancy will only be used as a last resort when all other measures have been considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1456W.6/3">The Department has and will continue to run a limited number of voluntary early release and voluntary retirement schemes where these are shown to support operational requirements and be cost effective. Over the spending review period to date, 302 members of staff (equating to 270 Full Time Equivalents) have left under these schemes in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.1461W.2/1">There is very little information about same-sex couples in this country. The labour force survey suggests that there are about 50,000 cohabiting same-sex couples in the UK. The Department does not have any statistical information about individuals currently receiving income related benefits who are living with someone of the same sex as though they were civil partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.2/2">The Department has conducted a targeted publicity campaign intended to ensure that all benefit recipients are aware of the need to advise the relevant benefit office as soon as they can on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase> if they are living together as if they were civil partners. This has included publication of a leaflet 'Getting it right' which has been distributed to all Jobcentre Plus offices, pension centres, pension local services and Citizens Advice Bureaux. Additionally it has been sent to Doctors' surgeries and other organisations including the Terrence Higgins Trust, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, libraries and local councils. The leaflet has also been placed on the DWP internet site.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.2/3">Our policy is not to ask for repayments from someone who has acted reasonably but has failed to appreciate that, although they have not entered into a civil partnership, their benefit is affected because they now form a same-sex couple. Departmental guidance has been amended to reflect this policy and the changes in the law. However, if a customer who is a civil partner or who lives with another person as though they were civil partners knows that this could affect their benefit they must tell the office that deals with their claim. If they fail to do so and they receive too much benefit they may be required to refund the amount that has been overpaid to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1464W.0/51" class="indent">The roll out of Jobcentre Plus and, in particular the new claims process supported by the Customer Management System (CMS), is a major undertaking.

	<p pid="b.1464W.0/53" class="indent">Staff recruitment and training: contact centres in particular have faced the difficult task of recruiting and training a new workforce, often with little or no prior experience in the business and, therefore, of benefit issues. This is taking time to develop although underpinning learning and development products are in place;</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/54" class="indent">IT system performance: CMS has been implemented in tandem with Jobcentre Plus rollout and initially some problems were encountered in terms of speed, capacity and reliability of the system. A series of technical releases earlier this year addressed these issues and CMS now performs well and to agreed service levels;</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/55" class="indent">Efficiency challenge: at the same time as we are introducing significant change to the way we deliver our services we are we are implementing a major efficiency programme to deliver the required headcount savings in the Spending Review 2004 settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/56" class="indent">With any change of this size there are always difficulties as the systems and processes bed in. This has led to some backlogs building up and a lengthening in the average time it takes to process claims.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/57" class="indent">Because clearance times have been rising in some areas, a task force has been set up to develop a national action plan that coordinates and builds on action that has been taking place locally. The plan will cover a number of issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1467W.7/1">The Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) periodically evaluates the scientific research relating to mobile phone technology and health including that relevant to third generation (3G) mobile phones. The Stewart report in 2000 comprehensively reviewed the scientific literature and concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.7/2" class="indent">the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures below [international] guidelines do not cause health effects to the general population&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.7/3">More recently, Mobile Phones and Health 2004, reiterated the Stewart report's conclusions noting that</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.7/4" class="indent">there is a lack of hard information showing that the mobile phone systems in use are damaging to health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.7/5">Both the above reports recommended a precautionary approach to the use of mobile phone technology pending the availability of more robust scientific research results. The reports are available on the HPA's website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.7/6">The widespread use of mobile phones and the development of newer technologies mean that the possibility of health effects should be continually monitored. Following the results in 2003 of research on 3G base station exposures apparently showing a health effect, the mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme in this country is now supporting a study at the university of Essex into the symptoms experienced by 3G signals on volunteers (<a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="b.1467W.7/7">All mobile phones and base stations in this country comply with the international guidelines. Measurements undertaken both by the HPA and by Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>) have consistently shown that exposures to radio signals from base stations, including those from 3G stations, are lower than the international guidelines.</p>

Clinical evidence proves conclusively that early defibrillation and resuscitation saves more lives, and therefore co-responders trained in life support, first aid and equipped with defibrillators help to ensure that patients receive advanced life support as soon as possible, improving outcomes for those patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469W.5/2">It is a local matter for ambulance trusts to decide whether or how they use community volunteer responders or other schemes such as community paramedics, in conjunction with the range of ambulance vehicles to ensure all patients get the most appropriate and timely response.</p>

	<p pid="b.1477W.11/1">As with many factors during a pandemic, the level of absenteeism will depend significantly on the nature of the pandemic virus and this cannot be known until after the virus emerges.</p>
	<p pid="b.1477W.11/2">Over the period of a pandemic, which could be around three to four months, the proportion of the workforce who will take time off due to illness will be similar to the overall clinical attack rate. For example, if the overall clinical attack rate is 25 per cent., then a quarter of the workforce is likely to be ill over the three to four month period. The number absent at any particular time will be less, but will probably peak over two to three weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1477W.11/3">The absenteeism rate is unlikely to be uniform across all sectors nor is it likely to occur at the same time in each company, sector or region. The level of absenteeism is likely to be dependent on the size of the organisation, the type of industry and the personal circumstances of the workforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.1477W.11/4">On the national health service in particular, there is ongoing modelling work in this area to take account of the special circumstances of health care workers. Preliminary results indicate that the picture would be broadly the same as for other organisations, however, work is still in progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1480W.0/1">The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-13">13 December</phrase>, to the director of development for Bristol South and West Primary Care Trust, confirmed the Department's decision to require the standard private finance initiative contract to be used in future for complex individual Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) facilities with a capital value of over &pound;25 million. This decision was taken to ensure appropriate risk transfer for these very large LIFT facilities, which are much larger and cover additional services than those originally intended to be undertaken under LIFT. The decision simply involves the use of a different contract for the limited number of LIFT facilities where it is more appropriate. It does not represent a major policy, financial or service change, and for this reason, no formal consultations were undertaken with stakeholders including the LIFT Liaison Organisation for Business Investors (LIFT LOBI). This is in line with the Cabinet Office's Code of Practice on Consultation&quot;. The Department's national health service LIFT policy lead met representatives of LIFT LOBI on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase> to discuss and explain the decision, and is also holding a series of meetings with the primary care trusts affected.

	<p pid="b.1480W.0/3">The policy developments set out in the letter are consistent with the National Audit Office report on the LIFT scheme, which endorses LIFT as an initiative to support the redevelopment of the primary care estate. They are also consistent with the letter from the chief executive of the NHS to the chair of the LIFT LOBI dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1480W.3/2">Three representations have been received concerning the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease. Two alleged that Lyme disease was not being correctly diagnosed or treated within the national health service and one was additionally concerned about risks of transmission via blood transfusion. A parliamentary question has also been asked about the use of intravenous ceftriaxone for Lyme disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.1480W.3/3">The inspector of microbiology and infection control has confirmed that the internationally recognised criteria for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis are routinely used for diagnosis within the NHS through the Health Protection Agency's Lyme borreliosis specialist diagnostic service. These are based upon stringent interpretation of serological tests for specific antibodies to the causative organism, Borrelia burgdorferi and are recommended in the United States of America, Europe and the United Kingdom. The Inspector is concerned that some medical practitioners base their diagnosis on positive results from unsuitable and unvalidated tests performed in non-accredited laboratories. A warning was published in the American journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-11">11 February 2005</phrase>, advising caution regarding many commercially promoted tests for Lyme borreliosis and restating the internationally accepted diagnostic criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1480W.3/4">Treatment is with antibiotics. Detailed studies have shown excellent long term outcomes for most people who receive appropriate treatment. Repeated or prolonged courses of antibiotics have been shown not to help the small proportion of patients with post infection syndrome.</p>

The NHS Cancer Plan is a 10-year strategy to improve cancer services in England and raise the level of our cancer services to the best in Europe. We are now five years into the NHS Cancer Plan and are focused on delivering its commitments. Once these have been delivered we will give further consideration to whether an updated cancer plan is needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1486W.6/1">Under the terms of their contract, contractors receive a global sum which is a contribution towards the contractor's costs in delivering essential and additional services, including maintaining adequate patient records. In addition, contractors can obtain points within the quality and outcomes framework on a number of areas relating to the maintenance of patient records. The relevant indicators are outlined in annex D of the statement of financial entitlements, which is available in the Library. There are no current plans to provide additional financial support to general practitioners specifically for entry of patients' records on the national health service care records service (NHS CRS).</p>
	<p pid="b.1486W.6/2">The transfer of local records to the NHS CRS requires compliance with NHS Connecting for Health's stringent data migration quality standards. However, good practice guidelines for general practice electronic patient records developed by the General Practitioners Committee and the Royal College of General Practitioners, and issued by the Department, make it clear that responsibility for the quality of the necessary transfer processes, and for ensuring information is accurate and up-to-date, lies with the individual practice. This includes the putting in place of procedures to identify and resolve where an error occurs in code conversion. That could be as simple as reviewing and verifying the relevant record with the patient at the next consultation.</p>

The CRB service standards are to process 93 per cent. of standard disclosure applications within two weeks and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosure applications within four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1494W.0/2">I understand from the CRB, that there are no figures available to determine the average time taken to process a POVA check because the check forms part of the overall internal CRB disclosure process and figures are not collated centrally.</p>
