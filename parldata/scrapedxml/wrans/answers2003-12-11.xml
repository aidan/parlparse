	<p pid=".539W.3/1">Previous research has shown that there is a negative relationship between badger and hedgehog abundance, i.e. more badgers equals fewer hedgehogs, in rural areas. This is believed to be due to hedgehog predation by badgers and through hedgehogs avoiding areas of higher badger density. However, this is not necessarily a &quot;deleterious effect on wildlife&quot;, since predator/prey interactions are a feature of ecosystems. It has been suggested that badgers may impact adversely on some species of ground nesting birds. The interaction between the badgers and other species in the ecosystem is the subject of a study being carried out by the Central Science Laboratory. This study is being conducted in selected areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial and the results will not be available until after the fieldwork programme finishes at the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".539W.12/1">These are set out in the Second Report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB. Essentially, over the same time period, the number of cattle herd breakdowns in reactive trial areas are compared with the number of herd breakdowns in the survey only trial areas, taking into account factors such as numbers of herds per trial area, timing of tuberculin test and a number of other variables. For analytical purposes, the starting point used for such comparisons, for each triplet, is the end of the initial culling operation in the proactive trial area.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.2/2">The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) intends to publish the results of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial as soon as possible following its predicted conclusion in 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/3">In line with its undertaking to report any significant results that emerge from analyses before the trial's conclusion, the ISO recently reported results that indicated that localised badger culling seemed to increase TB incidence in cattle. These results stem from a comparison between the level of TB incidence in cattle in the reactive culling and the control (no culling) treatment areas. Further information is available from the Defra website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm</a> and from a paper the ISO have published in <i>Nature</i> <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature">www.nature.com/nature</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.5/1">Since the early 1970s MAFF/Defra has carried out a range of badger control strategies in an attempt to reduce TB incidence in cattle. These were reviewed in the Krebs Report in 1997 where, among other things, it was recommended that a scientific field experiment be set up to test rigorously the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of different badger culling strategies and to provide the evidence on which to base future TB control strategies. The Krebs report recommended a randomised block approach comprising three treatments: reactive culling, proactive culling, and no culling. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial, as recommended by Krebs and designed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, commenced in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.5/2">Previous control strategies included Gassing (1975&ndash;82), Clean Ring (1982&ndash;86), Interim (1986 to 1998) and Live Test (1994&ndash;96) further details are available in the Krebs Report Chapter 5 page 76. None of the control strategies has been assessed in a properly designed experiment to establish their efficacy. While removal operations may have had an effect on the prevalence of TB in badgers and on herd breakdowns, other factors may also have influenced these. In the absence of scientific controls, it is not possible to separate out the effects of badger removal from these confounding factors.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.0/1">It is only possible to make estimates of the incidence of bovine TB in cattle based on previous years. Unfortunately, data for both 2002 and 2001 cannot be easily compared with earlier years. This is because, in 2001, TB testing was largely suspended during the foot and mouth disease outbreak, and in 2002 much of the testing effort was aimed at high-risk herds and those with overdue tests. Nevertheless, early indications suggest that the reduced levels of testing in 2001 have not substantially altered the underlying historical trend of confirmed TB incidents in cattle, which continues to rise at a yearly average rate of about 18 per cent. for new herd incidents.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.3/1">DFID is committed to working with others, including our donor partners, the pharmaceutical industry, investors, developing country governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to improve access to medicines in developing countries, including for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.3/2">With the World Health Organisation, DFID believes that affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems, and the rational selection and use of existing drugs are all essential to improve access to medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.3/3">In line with this, DFID has committed over &pound;1.5 billion since May 1997 to support the strengthening of health and supply systems in developing countries, which will help to build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection of drugs. The UK has also pledged $280 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). This will help pay for increased coverage of proven interventions for the three diseases and some associated health systems strengthening. According to UNAIDS, the UK is the second largest bilateral donor for HIV/AIDS programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.3/4">DFID supports a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS, which includes prevention, treatment and care and alleviation of the impact of AIDS. We welcome recent reductions in the price of both patent and generic anti-retroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV. These reductions have created new opportunities to allow poor people to benefit from the same life-saving treatment that has been available in affluent countries. We will continue to work with the WHO, the patent based and generic pharmaceutical industries and others to further reduce prices. DFID supports the target set by the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS for three million people receiving treatment by the end of 2005. A new policy on treatment and care, to be launched early next year, will set out how DFID will coordinate work with partners to promote anti-retroviral treatment for poor people and for women.</p>

Estimates are for London and are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that, in the case of the Family Resources Survey, control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).</p>
	<p pid=".550W.13/30">4. Income is adjusted or equivalised to take into account variations in both size and composition of the household. This process reflects the notion that a family of several people needs a higher income than a single person in order for both households to enjoy a comparable standard of living. Incomes of larger families are adjusted downwards and incomes of smaller households adjusted upwards. The equivalence scales used takes a couple with no children as the reference point, and increases relatively the income of single persons households, and reduces relatively the incomes of households with larger consumption capabilities.</p>

In particular, member states reached a compromise on Unemployment Benefit for people who live in a member state other than the one where they last worked. This relates to a reimbursement system that member states have agreed to: the last state of work will reimburse part of the Unemployment Benefit paid by the state of residence. UK retains a Parliamentary Scrutiny on this Regulation.</p>

Discussion focused on the scope of the Centre, which is due to be operational by 2005, with member states agreeing it should concentrate initially on communicable disease, with the possibility of broadening the remit following external evaluation of its operations at a later date. Issues still to be resolved include the legal base, where the UK retained its reserve, and data protection requirements.</p>

By multiplying these numbers together (and by multiplying by 52 weeks) we get an estimated value of annual actual unpaid overtime worked by employees in the UK of &pound;22&frac34; billion. If managers and senior officials who receive a salary rather than an hourly rate are excluded then the value of annual unpaid overtime falls markedly, to &pound;12&frac12; billion.

Such hopes had always depended on a high proportion of proposals awarded contracts under the old Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) arrangements resulting in commissioned projects, and it had become apparent that this was not happening with the necessary speed.</p>

Some of these employees would not have been required to sign an opt-out as not all would have worked over 48 hours per week on average over the 17 week reference period, some would have been autonomous workers and others would have been in sectors or occupations that were excluded from the regulations at the time of the surveys.</p>

This is achieved through a combination of highly targeted direct marketing and the establishment of a network of Employer Support Executives to focus employer support at the regional level.

This process recognises that, if there is time, it is better to seek volunteers for specific posts whose employers have given permission for them to be mobilised. Where possible, we will also endeavour to provide reasonable notice of mobilisation plans and improve the flow of information to employers about mobilised Reservists.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.8/1">The Irish Hare Species Action Plan, published by the Department of the Environment in 2000, identified the need for regular surveys of the Irish hare population, building on the baseline population for the species established by research commissioned by the Department from Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) in 1997. This was followed by The Northern Ireland Irish Hare Survey 2002, also carried out on the Department's behalf by QUB. Both reports confirmed that Irish hare numbers are low. I am satisfied that this research provides as accurate a population estimate as can be made for such an elusive and uncommon animal.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/2">The Department intends to carry out regular monitoring throughout Northern Ireland in order to detect future trends in Irish hare numbers. The next survey is scheduled for spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.8/3">No assessment has been made of the effect on hare numbers of developing current hunting, shooting and coursing practices to ensure they cannot have an unsustainable impact on hare numbers. These practices are subject to the provisions of the Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928, as amended. I recently published notice under the Act, of a proposal to introduce a temporary ban on the killing or taking, or the sale or purchase of Irish hares. This is intended to allow time to consider, within a current review of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, whether there is a need to strengthen the statutory protection afforded to the Irish hare.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.2/1">Research carried out at the Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) reported in 1997 that the population of the Irish Hare was at low density in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".577W.2/2">This assessment was followed up by a research study, &quot;The Northern Ireland Irish Hare 'Lepus timidus hibernicus' Survey 2002&quot;, commissioned by the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) of the Department of the Environment and also carried out by QUB. It reported that Irish Hares were widespread but occurred at a low density of about one hare per kilometre square. The report of this study included the recommendation that the Department should consider removal of the Irish Hare from the quarry list and giving protection under the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. This recommendation is among the issues being considered in a current review of the Wildlife Order.</p>
	<p pid=".577W.2/3">I considered the research and survey report in the context of the Irish Hare Species Action Plan published by EHS in 2000, which has among its objectives a target to double the Irish Hare population, over as wide an area as possible, by 2010. The inconsistency between this policy objective and the continuing practice of hunting and coursing Irish Hares led to the proposal for a temporary ban on the killing or taking, or the sale or purchase, of Irish Hares, pending the outcome of the Wildlife Order review.</p>
	<p pid=".577W.2/4">A seminar delivering the results of the 2002 Survey was held in January 2003 at Queen's University Belfast. Interested parties were invited to attend. Following this seminar the full text of the report was made available on the EHS website, (<a href="http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/pubs/publications/IrishHareSurvey2002.pdf">http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/ pubs/publications/Irish HareSurvey2002.pdf</a>) where it remains available, together with the Irish Hare Species Action Plan. Copies of both documents have also been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.6/3">It was the Department's assessment, informed by advice from NICE, that the national health service would be unable to implement the guidance in full within the usual three-month period. We have previously varied the direction on five occasions when it was required to implement effectively the guidance to provide the service to patients.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.6/4">Patients are already receiving photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the NHS and we are committed to working with the NHS to facilitate implementation by July 2004. We want to see eligible patients benefiting from effective treatment: this is why we are implementing the NICE guidance as quickly as possible and have asked the NHS to ensure that patients with suspected classic with no occult CNV are treated wherever capacity exists to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".596W.0/1">The Government have made clear their position on the use of genetic test results for underwriting life and health insurance in the October 2001 Government response to the report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee: Genetics and Insurance.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.0/2">The Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) is responsible for the evaluation of specific genetic tests and their relevance to particular types of insurance. The GAIC also provides independent scrutiny of compliance with the terms of the moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurance companies, which runs until November 2006. If there is evidence of non-compliance with the moratorium by the insurance industry, then the Government are prepared to enforce it through legislation, if necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.0/3">The Human Genetics Commission (HGC) has been asked to work closely with the GAIC to provide Government with further advice in developing a longer-term policy on the use of genetic information by insurance companies.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.0/4">The GAIC and HGC will also monitor the effectiveness of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) code of practice on genetics, which is mandatory for all ABI members.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.0/5">The HGC and GAIC held a well-received joint public meeting in September 2003. A number of interested groups and members of the public attended this meeting, including representatives from organisations concerned with genetic disorders, as well as from insurance and re-insurance companies, and non-governmental organisations with an interest in this area. The HGC and GAIC are planning a further such meeting in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.0/6">Research is also under way to consider the use of genetic information in insurance underwriting. This research will be completed by 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.0/1">A vote on the authorisation of Bt11 sweetcorn was taken at a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>. The Food Standards Agency represents the United Kingdom at this committee. As is always the case at such committees, the UK delegation presented a position on behalf of the Government, which was agreed after consulting Ministers from all relevant Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.0/2">The application for the authorisation of a line of genetically modified sweetcorn for food use was made in 1999 under the novel foods regulation (EC) No. 258/97. The dossier was reviewed by the European Union member states and then referred to the European Community Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). The SCF reviewed the application along with an additional dossier of information provided by the applicant, which responded to questions raised by member states. The SCF opinion was published in May 2002 and concluded that this line of GM sweetcorn is as safe for human food consumption as its conventional counterparts.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.0/3">The UK supported the proposal for authorisation because the criteria laid out in the relevant legislation had been met, namely: the product does not present a risk to the consumer, does not mislead the consumer and is not nutritionally disadvantageous compared with other foods that it might replace.</p>

	<p pid=".598W.3/1">The Government are very careful when considering introducing a new vaccine into the childhood immunisation schedule. We have to be sure that the vaccine is safe, and effective in preventing disease. It is also important to know how many doses that children need to be protected and at what age the doses should be given. We also need to be confident that introducing a new vaccine into the childhood immunisation schedule doses not interfere with the protection given by the other vaccines in the programme. We have to be sure that any new health intervention is cost-effective.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.3/2">The independent expert advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is currently examining the evidence of the potential benefits of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the infant immunisation schedule. What is clear is that there are many uncertainties in the evidence, in particular in measuring the burden of pneumococcal disease, and in the amount of disease that is expected to be prevented by a vaccine in both the short and longer term, because it protects against only seven of the numerous strains of pneumococcus.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.3/3">Research is being undertaken to try to answer the questions, and the JCVI is assessing the evidence as it develops.</p>

	<p pid=".609W.3/2">Higher Education is undoubtedly a good investment for the average graduate. The Department has previously estimated that first degree graduates earn on average around &pound;120,000 more &mdash;in present value terms&mdash;over their working lives than those with two or more A-levels. The analysis is based on the spring 2002 quarter of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for Great Britain. The &pound;120,000 differential is derived from gross lifetime earnings streams that are assumed to grow at 2 per cent. per annum in real terms and are discounted at a rate of 3.5 per cent <sup>1</sup> . The Department estimates that the differential would fall to around &pound;90,000 using net lifetime earnings streams, given that higher earning degree-holders would pay more tax on average over their working lives than those with only A-levels.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.3/3" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Real earnings are assumed to grow in line with productivity at 2.0 per cent., as set out in Annex A of The Budget 2003. The discount rate of 3.5 per cent. is the rate used by the Treasury in deciding whether public investments are worthwhile.</p>

	<p pid=".612W.2/2">The HE White Paper sets out our proposals for student support. From 2004, we are introducing a grant worth up to &pound;1,000 to assist students from low-income backgrounds. The full grant will be available to those whose household income is below &pound;15,200, estimated to be around 30 per cent. of students. This is in addition to the loans available for students' living costs, currently of up to &pound;4,930 and a grant for tuition fees currently worth up to &pound;1,125 a year. From next year, the hardship loan fund will be merged into the Access to Learning Fund. All payments of grants will be non-repayable and will be delivered through universities and colleges. Students with dependants and disabled students will continue to benefit from a series of grants that are designed to assist with the cost of entering higher education. We are also introducing a more flexible package of support for part-time students. Full details on the 04/05 student support package were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-03">3 December 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-12-03.61WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 61WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.2/3">From 2006, students will no longer have to pay up-front fees. Instead, we will offer a loan for fees, which with the maintenance loan will be repayable after graduation once earnings exceed &pound;15,000. Any institution that wishes to charge higher fees must first have an access agreement, approved by the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). We are considering and discussing the content of access agreements, including bursaries and other financial support, and the role of OFFA, and will make an announcement in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.2/2">The Department has recently published results from the 2002&ndash;03 Student Income and Expenditure Survey. This showed that more students are taking on debt; 92 per cent. of students anticipated leaving university with debts in 2002&ndash;03. All students are taking on more debt on average, partly as a result of the complete replacement of mandatory grants with student loans, and partly to finance higher levels of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.2/3">In addition, in 2001 the Department published research entitled, 'Social Class and Higher Education: Issues Affecting Participation by Lower Social Class groups' which amongst other things explored the relationship between social class and students' attitudes to debt. This research showed that most potential and current students accepted that they would accumulate debt but felt that the investment was worthwhile and that most current students were confident about paying back the debt they were accruing.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.2/4">Both research reports are available from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/</a></p>

	<p pid=".613W.5/1">The national Primary and Key Stage 3 Strategies have enabled teachers to improve and broaden their teaching skills to raise standards of attainment for children of all abilities. Typical of their approach to inclusion has been the help on challenging and supporting all pupils in whole class teaching, in the ways in which teachers differentiate tasks, in the ways pupils are grouped, and in the ways in which teaching assistants are used to support pupils. This year Key Stage 3 Challenge Programmes offer support in new approaches in one-to-one teaching for pupils who are falling behind in basic skills. Our programme for gifted and talented education, including our support for the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Young, is also helping to develop teachers' understanding of the most effective approaches to the teaching of the most able pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.5/2">Our ambitions for personalised learning in schools are that universal provision should be tailored-to the needs of every child. Central to this agenda are that teachers have more effective skills in formative assessment. We know through a wide body of research, for example through the Ofsted report &quot;Good Assessment in Secondary Schools&quot; published earlier this year, that the quality of assessment by teachers has a significant impact on attitudes to learning through challenging children and through encouraging teachers to focus on how to improve the learning skills of individual pupils. That is why we have made available to all schools the new Pupil Achievement Tracker to help them identify their pupils' strengths and weaknesses and set appropriate targets for development, based on the results of pupils in their National Curriculum Tests. And through the Primary and Key Stage 3 Strategies we will be making available to teachers next year support in assessment for learning techniques and approaches.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.5/1">The policy on the use of staves and mini-batons is set out in Prison Service Order 1600. Female staff who have been trained in its use may be issued with a mini-baton, and this applies at juvenile establishments and units, including Wetherby. In line with the policy relating to juvenile establishments and units, staff at Wetherby have been required to follow the practice of not carrying staves within the establishment. In June 2003, after seeking clarification of the policy from Prison Service headquarters, the Governor ended the practice of issuing staff with staves when escorting young people outside the establishment.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.5/2">Staff in the operational support and prison officer grades at Wetherby continue to wear the traditional Prison Service uniform. Prison Service Order 4950 sets out a requirement for a less formal uniform for staff. Consultations on the implementation of this aspect of the Order are taking place at a national level. The Prison Service remains committed to implementing a uniform that is appropriate for use in juvenile establishments.</p>
