	<p pid=".305W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence currently provides compensation for death and disablement caused or aggravated by service under two schemes, the War Pension Scheme (WPS) and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). Each scheme operates under separate legislation and the standard of proof applied to claims under the two schemes is different.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.3/2">The War Pension Scheme was introduced in 1917 and its generous standard of proof reflects in particular the limits of medical understanding of the time. Claims may be made at any time after service release. Specifically, where a claim is made to a War Pension within seven years of termination of service, the onus is wholly on the Secretary of State to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the disablement was not due to service. Where a claim is made more than seven years after termination, the onus rests on the claimant to raise reasonable doubt by reliable evidence that the disablement is due to service, the claimant receiving the benefit of any reasonable doubt. The attributable benefits elements of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme introduced attributable pensions in 1973. This applies to disablements leading to medical discharge; it considers claims against the balance of probabilities standard of proof, in line with most other such schemes and the practice of civil courts. It places the onus of proof on the individual.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.3/3">It has not been considered appropriate so far to change these arrangements but the issue has been considered within the current review of armed forces compensation arrangements. In March 2001, we published proposals for a new armed forces compensation scheme based entirely on the balance of probabilities standard of proof A number of respondents have expressed their concern that this would not be appropriate to the special status of the armed forces and the demands placed on them. This view has been particularly strongly represented by ex-service organisations. We have been in close consultation with these and other interested groups and will continue to work with the ex-service community in finalising the details of the new scheme. We expect to make a final decision on the broad design of a new scheme shortly.</p>

This arrangement provides a framework of enabling contracts, some elements of which are calculated on anticipated daily consumption rates and others on term hire rates. These arrangements apply mainly to base camps and are likely to remain in place for the duration of operations in Iraq. We also contract for support services independently where this is more appropriate. In addition, a number of items of clothing and footwear have been acquired from the US at a cost of around &pound;250,000.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.2/2">The milk tokens represent some 130 million litres of milk per year, or 1 per cent. of the total production of milk in Great Britain. It is difficult to assess to what extent milk consumption might fall as a result of the proposals, as milk would still be available under the fixed value voucher system proposed by the Department of Health, albeit along with other foods.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/3">The dairy industry has expressed concern that the removal of the milk token system would have an adverse effect on milk rounds, given that milk delivered under the Welfare Food Scheme represents about 5 per cent. of all doorstep deliveries. The Department of Health has conducted a major consultation exercise on its proposals, the results of which have now been published.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/4">The reforms were proposed following medical advice that mothers and children required access to a broader range of foods than had been available under the scheme.</p>

This is available at <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2002/construct.htm">www.hse.gov.uk/press/2002/construct.htm</a>. It aims to:</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/4" class="indent">encourage greater commitment to achieving improved health and safety performance targets from all those in the construction procurement and supply chain;</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/5" class="indent">encourage better communication and co-operation between all those involved in delivering a safe and healthy work environment; and</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/6" class="indent">promote the development of a competent workforce at all levels.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/7">Their priorities for the year are:</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/8" class="indent">Reducing the incidence of cement dermatitis</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/9" class="indent">Reversing the increased incidence of hand arm vibration syndrome</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/10" class="indent">Reducing exposure to noise</p>

	<p pid=".321W.2/12" class="indent">Workplace transport</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/13" class="indent">Work at height</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/14" class="indent">Slips, trips and falls</p>

	<p pid=".323W.11/1">The purpose of the Renewables Obligation is to secure a target level of our electricity supply from renewable energy. The obligation for each electricity supplier is calculated by applying a percentage to that electricity supplier's total electricity sales to customers in England and Wales during each Obligation period. The same arrangement applies in Scotland under their corresponding Obligation. Total electricity sales includes electricity from all sources, including both CHP and renewables, so as to avoid market distortions. However, electricity sold under licence exempt arrangements, including CHP, is not subject to the Obligation.</p>

The report is expected within a month and will help me to identify the high priority library projects that are most likely to attract private sector interest and therefore benefit from the Strategic Investment Programme. Within this programme &pound;20 million has been identified for potential library and other information resources projects.</p>

(104752)</p>
	<p pid=".336W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates for council taxes and income are based on the analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2000&ndash;01&quot; produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on April 19th 2002 and in Economic Trends in the May 2002 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Family Expenditure Survey. Sample sizes for each country are only sufficient to allow a break down to be given by quintiles of income distribution and not by decile as given for Great Britain in the answer to your previous question.</p>
	<p pid=".336W.2/5" class="indent">The following table shows the estimated gross and net council tax for all households in Great Britain and <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Scotland and <i>(c)</i> Wales, for each income quintile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less benefits and discounts. The table also shows the equivalised disposable income quintile point boundaries, which have been calculated separately for Great Britain and each country. For example, the 1st quintile point for each country is the income below which one fifth of households in that country lie.</p>
	<p pid=".336W.2/6" class="indent">Council tax benefit is available to low income households to help them meet their local tax liability. The Family Expenditure Survey collects data on the amount of council tax benefit received by households who take up their entitlement. Where a household reports taking up their council tax benefit entitlement, this has been deducted from the council tax liability to produce the net figures.</p>

Guidance on good practice in all aspects of specials' local recruitment, management and deployment is being produced by the Home Office with the Association of Chief Police Officers, and will be published on this site.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.6/20">Additionally, we have introduced amendments to the Special Constabulary Regulations to allow police authorities to submit schemes, which they have agreed with the chief constable, for the payment of special constables. Such schemes will require the approval of the Secretary of State. Running a number of trial schemes will help establish to what extent payments to specials have a positive effect on their recruitment and retention and the number of hours they are able to offer their force. As announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-24">24 March</phrase>, the first such scheme to be authorised is in Workington in Cumbria.</p>

	<p pid=".358W.3/1">The UK's bilateral relationship with Cuba is one of constructive engagement. HMG co-operates with Cuba in a number of areas including the fight against drug trafficking, HIV/AIDS, child protection and in science and sport. We share the EU goal of encouraging a process of transition to a pluralist democracy with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba. With our EU partners, we take every opportunity to make clear our concerns about human rights and the one-party system in Cuba. We have raised the recent arrests of dissidents with the Cuban authorities.</p>

Places are offered on a first come, first served basis, which means the number of users varies each year.</p>

	<p pid=".361W.0/1">We continue to make clear our deep concerns about the treatment of all civilians in the Occupied Territories by the Israeli authorities. I raised my concerns about civilian deaths in the Occupied Territories, including that of Rachel Corrie, in a meeting with the Israeli Ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March</phrase>. The indiscriminate use of force by the Israel Defence Forces only fuels the cycle of violence and makes a comprehensive settlement harder to reach. We have always recognised Israel's right to take steps to provide security for its citizens, but these actions must fall within the parameters of international law.</p>

	<p pid=".364W.2/1">Sport's governing bodies are essential to the Government's plans to increase levels of sporting participation.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/2">(i) &pound;40 million in new Lottery funding has recently been made available to national governing bodies to improve their mechanisms for delivering improvements in participation levels. In addition, the Government has taken steps to assist governing-body affiliated, and other, Community Amateur Sports Clubs in offering opportunities for people of all ages to participate in healthy recreation. DCMS worked closely with the Charity Commission on the revised guidance issued in March 2002, which will make many more local clubs are eligible for the financial benefits of charitable status;</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/3">(ii) The Government have worked closely with the Football Association, the Rugby Football Union, the Lawn Tennis Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board increase participation among Asian people. I fully support the efforts of these governing bodies in this area, which include FA projects in Leicester and elsewhere, the RFU's social inclusion programmes including its work at the Islamic High School for Girls in Central Manchester, the LTA's inner city tennis projects and the ECB's Racial Equality Intermediate Level Award-approved coaching projects;</p>
	<p pid=".364W.2/4">(iii) all four of these governing bodies run sporting access schemes for children in inner urban areas, which complement Sport England's Sport Action Zones initiative in some of the most socially and economically deprived areas of the country. The Government will be investing &pound;60 million over the three years from 2003&ndash;04 through the Community Clubs Investment Programme, the focus of which will be on increasing participation levels in deprived areas and among disadvantaged groups. The Government have funded additional and complementary sporting initiatives in deprived areas through the Positive Futures and Splash projects.</p>

DCMS, in partnership with Sport England is developing an England-wide database of sports facilities, which will enable more strategic Government investment in those areas and facilities that are most important.</p>

As part of its consistent support for the Hague Conference, the Government has encouraged the rapid and recent world-wide expansion of the Conference's membership; in particular, it routinely endorses applications to join from individual countries. In 2000 my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor wrote to the Ministers of Justice in South Africa, New Zealand and India to advocate membership of the conference; the first two of these countries have subsequently joined.

When a scheme has changed status, the previous status of the scheme is not recorded on the registry. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify OPRA of any status change so the data for the current year are particularly provisional.

	<p pid=".370W.5/1">The English House Condition Survey of 2001 shows that between 1996 and 2001 the number of households with at least one person over age 60 in fuel poverty, after taking all income into account, fell by over 50 per cent. The figures fell from just over two million to around 940,000.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/2">This change is due to a number of measures introduced by this Government including changes in income, lower fuel prices and installation of energy efficiency measures.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/3">The minimum income guarantee, introduced in April 1999, has boosted the income of the poorest pensioners and means that, from April, no single pensioner will need to live on less than &pound;102.10 a week (&pound;155.80 for couples). In 2003&ndash;04, the Government will spend an extra &pound;7.5 billion a year on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes &pound;3.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners&mdash;almost six times more than an earnings-link in the basic state pension since 1998 would have given them.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/4">Most people aged 60 and over are entitled to a winter fuel payment of up to &pound;200. More than 11 million people aged 60 and over receive payments, totalling &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/5">Overall, prices for all fuel and light for domestic customers fell by 13 per cent in real terms between 1997 and 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".373W.3/1">Information on the number of schoolchildren with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not collected centrally. From January 2004 the Department will be collecting data on SEN by type of need. This will include children with Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties, but will not contain a separate category for ADHD.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.3/2">All schools and local education authorities have statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN, which includes those pupils with behavioural difficulties and ADHD. The SEN Code of Practice provides practical advice to schools and Early Years settings to help them carry out these duties. It recommends a graduated, school-based approach to meet the needs of children with SEN, and specifically offers a range of interventions for schools to use in supporting pupils who are hyperactive and lack concentration.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.3/3">Children with ADHD normally receive help and support from within the spectrum of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) which range from primary care, including school and social services interventions, to specialist and inpatient services. Child and adolescent psychiatrists, and increasingly paediatricians, provide specialist diagnostic and treatment services for children with ADHD, supported by members of multidisciplinary teams. The joint DfES/DH good practice guidance for schools &quot;Supporting Pupils With Medical Needs&quot; gives advice to schools and LEAs on supporting pupils with medical needs, including those who may be prescribed medication for ADHD.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.2/1">We do not hold complete information in the form requested. However, in 1997&ndash;98 the Government introduced New Deal for Schools (NDS) as a new additional programme targeted specifically at addressing the backlog of urgent repairs in school buildings that had built up after eighteen years of under-funding under the previous administration. This programme was bid based and was in addition to other capital funds made available to Portsmouth local education authority. NDS ran through four phases from 1997- 98 to 2000- 01. Table A shows the schools in the Portsmouth area which benefited from investment through the original NDS programme. From 2001- 02 most capital funding available for building improvements in schools has been allocated to local authorities and schools by needs-related formulae. It is for local authorities and schools to decide how their capital allocations are invested and prioritised between projects, in line with their local asset management planning. Also, from 2000&ndash;01 every school has received direct capital allocations to address their highest priorities. In addition, each year authorities have been able to bid for Basic Need funding for the provision of new pupil places. Table B shows all capital funding for school buildings allocated to Portsmouth LEA (including voluntary aided schools) since 1998&ndash;99. Looking to the future, I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-26">26 February</phrase> proposals for a new approach to capital investment in a paper, &quot;Building schools for the future&quot;. This will be a programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that secondary education in every part of England has facilities of 21st century standard within 10 to 15 years from 2005&ndash;06, subject to future public spending decisions. We will also aim to provide substantial investment in primary school buildings.</p>

	<p pid=".393W.2/1">Details of food sampling checks by local authorities are not recorded in the form requested by the hon. Member. It is not possible to identify separately those samples taken for labelling purposes for all of the last ten years. Such information that is available for all sampling activity is shown in the tables.</p>
	<p pid=".393W.2/2">The responsibility for enforcing the food labelling regulations, made under the Food Safety Act 1990, rests with local authorities. Figures for samples taken for this purpose are shown in table 1.</p>
	<p pid=".393W.2/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) receives annual returns from local authorities, under the European Union's Official Controls Directive, EEC/89/397, for all food sampling activity, not just for labelling checks. Before 2001, details of the reasons why samples were found to be unsatisfactory are not readily available. However, in 2001, under the new Framework Agreement on local authority food law enforcement, implemented by the FSA with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January</phrase> that year, 17 per cent. (27,280 samples) of the 163,993 official and informal samples taken were found to be unsatisfactory. Of these unsatisfactory samples, 31 per cent. (8,418) were found to be unsatisfactory with regard to labelling and presentation, and 24 per cent. (6,551) for composition.</p>
	<p pid=".393W.2/4">Official samples are those taken in the course of an official inspection procedure under the Food Safety Act 1990, where the results can be used in legal proceedings if appropriate. Informal samples are taken during other visits, such as for monitoring or screening.</p>
	<p pid=".393W.2/5">Over the last ten years, the FSA and its predecessor bodies have published the results of a number of surveys aimed at identifying problems with the labelling of food products, and carried out under its Food Authenticity Programme. These surveys have covered 6,523 samples, as shown in table 2.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.2/2">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) will take the lead role in managing the consequences of any actual incident of food contamination. The FSA already undertakes such work in respect of the several hundred relatively minor accidental and adventitious environmental food contamination incidents that occur each year, ensuring that contaminated food does not reach the public. The FSA regularly exercises its response to major incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.2/3">With the agreement of other Departments, the FSA reminded the food industry in November 2002 of the importance of maintaining vigilance against potential malicious attacks on the food supply. This was a general reminder rather than a response to any new intelligence suggesting a specific threat. This advice remains current.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.5/1">The Food Standards Agency has lead responsibility for this proposal on official feed and food controls. I am advised by the FSA that the negotiations on it are due to begin shortly. The FSA will press for provisions that ensure the frequency of testing of foods of non-animal origin is risk-based and proportionate. In effect, this would mean spot checks and random analytical testing for 'low risk' products but increased checks and analytical testing, up to a level of 100 per cent. (depending on the nature of the risk), for foods included in the list of 'high risk' products that is envisaged under the proposal. The commodities included in this list and the required level of testing will not be static over time but rather will vary depending on identification of new risks and the control of others. Currently, the European Commission publish decisions regarding those commodities from specified countries that should be subject to 100 per cent. documentary and analytical checks. This includes aflatoxins in various nuts and dried fruits from certain countries. It is understood that such products would be included in the 'high risk' list under the proposal and would require 100 per cent. testing.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.5/2">Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be scanned.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.5/3">Where an MRI scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two months wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which will be in place for all cancers by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.5/4">To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners. The New Opportunities Fund has provided funding for 57 MRI scanners and the NHS Cancer Plan has provided funding for a further 50 MRI and 50 computed tomography (CT) scanners through central purchasing programmes by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.6/1">Primary care trusts are responsible for improving the health of their local population. Planning is now undertaken at a local level with primary care trusts leading and agreeing how targets will be met within the three year planning framework. The national health service is being asked to concentrate its planning activity against the priorities in the Priorities and Planning Framework 2003&ndash;06. This has resulted in the majority of current planning requirements being replaced by a single three year local delivery plan. There will be routine monitoring of national standards to ensure they continue to be met. Inspection programmes for both health and social care are well established which generate independent performance ratings. These are aligned to the priorities and planning framework and based on the primary care trust's performance against a number of key targets and a wider set of balanced scorecard indicators.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/2">In September 2001 primary care trusts' performance was assessed for the first time against a range of suitable indicators but they were not given an overall star rating.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/3">In December 2002 proposed key targets and performance indicators for primary care trusts for inclusion within 2002&ndash;03 performance ratings were announced. This year will be the first time that full performance ratings have been given to primary care trusts. The final indicator lists for primary care trusts will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/4">The intention is to announce the 2003&ndash;04 key targets and performance indicators for all NHS organisations as soon as possible so they know for the start of the performance year in question the basis of the future rating.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.2/1">Since it was authorised in 1990 the safety of paroxetine (Seroxat) has been closely monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Government's independent expert advisory committee, Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The CSM has considered the question of suicidal behaviour in association with Seroxat on a number of ccasions and carefully assessed any new data. The CSM has advised that there is insufficient evidence to confirm a causal relationship between Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicidal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.2/2">The CSM has advised that it is general clinical experience that patients taking any antidepressant may develop an increase in suicidal behaviour in the first few weeks of treatment. Product information for prescribes and patients for all SSRIs has been amended to include warnings that suicidal behaviour may increase in the early stages of treatment as with any antidepressant. In September 2000, an article was published in the drug safety bulletin, Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance, which is distributed to all doctors and pharmacists.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.2/3">An expert working group on the safety of SSRIs has been set up by the CSM to review the current available evidence relating to the safety of SSRIs, including paroxetine, particularly in relation to suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The expert working group will report its findings to CSM in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.2/4">Since 1997, the MCA has received a range of representations, including parliamentary questions, letters from hon. and right hon. Members, patients and health care professionals expressing concerns about the safety of paroxetine (Seroxat), none of which have been from coroners.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.2/5">The MCA and the CSM receive reports of suspected adverse drug reactions to medicinal products via the yellow card scheme. Since marketing authorisation was granted in 1990, the MCA and CSM have received 8,702 such reports for paroxetine (Seroxat). One of these reports has been received from a coroner. In addition the MCA has written to the coroner for Brecon to obtain further details of a recently publicised case.</p>

	<p pid=".406W.2/1">There is no definition of &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; in the National Assistance Act 1948 and it should be given its ordinary and natural meaning subject to any interpretation by the courts. The concept of ordinary residence involves questions of fact and degree. In determining ordinary residence, factors such as time, intention and continuity&mdash;each of which may be given different weight according to the context&mdash;have to be taken into account. Local Authority Circular LAC(93)7 on &quot;Ordinary Residence&quot; gives full details.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.2/2">Generally, if a council places an individual in a care home in the area of another council under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948, the first council has continuing responsibility to fund and care manage the individual's stay in residential care. This is because the individual is regarded as remaining ordinarily resident in the &quot;placing&quot; authority's area, by virtue of section 24(5) of the 1948 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.2/3">Residents who are placed in care homes by councils are financially supported when their income and assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of care home fees. The amounts that supported residents should contribute to these fees are governed by the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992. Once the resident's contribution has been determined, the council should make its contribution sufficient to meet the costs of care as set out in the resident's care plan and contract between the council and care home. If the care home's fees are higher than the council would normally expect to pay, third parties such as relatives may make up the difference.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.2/4">Whether a supported resident is placed by a council in its own area, or the area of another council, the placing council would be acting outside its statutory duties if it attempted to reduce its contribution to care costs in situations where supported residents' income and assets and assessed needs remain unchanged. When the resident's financial situation or needs change, a council may legitimately reduce or remove its funding. For example, a supported resident who acquires extra income and assets during his stay in residential care may lose entitlement to council funding. A council may reduce its funding when, following a re-assessment of needs, it agrees with a resident that some aspect of care within the care home may be reduced. In such circumstances, the resident should continue to pay their assessed contribution and the council makes up the difference with regard to the lower care home fee.</p>
