	<p pid="b.1017W.6/1">The visit of the Cabinet to Birmingham was preceded by several ministerial visits across the region; a public engagement event with approximately 250 people was followed by a formal Cabinet meeting and an economic event including business leaders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.6/2">The cost of the public engagement event, the Cabinet meeting and the economic events in Birmingham was &pound;61,920, excluding VAT. There are no separate figures for the Cabinet event, and the costs for all the events have been taken together. The figure includes the cost of hiring the venue, catering, associated security and search equipment, delegate management and rail travel for both staff and Ministers. In addition, Departments and agencies will have incurred costs in terms of staff time and other support. The cost of any security provided by the police is a matter for the relevant police force.</p>

	<p pid="b.1023W.3/3">The CITES regulations are aimed at the trade of wildlife and thus control the import of exotic wildlife into and out of the EU. The CITES management authority, and the UK Border Agency work closely with the national wildlife crime unit to ensure that the enforcement and compliance aspects of the control in trade come up to the highest possible standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.3/4">DEFRA, with other regulatory authorities and non-government organisations, are developing a communications strategy aimed at raising awareness of CITES controls among the public, businesses and other relevant organisations. Animal Health representatives regularly attend trade shows and produce literature advising on the CITES controls and with the aim of reducing the illegal imports of endangered species. The UK Border Agency is responsible for enforcing CITES import and export controls at the UK frontier. Profiling and targeting activities are also carried out by them in order to combat illegal imports.</p>

	<p pid="b.1023W.7/1">Information about the role of the SCC is communicated through a number of means. Joint service publication 831 Service Complaints (Redress of Individual Grievance) sets out the policy and process for making and handling service complaints, and includes a chapter on the role of the SCC. This is available on the defence intranet and <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a> to all serving personnel. A booklet covering the main points of the complaints process, with a leaflet explaining the role of the SCC has been issued for distribution to all Service establishments. A team profile is under development on the defence intranet to make information relating to service complaints available electronically. This profile will also provide a link to the SCC's website. The SCC has visited establishments of all three services, and continues to do so regularly, to meet serving personnel and the chain of command to raise awareness of her post.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/2">The three services have different approaches to providing information to recruits about how to make complaints in confidence:</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/3" class="italic"> Navy</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/4">Within phase 1 training Royal Navy and Royal Marine rating and other ranks recruits at each establishment are briefed on both equality and diversity related complaints and Service complaints generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/5" class="italic"> Army</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/6">All recruits and trainees receive briefings that inform them of the function of the complaints procedures and the various channels which are available to raise a complaint. These include: the chain of command, Women's Royal Voluntary Service, the padre, the unit welfare officer, a medical officer and the confidential support line.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/7">This is currently in the process of being reinforced by the inclusion of detail covering the role of the SCC in the &quot;Army Recruiting and Training Division Code of Conduct and Behaviour for Recruits,&quot; leaflet and the recruiting group publication &quot;A Guide for Guardians and Parents&quot;. With the commissioner's agreement, a paragraph outlining her role will be included in letters sent to parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/8" class="italic"> RAF</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/9">There are two training establishments for the RAF, Cranwell and Halton.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/10">At RAF Cranwell, the officer and aircrew cadet training unit is responsible for conducting the initial training of all officers and non-commissioned aircrew. Since January 2008, all cadets at RAF Cranwell have been briefed during their first week of training on the role and contact details of the SCC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.7/11">At RAF Halton, comprehensive measures are in place to ensure that recruits are aware of the complaints procedures. These include two 45 minute briefings on the RAF's equality and diversity policy, and the distribution of a booklet entitled &quot;Combating Bullying and Harassment in the Royal Air Force&quot; to all recruits. The issue is also addressed in the station commander's supervisory care directive, which is mandatory reading by all instructors at RAF Halton and is available to all recruits.</p>

No formal evaluation of this policy was conducted in 2007. However the Army considers this to be a highly effective way of helping to identify particularly vulnerable recruits during the recruiting process and at the very start of basic training. As a result the Army has been able to ensure that recruits have the appropriate support throughout their time in the Army training system.

	<p pid="b.1027W.5/1">Following the extremely heavy rainfall on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July 2007</phrase>, immediate action was taken by AWE plc., with the agreement of MOD, to prevent any reoccurrence of the flooding. These measures proved effective when further extreme weather conditions were subsequently experienced across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.5/2">AWE prepared a comprehensive review, learn and improve (RLI) assessment report following the flooding to ensure the continued safety of both sites. The MOD endorsed this report, and its recommendations, many of which were under way or implemented prior to its publication. The nuclear installations inspectorate has remained content that nuclear site licence requirements have been met both during and subsequent to the periods of exceptional rainfall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.5/3">The cost of remediation, to the extent that it is not covered by commercial insurance, is still the subject of commercial discussions between the MOD and AWE plc.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.5/4">The disruption caused by the flooding had no adverse effect on the UK deterrent programme, and both Aldermaston and Burghfield sites maintained the capability safely to support the deterrent. Knowledge gained from the events following the flooding has been taken into account in taking forward the programme of investment under way at AWE announced in July 2005, which will ensure that this capability is sustained into the future. Specifically, flood prevention measures continue to be included in designs for replacement facilities and the potential risk from flooding forms a key element of planning applications to the local planning authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1039W.8/1">Stations are awarded Secure Station status for a two-year period once they have met the required scheme accreditation standards on station design, station management, crime management and passenger perceptions. After this two-year period, stations can seek reaccreditation under the scheme. The vast majority of accredited stations seek and obtain re-accreditation.</p>

Six such stations have achieved full accreditation in this way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044W.0/1">The bail accommodation and support service provided by ClearSprings Ltd under contract to the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), to which I take these questions to refer, does not provide hostels. It provides people on bail and on home detention curfew with private, rented accommodation in small houses and flats with up to five people sharing. It is not our practice to disclose the addresses as these are the private homes of those provided with the accommodation. If an address does become public ClearSprings and NOMS will consider the risks to the occupants and to the public, consulting the police and other agencies as appropriate, and take such action as is considered appropriate. Local authorities are consulted by ClearSprings about the locations of properties. The Department has not issued guidance to local authorities about the disclosure of addresses. However, in its communication with local authorities in July 2008, ClearSprings asked that they respect the private nature of the houses and share address information on a 'need to know' basis only.</p>

	<p pid="b.1048W.2/1">There are two statistical counts of persistent offenders used in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1048W.2/2">The first count is of persistent young offenders (PYOs). A PYO is a young person aged 10 to 17 who has been found guilty of recordable offences on three or more separate occasions, and within three years of the last of these is arrested by the police for a further recordable offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1048W.2/3">During the three-month period from April to June 2008, there were 7,389 criminal court cases across England and Wales in which PYOs were found guilty and sentenced. Of these, 292 were in Lancashire. Within east Lancashire, there were 59 and 48 cases respectively in the &quot;eastern&quot; and &quot;Pennine&quot; base control unit (BCU) police areas during the same period. Further information on PYOs can be found on the Ministry of Justice website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1048W.2/4">The second is for prolific and other priority offenders (PPOs). The PPO programme tackles a small hard-core of offenders (not confined to any age group) who commit a disproportionate amount of crime, and cause disproportionate damage to their communities. It is a crime-reduction programme with a reducing re-offending focus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1048W.2/5">Data from the PPO scheme performance framework indicated that at the end of March 2008 there were a total of 11,296 PPOs being managed in England and Wales, of whom 305 were in Lancashire. In the East Lancashire area (encompassing for this purpose the local authorities of Burnley, Hyndburn and Pendle) there were 99 offenders being managed as PPOs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-29b.229941.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-29b.1050W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="1050W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/text/81029w0008.htm#08102958001530">
	<p pid="b.1050W.2/1">Sentencing is an independent function and judges and magistrates are responsible for making decisions in individual cases, which are governed by the statutory framework laid down by Parliament. Responsibility for issuing sentencing guidelines rests with the Sentencing Guidelines Council, not the Government. The council was set up under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and is an independent body chaired by the Lord Chief Justice. The Council's guide for sentencers and practitioners on dangerous offenders makes it clear that if the conditions for a hospital order are satisfied, the court may make such an order, even if the criteria for passing a sentence of imprisonment (or custody) for life, imprisonment (or detention) for public protection or an extended sentence are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050W.2/2">In March 2008, the Department issued guidance to the courts on the sentencing options available for mentally disordered offenders following the changes made to the Mental Health Act 1983 by the Mental Health Act 2007. The 2007 Act reflects the continuation of the Government's policy that mentally disordered people who commit offences should receive specialist mental health treatment rather than being punished, wherever that can safely be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="b.1056W.0/1">Since 2005, requesters have complained twice to the Information Commissioner about the Department's handling of applications for information about abortions under Freedom of Information legislation; one in 2005 and one in 2006. In the first case, the Information Commissioner decided that the Department should release information and a copy of the information was released to the applicant and has already been placed in the Library. In the second case, the Information Commissioner decided in July 2008 that the Department should release the information. After careful consideration and taking into account all the circumstances in both cases, the Department has lodged grounds for appeal with the Information Tribunal and is currently undertaking preparatory work. The Information Commissioner has not received similar complaints about the Department's refusal of requests on contraception, reproductive health issues and euthanasia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.0/2">Legal advice in both cases is provided to the Department by DH Legal Services, which is part of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) legal group. DH Legal Services provides a full range of legal services to the Department including arranging representation in court. No external consultants were employed in either case. No consultants or law firms were instructed in relation to these cases, although DH Legal Services sought advice from Counsel in relation to some matters. The costs associated with these two cases have amounted to &pound;4,400.00 to date. The Department is not expecting the outstanding appeal from the 2006 case to be heard in the current calendar year and therefore the law firm representing the Department is yet to be identified.</p>

The figures in the study are based on a detailed survey of the services and resources needed to treat infections at that time. This major piece of work took several years to complete. The study is still the best estimate of total resource required for each health care acquired infection and current costs can be calculated by applying standard deflators. It will be possible to provide figures for 2007-08 when the relevant deflator is available. When considering cost-per-case, we consider this indicator to be more useful than one that apportions costs across all in-patient episodes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1068W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned specific research on medical interventions to prevent genital warts. The Department did however commission the Health Protection Agency (HPA) to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the human papillomavirus vaccines 'Economic evaluation of human papillomavirus vaccination in the United Kingdom', a copy of which has been placed in the Library. An element of this was to estimate the cost of treating a patient for anogenital warts, the HPA estimate this at &pound;134 (2006 prices).</p>
	<p pid="b.1068W.2/2">Funding to support sexual health services is not allocated separately to primary care trusts (PCTs) but is contained within the mainstream revenue allocations made to PCTs. It is the responsibility of PCTs to commission the health services they need to meet the health requirements of the local populations they serve. Genital warts can be diagnosed and treated in a variety of settings but currently data are only collected from genito-urinary medicine clinics, so it is therefore not possible to accurately forecast how much PCTs spent on treating warts in the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="b.1069W.12/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) uses non-consolidated, non-pensionable bonuses to encourage high performance. We pay annual bonuses to staff in the delegated grades (i.e. all except senior managers) based on appraisal evidence of annual performance. The highest rating and bonus award is given only where performance has significantly exceeded challenging objectives and may have radically transformed delivery of policy and/or services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.12/2">We have not yet determined pay or bonus awards for the delegated grades for performance in 2007-08. These will depend on the outcome of negotiations on a new pay settlement for staff in the delegated grades for the period 2008-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.12/3">Variable pay (bonus) arrangements for staff in the Senior Management Structure/Senior Civil Service (SMS/SCS) of the FCO follow a framework set centrally for Whitehall departments by the Cabinet Office. We use variable pay for SMS/SCS staff to reward excellent individual performance and achievement during the year. Variable pay decisions are based on a judgement by pay committees of what an individual has achieved in comparison with peers. Those who have delivered the best results, and shown real leadership in doing so, receive the biggest bonuses. Those who have delivered least receive nothing. Departments are authorised to spend a sum equivalent to 8.6 per cent. of their SMS/SCS pay budget on bonuses to reward performance in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1069W.12/4">The FCO and FCO Services, a trading fund of the FCO, have so far spent &pound;2,264,250 on 266 bonus payments to SMS/SCS staff for performance in 2007-08. The average size of individual bonuses has been &pound;8,512. 30.5 per cent. of staff have not received a bonus in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1071W.2/1">The UK monitors the Nuba mountains and the rest of the &quot;transitional areas&quot; (the Blue Nile, Abeyi and the other parts of the Southern Kordofan) through the UN Mission in Sudan and the Security Working Group of the Assessment and Evaluation Commission which we chair.</p>
	<p pid="b.1071W.2/2">We remain concerned about the need to promote peace and reduce the potential for conflict in the Nuba mountains. The UK led a security assessment of the transitional areas, including the Nuba mountains, earlier this year and has established a steering group to address key stability priorities. In 2009-10 we will spend up to &pound;4 million on community security and peace-building in southern Sudan, with much of this money going to the transitional areas.</p>

Ministers also encourage Members of both Houses to write directly to agency chief executives, or appropriate senior managers in respect of non-agency businesses, on matters for which they have day to day responsibility.

	<p pid="b.1077W.6/1">It is now clear that some records relating to the terms of the transfer of staff from the then Skills Training Agency to TICC Ltd do still exist and are currently held by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. They confirm that at the time TICC Ltd went into liquidation 48 civil servants were made redundant and received ex gratia compensation payments from public funds. The payments were based on the settlement each would have received had they been made redundant by the Skills Training Agency at the time of the sale, less any statutory redundancy pay to which they were entitled.</p>

	<p pid="b.1078W.3/2">The Government have published plans to tackle alcohol related crime. The most recent of these include the Youth alcohol action plan which was published in June 2008 and the written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-04">4 March 2008</phrase> in response to the review of the Licensing Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078W.3/3">The written ministerial statement set out the Government's plan to amend legislation and to ensure that current powers to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder are being fully utilised. The Youth Alcohol Action Plan announced the Government's intention to introduce a tiered approach to address public drinking by young people. This includes greater use of acceptable behaviour contracts and antisocial behaviour orders for those that repeatedly drink in public places, coupled with greater use of parenting contracts and orders to ensure that parents take responsibility for their child's actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078W.3/4">In addition, the national alcohol strategy 'Safe.Sensible.Social' published in June 2007 set out the overarching plans to tackle alcohol related problems, one of those being alcohol related crime. Further details of the national alcohol strategy can be accessed at:</p>

However, following a recommendation of the independent Smith review of the Home Office crime statistics, the British Crime Survey is being extended to include those aged under 16 years from 2009. This will assist in providing a clearer understanding of youth victimisation. We know that young people are more likely to be victims of other young people, and we are committed to driving down levels of youth victimisation. Through the implementation of the Youth Crime Action Plan, we will introduce a new national objective to substantially reduce the number of young victims by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="b.1082W.14/1">To provide a response across the whole of the Home Office area of business would be disproportionate to costs. However, for passports, the Identity and Passport Service despatched passports by Royal Mail first class post until February 2004. Since then new passports have been despatched by Secure Delivery, a secure courier service provided by Secure Mail Services, a private contractor. Customers can also opt for the return of their supporting documents by Secure Delivery on payment of a fee of &pound;3.00.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.14/2">This change was due to the high numbers of passports lost within the Royal Mail. In 2003, the last year of the Royal Mail arrangements, 3,593 passports were recorded as lost in the delivery process. Following the introduction of secure delivery, losses have been around 720 in the last two years; a reduction of over 80 per cent. The recent introduction of handheld GPS technology for couriers should significantly reduce this figure further.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-29b.228574.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-10-29b.1085W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" colnum="1085W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081029/text/81029w0016.htm#08102962001882">
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/1">The Government are committed to reducing the harms caused by illegal drugs, including drug-related crime. Most recently the Government have committed through public service agreement (PSA) 25 to reduce the harm caused by alcohol and drugs. Within this PSA three indicators relate to drugs; one of which is a commitment to reduce the rate of drug-related offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/2">Recent assessment of effectiveness has shown that good progress has been made in combating drug related crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/3">The previous public service agreement relating to drugs (PSA 4) committed the Government to reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs; a key measure of effectiveness in relation to this PSA is assessed by the Drug Harm Index, the single largest element of which is drug related crime. Latest figures show that since 2002 the Drug Harm Index has fallen by 28.4 per cent., representing a substantial fall in drug related crime types. As there is some delay in the availability of data which contribute to this measure, we continue to gather performance data relating to the previous PSA using the Drug Harm Index.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/4">Effectiveness in relation to PSA 4 is also assessed through monitoring the numbers of drug users entering treatment through the Criminal Justice System. The Government's target to increase the number of drug misusers entering drug treatment through the Criminal Justice System to 1,000 per week was met two months early in January 2008 and we are currently consistently achieving over 4,000 entering treatment each month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/5">The Government's Drug Interventions programme (DIP) was introduced in 2003 and is central in delivering drug misusers into treatment via the criminal justice system. Recent research on DIP found that around half of offenders who came into contact with DIP had 79 per cent. lower levels of offending in the six months after their contact with the programme. The overall volume of offending for the entire cohort was 26 per cent. lower.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/6">Latest published figures on recorded crime show that recorded acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug-related crime makes a significant contribution&mdash;has fallen by 28 per cent. since 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/7">The Home Office also carries out a broad programme of scientific research to assess the effectiveness of individual interventions in relation to drugs. Home Office research is regularly published on the Home Office website. Much of the relevant evidence is summarised in Appendix 5 of the Government's new Drug Strategy, published in February 2008&mdash;&quot;Drugs: protecting families and communities&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/publicationsearch/drugstrategy/drugstrategy2008?view=Binary">http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/publicationsearch/drugstrategy/drugstrategy2008?view=Binary</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/9">The new strategy underpins action to achieve Government commitments on drug related crime. The strategy sets out a comprehensive and co-ordinated framework, which builds on the significant successes of the last strategy, while placing a new focus on meeting the needs of families and communities, and on achieving better treatment outcomes for individuals who have developed drug misuse problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1085W.2/10">The Government are committed to reducing drug-related crime and will continue to monitor this through the new PSAs and through research.</p>

The most recent estimate of the United Kingdom population published by the Office for National Statistics is that, at mid-2007, it was 60,975,000. Comparing these two figures gives a figure of 7.39 per cent. of the United Kingdom population having a record on the NDNAD.

	<p pid="b.1089W.5/1">Extradition casework in England and Wales is carried out by the Home Office's Judicial Cooperation Unit (JCU) and by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA). The Home Office administers extradition between England and Wales and non-EU states. Extradition between England and Wales and EU states (and Gibraltar) is effected by the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and is administered by SOCA. The EAW has been in operation in the UK since <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.5/2">SOCA's EAW records show that four individuals have been extradited to the UK for human trafficking offences and one for the facilitation of illegal immigration. In 2007, one UK citizen was extradited from the UK for human trafficking offences and one for human smuggling and forgery offences; and there were two further extraditions in that year from the UK for human trafficking offences where the nationality of the extraditees is not known.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.5/3">The Home Office has statistics for its extraditions only since 1998. These show that there have been no non-EAW extraditions to or from England and Wales for the offence of human trafficking or people smuggling in that period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1091W.8/1">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) do not use the Royal Mail for the delivery of British passports. New passports are returned to customers via a secure courier service, provided by Secure Mail Services. Mandatory customer signatures are required for around four per cent., of deliveries in areas of high risk. In all other cases, couriers are asked to obtain a signature where a customer is available. Currently this happens for around 45 per cent., of deliveries in non high risk areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1091W.8/2">Customer's supporting documents are returned by Royal Mail second class post unless a valid British passport is to be returned, when Secure Delivery is used. IPS strongly recommends that customers choose Secure Delivery for the return of their documents at a cost of &pound;3.00, and advises customers that IPS will not be liable for the loss of any documents despatched by second class post.</p>

	<p pid="b.1091W.8/4">The UK Border Agency does not send visas to addresses in the UK and do not keep records of any documents that have been lost in the post overseas. Such information could be obtained only by examining individual visa applications and therefore at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1103W.2/1">As part of Government's study looking at the feasibility of a tidal power scheme in the Severn estuary DTZ in collaboration with MDS Transmodal and Arthur D. Little have been commissioned to undertake an initial assessment of the potential economic impact of a tidal power scheme on the Welsh and South West of England economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.2/2">Information has separately been sought from all those ports in the South West and Wales likely to be directly impacted by a tidal power scheme in the estuary. Replies have been received from; Bristol Port Co., Milford Haven Port Authority, Gloucester Harbour Trustees, Environment Agency (Lydney Harbour), Neath Harbour Commissioners, Associated British Ports, Sharpness Dock and British Waterways (Sharpness).</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.2/3">In addition, as an early part of the strategic environmental assessment process, a Call for Information was issued in May 2008. This invited interested parties to submit comments or information that could contribute to the assessment. This yielded responses from the Ports Industry, Shooting and Angling bodies, and Marine Aggregates Producers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.2/4">Business representatives also participate in our various feasibility study stakeholder groups. The feasibility study regional forum meetings are for representatives from local government and representatives of the local environmental and business community. Membership includes representatives from the South West Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses and Confederation of British Industry in the South West and Wales.The Bristol Port Company, the Association of British Ports, West of England Strategic Economic Partnership, the Crown Estate, the Institute of Directors and GWE Business West are also members. The Steering Group for the Strategic Environmental Assessment&mdash;a major part of the feasibility study&mdash;includes a business representative and also representatives of the ports. Regional business issues are also raised through MPs attending the feasibility study parliamentary forum.</p>

	<p pid="b.1105W.0/2">The package of support measures we have put in place, includes the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's (EPSRC) Supergen Marine programme, Carbon Trust funding, research funding from the Technology Strategy Board and the Energy Technologies Institute.</p>

	<p pid="b.1111W.2/1">Heritage plays a significant role in plans for the Olympic and Paralympic games and the Olympic legacy. As the Government's adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage has had a direct involvement in the Olympics construction programme through its statutory responsibilities in planning and archaeology. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), the Government's statutory adviser on architecture and the built environment, is also a key player in the promotion of well designed, sustainable facilities that make best use of existing built assets where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1111W.2/2">As part of the build process for the Olympic Park, the waterways adjacent to and through it are being repaired and renovated. River wells are being repaired and soft river edges, reseeded with indigenous plants, are being re-established.</p>
	<p pid="b.1111W.2/3">All archaeological finds have been recorded and the artefacts are being held by the Museum of London for public viewing. The Olympic Programme is also financing two architectural reports on the history of the Olympic Park which will cover a thousand years of its history, as well as giving a more recent picture of how it has changed in modern times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1111W.2/4">The Cultural Olympiad provides an opportunity for all sorts of cultural organisations to engage in Olympic legacy. The heritage sector has already chosen to become involved, and many organisations took part in the Olympic Handover Celebrations in August and the Open Weekend in September which celebrated the launch of the Cultural Olympiad. Organisations from the heritage sector are also involved in the development of the major Cultural Olympiad project, Discovering Places. This programme introduces a new generation to the hidden places and spaces of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1111W.2/5">There are also opportunities for interested heritage organisations to get involved in the UK wide festival, part of the Cultural Olympiad.</p>

This year we have also conducted a wide consultation on informal adult learning because we recognise the enormous contribution that this activity makes to the quality of life, health and well-being of individuals, neighbourhoods and wider society. These consultation findings will provide the basis for a new informal adult learning strategy for the 21st century.</p>

	<p pid="b.1131W.5/1">The Government recognise that these are challenging economic times, but believe it is appropriate for the community infrastructure levy (CIL) to be introduced in due course. The development industry agrees that CIL is the right instrument to put in place for the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.5/2">As we made clear in our August policy statement, four particular features of CIL help to ensure it is fit for the full range of economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.5/3">First, local authorities will be able to decide whether the circumstances in their area make the introduction of CIL appropriate and at what level to set the charge. Local authorities will proceed at different speeds in establishing a levy and some may decide not to introduce CIL at all. This means there will not be a 'big bang' introduction of this instrument across the country. Rather its introduction will be gradual and local.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.5/4">Secondly, if local authorities do decide to proceed with a CIL, they will need to set charges which reflect the economic circumstances of their areas, and will need to subject their CIL proposals to consultation with developers and the local community, and testing by an independent person. Chapter 3 of the August policy statement sets out the Government's proposals for this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.5/5">Thirdly, the Government expect that charges will need to be kept under review and revised if, for example, changes in land values led to charges becoming unviable. The Government will be considering what procedures for revision might look like, and how they can provide for appropriate levels of both flexibility and stakeholder scrutiny; and will work closely with stakeholders on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1131W.5/6">Fourthly, the Government propose that charges will be indexed against a measure of inflation, enabling wider change in costs or prices (including deflation) to be automatically reflected in charges. Charging authorities will need to make judgments about how far such automatic responsiveness can accommodate changes in the market; and when a more thorough revision of the charging schedule might be necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1132W.2/1">As the Government set out at paragraph 2.7 of its August policy statement on the community infrastructure levy (CIL), CIL will provide further new resources to support housing growth and the development of local communities. Estimates on CIL's revenue raising potential are heavily dependent on assumptions about the number of planning authorities who choose to implement a CIL and the level at which CIL is set in each area. However, the Government believe that CIL has the potential to raise hundreds of millions of pounds per year of extra funding for infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1145W.11/2">The Government welcomed this important report, which highlighted the need for better, more strategic decision making by local authorities on the procurement and management of leisure facilities. We want to help local authorities to modernise their leisure facilities and to ensure that the right sports facilities are provided in the right location. Sport England has developed a range of strategic planning tools to assist them. These include: the Active Places database, which provides a comprehensive picture of a range of sports facilities across the country; the National Benchmarking Service; a facilities planning model; and a sports facilities demand estimator. In addition, Sport England's Facilities Improvement Service is working closely with a number of local authorities to improve their strategic planning for community sport at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.11/3">On the specific recommendations:</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.11/4" class="indent">Through the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) and Free Swimming programmes a range of Government Departments, including the Department of Health, Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are working together to ensure a coordinated approach to investment in sports and recreation facilities;</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.11/5" class="indent">As part of the BSF programme, local authorities must demonstrate that they have consulted with Sport England, County Sports Partnerships, sports governing bodies and others concerning the strategic development of school sports facilities within their area. Additionally, Partnerships for Schools' PE and sports advisers help local authority sports stakeholder groups to develop dual school community-use facilities;</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.11/6" class="indent">In BSF, the local education partnership (LEPS) actively promotes opportunities for local councils to develop strategic capital development proposals to achieve better value for money through joint procurement;</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.11/7" class="indent">DCMS were not allocated private finance initiative (PFI) credits in CSR07 and will not therefore be directly supporting any leisure PFI projects but continue to work with councils who are currently procuring leisure facilities through PFI and with the public private partnerships programme (4ps) and regional centres of excellence on procurement guidance. Sport England is also working with a number of local authorities on the development of sustainable public private partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.3/1">CLG is committed to keeping the key data that underpinned the &quot;State of the English Cities&quot; report, published by ODPM in March 2006, updated within the State of the Cities Database (SOCD). The database is used extensively by central and local government. Regional Development Agencies, academics and bodies like the Centre for Cities and Work Foundation, to monitor the progress and performance of cities in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.3/2">Taking account of feedback received from users since the launch of SOCD in November 2006, a new and improved version of the database was published by the Department in September of this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.3/3">The Department is considering making further improvements to SOCD, by looking at replacing data on Wards and Tracts with data on Super Output Areas (SOAs). This is because since the release of the 2001 Census, SOAs have mainly replaced Wards for the release of statistical information.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155W.6/1">We have no plans to extend the National Challenge to primary schools. There will not be a programme that challenges every single primary school to reach a minimum standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.6/2">Local authorities can choose to adopt a floor target for their primary schools as part of their local area agreement but there are no compulsory floor targets for local authorities or for individual primary schools. The optional floor target has been in place for over a year and is that schools should achieve 55 per cent. or more pupils attaining Level 4+ in English and maths combined at Key Stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155W.6/3">Our priority is to help all primary schools improve and work towards our Children's Plan goals&mdash;so that by 2020 every child will leave primary school ready to move on to secondary school, with at least 90 per cent. of pupils achieving at or above the expected level in both English and mathematics by age 11.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.0/1">Department for International Development (DFID) assistance is helping the Government of Afghanistan to deliver positive results. Since 2002 the non-poppy economy has grown by an average of 15 per cent. per year, with overall growth up to 2005-06 standing at 42 per cent. The first parliamentary elections for 36 years were held in September 2005. 6 million children are now in school of which 35 per cent. of whom are girls. This is in comparison with 2001, when an estimated 1 million children were in school and very few were girls as they were denied education under the Taliban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.0/2">DFID assistance also impacts directly on local communities. We have committed &pound;50 million (2003-10) to support elected Community Development Councils (CDCs). CDCs have delivered over 23,000 projects to date, chosen by locals, to improve water, roads, health and education. In 2006 alone the DFID-supported National Rural Access Programme improved 9,790 km of roads, connecting 2,800 rural villages.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.0/1">At Gleneagles in 2005, the UK Government led efforts to secure the commitment of the G8 to the goal of universal access to HIV treatment by 2010. In 2007, the G8 committed to scale up their efforts to achieve Universal Access, including providing, with other donors, a projected $60 billion over the coming years. G8 leaders at their meeting in July this year reiterated their commitment to work towards the goal of universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. The UK Government continue to push G8 colleagues to ensure they fulfil and implement previous summit commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.0/2">In June 2008, the UK Government made a commitment to spend &pound;6 billion over seven years to 2015 to strengthen health systems and services which are essential to the provision of effective treatment. Subject to performance, the UK Government has also committed an additional &pound;1 billion to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria from 2008-15 and has made a 20 year commitment of up to &euro;60 million per year by 2010 to the UNITAID drug purchase facility. Both play key roles in supporting countries to access high quality, affordable medicines for the treatment of HIV.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.0/3">In addition, the UK Government has worked with pharmaceutical companies to develop a Good Practice Framework (2005) to help support access to medicines for the poor. The UK Government continue to support the right of developing countries to use, judiciously and where necessary, flexibilities available under international trade rules to ensure access to affordable, high quality medicines.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.3/1">The UK Government are committed to work with international partners to reduce drug prices and increase access to more affordable and sustainable treatment over the long term in developing countries. We are working with the World Health Organisation and others to develop a global procurement database that could yield cost efficiency savings of at least &pound;50 million per annum, enough to fund medicines for an additional one million people every year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/2">The UK Government launched the Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA) in May. By disclosing information on the price, quality and availability of medicines, MeTA will help to increase public accountability and improve access to medicines, including HIV treatment. The UK Government have made a 20 year commitment of up to &euro;60 million per year by 2010 to support the international drugs purchase facility, UNITAID. This will help reduce the cost of HIV treatment. This also includes exploring the possibility of a voluntary patent pool for antiretroviral drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/3">The UK Government support the use of generic medicines where patents have expired, or where there is no patent on the medicine concerned. We have consistently and strongly supported the right of developing countries to use flexibilities available under World Trade Organisation agreements to facilitate access to medicines. This includes using compulsory licences, which permit countries to produce or import generic versions of patented drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/4">Starting in 2008, DFID will support a new regional programme on Access to Medicines in Southern Africa. The programme will spend &pound;10 million over the first three years to deliver more affordable, quality medicines and diagnostics, including AIDS medication.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated &pound;9,935,381 over three years (2008-11) to the Platform2 programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.2/2">The main conditions attached to the funding are: a target to involve a minimum of 2,500 UK volunteers, aged between 18 and 25, and focusing on less advantaged young adults who do not normally have the opportunity to participate in such schemes; each volunteer's programme to include a visit to a developing country of between two to four months to participate in a development project, and an activity plan to raise awareness of development issues upon their return to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.2/3">To date, DFID assesses that the money has been effectively spent. Since the launch in February 2008, 170 UK volunteers have completed (or are currently participating) in the programme in Ghana, South Africa, Peru, India and Nepal. Review visits to Ghana by our implementing partners have been very positive. Volunteers who have returned to the UK have developed concrete action plans to raise development awareness, including through media interviews, creating blogs and other online tools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.5/1">In principle, the UK Government stand ready, as part of a wider international effort, to support Zimbabwe's economic recovery if a new administration shows a clear commitment to change and a willingness to tackle the root causes of economic, political and social decline. Macro-economic reform&mdash;including tackling hyperinflation&mdash;must be at the forefront of any reform efforts, as well as reviving the wider economy and supporting basic social and humanitarian needs. There is broad agreement among international donors on a core set of common sense global values which would signal such a change: these include an end to political violence, free and equal humanitarian access, commitment to democracy and to economic reform and respect for human rights. In order to succeed, recovery and development efforts must be led by a Government of Zimbabwe that are committed to reform. The timing and details of any donor conference must be decided by the new administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.5/2">This is the stance the UK Government and like-minded donors have presented in all recent discussions with international partners. The UK Government are engaged in a range of discussions on recovery with the major international financial institutions and other bilateral donors. Such meetings take place regularly in Harare and between donor capitals. Zimbabwe is also discussed at ad hoc international events: recent examples of which include the 63rd session of the UN General Assembly and the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in early October 2008.</p>
