	<p pid=".316W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates in the following table are produced from the Office for National Statistics' analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot; produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library or from the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. It includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.2/5" class="indent">The table shows, for 2001&ndash;02, the average net council tax paid for all households in London and for each income quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and discounts. The table also shows the boundaries between equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for London households. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of those households are estimated to lie. The results are subject to a degree of uncertainty due to increased sampling variability arising from small sample sizes.</p>

	<p pid=".331W.9/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".331W.9/2"><i>(a)</i> There is a long-standing policy of parity in social security matters between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. NI social security legislation relating to overlapping benefits is therefore already in line with that in GB.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.9/3"><i>(b)</i> MOT testing in Northern Ireland is conducted to the same standards and within the same framework of EU requirements as elsewhere in the UK. However, an earlier proposal to lower the age at which private cars in Northern Ireland must undergo an MOT test from four years to three years, in line with practice in the rest of the United Kingdom, was deferred pending the outcome of a review of three year testing in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".331W.9/4">MOT tests, along with all other statutory vehicle tests, are carried out exclusively in Northern Ireland by the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency (DVTA) of the Department of the Environment. There are no arrangements to allow private garages in Northern Ireland to carry out MOT tests on private cars, as is the practice in Great Britain. In light of the on-going difficulties with MOT test waiting times, there have been some calls for the GB arrangements to be introduced in Northern Ireland. However, following the recent programme to refurbish and re-equip DVTA's 15 test centres, under a &pound;57 million private finance initiative contract, and on completion of the current project to introduce telephone, and subsequently internet, test booking, I expect the Agency to return to its previously high levels of performance and customer service. I believe these arrangements best suit the circumstances in Northern Ireland and I have no plans at present to review them.</p>

	<p pid=".339W.6/1">Various Multi-Modal and Road Based Studies have recommended widening the majority of the heavily congested sections of the Ml motorway between M25 (Junction 6A) and M62 (Junction 42).</p>
	<p pid=".339W.6/2">Widening of sections of the motorway in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire (Junctions 6A-13), and improvements to the M6/M1 junction, have been accepted into the Targeted Programme of Improvements (TPI). The Highways Agency is currently reviewing procurement and programme options for these schemes, but construction work is planned to commence within the timescale of the Ten Year Transport Plan announced in 2000, subject to completion of statutory procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".339W.6/3">The Secretary of State has announced previously that he is minded to add further schemes for widening other sections of the Ml motorway between Junction 21 (M69) and Junction 42 (M62) to the TPI. Preparation work continues on these sections of the motorway to identify widening options/costs. The Secretary of State intends to make further announcements in due course.</p>

Every marine minerals dredging proposal is subjected to environmental impact assessment. Every dredging licence application is therefore accompanied by an environmental statement that includes a specific coastal impact study. This is subject to wide consultation and publicity. It is carefully scrutinised by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences on behalf of Defra to determine whether the proposal is environmentally acceptable. Only if the proposal is acceptable is a licence for dredging issued. The licence is normally subject to conditions requiring environmental monitoring and is time limited so that account could be taken of unforeseen environmental impacts if any were to occur.</p>

Authorities' entitlement to housing revenue account subsidy for 2004&ndash;05 will be calculated in accordance with Determinations to be made after consultation. Each local authority will be required subsequently to submit subsidy claims, calculated in accordance with the Determinations and using a new internet-based system currently undergoing trials with a number of authorities. Where the claim shows that the authority is in deficit and an amount is due to it, subsidy will be paid on-account in 10 monthly instalments starting in May 2004. The amount claimed on account will be subject to audit and, if necessary, adjusted after the end of the year. Where the claim shows that an authority is in surplus, it will be required to make payments to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister at the same intervals.</p>

	<p pid=".346W.8/1">Through the New and Renewable Energy Programme, the DTI has funded a number of assessments of the benefits of distributed generation, i.e. smaller generation, which is connected to the distribution networks.

Both these studies were undertaken in 2002.

	<p pid=".353W.3/2">The income of sub-postmasters is derived firstly from payments made to them by Post Office Ltd. for carrying out work on its behalf, and secondly, from the sales made by any private retail business, which they run alongside the post office.</p>

	<p pid=".355W.3/2">The European Directive on the conduct of clinical trials was adopted in February 2001. The main aim of the Directive is to simplify and harmonise procedures across the Community while ensuring the protection of trial subjects and providing a safe environment for the development of new medicines. Member states are required to implement fully the Directive by <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.3/3">The scope of the Directive is wide and the UK Regulations will apply to all clinical trials on medicinal products for human use conducted in the UK, including academic and healthy volunteer studies, with the exception of non-interventional trials.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.3/4">The former Health Minister my noble Friend the Lord Hunt of Kings Heath invited the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Academy of Medical Sciences to co-ordinate a report on the impact of the Directive on academic studies. The impact assessment, prepared by the MRC with the active support of others including Cancer Research UK, the National Co-ordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment and a number of academic experts formed the basis for a response to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) consultation on the draft regulations to implement the Directive into UK law earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.3/5">In responding to concerns, and to provide an environment in which patients are protected but high quality research is not inhibited, the Government have taken steps to attempt to influence the Commission in its consideration of a Commission Directive on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and also in reviewing guidance that the Commission published earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.3/6">In another initiative, the Department and the MRC have announced a joint project to work with experts to find practical solutions to the issues identified in the impact assessment. Details of the project can be found on <a href="http://www.ncchta.org/eudirective/index.asp">www.ncchta.org/eudirective/index.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.3/7">With our careful exploration of the impact on publicly funded research and organisations that support it and delays in the Commission finalising the GCP Directive and other guidance, the United Kingdom's implementing regulations are not expected to be made until early in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.3/8">Further information on the scope of the Directive and the proposed UK implementing regulations is available on the MHRA's website <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a> on the Clinical Trials Directive pages.</p>

Access Agreements will focus on what institutions are doing to encourage more people from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply: they will be required to say how they will recycle a proportion of their additional fee income into bursaries and other financial support to students from poorer families.</p>

We are using our 14 to 19 Pathfinders to test new ways to deliver progression for pupils post-16. One of the key issues my right hon.

A further 14 per cent. of graduates undertake jobs which do not necessarily require a degree but nevertheless make use of their graduate level knowledge or skills.

Furthermore, the rate at which graduates move out of non-graduate occupations in the early years following their graduation was similar for 1995 graduates and for those graduating 15 years earlier (1979/1980).</p>

The 50 per cent. premium is measured in a different way from the &pound;120,000 lifetime earnings differential. In particular the comparator groups and methodologies used differ. However, both estimates provide evidence that individuals with Higher Education qualifications earn considerably more than those without.</p>

The analysis involved constructing a lifetime earnings stream for first degree graduates and comparing it against the lifetime earnings of A-level holders. Both earnings streams were discounted, adjusted for real earnings growth and other factors affecting earnings, other than the qualification itself. The difference between the two earnings streams summed to &pound;120,000.</p>

In general there have been fewer security problems in the north of Afghanistan than in the south. But there have been long-standing tensions between various factions, most notably between the leaders of the two biggest factions. The Afghan Government moved quickly to defuse the most recent flare-up between them earlier this month, supported by the UN and the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) based in Mazar-e Sharif. The Afghan Interior Minister then brokered a comprehensive peace agreement covering five northern provinces. Implementation of this is being monitored by the UN and the UK PRT. The Afghan Government have now reached agreement with the two commanders on merging their factional forces under neutral and central government command. A number of senior personnel in local civilian and police posts have been replaced by new appointees, which will contribute further to weakening local power bases.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/1">Despite a number of difficulties, there have been some positive outcomes to the Somalia reconciliation talks, including a ceasefire agreement and significant dialogue among the parties. The United Kingdom, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, has provided support to the conference running costs, to the African Union ceasefire monitoring process, to satellite broadcasting of the proceedings, and to other facilitation activities. We expect to give further support to enable Somalis to take forward any satisfactory outcome of the conference.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.6/1">The UK has made use of its discretion under Article 11(1)<i>(b)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) to provide an exemption from the licensing requirements of Article 10 for composting operations. Licence exemptions are a less onerous form of control than licences and are provided to encourage the recycling of waste.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.6/2">The current composting exemption restricts the location of composting operations either to the place where the waste is produced or where the final composted material is to be used. We have recently carried out a consultation exercise on the revision of this exemption. The proposed revision would allow waste to be collected from numerous sources and, after composting, to be distributed. We also propose to widen the current exemption to include screening, chipping, shredding, cutting, pulverising or storage of the waste as part of a composting operation. One of the aims of the review is to encourage the recycling of waste by composting by ensuring that the regulatory controls are applied to communal and other composting operations in a way which is proportionate to the risk to the environment and human health.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.5/1">Case-by-case decisions on applications to release GM crops for commercial cultivation are governed by EC Directive 2001/18. This sets out clear timescales for each stage of the decision-making process. Before a GM crop can be granted consent for commercial importation or cultivation, its release is subjected to an assessment by all EU member states to ensure that it poses no significant risk to human health or the environment. If the UK is the lead competent authority, then it has 90 days to assess the application for compliance with the requirements of the Directive. If the UK is not the lead competent authority, then it has 60 days to forward any comments on applications where another member state has forwarded a favourable opinion to the Commission. As decisions are subject to collective EU agreement, it is not possible to say when a decision on a specific application might be taken, but we do not expect any final decisions before early 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".379W.5/2">For releases into the environment (i.e. for purposes other than placing on the market), the Directive requires the relevant competent authority to assess applications and respond to the applicant within 90 days. The 90-day clock, however, is stopped for any periods of time during which the competent authority is awaiting further information. There are currently no field trials of genetically modified crops taking place in the UK nor any application being assessed by the Department.</p>

For example, the Environmental Protection (Restriction on the Use of Lead Shot) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2003, introduces minor changes to the list of sites in Schedule 1 to The Environmental Protection (Restriction on the Use of lead Shot)(England) Regulation 1999. Specifically the New Forest, Avon Valley (Hereford) and River Derwent and Tributaries (Cumbria) and Stanford Training Area, are removed from the list of sites as not being important to waterfowl; the Tweed Estuary is reinstated to the list because it has significant importance for these species. These changes come into force on the <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>. From this date it will be legal to use lead shot in the New Forest providing people are not shooting species listed on Schedule 2 of the 1999 Regulations, such as ducks and geese.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.6/1">The UK Government have been working with the European Commission and stakeholders to develop proposals for a new regulatory regime to tighten controls on substances that are very persistent and very bioaccumulative, as well as those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. The need for a more precautionary approach to managing the risks from these chemicals is set out in the UK Chemicals Strategy, published in 1999. This can be found on Defra's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/ukpolicy.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/ukpolicy.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".381W.6/2">It will be some time before the new EU regulatory system is up and running. In the meantime, we intend to press ahead with encouraging voluntary action in the UK as envisaged in the UK Chemicals Strategy. The Chemical Stakeholder Forum was set up under the Strategy to advise on action to address people's concerns about chemicals. The Forum's criteria for identifying chemicals of concern includes those that are very persistent and very bioaccumulative, as well as those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Details of the Forum's activities can also be found at the above website address.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.6/3">Further information about the forthcoming EU regulatory proposals and the Government's position on these can be found at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/eufuture.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/eufuture.htm</a></p>

A regulatory impact assessment was published as part of this consultation exercise and is available on the Department's website. Licence exemptions are a less onerous form of control than licences and they are provided to encourage the recycling of waste and the attainment of recycling targets.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.5/1">Cement kilns and other co-incineration plants can play a significant role in the treatment of hazardous waste. Evidence given to the House of Commons EFRA Select Committee inquiry on hazardous waste last year suggests that cement kilns have capacity to deal with significantly more hazardous waste than at present. I am keen to ensure that all treatment options for hazardous waste are considered, and that there should be a diversity of management options available. The UK Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste sets out Government policy in relation to the export and import of hazardous waste, including for the incineration of waste in cement kilns. The plan is currently under review in the light of recent European case law, and the on-going review of the Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community.</p>

	<p pid=".385W.2/1">The Water Bill, currently before Parliament, contains a range of measures to advance water conservation. I have also asked Ofwat and the Environment Agency to review jointly the current and potential contribution that water efficiency can make to balancing the supply and demand for water. In addition to this more strategic work, Government are already engaged in a number of activities to encourage water efficiency in different sectors. Envirowise provides advice and guidance to businesses to promote water minimisation, and the Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme has recently been extended to include sustainable water use technologies. I am also considering the feasibility of introducing a product labelling scheme to help domestic consumers identify water efficient fittings and appliances. This will complement the existing duty on water undertakers to promote the efficient use of water by their customers.</p>
