	<p pid="a.252W.0/1">Health visitors are central to delivering the Child Health Promotion Programme (CHPP). With expertise in children, families and public health, together with their background as nurses they are ideally placed to lead the delivery of CHPP in the community. The recent review into the future role of the health visitor, 'Facing the Future', recommended two roles for health visitors. One of the roles is to lead and deliver the CHPP for a defined population working across general practice and children's centres. The recently updated CHPP promotes the important role of the health visitor to commissioners and services providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.0/2">It is the responsibility of local organisations to commission and develop services to respond to local needs, including the recruitment of health visitors.

It affects all members of the NHS Pension Scheme who receive an enhanced national health service pension funded by the scheme or their employer if they return to NHS employment. It continues until they are aged 60 for members of the 1995 scheme, or age 65 for those members of the 2008 scheme. It does not affect those who have retired on voluntary grounds with an actuarial reduction in their pension. Abatement will usually only affect those who earn more than 50 per cent. of their previous salary.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/3">Local Housing Allowance rates are set by rent officers at the median level within each Broad Rental Market Area. This means that exactly half of the rental properties within any Broad Rental Market are affordable to people claiming housing benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.263W.3/1">The budget for the Aquatics Centre is &pound;242 million. This iconic venue, designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid, will provide state of the art facilities and a world class permanent legacy facility for elite and community use. The contract for the Aquatics Centre also includes constructing the land bridge that will be the main gateway into the Olympic Park and will also form part of the roof of the venue. The budget for both the Aquatics Centre and the bridge is &pound;303 million, and this has not changed throughout the procurement process. This figure includes the contract price, allowance for inflation, an element of project management costs, VAT and the costs to convert the venue for long-term legacy use (and associated VAT and contingency). This budget is within the ODA's &pound;6.090 billion baseline budget as set out in the statement made in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.263W.3/2">The Bid Book estimate for the Aquatics Centre was $117 million at 2004 prices (approximately &pound;73 million at a USD/GBP exchange rate of 1.6). However, this did not include inflation, legacy transformation costs, project management costs or VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.263W.3/3">The overall venues budget remains broadly in line with the Bid Book when an allowance is made for inflation, project management costs, transformation costs and VAT.</p>

	<p pid="a.269W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice has published two annual reports containing statistical information on freedom of information requests received by monitored bodies (including central Government Departments) in 2005 and 2006. These reports can be found at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/3">The 2007 annual report is currently being drafted for publication in June 2008. However, statistics on requests received in each quarter of 2007 have been published and can be found via the MOJ website:</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial se had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (i.e. meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007 was 89 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.3/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the Department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied. For 2007, the number of such requests was three based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

	<p pid="a.272W.8/2">The A12 through Essex is considered to be primarily of regional importance. Decisions on such schemes are made on the basis of advice from regional bodies, including the Regional Assembly and the Regional Development Agency, on the priorities for funding within an indicative budget. The advice provided by the East of England regional bodies in 2006, which Ministers have accepted, did not prioritise any A12 schemes in the period to 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.8/3">The Government intend, by the summer, to invite each region to carry out a further review of its funding priorities. This will provide an opportunity for those who support improvements to the A12 to press their case within the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.8/4">Officials in the department have regular meetings with Essex county council and have received correspondence over the period in question from both individual councillors and the council itself.</p>

The main elements are a 'backstop' limit value, to be met everywhere by 2015, and an 'exposure concentration obligation' to be met across urban background locations (as an average), also by 2015.

These estimates are used for assessing new vehicle emissions standards and the revised National Air Quality Strategy, published in 2007. Diesel cars currently emit significantly higher levels of both particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen than petrol cars. However, the recently agreed Euro 5 and 6 emissions standards will reduce particulate emissions from new diesel cars to comparable levels to petrol cars by 2011 and substantially reduce the difference between petrol and diesel NOx emissions by 2015.</p>

On each occasion they have drawn attention to the potential environmental, economic and social impacts of increasing levels of biofuel use.

	<p pid="a.284W.8/1">The Environment Agency maintains a network of 750 telemetered rain-gauges which feed data directly into computer models to forecast river levels, using the national flood forecasting system (NFFS). The Environment Agency is about to gain access to a further 110 telemetered rain-gauges that are owned by the Met Office The Environment Agency also maintains a network of 2,250 rain-gauges across England and Wales that are monitored on a daily basis and which are used in a planning capacity to establish potential flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.284W.8/2">Due to the limitations of measuring rainfall at fixed point locations, spatial data on actual and forecast rainfall is provided by a network of weather radars (which measure rainfall to a resolution up to 1 sq km), and by the Met Office's weather forecasting models. The Environment Agency has evaluated each area with a flood risk to ensure that each is served with information from an appropriate number of rain-gauges or data from weather radar. Where gaps are identified, then improvements in rain-gauge coverage (and/or weather radar) are under way.</p>

In response, the Government set an expectation that apprentices be paid a weekly wage of at least &pound;80 per week which is broadly the equivalent of the package of child and family benefits paid in respect of unwaged learners. A research survey published by the Department in April 2008 showed that average apprenticeship pay has risen in line with inflation since 2005, from a weekly average of &pound;137 to &pound;170 in 2008. A copy of the survey report will be placed in the Library. To ensure that apprenticeship pay remains at least on par with financial support for other learning routes, the Government have remitted the Low Pay Commission to report on apprenticeship pay by February 2009. The Government will consider its findings once they have been published.</p>

	<p pid="a.298W.6/12">Repayment of student loans by prisoners is the same as for other borrowers. For income contingent loans, borrowers start to repay in the April after they graduate or withdraw from their course. Repayment is linked to income and repayable through the PAYE or Self Assessment Tax system and is at 9 per cent. on earnings above &pound;15,000 a year. Interest paid is linked to the rate of inflation, so in real terms what is paid back is equivalent to what was borrowed. The repayments to the Student Loans Company by these borrowers and posted to their accounts as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-19">19 March</phrase>, 2008 is shown in the table as follows.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.298W.6/21">The figures do not include payments that have been made but not yet credited to Borrowers' accounts. Prisoners will typically take longer to start repayments than other students. For example, some prisoners will complete their course several years before release; and there will therefore be a longer period between prisoners finishing their studies and starting work and earning above the annual threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Bite sized&quot; learning events on both finance and other Professional Skills for Government (&quot;PSG&quot;) topics that are relevant to CLG for all finance staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/15" class="indent">Professional training courses for a CCAB qualification delivered by England's leading providers and open to all finance staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/16" class="indent">Development of a set of finance competencies, based on best practice, against which finance staff can benchmark themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/17">The training and development programme has been equality-proofed and subject to an equality impact assessment. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/18" class="indent">There is no limitation on any finance staff attending training and development events.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/19" class="indent">There is no funding limitation or restrictions in finance staff taking up professional training.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/20" class="indent">The training providers have a range of courses, including day release; evening study; weekend study and distance learning to fully meet flexible working requirements. There are no restrictions on which course finance staff select and there are generous study leave arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/21" class="indent">The training providers operate from a number of localities to meet the needs of finance staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/22" class="indent">The finance training manager provides open support and is available to assist with any individual difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/23">The training and development programme also covers non-finance staff and provides for accessibility and support for finance Professional Skills for Government through the National School of Government &quot;Finance Love Learning&quot; portal.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/24">There are approximately 135 finance staff based in central London. Since the launch of the current finance professionalism scheme in September, there have been six promotions internally on successful completion of accountancy examinations. Three finance staff have been promoted on transfer to other Government Departments, including one to the senior civil service. In addition, three members of the CLG fast stream have joined the Government Finance Profession (&quot;GFP&quot;) fast stream.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/25">Prior to the new scheme, only one member of staff had been promoted in the preceding five months from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. This promotion was of a member of staff who had worked independently to pass accountancy qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.2/26">The Finance Professionalism agenda is a Government- wide initiative, the objectives of which are publicly set out on the GFP website.</p>

	<p pid="a.303W.5/1">Communities and Local Government have taken numerous steps to reduce its energy consumption over the last twelve months.</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.5/2">The Department has developed a detailed Energy Efficiency Action Plan which provides a structured, timetabled approach to reducing its carbon emissions. Efficiency controls have been fitted to fans and pumps, and plant operating hours have been reduced. The building energy management system in the Department's main headquarter building has also been upgraded to enable more effective control of heating and cooling. Air conditioning plant has remained off during the winter season, and external solar blinds have been permanently lowered during summer periods to reduce solar gain. An audit was also undertaken to ensure that sensors fitted to lights were operating as intended. (The Department's office floor lighting is fitted with daylight and movement sensors which automatically switch lights off after 2 &amp;frac12; minutes of inactivity.)</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.5/3">Ongoing staff awareness campaigns continue to help towards reducing the energy consumption of office equipment and the total number of computer printers has been reduced. The Department also participated in the Lights Out London energy efficiency awareness raising event.</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.5/4">As part of the Department's wider estate rationalisation strategy, the total number of buildings occupied has been reduced, thereby reducing total energy consumption across the estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.5/5">Actions taken to reduce energy consumption within the Department's executive agencies have included installation of more energy efficient lighting systems, reductions in heating plant operating hours, installation of timer devices on boilers and investigations into options for on-site renewable energy generation.</p>

	<p pid="a.305W.3/1">Household waste has no role to play specifically in the definition of zero carbon, which is focused on the energy performance of the home in relation to energy use from cooking, washing and electronic appliances as well as space heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and hot water. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes contains a minimum entry requirement on household waste which must be met in order to gain a star rating against the code at any level. This ensures that when developers are building to higher environmental standards, and ultimately zero carbon standards at level 6 of the code, waste is taken into account in the design, construction and occupation of the house.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.3/1">The Government anticipate that, in order to meet the long-term carbon reduction target set out in the Climate Change Bill, substantial reductions will be required both from new and existing homes. A number of studies have been undertaken on the potential in each of these. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.3/2" class="indent">In 2007, following analysis published by my Department (<a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reviewsustainability">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reviewsustainability</a>), the Office of Climate Change published its analytical slide pack on household emissions (<a href="http://www.occ.gov.uk/publications/index.htm">http://www.occ.gov.uk/publications/index.htm</a>). This estimated that existing policies (including zero carbon homes) would reduce carbon emissions by some 45 million tonnes carbon dioxide (MtCO2) per year by 2020 and that there was further potential (not from existing policies) to reduce emissions by some 47.5 MtCO2 per year (including some 11.7 MtCO2 from measures with a payback of seven years or less).</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.3/3" class="indent">In 2007, following consultation, my Department published the &quot;Building a Greener Future&quot; policy statement (<a href="http://www.communities.gov">http://www.communities.gov</a>.ukypublications/planningandbuilding/building-a-greener) and accompanying regulatory impact assessment, which estimated that our policies on revising building regulations towards the zero carbon standard will save some 2.7 MtCO2 per year by 2020 and at least 15 MtCO2 per year by 2050. A further consultation on the detailed definition of zero carbon will follow later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.6/3" class="indent">Cavity width less than 50mm (or less than 40mm) if UF foam is used.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.6/8" class="indent">Walls exposed to driving rain (unless the outer leaf is in good condition and appropriate to the locality).</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.6/9">We estimate that there are currently 7.3 million homes in Great Britain with unfilled but fillable wall cavities and around 807,000 homes with unfillable cavities, for the reasons set out above. We estimate that around 2.9 million cavities will be filled under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.6/10">However, the insulation industry has informed the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) that improvements in technology mean that some of these cavities can now be filled; for example, three of the main insulation companies have installed cavity wall insulation in blocks of flats up to 45m, and CIGA (the cavity wall insulation guarantee agency) has assured DEFRA that cavity wall insulation is regularly retrofitted to homes in areas of driving rain (for example, Cornwall, Shetland and the Hebrides) provided that the external leaf of the building is in good condition. We therefore believe that the figure of 807,000 unfillable cavities in Great Britain is an over-estimate.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.0/1">In general, the conversion of a dwelling house to flats would involve a material change of use and therefore require planning permission. It would then be for the local authority to determine whether this is appropriate based on their local plans and policies and the need for such housing in the area. It is important for local authorities to strike a balance between the need to make efficient use of land by building at higher densities in accessible locations and making sure that satisfactory living conditions are either maintained or could be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.0/2">I have no plans to give local authorities greater powers in relation to planning decisions on the conversion of dwelling houses to flats, as I consider that existing powers are sufficient. It would not be appropriate to restrict generally the opportunities that conversions can bring to overall housing stock, as these are decisions best taken locally after careful consideration of the merits and drawbacks of each particular case.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.3/1">The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2000 (IMD 2000) is a ward level measure of multiple deprivation. For the geographical access sub-domain, average distance travelled to each service was calculated as the average distance that claimants in a particular ward would have to travel to that service, as the crow flies. The distances to post offices, doctors' surgeries and food shops were computed for claimants of means tested out-of-work benefits, while the distance to primary schools was computed for all children aged 5 to 8.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.3/2">The same four indicators were used in the IMD 2004 and 2007. However both these indices are based on Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) geography, rather than ward geography. The measurement of distance changed from ;as the crow flies' to measuring road distance, to each service. The distances were measured to the nearest 10 metres. In 2004 and 2007 distance was measured for all people rather than just for people claiming out-of-work benefits.

	<p pid="a.316W.9/1">Planning Policy Statement 25 Development and Flood Risk, sets out the Government's policy for managing flood risk, including that from surface water. It requires local planning authorities to prepare strategic flood risk assessments in consultation with the Environment Agency, which should form the basis for preparing appropriate policies for flood risk management in those areas. Planning applications for development on sites of 1 hectare or greater in areas with low probability of flooding and all proposals in areas with medium and high probability of flooding should be accompanied by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment. This will identify and assess the risks from all forms of flooding to and from the development, and demonstrate how these flood risks will be managed, so that the development will be safe and will not increase flood risk elsewhere. Annex F of the PPS specifically deals with the management of surface water.</p>

	<p pid="a.318W.8/1">There are no proposals in the East of England or South East Regional Spatial Strategies for amending Green Belt boundaries in the Thames Gateway area. Any planning applications for development on Green Belt land must satisfy the national planning policies on Green Belts set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 2. Under this policy, strict planning controls in Green Belt land are in place and there remains a general presumption against inappropriate development within Green Belts. As we reaffirmed in last year's Planning White Paper, the Government have no intention of making fundamental changes to this policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.318W.8/2">I would also point out that one of the reasons land may be included in the Green Belt is to assist in the urban regeneration of urban land, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other land. The opportunities for urban regeneration in the Thames Gateway are recognised in the Government's investment programme for the area.</p>

On flood adaptation, we support a 50 million programme which assists poor people to cope with severe floods by raising homesteads. In response to the direct needs from last year's floods and cyclone, we have provided &pound;15 million as disaster relief and early recovery activities to Bangladesh.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/2">We have recently committed &pound;30 million to climate change adaptation. The programme will protect around &pound;10 million poor and vulnerable people against climate change related disasters such as flood, drought, tidal surges and cyclones. The climate change programme will facilitate access for Bangladesh to major global funds, such as the environmental transformation fund and the multi-billion-dollar global environmental facility. These funds support low-carbon development initiatives through adaptation of greener technologies.</p>

	<p pid="a.324W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) provides its humanitarian assistance through partner agencies such as the UN Relief Works Agency and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The UK also makes a substantial contribution to the World Food Programme's central budget. For these implementing agencies, the partial closure of Gaza's crossings has significantly increased the time and costs involved in importing humanitarian supplies into Gaza. Verified estimates are unavailable, although the World Food Programme has calculated that additional costs created by Israel's food clearance procedures will reach $6 million over the two years from September 2007 to August 2009. As the situation deteriorates, we expect these costs to rise.</p>

The previous set of data relating to the 1964 Act covered the triennial renewal process when 273 on-licensed and 81 off-licensed premises had their licences revoked in England and Wales between July 2003 and June 2004. This data does not indicate the reason for revocation which could include premises having simply ceased trading. This data is not available broken down by police area.</p>

The data does not indicate the reason for revocation or suspension, nor by type of licensed premises. Licences may be revoked on review for one or more reasons relating to the four licensing objectives, including sales of alcohol to children.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.2/1">Individual police authorities rather than the Home Office are required to account for police pension liabilities. Each authority's liability along with details of certain assumptions used in the calculation of the liability are published by each authority in its annual accounts. Data from those accounts are compiled each year by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). These are available either for purchase or via subscription on the CIPF website,</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cipfa.org.uk">www.cipfa.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/3">The Government Actuary's Department (GAD) has estimated the unfunded liability of the police pension scheme in England and Wales to have been &pound;70 billion as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, based on data from police authorities' published resource accounts. This is part of the figure of &pound;650 billion discussed in box 4.3 of the Long-Term Public Finance Report published in March 2008 and available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/A/E/bud08_longterm_586.pdf">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/A/E/bud08_longterm_586.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/5">The discount rates used are also discussed there, but the longevity assumptions used have not generally been disclosed by police authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/6">The earliest comparable estimates of the unfunded liability of the police pension scheme are in the note placed in Library by my right hon. Friend the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March 2006</phrase>, which gave combined UK wide figures for the police and fire service pension schemes of &pound;64 billion as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> and &pound;85 billion as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, based on data from police and fire authorities' published resource accounts. The note is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/4/A/foi_publicservicepensions260406.pdf">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/4/A/foi_publicservicepensions260406.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/8">The discount rates used are discussed in that note, but the longevity assumptions used have not generally been disclosed by police authorities. No breakdown of those figures is readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Although we have previously provided some estimates of the police pension scheme's unfunded liability prior to 2004, they were not based on data from police authorities' published resource accounts, and so are not comparable with the aforementioned figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/9">There were no employer contributions for police pensions for the years prior to 2006-07 since until this point police authorities had to meet the cost of pensions in payment out of their operating accounts. However, the system for financing police pensions changed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Police authorities now have a separate pensions account, into which they pay officers' contributions and a new employer's contribution. Any shortfall in an authority's pensions account each year is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. The employer contribution rate is a combined one for both the Police Pension Scheme 1987 (PPS) and the New Police Pension Scheme 2006 (NPPS). In 2006-07 and 2007-08, the employer contribution rate was 24.6 per cent. of each officer's average pensionable pay, and was reduced to 24.2 per cent. with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. Returns from individual authorities show a total employer contribution cost of &pound;1.108 billion for 2006-07 based on forces' unaudited accounts, and &pound;1.151 billion for 2007-08 based on forces' estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.2/10">The employee contribution rate for the PPS is currently 11 per cent. of pensionable pay, and 9.5 per cent. for the NPPS. The annual saving from increasing these rates for police officers in England and Wales would be &pound;47 million, based on 1 per cent. of the estimated annual pensionable payroll in 2007-08. Such a change would, in isolation, reduce the call made by police forces on the central Government top-up grant, although this may differ if other changes were introduced at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="a.338W.5/1">In January 2005, the joint Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) was set up by the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.5/2">The FMU leads on Government policy on forced marriage and has developed guidelines for professionals (the police, education professionals, health and social workers) on how to deal with cases of forced marriage. In addition, as part of the National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan, the FMU coordinates an outreach programme to raise awareness of the problem, and runs a dedicated support and advice helpline for victims of forced marriage. The FMU also works with embassies and high commissions overseas to rescue and repatriate those British citizens forced into marriage overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.5/3">Last year the FMU:</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.5/4" class="indent">assisted approximately 400 victims of forced marriage (168 of these were overseas cases);</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.5/5" class="indent">spoke at over 80 awareness raising events around the country;</p>
	<p pid="a.338W.5/6" class="indent">contributed to the passage through Parliament of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. One of the provisions of the Act is to make the guidelines for professionals statutory; and also</p>

	<p pid="a.338W.11/1">The Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (&quot;SWGDAM&quot;) standards refers to guidelines that were written primarily for assisting North American forensic laboratories in meeting defined quality standards. Forensic Science Service Ltd. (&quot;FSS&quot;) operates to a forensic science quality framework that incorporates independent accreditation of the organisation's scientific methods, and standards employed for validating techniques, to the international quality standard IS017025, (General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories). The FSS is also registered as compliant with the international quality standard IS09001 (Quality Management Systems). The FSS' validation standards and the SWGDAM validation guidelines are similar; however as an additional measure since December 2007, the FSS has implemented a process that involves checking against the SWGDAM validation guidelines when implementing new DNA techniques into casework. The FSS has shared its standards for technique validation with the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes, who have adopted them in their own published guidelines for validation, with which the FSS are fully compliant.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.3/3">A total of 20 police forces use WPC Software's Community Policing and Case Tracking (COMPACT) computer system to record and manage their missing persons' cases. Electronic data transfer between 'COMPACT' forces and the MPB's 'Hermes' system is being arranged.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/4">Automatic data transfer mechanisms for the other systems are being investigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/5">At a national level, the MPB use Hermes, which is a purpose-built electronic database, developed and implemented by the Missing People charity through the Invest to Save Initiative in 2004-05. The shared technology between the MPB and the charity facilitates effective transfer of data between the two organisations and collaborative efforts on research and analysis projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.3/6">All police forces and the MPB also have access to the Police National Computer (PNC). The national Guidance on the Management, Recording and Investigation of Missing Persons indicates that officers should record details of all missing persons reported to them on the PNC within 48 hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.356W.2/3">This information is not held centrally. There is no requirement for the police or airport operator to provide Government with the details of the agreed policing provision or the related costs. The number and cost of uniformed police officers at designated airports is for negotiation at local level by the airport operator and police.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.2/4">However, the Government are also considering how to implement the conclusions of the independent report into airport policing, with the aim of clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the police, airport operators and other agencies to deliver a high level of security at UK airports and we will set out proposals on this later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.5/2">The work will provide a single technical platform for all the FCO websites (including the main FCO website, Arabic and Urdu versions of the FCO website, UKvisas website, the FCO Freedom of Information website, and 229 embassy, high commission and special mission sites in multiple languages) as well as new designs, content, functionality and a new hub and spoke model for delivering business support.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/3">The project will complete in September 2008, by which time all of the FCO posts websites will have joined the new platform and will operate under the central domain, fco.gov.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/4">The initial cost of &pound;9.7 million for the web platform was set out in the answer given by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Meg Munn) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-30">30 January 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-30.398"><i> Official Report,</i> column 398W</phrase>. The project is on target to cost &pound;19.2 million over five years. This includes running costs, for example hosting and support, and some staff salaries. The cost of the project to date is &pound;9.2 million which includes the design and implementation of the FCO and UKvisas websites, and the design of the embassy and high commission websites. It also includes procurement costs, client side advice, setting up regional hubs to provide business support, and training. Details of the project and costs were published in Whitehall and Westminster World on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-04">4 April</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.5/6">The web is vital for the delivery of the FCO's Departmental strategic objectives.

The FCO is committed to using the web to deliver its Policy Goals as well as key services such as travel advice and visa information.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/7">The project has followed the Office of Government Commerce Gateway Review process and is delivering on time and to budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.387W.6/3">Additionally, as a result of the creation of Her Majesty's Courts Service in April 2005, this Department became responsible for staff previously employed by 42 magistrates courts committees (MCCs). With the exception of the Greater London Magistrates Courts Authority who were also part of the civil service pension scheme, each of the remaining 41 areas were members of a Local Government Pension Scheme. The Department took responsibility for all pension liabilities at that time which were estimated to be &pound;268 million. This was reflected in the departmental accounts as a provision. The true value of this provision will only be known when all the returns are received from the Local Government Pension Funds. When that figure becomes clearer, HM Treasury will need to determine the discount rate to be applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.6/4">This Department is also responsible for the administration of the pension scheme for the judiciary. Information since 2003-04 is contained in the resource accounts for the Judicial Pension Scheme. Copies of the resource accounts can be found on the Department's website.</p>

The court has a discretion to extend this period without limit in appropriate cases.</p>

The Government accepted the Law Commission's recommendations in principle, subject to further work in certain areas, in July 2002.

	<p pid="a.390W.5/1">The Mental Capacity Act 2005 was fully implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. It also introduced new lasting powers of attorney (LPAs) to enable people to appoint someone to make decisions on their behalf in relation to their property and affairs and/or their health and welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/2">In addition, enduring powers of attorney (EPAs) made prior to October 2007 remain valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/3">All LPAs must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) before they can be used. EPAs only need to be registered with the OPG once the person to whom they relate has lost capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/4">The total number of applications to register both types of power of attorney since the new legislation came into force in October has greatly exceeded forecasts. The last three months in particular have seen volumes again increase even more sharply. This has put a strain on resources and led to delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/5">It is currently taking staff around six weeks to process and check LPAs to ensure they are valid before other parties can be notified that an application has been made. Applications then enter a statutory waiting period of 42 days during which objections can be made against the application. This is an important safeguard to allow any concerns about the power to be aired. Where no objections are received, staff are registering the power and notifying the applicant within another week.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/6">Steps have been taken to address the delays in this process which exist mainly at the point where applications are received and checked:</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/7" class="indent">Additional staff are being taken on at all levels to deal with processing the higher than expected volumes.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/8" class="indent">Some staff have already been taken on temporarily in some of the more process-driven areas to increase capacity quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/9" class="indent">Other staff are currently undergoing training to ensure they can carry out their new roles effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/10" class="indent">Procuring additional IT equipment to increase the team's capacity to scan and check applications at the front end. The additional equipment has been ordered and is awaiting installation.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/11">As a result of these steps, I expect the OPG to have reached a point where it has reduced the front-end period spent processing and checking applications to two weeks in June. This would be in line with the level of service that we aim to offer our customers and which is tracked as a corporate target as one of the OPG's key performance indicators.</p>

	<p pid="a.392W.2/2">A revised strategy was published in October 2007 with implementation to be completed in every prison by the end of April 2008. This builds on several years of learning from the experiences of prisoners, staff, investigators, inspectors and others, and aims to embed improved suicide prevention and self-harm management methods of working in all areas of prison life. It incorporates the care-planning system for at-risk prisoners, improved cross-agency information flows, and also reflects long-standing areas of safer custody work such as listener and insider peer supporters, local suicide prevention co-ordinators and working with outside organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.394W.12/1">Since 1987 the policy has been not to provide prison quarters and to dispose of the existing quarters under the then discount sales scheme or on the open market. Since that time some 12,000 quarters have been sold and some 480 remain. Once these remaining quarters are declared surplus to requirements and become vacant they are sold on the open market. In the financial year 2008-09 some 50 quarters are anticipated to be sold in this manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.12/2">There are four quarters at HMP Wandsworth however that are not to be sold, on account of their strategic location on the front of the prison wall, and these are due to be transferred on a short to medium-term basis to a housing association or similar body who will source funding, possibly from a housing corporation to undertake the necessary works and then let the properties to local families who are deemed most in need of affordable social housing. A similar arrangement has been in place for some years for residential flats adjacent to Wormwood Scrubs.</p>

	<p pid="a.406W.0/1">We have received a number of representations that at least one teacher in every school should have a specialist dyslexia qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/2">All local authorities and schools must have regard to the special educational needs code of practice which provides advice on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs. Children with dyslexia should have their needs identified and support put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/3">To identify and promote best practice, we are working with dyslexia organisations on the No to Failure project, through which children in trailblazer schools are screened and specialist teaching provided to those identified at risk of dyslexia and other specific learning difficulties. We are supporting this project with just over &pound;1 million funding over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/4">The recently published report from No to Failure says a significant proportion of participating children not achieving expected levels of attainment are at risk of dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties. However, the report does not indicate how many had already been identified with SEN, nor does it evaluate the impact of specialist teaching on children's progression. We are looking forward to seeing the final report later this year, which we understand will contain such an evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/5">Through No to Failure, we have commissioned Dr. Chris Singleton to summarise published research on the impact of specialist dyslexia teaching. We will consider whether and how we should promote specialist dyslexia teaching as best practice in the light of evidence of its impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/6">All schools receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. This can include professional development for teachers intending to be dyslexia specialists. It is however for individual teachers and their schools to determine training and development needs and how best to address them. This would also hold true for support staff. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development in SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/7">To help those working in schools with identifying and supporting children with dyslexia, last October we launched the Inclusion Development Programme, which is offering professional development in key areas of SEN starting with training on communication difficulties, including dyslexia. The Inclusion Development Programme materials were developed in close consultation with dyslexia organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/8">Our commitment through the Primary and Secondary national strategies is to ensure Quality First teaching for all. The Every Child a Reader and Every Child Counts initiatives are focused on providing additional intervention for the 5 per cent. of children facing the most difficulties with reading and mathematics. They do not provide a specific focus on provision for children with dyslexia. Every Child a Reader is being rolled out to reach 30,000 children a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/9">Every Child Counts is currently in a research phase and will be informed by the Williams review of the teaching of mathematics that is due to be published in June this year. The intention is that Every Child Counts will be aimed at children whose attainment in the early stages of mathematics shows they are not making expected progress for their age.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/10">Every Child a Writer is a new programme announced at the end of last year. The intention&mdash;as stated in our Children's Plan&mdash;is that this will offer support later in primary school than Every Child a Reader and Every Child Counts and reach a greater number of pupils. Further announcements will be made about Every Child a Writer in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/11">Evaluations of the Every Child a Reader pilot&mdash;which provides Reading Recovery for children from among those having the most difficulties in learning to read&mdash;were published in 2006 and 2007. These are available on</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/12" class="indent"><a href="http://www.everychildareader.org.uk">www.everychildareader.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/13">The evaluation of Every Child a Reader in London in 2005-06 showed that 87 per cent. of children who had received Reading Recovery were considered to have made average to exceptional progress in reading comprehension. However, these evaluations did not include looking at the efficacy of Reading Recovery for children with dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/14">The SEN code of practice says that</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/15" class="indent">&quot;effective management, school ethos and the learning environment, curricular, pastoral and discipline arrangements can help prevent some special educational needs arising, and minimise others&quot; (paragraph 5:18).</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.0/16">Where whole school arrangements for teaching and learning are not addressing a child's learning difficulties, schools have a statutory duty to do their best to ensure that the necessary provision is made for any pupil who has special educational needs. It follows that if a child with dyslexia is not benefiting from their participation in any or all of the three initiatives, the school must make additional or different arrangements to address the child's special educational needs.</p>

Grammar schools already selecting in this way at the beginning of the 1997/98 academic year may continue to do so with decisions on whether individual grammar schools should continue to do so being made at a local level. Mechanisms are in place to allow parents to vote to remove selection at a grammar school.</p>

	<p pid="a.410W.3/1">In response to consistent feedback received from children, young people and their families that there are not enough safe and stimulating places for them to play, we have made the biggest ever investment in play by Government. A total of &pound;235 million over the next three years (2008-09 to 2010-11) will be made available to all local authorities to provide a range of innovative play facilities, accessible to all children. A total of 30 'Pathfinder' authorities will each receive on average &pound;2 million capital and a substantial amount of revenue funding to develop public play areas and deliver 30 adventure playgrounds by 2011. By 2010 all the remaining authorities will each receive on average &pound;1 million capital and a contribution towards their revenue costs to deliver our aim of developing up to 3,500 public play areas by 2011. The development of all sites will be shaped by local children, parents and communities to help meet the clear demand from the public for improved play facilities that our Children's Plan consultations revealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.410W.3/2">To inform a full cost-benefit analysis of the impact of this expenditure, my Department is currently piloting and testing, via the Pathfinder programme, innovative approaches to promoting and supporting the play areas we are developing. Through the evaluation of this programme, we will identify the impact of our capital investment as well as identifying the most cost-effective way of implementing further national roll-outs of adventure playgrounds and play areas beyond 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.410W.3/3">In advance of the publication of &quot;Fair Play: A Consultation on the Play Strategy&quot; my Department completed a provisional value for money calculation expressed as the required reduction in future obesity costs resulting from play to offset the costs of the proposed spending. Other unquantified benefits such as attainment, emotional development and reduction in antisocial behaviour would only add to the attractiveness of our capital investment programme.</p>

LAs have wide discretion in deciding whether transport is necessary, but they must provide free home to school transport for pupils of compulsory school age who are attending their nearest suitable school, provided that the school is beyond the statutory walking distances (two miles for pupils below the age of eight years and three miles for those aged eight years and over).</p>

The term 'banding', which is very similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included or not in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects.</p>
	<p pid="a.420W.2/17">From 2003/04 the distinction between streaming and setting was removed and Ofsted now record data on whether classes they observe are mixed ability or set/streamed. They no longer record data on setting alone. It is therefore not possible to provide data on the proportion of lessons which are set for the period from 2003/04 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="a.420W.5/2">Since October 2006 the Government have used significant numbers of police cells provided through Operation Safeguard to help manage pressure in the prison population. Juveniles are not held under Operation Safeguard itself although over this period our records indicate that 36 juveniles were held overnight on an ad hoc basis. It is not possible to break this figure down by age without incurring disproportionate cost. The Government's policy is that juveniles should be held overnight in police cells only in the most exceptional circumstances. It does not happen routinely.</p>

	<p pid="a.421W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/2">In 2000 the Secretary of State issued guidance on matters to be taken into account by Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator, in agreeing companies' charges schemes, including charging non-household users that are not businesses. These include places of worship, community facilities, charities and voluntary bodies. The guidance stated that those making similar demands on a service should be charged on the same basis. It also made clear that where premises impose customer-related costs in line with or lower than those of typical households, they should be able to benefit from tariffs which reflect their small demand on the water system.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/3">Churches were traditionally zero rated under the rateable value system of charging, meaning that they did not have to pay surface water drainage (SWD) charges. However the replacement of rateable value charges for SWD with a site area based charge means that churches will be required to pay surface water drainage charges and will no longer benefit from the cross subsidy that resulted from the rateable value system.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/4">Ofwat reviewed companies' approaches to charging for SWD in 2003. In RD35/03, 'Surface water drainage&mdash;charging policy' (September 2003), Ofwat concluded that charging according to site area was the best method of charging for SWD. Ofwat recommended that water companies consider introducing site area-based charging for SWD&mdash;particularly for non-household customers where the process is simpler to implement. However Ofwat also noted that, given that set up and administration costs of introducing this method were considerable, and would vary depending on customer base, it was for individual companies to decide if the benefits of implementing site area SWD charging outweighed the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/5">For sewerage customers served by United Utilities the site area based SWD charge was introduced in 2007-08 for new and substantially altered properties. In 2008-09 it is being introduced for all non-household properties, including churches. The move to site area charging will be phased in over three years to reduce the year-on-year impact on those customers who will see an increase in their charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/6">The most cost reflective way of charging non-household customers for SWD is by reference to the customer's site area, because the larger the site area, the more surface water will drain from it. SWD charges based on site area are only payable for areas which drain (directly or indirectly) into public sewers. Chargeable areas will be adjusted to take account of large grassy or gravelled areas, such as church yards or burial grounds that do not drain into a public sewer. Surface area based charging offers strong incentives to customers to reduce surface water drainage costs they impose on companies, for example by installing soakaways. Charges can therefore be mitigated by customers by installing such devices. The approach aligns with the Government's water strategy for fair, affordable and cost reflective water and sewerage charges which incentivise environmentally responsible behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/7">Companies are obliged under their licences to ensure that charges are neither unduly preferential or unduly discriminatory between groups of customers. Ofwat therefore considers that churches and other places of worship should be treated no differently to other non-household customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/8">Ofwat has held discussions with the Consumer Council for Water which supports the proposal for all companies to charge surface water drainage by site area.</p>
