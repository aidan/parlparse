	<p pid=".665W.10/1">The Crown Prosecution Service instructs counsel on behalf of the Attorney-General in Attorney-General reference cases. These are cases that are referred to the Court of Appeal under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 and sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 either on a point of law or because they come within the unduly lenient sentence provisions, under which the Attorney-General refers a case to the Court of Appeal to have the sentence reviewed on the grounds that it is unduly lenient.</p>
	<p pid=".665W.10/2">The Crown Prosecution Service usually instructs Senior Treasury Counsel or Junior Treasury Counsel to undertake this work. Treasury Counsel are very experienced counsel, used by the Crown for serious work. When instructing counsel, the Crown Prosecution Service considers the seniority of counsel, the specialist areas of work in which counsel practises and the ability of counsel to return work at the specified time. In deciding which counsel to instruct, the Crown Prosecution Service strives to promote consistency in the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid=".665W.10/3">In cases concerning potentially unduly lenient sentences it is considered to be of particular benefit to have new counsel to consider the facts. Consistency in these applications is maintained by restricting them to Treasury Counsel, who build up expertise in this field of work.</p>

	<p pid=".668W.0/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/2" class="italic">Crown Prosecution Service</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/3">The Compass contract was awarded to LogicaCMG (formerly Logica UK Limited) on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase> under a Private Finance Initiative procurement to provide a fully managed IT service .to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Compass contract is for 10 years with the option of extending it for a further 5 years. Over 10 years the cost is currently estimated to be &pound;275 million. This is subject to change as user numbers change and/or additional facilities are required. There has been no renegotiation of the contract.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/4" class="italic">Serious Fraud Office and Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/5">There is one material contract relating to &quot;Outsourced IT contracts&quot; for the provision of IT support services. This contract is with IBM and originated as a comprehensive, PFI outsourcing in 1998. It was re-negotiated at end 2000 as a fixed-price, support agreement, subject to an inflation-related annual increase. The value of the agreement is affected by privity of contract but it has been considered to offer sufficient value for money that it was subsequently extended to provide support for the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. IBM charges the Serious Fraud Office for this extension and the Serious Fraud Office recharges to the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. Prior to 1998 IT was supported in-house both at the Serious Fraud Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/6" class="italic">HM Crown Prosecution Service</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/7">Since its inception in October 2000, HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has relied on the Crown Prosecution Service for the provision of its IT services. However, it used separate one-off contracts with commercial suppliers for the initial design and continuous improvement of its website. In 2002 this contract work totalled &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/8">The design of the website is such that the majority of maintenance work can be conducted in-house. Any specific improvements, or work beyond the in-house capability would be subject to the awarding of separate contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/9">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has budgeted for a maximum cost per annum of &pound;5,000 for both this work and the hosting of the website.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/10" class="italic">Treasury Solicitor's Department</p>
	<p pid=".668W.0/11">Since 1997, the Treasury Solicitor's Department has entered into no contracts where an external organisation delivers and operates IT service on the Department's behalf. The Department's in-house Information Services team provides the IT services for the Department, generally using commercially available software, supported by contractors where necessary.</p>

Authorities were asked to include some key data in their statements, including indicating whether they were committed to NLPG and NLIS. Following assessment of the IEGs submitted in 2002, Ministers of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sought (with the agreement of the Local Government Association and other stakeholders) parliamentary approval for the use of &pound;2.2 million from the Local e-Government programme funds to ensure that all local authorities were committed to supporting the NLPG by December 2003. Specifically, this will fund work to identify the barriers to implementation of the NLPG. Where implemented the NLPG will provide basis for electronic land and property information searches by NLIS and other compatible services. It will remain a decision for local authorities as to whether or not to link to NLIS.</p>

	<p pid=".672W.2/1">The Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber and the Community Housing Task Force have held a number of discussions with the council about their plans for delivering decent homes. The council has benefited from an increase in resources for housing investment from &pound;2.221 million for 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;6.563 million for 2003&ndash;04, including provision for major repairs allowance that was introduced in 2001&ndash;02.

	<p pid=".672W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to visit North-East Lincolnshire and has made no recommendations to North-East Lincolnshire about large scale voluntary transfer in particular, although all authorities are required to have in place arrangements to ensure the delivery of the decent homes target by December 2010. Housing transfer is one of three options available to an authority where additional resources are required to meet this target.</p>

We are clear that this is not something that can be left to the market alone to resolve. That route offers a prospect of years of neglect that will endanger economic resurgence and cause untold suffering for the communities affected. Turning round these areas will require long-term commitment. We have already signalled the Government's commitment through the creation of a &pound;500 million market renewal fund for investment in the pathfinder areas over the next three years. Tackling poor housing stock and empty homes will be a crucial part of the pathfinders work.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.3/3">The Environment Agency has estimated that the total cost of clearing fly tipping by all stakeholders is 100 million. ENCAMS (Environmental Campaigns) also recently completed a survey, where costs were assessed on a different basis. The results of this survey suggested an average spend on clearing fly tipping for each local authority in 2002 of 54,258. No estimates are available, however, to indicate the costs associated with clearing incidents caused by particular individuals or groups of individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.3/4">A clause in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill currently before Parliament will, if successful, require local authorities and the Agency to submit annual data returns to Defra on the amounts and type of illegally dumped waste they deal with. These measures are expected to come into effect in the summer of 2004 and will mean, for the first time, that national data on fly tipping levels will be available.</p>

These payments reflect the liability the office would have had to meet as ongoing Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy if these authorities retained their stock. In respect of the authorities liable to require overhanging debt payments over the two years concerned, the total estimated provision for the Major Repairs Allowances (MRA) within the Housing Revenue Account subsidy is &pound;124.2 million in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;122.3 million in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

The Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Developments, which was produced jointly by representatives of central and. local government and the mobile phone industry, built on Government guidance and the operators' Ten Commitments. The Code has only been in operation since last November.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-15">Tuesday 15 July 2003</phrase> Deloitte and Touche published their report of the Implementation Review of the Ten Commitments to Best Siting Practice for the UK Mobile Industry. A copy of the report is available in the Library of the House. The opinion of Deloitte &amp; Touche is the evidence they have seen of the operators' processes and procedures during the review fairly reflects the operators' assertion that they have made demonstrable progress in implementing the Ten Commitments. However, given the relatively new nature of some of the Commitments at the time of the review some of the processes were not fully operational and there were some areas where implementation was not comprehensive or thorough. Deloitte and Touche made 46 recommendations for improving procedures and all the mobile network operators have accepted all the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.8/3">The operators are committed to commissioning another review in a year's time and I will be asking them to extend the scope of that review to include observance of the Code. This will enable us to assess how effectively the Code has been put into operation since its introduction and whether any changes need to be made.</p>

	<p pid=".691W.2/1">The calculations for both these figures are to be found in Annex 1 of the consultation paper &quot;Tenancy Money: probity and protection&quot;. They start from a figure derived from the Survey of English Housing (SEH), that there are 127,000 tenancies ending each year in which there is a dispute about the deposit. The total cost is found from multiplying this figure by the average cost of each adjudication in the pilot Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS), &pound;150. The benefit is found from multiplying the derived figure on deposit disputes by the average level of deposit (&pound;510, SEH data) and by the average proportion of the total deposit an independent adjudicator would consider should be returned to the tenant (31 per cent. taken from data on disputes in the TDS).</p>

	<p pid=".693W.8/1">A significant number of actions have been taken in the last two years to improve and measure public sector leadership.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.8/2">In the Civil Service, the Senior Appointments Selection Committee (SASC) takes a strategic overview of senior appointments, succession planning and leadership development. Over the last year, SASC (supported by the Cabinet Office) has shifted its annual succession planning round with the aim of providing a more strategic overview of talent in the SCS and those with potential for top posts. It includes individual Departments' assessment of their short- and long-term skills needs to meet priorities, an assessment of their current talent pools and what they are doing to develop individuals through career moves and broader development.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.8/3">The Cabinet Office also collects data on the Senior Civil Service workforce, which include information on progression rates through SCS Pay Bands and leavers. These data are used to inform SASC's succession planning overview.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.8/4">In the wider public services, priority has been given to strengthening leadership. For example, in the NHS through the NHS Leadership Centre, in Schools with the introduction of the Leadership Incentive Grant, and the Police with the establishment of the Central Police Training and Development Authority last year. There has also been a focus on monitoring leadership improvement through inspection, for example the Local Government Comprehensive Performance Assessment corporate reviews.</p>

	<p pid=".698W.5/2">Negotiations of EPAs began in September 2002. As part of these negotiations, each ACP state is required to decide with which regional organisation it wishes to enter into an EPA with the EU; many ACP states are still in the process of exploring the options available to them. Any assessment of the likely impact of EPAs signed between the EU and southern African countries on the economies of ACP states will need to consider the resulting geographical configurations.</p>

	<p pid=".699W.8/1">The Government have long been committed to greater openness in the EU Institutions. This was a key theme of the UK Presidencies in 1992 and 1998. Making it easier to gain access to non-sensitive documents is crucial to this. The Government welcomed Regulation 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. As a result, more documents are released to the public, while genuinely sensitive documents are given the protection they need.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.8/1">The UK is in favour of legislation to provide minimum standards of employment protection, but is keen to maintain the flexibility our individual labour market requires, and which many individual workers prefer. Last year, we implemented new rights for employees on fixed-term contracts in a way that provides a high level of protection for these employees, without unnecessarily reducing employers' flexibility to use fixed-term contracts. We must allow workers choice as well as protection. The proposed Directive on temporary agency work is currently being considered by the European Council of Ministers. The Directive would not need to be implemented in the UK unless and until it is adopted. The Government are keenly aware of the potential impact on UK agencies and agency workers of a Directive that takes no account of conditions in the UK labour market. We are therefore pressing very hard for the UK's legitimate concerns to be recognised.</p>

	<p pid=".705W.2/1">The Government's approach to raising productivity centres on maintaining macroeconomic stability to allow firms and individuals to invest for the future, as well as implementing microeconomic reforms to remove the barriers which prevent markets from functioning efficiently. The Government are addressing historic microeconomic weaknesses in five areas that drive productivity growth&mdash;investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competitive markets.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.2/2">Following the recent review of DTI structure and priorities, the Department has been reorganised in order to put productivity and competitiveness at the heart of our activities. The Department's mission, reflecting the Government's five drivers, is centred on the three objectives of world-class science and innovation, successful business and fair markets. In order to enhance the DTI's capacity to achieve these goals, we are currently working to develop a new strategy. This strategy will set out our longer-term direction; allow us to meet the expectations of our key stakeholders and guide the annual business planning process. The strategy will make the maximum use of the evidence base to inform both policy and delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.2/3">The DTI has already initiated a number of measures which are intended to help drive up productivity. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".705W.2/4" class="indent">publishing the first Manufacturing Strategy for thirty years and launching the Manufacturing Advisory Service;</p>
	<p pid=".705W.2/5" class="indent">working in conjunction with the Department For Education and Skills, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury to produce the recent Skills Strategy White Paper, which contains measures to improve the skills of Britain's work force;</p>

In addition, developments in out of school care including before and after school and during weekends and holidays are making a real difference for children and their families. While the focus of these clubs is care for the children outside the school day, the provision is also about positive play and learning experiences. We launched extended schools through the Education Act 2002, giving schools the powers to provide community facilities, including child care. Child care in schools provides safe, accessible child care for children attending the school and children in the wider community.</p>

	<p pid=".720W.5/1">Sites for academies are usually provided by local education authorities, which transfer ownership to the academies themselves, on a leasehold or freehold basis. Where an academy is sponsored by a church, however, particularly if it replaces an existing church school, the site may be provided by a religious foundation.</p>
	<p pid=".720W.5/2">Our normal expectation is that the site and buildings of an academy will revert to whichever body provided the site initially, in the event they are no longer required for the purposes of the academy. Individual academy funding agreements will make specific provision for this. Where a local education authority has transferred the land or buildings to an academy trust the Secretary of State has powers to transfer the land back to the authority if the academy ceases to exist or moves to another site.</p>

	<p pid=".721W.5/2" class="italic">Connexions</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/3">Greater Merseyside Connexions Partnership (which covers the whole of Sefton) opened in September 2001. Connexions offers advice, guidance and access to personal development opportunities for all young people aged 13&ndash;19 years old (or up to 25 years old if the young person has a learning difficulty or disability). Since April 2002, significant help has been given on 29,500 occasions to young people in Sefton.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/4" class="italic">Positive Activities for Young People (previously Connexions Summer Plus)</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/5">Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) is a new programme for young people, which provides diversionary activities during school holidays. This programme is being delivered by Greater Merseyside Connexions. In Sefton, 210 full-time places will be provided under PAYP from mid July this year with activities focused on the southern end of the borough.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/6">In addition, a minimum of 60 young people will receive targeted support from key workers to ensure that they join and stay with the programme and return to education, training or employment after the holiday period.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/7">Activities will focus on providing young people with opportunities to help them fulfil their potential, as well as diverting them away from crime. The PAYP scheme will include sport, developing skills as DJs, arts, activities promoting the cultural diversity of the area, and outdoor adventure. These will be available throughout the school holiday periods at times appropriate to meet the needs of young people.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/8" class="italic">Transforming Youth Work Development Fund</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/9">The aim of the TYWDF is to raise the overall quality and quantity of youth work. Sefton has received &pound;48,989 from TYWDF in 2003&ndash;04. (This amount adds to the budget provided by the local authority from its education resources).</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/10">Sefton Youth Service has used some of this funding to help develop a project called 'Youth Only Zone', working with the police and Leisure services. This project focuses on tackling anti-social behaviour and street crime by young people. It gives youth workers and the police a number of options to offer young people through a range of activities provided in leisure centres. Last year, 500 young people became involved in 'Youth Only Zone' through the Youth Service. Sefton police have also reported a 20 per cent. reduction in calls about juvenile nuisance since the start of the project.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/11" class="italic">Lifelong Learning Partnerships</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/12">Lifelong Learning Partnerships bring together local learning providers (ranging from voluntary sector to Further Education/Higher Education Institutions) and others such as local government, Connexions Service, trade unions, employers and faith groups.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/13">The Partnerships have two core roles; to promote joint working between partners in support of lifelong learning and to maximise the contribution of learning to local regeneration.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/14">From April 2003, funding is routed through the LSC with Sefton Lifelong Learning Partnership receiving &pound;74,512.</p>

	<p pid=".724W.0/1">The Education Formula Spending (EPS) system, which distributes the bulk of the financial support for schools, sets out not to provide the same level of funding for all pupils but to allow for the extra costs of educating children with additional needs, those in rural areas with sparse populations and those in areas where it costs more to recruit and retain staff. Therefore there are differences in the levels of funding which authorities receive recognising the differences in circumstances. For that reason, Leicestershire receives &pound;380 per pupil (10 per cent.) less in overall resources than the &quot;top&quot; funded county outside London but since 1997&ndash;98 (the last year for which comparable data are available) real terms funding in Leicestershire has increased by 620 (29 per cent.) for primary pupils and by 550 (19 per cent.) for secondary pupils. The following table sets out the other information requested in cash terms between 1997&ndash;98 and 2003&ndash;04. For 2004&ndash;05, we are working with representatives of schools and local education authorities to ensure that every school receives a reasonable per pupil settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".727W.11/1">In elaborating the Lisbon agenda, the European Council has set targets to raise the overall level of skills across the European Union. Member states contribute to the achievement of these targets through their own national strategies and policies. The Skills Strategy will contribute particularly by raising the skill levels and employability of adults in this country through the new entitlement to free tuition for adults seeking their first level 2 qualification, increased support for higher level skills in areas of sectoral or regional priority and by helping adults gain ICT skills as a third basic skill alongside literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.11/2">Within the overall Lisbon agenda, the European Employment Strategy (EES) provides a framework for reaching key Lisbon employment rate targets. Under the EES, member states develop their national employment strategies and policies in the light of the shared priorities agreed at EU level. For the UK these include providing appropriate guidance in the context of initial training and lifelong learning, modernising the apprenticeship system, tackling poor basic skills and promoting better access to learning for adults, including through the promotion of e-learning. These are all being addressed in the Skills Strategy, which will therefore contribute to the EES by equipping workers in this country with the skills they need for lifetime employability and providing other member states with a model for how to develop the skills base demanded by the modern labour market.</p>

	<p pid=".728W.5/1">The low skills equilibrium theory is where, due to adaptation over a number of years to the poor availability of skills in the work force, UK companies often engage in producing more basic, less customised and less skill intensive products than their competitors overseas. This reduces the incentives for individuals and employers to acquire skills, thus becomes self-reinforcing. As we set out in the Underlying Evidence paper for the Skills Strategy that we published in March, it is a vicious circle of low skills, low wages and consumer demand for cheap products and services. The Skills Strategy White Paper makes no reference to a high skills equilibrium.</p>

It found that among those who were qualified to enter higher education but had decided against going the main reasons were because they wanted to start work, because they did not need a higher education qualification for their chosen career or because of the expected costs involved.

The evidence shows that non-completion is a complex process that cannot normally be explained by any single factor.

By the end of the decade they want to move towards half of all 18&ndash;30 year olds participating in HE, but within that target they are committed to ensuring that all those who can benefit from HE will be willing and able to do so, regardless of their background. 'Aimhigher' is the brand name for a range of initiatives through which Government and their key partners aim to widen participation in HE. HEFCE has allocated &pound;265 million to higher education institutions in 2003&ndash;04 for widening access and improving retention. This figure recognises the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and thereby increases the likelihood that they will complete their courses successfully.</p>

We will continue to provide a tuition fee remission grant and, from autumn 2004, full-time HE students with parents on the lowest incomes will be eligible for a new HE Grant of up to &pound;1,000 a year for living costs. No student or parent will have to pay any up-front tuition fee&mdash;they can defer paying these until after they graduate. We are also raising the level of repayment from &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000 to reduce the levels of repayment for all graduates.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.5/1">Since November 2002 I have received 10 letters on the future of Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs), and replied to 6 Parliamentary Questions about ILAs. In addition, some of the 83 responses to our &quot;Developing a National Skills Strategy and Delivery Plan: Progress Report&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-26">26 March</phrase>, including the responses from the CBI and TUC, covered ILA. Correspondents often supported some, but not all, characteristics of ILA, and a number of comments have been mutually contradictory. For example some wished to keep the wide range of providers in the original ILA scheme because they believed that that increased learner choice; others wished to restrict the range of providers to minimise wasteful competition between them and to protect quality. It is, therefore, not possible to categorise representations as simply in favour of, or opposed to, ILA; opinions are usually qualified. What is clear is that the principles of the ILA scheme are still widely supported.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.5/2">As to safeguards, many correspondents suggested that fraud and waste in ILA would be minimised if the assessment process for learning providers was more rigorous. I agree with this view.</p>

	<p pid=".753W.2/1">At national level, we will build a new Skills Alliance to bring together key economic and delivery partners who will work with the Government to drive forward the Skills Strategy. The Alliance will comprise the key departments (Department for Education and Skills, Department of Trade and Industry, Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury), the economic partners (the CBI, the TUC and Small Business Council) and the key delivery agencies. We will also invite the Regional Development Agency in each region, working with its partners, to put forward proposals for joint working at regional and local level. The Sector Skills Councils will be major contributors to the process.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/2">The Skills Alliance will ensure collaboration between key partners through the new regional structures, engage employers, trade unions and their representative organisations, advise the Government on the effectiveness of the Skills Strategy and report annually on progress.</p>

Information is currently being collected from each lead delivery agency to assess what provision there was over the Whitsun half term. Information for all areas is expected to be available by early August. The first quarterly report, reflecting the provision under PAYP so far, will be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.5/2">The employment of staff to deliver PAYP is an issue for Lead Delivery Agents and local delivery partners. It is for them to decide how best to utilise the funding that is provided to them. In addition, &pound;13.75 million has been allocated to Connexions Partnerships for key workers which will provide 435 full-time equivalent posts. These workers will provide targeted support to those young people on the scheme who are most at risk.</p>

In line with our policy set out in the Higher Education White Paper, HEFCE has re-balanced the funding levels between ratings for 2003&ndash;04 to ensure better resourcing for, and improved quality of, the best research. This has meant a reduction in funding for 4 rated departments from &pound;139 million in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;118 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".756W.2/1">The Department does not collect information on the distribution of teaching salaries by school or by local education authority. It is therefore not possible for us to calculate the additional cost of the increase in National Insurance contributions for each local education authority. However, nationally, the increase in additional resources provided for education of &pound;2.7 billion more than match the pressures faced by schools and local education authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.2/2">In introducing the new funding system in 2003&ndash;04, our aim has been to produce the best possible match between the distribution of funds and the differing circumstances and needs of local education authorities. The formula provides the same funding for all comparable pupils right across the country. So the new system consists of a basic amount per pupil&mdash;which is the same everywhere&mdash;with top-ups for pupils with additional educational needs (again the same per pupil everywhere), and for area costs for salaries, recruitment and retention. Authorities which have more deprived pupils and/or receive extra funding to take account of the high costs of recruiting and retaining staff in their area, receive a higher level of funding overall than those which have comparatively low levels of deprivation and/or do not receive additional funding for area costs. But all authorities received an increase of at least 3.2 per cent. per pupil after taking account of the changes to teachers' pension contributions and the additional &pound;28 million grant provided to authorities ensured a minimum effective increase per pupil of 3.2 per cent. per pupil taking account of changes to the Standards Fund. Local education authorities are responsible for deciding the amount of funding available for the Schools Budget.</p>

	<p pid=".757W.5/1">The Department's Annual Schools' Census (ASC) collects information on the numbers of pupils 'known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM)' as a consequence of local authorities (and schools) legal duty to provide them. The ASC does not collect any other information on the socio-economic circumstances of individual pupils or, in aggregate, of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.5/2">The Department is investigating whether information from other departments' datasets can be linked in ways which preserve necessary data confidentialities but provide measures additional to FSM that improve the appropriateness and robustness of socio-economic comparisons of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.5/3">There has been a trend downward over the last few years in the numbers of children 'known to be eligible for FSM', due in part to increased employment. About 80 per cent. of children who are entitled to make a claim for a free meal do so, but the rate varies from school to school over time depending on pupil and parental preferences and economic circumstances. Direct, and fair, interpretations of FSM comparisons within and between schools are therefore complicated and complex.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.5/4">The Department's &quot;Autumn Package of Pupil Performance Information&quot; has shown since 1996 national attainment benchmarks for groups of schools with broadly similar levels of FSM. These are used by schools to gauge their recent relative performances and by OFSTED in discussions with schools during inspection. Schools compare their performances with those of schools in adjacent benchmark groups and bring to bear their detailed knowledge of pupils and their schools in those discussions.</p>

Governing bodies must ensure that teaching materials and programmes used for sex education are in accordance with the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education; and that inappropriate materials are kept out of the classroom. Consulting pupils and their families will help establish what is appropriate and acceptable to them. Where schools work within the SRE guidelines and consult effectively, parents should be reassured about the content of lessons.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.2/1">Borrowers are liable to repay their loans from the April following graduation or otherwise leaving their course. Students who started their course from the 1998/99 academic year will repay income contingent loans. Loans for those who started their course before 1998/99 are repayable on a mortgage style basis. The table shows estimates of average student loan debt at the point at which they entered repayment status for borrowers who became liable to repay their loans in financial years 2000&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/2">New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998/99. Most new students in that year (apart from specified exceptions) received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (about 25 per cent. of the support available) and non means-tested student loans (about 75 per cent. of the support). From 1999/2000, students who entered higher education after 1998/99 received support for maintenance expenditure through loans. About three quarters of the value of these loans is not subject to means-testing. The repayments on these loans are on an income contingent basis.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/3">Students who started their course up to 1997/98, and those who entered in 1998/99 under the existing arrangements, are eligible for mortgage style loans; the ratio of support for these students is roughly 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. non means-tested loan.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/4">The first cohort of students on a three-year degree course who entered higher education under the new student support arrangements became liable for repayment in April 2002. That, and earlier, cohorts includes a disproportionate number of students on shorter courses as well as those who have left higher education before completing their courses. Therefore the average level of debt will not be representative of the average debt experienced by those who complete their courses.</p>

	<p pid=".772W.2/2">The answer to the hon. Member's earlier question was being processed in the usual way and was answered at the earliest opportunity. Provisional statistics on teacher numbers and teacher vacancies at January 2003 were published in April in Statistical First Release 10/2003. In May this year, in response to concerns about the difficulties some schools are facing as a result of changes to the funding arrangements, my Department liaised with local education authorities (LEAs) to make a broad assessment of the extent to which schools were making changes in their teaching staff complements, including making teachers redundant, and the possible reasons for such changes, including falling rolls. This was based on the best information available to local education authorities (LEAs) at that time; many told us that definitive information was not available and that the situation was changing rapidly as schools finalised their budgets and their staffing. In addition they advised that a significant number of the redundancy notices were 'protective' and were likely to be withdrawn as the situation within schools and the LEA became clearer.</p>

	<p pid=".773W.3/1">Following consultation on the Pensions Green Paper, which was published by the Department for Work and Pensions last December, raising the pension age for teachers and other public servants from 60 to 65 is one of the measures being taken forward. This reflects both increased life expectancy and the fact that many people want to work longer and build up their pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/2">Details of how and when the changes might be introduced for new entrants to the Teachers Pension Scheme and the transitional arrangements for existing scheme members remain to be worked out. These will be considered alongside changes to improve scheme benefits, and there will be a wide-ranging review of the scheme involving full consultation with union and employer representatives. All of the issues associated with an increase in the pension age of members of the Teachers' Pension Scheme will be considered during the review. A change for new entrants is unlikely before 2006 and will be much later for existing staff.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/3">We have, nevertheless, given teachers five clear guarantees.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/4" class="indent">Serving teachers who are currently aged 50 and over will not be affected by changes to the existing pension arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/5" class="indent">Pension benefits earned before the new arrangements start will not be affected. Whatever changes are made will not affect pension benefits already earned from past service.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/6" class="indent">Teachers will still be able to retire at, before or after 60 as they do now. At retirement, pension and lump sum benefits will take account of the number of years of service the teacher has worked before and after the changes were introduced.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/7" class="indent">These changes will be talked through fully with teachers and their union representatives, as well as with employers. Unions will be part of this process and there will be a full consultation exercise before any changes are made to the Teachers' Pension Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/8" class="indent">Opportunities to introduce other benefits and flexibilities into the Scheme will be fully explored, particularly those that aid the transition from work to retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.3/9">We remain fully committed to the provision of a good quality pension scheme for teachers which is valued by the membership and which contributes effectively to the recruitment and retention of teachers.</p>

The High Court and county court may impose a fixed prison sentence, not exceeding two years (two months in the magistrates court). A fine not exceeding &pound;2,500 may also be imposed. The court may also change the residence of the child from one parent to the other. In considering any penalty, the courts take into account its likely impact on the child's welfare. The Government acknowledges that it is unsatisfactory for contact orders to be flouted with impunity and for children to be denied contact with one of their parents, when the court has found this to be in their interests.</p>

Since January 2002 the committee has given favourable opinions on draft Commission decisions that Argentina and Guernsey provide adequate data protection. The committee has also had preliminary discussions of other matters that could lead to Commission decisions, such as the Commission's current discussions with the United States' authorities about the disclosure of airline passenger information. The Commission keeps the committee informed about a wide range of matters relating to data protection. These have included: the activities of the working party of data protection supervisory authorities set up under Article 29 of the Directive; the appointment of the European Data Protection Supervisor; and the Commission's first report on the implementation of the Directive.</p>

All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be diverted within the buyer country, re-exported under undesirable conditions, used for internal repression or external aggression, or to abuse human rights.</p>

It will introduce tough new controls on trafficking and brokering, the intangible transfer of military technology, and technical assistance. It is a significant step forward. It will ensure the UK cannot be used as a base for irresponsible trade in arms to undesirable destinations.</p>

	<p pid=".791W.5/1">The first visit took place in March 2002 and the second in March 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/2">The first comprised three D Band (Home Civil Service Principal equivalent) officers from different sections of our estate departments in Croydon. Two visited for five working days, and one for two, to inspect properties the Post had short-listed as potentially suitable as a new Residence. The cost of the three return flights was &pound;11,986. Subsistence totalled &pound;2,031. There would also have been some minor local expenditure on transport within San Francisco and photocopying.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/3">The second visit also comprised three people: one from the Senior Management Structure (SMS) of the FCO, one D Band officer and one external adviser. The combined cost of air fares was &pound;11,612. The SMS officer and the Estate Adviser spent five days in San Francisco but the D Band officer remained for a further six days (including the weekend) for a detailed technical investigation of the property selected. Subsistence totalled &pound;4,026. Sundry expenditure including telephone calls totalled approximately &pound;55. Local transport was arranged and paid for by the Consulate-General and the total cost is not readily available.</p>

We continue to uphold EU sanctions (an arms embargo and visa restrictions) and support related action in the UN. There are currently no restrictions on the import of coltan into the UK.

	<p pid=".795W.8/1">The UN Expert Panel report on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), published in October 2002, provides extensive details of the widespread exploitation of the DRC's natural resources, including coltan. The report states that elite networks linked to the governments/militaries of the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda are the main players in the smuggling and/or sale of coltan; Burundi's role is small in comparison. Such exploitation continues today, with the active co-operation of the various rebel groups operating in the eastern part of DRC. The human rights of many citizens of the DRC have already been severely eroded by many years of violent civil war and the ensuing chaos. The trade in coltan has played a part in this conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".798W.5/1">The Government wine cellar contains a mix of fine wines, beverage wines and spirits and liqueurs. Stock levels vary but generally the cellar contains approximately 37,000 bottles, of which fewer than 700 are spirits or liqueurs. There has been no significant variation in the stock levels since 1993. It is not possible to give a break down of the ratio of wines to spirits, etc over the last 10 years without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.5/2">Fine wines are bought young and then stored until ready for use, enabling aged wines of excellent value to be used by the Government for their hospitality needs. The value of the stock is subjective and bears no relation to the purchase costs. The current value of the stock is estimated to be in the region of &pound;1.7 million.</p>

	<p pid=".799W.2/2">Since then, there have been regular exchanges at Ministerial and official levels. During those, the situation in post-handover Hong Kong has frequently been discussed.

The site has now been secured, and the radio-active material there sealed in concrete. There is minimal likelihood of further looting. Initial indications are that there is little or no immediate radiation sickness evident in the population, but there may be longer term health risks to people who have been exposed to radiation. A task force has been set up in Baghdad to take forward action on recovering radio-active material that has been taken from the site, and monitoring the long-term health of people at risk of exposure to radiation. The task force includes representatives from the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Iraqi Ministry of Health and Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission, as well as the World Health Organisation.</p>

	<p pid=".814W.0/1">Since his election victory in 2001, President Bolanos' administration has been dominated by his attempts to wrest the power to govern from his allegedly corrupt predecessor, Arnoldo Aleman. In December 2002, the National Assembly voted to strip Aleman of his parliamentary immunity; he is currently under house arrest and could now face criminal prosecution. We have assured Nicaragua of our commitment to good governance, transparency, economic reform and exposing corruption and recognise the President's evident equal commitment to these objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".818W.0/10">In all cases, the EU country concerned consulted EU partners before issuing visas. The EU's Common Position of February 2002. imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe, specifically allowed member states to grant exemptions where &quot;travel is justified on the grounds of humanitarian need, including religious obligation, or on grounds of attending meetings of international bodies or conducting political dialogue that promotes democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe&quot;. This clause was made more explicit when the Common Position was rolled over in 2003, to state that a member state shall grant a visa when it is &quot;bound by an obligation of international law&quot;. In all these cases, the EU country in question had a legal obligation to grant visas.</p>
	<p pid=".818W.0/11">In the case of the attendance of Robert and Grace Mugabe and Stan Mudenge at the France-Africa summit in Paris in February 2003, France argued for an exemption to be granted under article 3.3 of the Common Position, where travel is justified on the grounds of conducting political dialogue that promotes democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We did not want Robert Mugabe at the France-Africa summit in Paris. We made this clear to the French Government, at various levels as well as to other EU partners. The meeting took place two days after the EU sanctions on Zimbabwe were due to expire. Our priority then was to ensure a roll-over of those sanctions. The roll-over required a consensus among EU member states. This was achieved on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-18">18 February 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".819W.9/1">The Government's policy on the use of phosphates and nitrates is that they should be applied in accordance with good nutrient management practice, and in compliance with legal requirements. This ensures that the necessary quantities of nutrients are available when required for uptake by the crop and that losses to the environment are minimised. Defra supports the Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme which trains and certifies people who advise farmers and growers on the appropriate use of fertilisers. Details on the optimum rate and timing for spreading phosphates and nitrates are contained within Defra booklet RB209 'Fertiliser Recommendations for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops'. Adoption of these recommendations helps to reduce the risk of applying more nutrients than the crop needs and thereby minimises the risk of run off. There is evidence that farmers are following these recommendations. Application rates of nitrogen, phosphate and the other major nutrient, potash have been lower in the past decade than in the 1980s, despite an increase in crop production.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.9/2">The statutory Water Code (Defra PB0587) provides further essential guidance on the use and handling of fertilisers to minimise the risk of nutrient losses to water. Farmers operating in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones are obliged to implement Action Programme Measures, which are based largely on the Water Code.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.9/3">Defra is currently undertaking a review of the problem of diffuse pollution of water by agriculture, to identify the most cost effective way to achieve further reductions in pollution to comply with the Water Framework Directive and safeguard conservation sites.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.9/4">In collaboration with the EA and industry, Defray is developing a software tool to provide nutrient management decision support for farmers and advisers. The first version of the tool should be available next year, both as a module of existing farm management software packages and as a free stand-alone version.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.9/5">The Government encourages the use of manure as a valuable fertiliser thus helping to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers. One of the ways in which this is done is through the availability of the MANNER (Manure Nitrogen Evaluation Routine) Decision Support System which helps farmers accurately predict the fertiliser nitrogen value of organic manures on a field specific basis.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.9/6">Defra agri-environment schemes such as Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs), the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) and the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) fund management options which involve the reduction of input levels to grassland and arable farming systems. They also contain options such as buffer strips which benefit resource protection. ESAs and CSS are currently being reviewed in consultation with partners with a view to introducing a new scheme in 2005. It is proposed that resource protection should be an important objective of the new scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.9/7">In addition, Defra is currently piloting a new Entry Level Scheme which aims to introduce simple yet effective environmental measures across a wide area of farmland. The pilot scheme includes options to prepare nutrient and manure management plans and other on-farm management which will deliver resource protection benefits. Following an assessment of the pilot scheme we intend to draw up proposals to roll it out across England in 2005.</p>

Base data for 1993 and 1994 cannot be validated, and figures for all years cannot be reconciled with published data and have therefore been rounded. The figures show the number of cases where TB was not confirmed (rather than 'negative' cases). Post mortem examinations are less than 100% sensitive so failure to detect visible lesions or culture Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) from samples does not confirm the absence of infection or that the animal has not been exposed to M. bovis. The figures also include cases where culture results are still outstanding and where samples were not taken.</p>
	<p pid=".822W.5/23">3. In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests that would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the numbers of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".823W.2/1">The single intradermal comparative cervical test (SICCT) is the only skin test currently used in Great Britain for the detection of TB in cattle. This test and the less specific single intradermal test (SIT) were, until recently, the only TB tests officially recognised by the European Union for use in cattle. The skin tests, along with the application of disease control principles, have achieved TB eradication in many countries.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.2/2">Last October, we begun a field evaluation of the gamma-interferon test, an in-vitro assay that measures the immune response to M. bovis of T-cells in cattle blood. This laboratory-based blood test was officially recognised by the EU in July 2002, but only for use as a supplement to the SICCT in TB affected herds. The test is considered more sensitive than the SICCT, but less specific, meaning that it results in a higher probability of false positives. For this reason, the gamma interferon test cannot be used as a screening test for TB for the time being.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.2/3">Diagnostic tests are never 100 per cent. accurate and there is often a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Although the gamma interferon test is not sufficiently specific to replace the SICCT, the use of the two tests in parallel has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle in herds where TB has been confirmed.</p>

Restructuring of businesses and greater efficiency encouraged by decoupling might give rise to further improvements. Overall, this is estimated to be worth &pound;270 million, but is likely to be shared between producers, consumers and businesses in other sectors. A breakdown of these figures for the sectors listed by the hon. Member is not available.</p>

	<p pid=".825W.2/2">In general, single payment entitlements will take the form of a designated amount per hectare for certain number of hectares and be allocated on the basis of farmers' average claims under the existing CAP direct aid schemes in the reference period 2000&ndash;02. The annual claim for payment against each entitlement will need to be accompanied by an eligible hectare, which may be on the holding that gave rise to the entitlement or on any other holding in the same member state. We expect &quot;eligible hectare&quot; to be defined as any agricultural area of the holding taken up by arable land and permanent pasture except areas under permanent crops, forests or used for non-agricultural purposes. Cross-compliance conditions will apply to those hectares and all other agricultural land on the holding. Those rules and restrictions will apply to tenants and non-tenants alike. A new management committee may establish additional detailed rules at EU level.</p>

	<p pid=".825W.5/2">Farmers, whether tenants or owner occupiers, will be able to sell the single payment entitlements allocated to them once they have fulfilled the relevant conditions in claiming payment on at least 80 per cent. of those entitlements in one year. Sale may also be possible once entitlement holders have voluntarily given up to the national reserve all the entitlements that they have not claimed in the first year of operation of the single payment scheme. Landlords of tenant farmers will only be able to sell entitlements that they are either allocated to them in their own right as a result of claims for CAP direct aids during the scheme reference period or purchased by them once the scheme is introduced. All sales may take place with or without land and will only be permissible if they are to another farmer within the same member state. Member states may further restrict sales to farmers within the same region.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.14/1">The role of the DWI is to audit all the statutory water companies in England and Wales. The companies are required to undertake sampling and analysis of public water supplies in accordance with the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 and subsequent amendments. These Regulations set out the frequency of monitoring, the locations where the samples have to be taken and the standards that have to be met. The regulatory standards incorporate those set out in the EC Directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption (80/778/EEC), which in turn are based on the World Health Organisation guideline values for drinking water quality. There are currently 26 water companies. In the last six years water companies have only experienced occasional failures of a standard. The level of compliance for all water companies rose from 99.75 per cent. in 1997 to 99.87% in 2002. The WHO guideline values for various constituents of drinking water, including certain minerals, represent the concentration of a constituent that does not result in any significant risk to consumers' health, usually over a lifetime of consumption.</p>

	<p pid=".829W.5/2">The Climate Change Levy was launched in April 2001 to help fund measures to promote energy efficiency in business and the public sector. As part of the CCL package a number of measures were introduced including:</p>
	<p pid=".829W.5/3" class="indent">The EGA scheme offering tax incentives to firms investing in approved energy saving technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".829W.5/4" class="indent">The Carbon Trust (CT) was launched &quot;to take the lead on energy efficiency for business and the public sector, and to support the development of a low carbon economy&quot;, delivered through the trust's two main programmes: the Low Carbon Innovation Programme, and Action Energy (formerly the non-domestic part of the Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme) the UK's main energy efficiency information, advice and research programme for organisations in the public and private sectors. Since 1989, the EEBPP has helped many organisations save up to 20 per cent. of their energy bills, which equates to total UK energy savings of around &pound;800 million a year.</p>
	<p pid=".829W.5/5">Envirowise (formerly the Environmental Technology Best Practice Programme) is the main programme promoting the resource efficiency message to business. Since it was established in 1994, the EETBP has helped UK business make resource efficiency savings of approximately &pound;800 million.</p>
	<p pid=".829W.5/6">A review of &quot;A better quality of life&quot; has just started, to have a revised strategy in place by 2005. We intend to take a fresh look at how we achieve sustainable development in the UK, building on the current strategy to improve delivery.</p>

The draft of the new treaty prepared by the Convention on Future of Europe for discussion at the Inter Governmental Conference this Autumn retains the key provisions of the current treaties that refer to the environment and to the need for environmental protection requirements to be taken into account in other Community policies with a view to promoting sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid=".840W.2/1">During 2003, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had discussions with US and EU colleagues to take forward global environmental policy and international sustainable development in the following fora: the G8 Environment Ministers meeting in Paris in April; the High Level Ministerial Segment of the eleventh session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD11) in New York in April; the Kiev Environment for Europe Conference in May and the European Environment Councils in Brussels in March and June. She has also corresponded in writing and by telephone with US and EU colleagues on these issues. The WSSD highlighted the need for real change and action&mdash;this has remained her main focus.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.2/2">The positive outcome of the CAP reform negotiations at the European Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg in June will also play an important role in reducing environmental degradation and pursuing sustainable development objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.2/3">Other Defra Ministers have also discussed these issues with US and EU colleagues at, among others, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 22nd Governing Council in Nairobi, the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit in February and the 3rd World Water Forum in Kyoto in March.</p>

	<p pid=".840W.5/1">The public debate on GM issues ('GM Nation?') is being managed by an independent steering board at arm's length from Government. The public phase of the debate was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June</phrase> and was followed by six regional launch events. Further local meetings have been organised throughout the UK by organisations and individuals, and the public were also able to participate via the interactive debate website. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July</phrase>, over 17,000 feedback questionnaires had been received. The Steering Board is due to submit its report to Government in September.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/2">The public debate is one strand of a wider GM dialogue announced by the Secretary of State last July, which also comprises a Science Review and a study by the Strategy Unit into the overall costs and benefits of GM crops. The Strategy Unit's report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July</phrase>; the report is available online at <a href="http://www.strategy.gov.uk">www.strategy.gov.uk</a> and a copy has also been placed in the Library. The report of the science review was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>. Both the Strategy Unit and the Science Review panel have invited comments on their reports. The Food Standards Agency also published its report on &quot;Consumers views on GM food&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-16">16 July</phrase>, which represents the FSA's contribution to the public debate.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/3">Separately, we are expecting publication of the results of our Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) crop trials this autumn, which will then be in the public domain, and people will be able to comment on them if they wish. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, which will provide independent advice to Government on the implications of the FSE results, has decided to hold a special meeting in public to take evidence on the results from experts and stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/4">Before any GM crop can be cultivated in the EU, each member state has the opportunity to scrutinise the application for marketing consent for commercial cultivation. Applications are considered on a case-by-case basis under EC Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the environment. The directive provides for mandatory public consultation on each application.</p>
	<p pid=".840W.5/5">We will decide our policy on the commercial cultivation of GM crops based on an objective assessment of all the available information, including the reports of the three strands of the GM dialogue and the results of our Farm Scale Evaluation crop trials.</p>

	<p pid=".842W.3/2">Projections for future years are affected by a range of factors, including the likely increase in costs of treatment and disposal, and the impact of this change in costs on producers efforts to minimise waste.

These and other factors are currently being investigated in support of work on possible scenarios for the hazardous waste forum, which is due to report in the autumn. The scenarios currently envisaged suggest a range for consignable hazardous waste of between 4.3 and 7.3 million tonnes per annum over the next five years. It is likely that the proportion of this waste being consigned to landfill will decrease markedly as costs of landfill disposal increase, and treatment requirements apply, making alternative treatments more economically attractive and in some cases necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.8/1">Until recently, landfill sites were licensed under the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. Under this system, the Environment Agency is obliged to ensure that, when issuing a waste management licence, the activities to which the licence relate do not cause pollution of the environment, harm to health or serious detriment to the amenities of the locality. The Agency is also obliged to modify the conditions of the licence if it appears that these impacts could be caused by the continuation of the landfill activities. If remedial measures are needed, it is for the licence holder to cover the cost of these, and the cost will vary depending on the nature of the works needed. No national figures have been collated on the actual numbers of landfills where modifications specifically to tackle pollution have taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.8/2">The Landfill Directive introduced stringent new standards for landfill sites to protect the environment. The Environment Agency has begun re-permitting all landfill sites under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002. The programme is expected to be completed by March 2007. As part of this process, all operational sites needed to submit a Conditioning Plan to the Agency by July 2002 which gave an outline of the measures that need to be taken by each site to meet the new standards. These plans are available on the Agency's public register.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.8/3">The Government assessed the cost of meeting the Landfill Directive in a Regulatory Impact Assessment. We estimated that the Directive brought forward a number of requirements that will add between &pound;2.20 and &pound;4.40 per tonne to the mean cost of waste disposal, with costs ranging from &pound;0 to &pound;120 per tonne for specific waste streams. These costs will largely be passed back to the waste producers, reflecting the polluter pays principle, and will provide a further incentive to waste producers to reuse, recycling or otherwise minimise their waste production.</p>

Where quota is confiscated, under the current UK legislation the quota holder has six years in which to resume production and thus have the quota restored. The new European Council quotas regulation, which is still under negotiation, provides for this period to be reduced to two years. Currently, only the quota holder may apply for restoration of quota but we are considering amending UK legislation to allow anyone with an interest in the holding/quota to apply.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.0/3">Although representations have been made to the Department with regard to landlord/tenant issues in the light of the Thomsen judgment, it is not for Defra to intervene in cases where private tenancy agreements give rise to quota disputes between landlords and their tenants.</p>

	<p pid=".851W.2/1">The Environment Agency, which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by Defra, authorises releases of radioactivity to the environment from nuclear licensed sites and non-nuclear premises in England and Wales. Authorisations specify limits on the amounts of radioactivity that may be discharged. The Environment Agency requires nuclear site operators to carry out monitoring of their own discharges and of the environment in the vicinity of their sites, to demonstrate the effectiveness of these controls.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/2">The Environment Agency also commissions independent check sampling of authorised discharges and conducts a comprehensive programme to monitor radioactivity in the environment resulting from such discharges. Results have been published annually by the Environment Agency in its report &quot;Radioactivity in the Environment&quot;, copies of which are in the Library. From 2003, the results will be published in &quot;Radioactivity in Food and the Environment&quot; (RIFE), which will be a joint publication between the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Department of Environment, Northern Ireland and the Food Standards Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/3">Defra co-ordinates the monitoring of radioactivity in air, rainwater and drinking water at locations throughout the UK and submits the results to the European Commission in compliance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Euratom Treaty. The results are included in &quot;Radioactivity in the Environment&quot; and will be included in RIFE from 2003. The Food Standards Agency carries out its own extensive programme of monitoring radioactivity, to ensure that discharges do not adversely affect food safety, and it submits data to the Commission on radioactivity in dairy milk and a typical mixed diet. The Food Standards Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency have jointly published their monitoring results annually in RIFE, copies of which are in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/4">Defra is also responsible for operation and maintenance of the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network (RIMNET) which is designed to detect radioactivity released as a result of an accident outside the UK. RIMNET continuously monitors gamma radiation at 93 locations throughout the UK and raises an alert if pre-set levels are exceeded.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/5">The great majority of radioactivity in the environment arises from natural sources, such as the release of radon gas from the ground. Radon can accumulate in buildings and may contaminate private water supplies in some areas of the UK. Defra conducts an ongoing measurement programme of radon in homes and has carried out research in partnership with West Devon borough council into the levels of radon in drinking water from private boreholes and wells.</p>

	<p pid=".852W.11/1">There is currently no ban on landfilling of recyclable materials and no review of a ban is due to be carried out in 2006. However, the Strategy Unit's Report, &quot;Waste Not, Want Not&quot;, recommended that Defra and DTI should review the case for a ban on the landfilling of recyclable products in 2006&ndash;07, and at the same time, consider the case for a similar ban on incinerating recyclable products.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.11/2">In their response to the Report, the Government said they would like to see increased utilisation of valuable resources which are currently wasted but many materials will only be recycled if there is demand for them. Developing sustainable markets for recyclable materials is, therefore, an important prerequisite to a ban&mdash;the Government do not want to create a new problem by requiring the long-term storage of recyclable materials for which markets have not been developed. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) was created to help develop these markets and the Government will continue to support WRAP'S role in market development. It would be preferable to avoid bans until other, more flexible, options have been exhausted.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.11/3">However, the Government will review progress in market development and recycling rates in 2006&ndash;07, and reconsider the case for banning disposal of recyclable products or materials then. The Strategy Unit has specifically mentioned a ban on biodegradable material if the other instruments designed to meet Article 5 of the Landfill Directive are failing to make progress. The system of tradable landfill allowances being set up under the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill will progressively reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being disposed of to landfill.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.8/1">The Government's statutory targets for recycling have been set under the Best Value regime. The Secretary of State has powers under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999 to act where local authorities are failing to deliver best value. The way in which these powers would be used in support of Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting of household waste is set out in Annex A of &quot;Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies&quot; (DETR March 2001), which can be found on Defra's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm</a> or in the Library of the House. The protocol to which Annex A refers has been agreed with the Local Government Association setting out the principles under which these powers will be used, and has been revised recently.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/2">The Government have made it clear that they will work with local authorities to ensure that such failures are minimised, and that intervention will be the exception. The powers would be used predominantly to achieve improvements in service delivery, as opposed to tackling procedural failures. The nature and severity of the intervention will vary, and need to reflect several factors such as the amount by which the standard is missed, the steps a local authority had taken to achieve the standard, external factors such as problems with a market for a particular material, or unusual occurrences such as the recent fuel crisis and the likelihood of the local authority meeting the standard in the immediate future. If there was evidence to suggest that a local authority was not taking the right sort of steps in respect of its waste management duties generally, or its recycling standards in particular, then Ministers have made clear that they will take that very seriously.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.8/15">The amount of hazardous waste sent to landfill in future years is affected by a number of factors, and it is difficult to predict the relative impact of these factors with any accuracy. The factors include the clear likelihood that the number of hazardous waste landfills after July 2004 will reduce significantly as a result of requirements in the Landfill Directive. The directive requirements, including the ending of co-disposal in July 2004, the requirements of the waste acceptance criteria, and the need for pre-treatment before wastes are landfilled will also increase the cost of disposal of hazardous waste, which in turn is likely to provide a greater incentive for the reduction of the amount and hazardousness of waste at source. Set against these factors are the impacts of changes to the European hazardous waste list adopted in January 2002 which introduce a number of new waste streams as hazardous.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.8/16">The Government have established a Hazardous Waste Forum for all relevant stakeholders to discuss these issues and those relating to the provision of treatment capacity for hazardous waste. To that end, the forum has established two sub groups to urgently consider (i) the effects of changes in legislation on producers, the scope for further waste prevention and minimisation and the consequent effect on hazardous waste arisings, and, (ii) treatment options and capacity. A third sub-group will build on this work to produce an advisory document in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".862W.2/1">The technical and regulatory requirements of the Landfill Directive, including the provisions of Articles 8 and 10, were implemented by the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002. Ensuring that financial provision is available is a requirement on the landfill operator. The Environment Agency sets out a range of mechanisms that it considers to be adequate to meet the financial provisions requirement in its Waste Management Licensing Financial Provision Manual. Landfill operators due to be re-permitted under the terms of the Landfill Directive were informed of this position in November 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/2">Discussions are taking place between the Government, the Environment Agency and the industry about how the requirement of Article 8 of the directive might best be satisfied given the various aims of the Landfill Directive and the particular need to ensure appropriate safeguards against insolvent operators are in place. We have not yet made an assessment of the costs as this is dependent on the outcome of these discussions.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/3">In the meantime, the Environment Agency did commission work on the long-term liability that landfills pose to England and Wales. Part of this work, carried out by AEA Netcen, calculated that the net present value of landfill liabilities (ie the closure and aftercare costs of completed landfills) up to 2020 would be between &pound;3-&pound;3.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/4">Article 10 of the directive is concerned with passing on the full costs of landfill to waste producers. To meet this, the regulations place a requirement on the operator of a landfill. This makes it a condition of the permit issued for the landfill, that the charges the operator makes for the disposal of waste at the landfill covers a number of aspects. These include the setting up and operating of the landfill, the costs of the financial provision and the estimated cost for the closure and aftercare of the landfill for a period of at least 30 years from its closure. Passing the full cost to the waste producer upholds the 'polluter pays' principle.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.2/5">Officials have met the industry at regular intervals to discuss these and other issues and will continue to do so. I met the Chief Executive of the Environment Services Association shortly after my appointment to this post. I understand my predecessor met representatives of the waste management industry on frequent occasions.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.9/1">American mink are an invasive non-native species and were introduced into Great Britain for fur farming in 1929. Release of mink into the wild is prohibited under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Their population has continued to increase in range and numbers it is thought the rate of increase is declining.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.9/2">The responsibility for the control of feral mink rests with those people most likely to benefit from such control, that is, individual landowners and occupiers. It is entirely at their discretion as to whether they wish to take such action against mink on their land.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.9/3">However, predation by mink has been a factor in the decline of our native water vole population. The Government's Biodioversity Action Plan (BAP) for water vole encourages humane control of mink where they pose a threat to water vole populations.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.9/4">There are various initiatives under way, limited geographically and financially, including some mink trapping in river catchments, supported by combinations of the Environment Agency (the lead organisation for the water vole BAP), English Nature and the local Wildlife Trusts, and other conservation organisations. These aim for local suppression of mink numbers, for example to assist water vole populations, rather than eradication.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.9/5">Defra has no current plans for an eradication programme given the wide distribution of mink and the costs associated using current techniques for control.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.5/1">The trafficking of children is part of a wide range of issues relating to the migration of poor people to better their lives, and to their vulnerability to national and international smugglers and traffickers. Trafficking is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's aim is to work to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that can lead to such abuse. Through our programmes to promote sustainable development and end poverty, DFID is helping to reduce the circumstances that give rise to this appalling trade, and which make women and children especially vulnerable. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection and justice in line with international treaties.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.5/2">For example, in south-east Asia, we are supporting the International Labour Organisation's work to reduce the trafficking of women and girls, many of whom would enter the sex industry, in Laos, Thailand, China (Yunnan), Cambodia and Vietnam. It involves a number of activities to raise awareness and prevent the trade. In the Balkans, we recently supported the International Organisation for Migration in training the various agencies dealing with the victims of trafficking, including police, social workers and the legal profession, in order to create and disseminate models of good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.5/3">The Government are also committed to helping to eliminate child labour, particularly the worst forms such as child slavery and all forms of abusive or exploitative work. Many programmes supported by DFID help end these practices and provide assistance to such children and their families through improving livelihood opportunities, and access to education, health, justice and protection, and through our support to the promotion of socially responsible business such as the Ethical Trading Initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".872W.2/1">A number of commodity stabilisation mechanisms (including buffer stocks arrangements and export quotas) have been employed in the past, generally within the framework of International Commodity Agreements concluded between producer and consuming countries. In general, these mechanisms have not been successful and their practical limitations have been clearly demonstrated in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.2/2">Consequently, the UK is not supportive of direct intervention in commodity markets through globally imposed or similarly orchestrated measures designed to maintain or stabilise commodity prices. Rather, the UK favours initiatives that are voluntary, transparent, financially self-sustaining and which minimise market distortions.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.2/3">DFID therefore does not intend to undertake any formal re-assessment of the potential role of commodity stabilisation mechanisms in future trading relations between the European Union and developing countries. Moreover, it is DFID's view that other institutions, such as the European Commission or the Common Fund for Commodities, might be better placed to conduct any such future assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.2/1">DFID recognises the importance of environmental assessment in ensuring that environmental sustainability is integrated into development policy, planning, programmes and projects.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/2">In line with this, DFID has recently updated its environmental screening procedures to make them more efficient and effective in addressing:</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/3" class="indent">changing ways that aid is being delivered (such as by direct budget support and sector-wide approaches); and</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/4" class="indent">the need to better respond to the opportunities that environmental considerations provide for improving the prospects for achieving sustainable development, the Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction, while also recognising the need to manage risks.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/5">The new procedures, and guidance on the screening process, are detailed in DFID's Environment Guide (2003). This has been revised and is available to the public on DFID's website.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/6">Where appropriate, screening will initiate a more comprehensive appraisal and, if necessary, a full environmental impact assessment in the case of projects or strategic environmental assessment in the case of policies, plans and programmes. Examples include:</p>

These include support for: Comprehensive Investment Climate Assessments by the World Bank Group and the Commonwealth Business Council, which help to identify investment obstacles in particular countries; research by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and NGOs on the benefits and costs of foreign direct investment; and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) programme of technical assistance, which helps developing countries build their capacity to better understand, attract and regulate foreign investment. The Government also believe that an international investment agreement negotiated in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) could complement these and other initiatives aimed at facilitating foreign investment flows to developing countries.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.3/1">In 1999, the UK Government led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) framework to ensure that it provides these countries with a permanent solution to their debt problem and frees up resources to tackle poverty. The merit of the new framework is that countries qualify for debt relief if their debts exceed either 150 per cent. of their annual export earnings or 250 per cent. of Government revenues, whichever gives the greater amount of debt relief. Relief is provided to bring each country's ratios down to these levels. The reduced debt sustainability ratios under this new framework have allowed more countries to benefit from the enhanced HIPC initiative, with deeper levels of debt relief.</p>

It is essential that access is given to national and international agencies to improve water supplies and sanitation.</p>

	<p pid=".877W.8/1">The UK Government agree that heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) must receive the resources they need to finance their Poverty Reduction Strategies. In calculating their levels of debt sustainability, account should be taken of this. But debt relief alone cannot deliver the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Deeper debt relief to HIPC countries would not significantly increase the net amount of development finance available, as this would have to come mainly from the multilateral development institutions since most bilateral debt has already been written off. We therefore support debt relief which is deep enough to ensure debt sustainability, while recognising that additional donor resources are needed to enable HIPC countries to meet the MDGs.</p>

	<p pid=".878W.8/1">The second summit of the African Union (AU) in Maputo in July focused on the internal mechanisms of the organisation. Mozambique took over the Presidency from South Africa and Joaquim Chissano, President of Mozambique, will Chair the AU for the next year. Alpha Oumar Konare, ex-President of Mali, was voted Chair of the AU Commission and Patrick Mazimhaka of Rwanda was elected Vice-Chair.</p>
	<p pid=".878W.8/2">The following Commissioners of the AU were elected: Peace and Security, Said Djinnit (Algeria); Political Affairs, Dolly Joiner (The Gambia); Infrastructure and Energy, Bernard Zoba (Congo Brazzaville); Social Affairs, Gawanas Bience Philomina (Namibia); Human Resources, Science and Technology, Saida Agrebi (Tunisia); Trade and Industry, Elisabeth Tankeu, (Cameroon); and Rural Economy and Agriculture, Rosebud Kurwijila, (Tanzania). The position of Commissioner for Economic Affairs is yet to be filled.</p>
	<p pid=".878W.8/3">The budget of the AU will increase from $31 million to $43 million in the next year and staffing is set to double to approximately 761 in the long term. The contributions of the richer countries of the AU will rise to 8.5 per cent., while the contributions from poorer countries will be 0.75 per cent. and those from the poorest will fall to 0.25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".878W.8/4">The Pan African Parliament and the Peace and Security Council each require 27 ratifications to be established. This was not achieved at the AU Summit. However, more countries did ratify: the Pan African Parliament now has 17 signatures and the Peace and Security Council 15 (although this number may have increased since the Summit). In the event of the Peace and Security Council receiving 27 ratifications before the next AU Summit, the Assembly mandated the Executive Council to elect the membership of the Peace and Security Council. No decision was taken on the location of the Pan African Parliament. The Assembly also adopted the Draft Protocol on the Court of Justice of the AU, which is now open to ratification by member states.</p>
	<p pid=".878W.8/5">The Assembly decided that the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) will be integrated into the AU in three years, or when the relevant institutions of the AU are in place, whichever comes first. The integration will be overseen by Alpha Oumar Konare, Chair of the AU Commission, and President Olusegun Obasanjo, Chair of the Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee of NEPAD.</p>

	<p pid=".883W.6/4" class="indent">The frequency with which cancer survival statistics are updated depends on how commonly the cancer occurs. Cancer survival rates are routinely estimated for eight major cancers, which account for almost 60 per cent. of all cancers. These include stomach and oesophageal cancer. The latest available survival rates for the eight cancers are for patients diagnosed in 1993&ndash;95 and followed up to the end of 2000. Five years relative survival rates by sex and age group for England are available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D4924.xls">http//www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D4924.xls</a>. The five year relative survival rates for stomach cancer were 11.1 per cent. and 11.8 per cent. for men and women respectively, and for oesophageal cancer were 6.7 per cent. and 7.7 per cent. respectively.</p>

	<p pid=".883W.6/6" class="indent">Pancreatic cancer is one of the twenty most common cancers, which together account for almost 90 per cent. of all cancers. The latest available cancer survival figures for those sites not included in the eight mentioned above, are for patients diagnosed in 1991&ndash;93 and followed up tot eh end of 1998. Five year survival rates by sex and age group for England and Wales for these cancers are published in the report Cancer survival in England and Wales, 1991&ndash;1998 which is available on the National Statistics website at:<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/themehealth/HSQ6Book.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme health/HSQ6Book.pdf</a>.

This publication presents cancer survival trends in patients diagnosed between 1971 and 1990 and followed up for at least five years to the end of 1995; it is available in the House of Commons Library. The five year relative survival rates for adults (aged 15&ndash;99) were 8 per cent. for acute myeloid leukaemia, 51 per cent. for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 51 per cent. for connective tissue (sarcoma) and 73 per cent. for thyroid cancer. For those cancers analysed for children (aged 0&ndash;14), the five year relative survival rates were:76 per cent. for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 51 per cent. for osteosarcoma and 93 per cent. for retinoblastoma.</p>

	<p pid=".884W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Paul Burstow, dated <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-21">21 July 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".884W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning how many people died from <i>(a)</i> strokes and <i>(b)</i> stroke-related diseases each year since 1997, broken down by age group. (126506)</p>
	<p pid=".884W.2/4" class="indent">I refer you to the answer given in Hansard on 18th July 2001, column 213 to Linda Perham MP indicating that figures are to be found in the annual reference volumes 'Mortality Statistics: Cause DH2.' The latest publication in this series contains figures for stroke for 2001 and is available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/themehealth/Dh228/DH2No28.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme health/Dh2 28/DH2No28.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".884W.2/5" class="indent">Causes of death in England and Wales were coded to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) from 1979 to 2000. Cerebrovascular diseases, which includes stroke and related conditions, were coded to 430&ndash;438. In the Tenth Revision (ICD-10), introduced in 2001, the same conditions are coded to 160&ndash;169. However, the way in which the underlying cause of death is selected from the conditions written on the certificate changed in ICD-10. This led to an increase of approximately 13% in the number of deaths attributed to cerebrovascular diseases in men and 9% in women. Time trends should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effects of the change in classification has been described in detail in ONS publications.i<sup>,</sup>ii</p>

If such assets are located in UK financial institutions, they may be subject to prior claims. As a result it is not possible at this stage to estimate what amounts will eventually be held by UK financial institutions.

The current forecast cost estimate for the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&amp;M) contract is around &pound;3 billion.

	<p pid=".893W.5/1">In the Strategic Defence Review published in 1998, it was envisaged that the two new Future Aircraft Carriers would be in the order of 30,000&ndash;40,000 tonnes and be capable of carrying up to 50 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The intention, as with any other new equipment project, has always been to refine the design during the assessment phase in order to best meet our developing capability requirements. The Carrier programme is currently midway through this assessment phase. The key specifications will be determined in capability terms prior to the award of the demonstration and manufacture contract, currently planned for Spring 2004.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-30">30 January 2003</phrase>, the best means of delivering the carrier programme is via an alliance approach involving BAe Systems as preferred prime contractor with responsibility for project and shipbuilding management, Thales UK as key supplier of the whole ship design, and the Ministry of Defence. That remains our view. Subject to reaching a satisfactory outcome to the final stage of the assessment phase and to contractual negotiations, we plan to reach the final investment decision for award of the Demonstration and Manufacture contract in spring 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".895W.11/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and the other Defence Ministers routinely meet with their French opposite numbers and the United Kingdom's Future Aircraft Carrier programme has frequently been discussed in that context. There is a high level steering group which helps to facilitate UK French co-operation and, in addition, there have been regular meetings on the subject both between project officials from the UK's Defence Procurement Agency and their equivalents in the DGA and on a navy-to-navy basis. These meetings have identified several areas for potential co-operation.</p>
	<p pid=".895W.11/2">The CVF project is currently in the Assessment Phase which is designed to balance performance, cost and time considerations and to maximise cost effectiveness and value for money for the capability required. Nothing will be fixed until the investment decision is taken next year and the award of the Demonstration and Manufacture contract in Spring 2004 as originally planned.</p>

	<p pid=".898W.2/2">Service personnel are entitled to the full use of NHS hospitals on the same basis as other United Kingdom citizens if appropriate military provision is not available. They will therefore benefit from the sustained investment through the NHS Plan which will reduce waiting times. Provision for accelerated diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation to return Service personnel back to fitness faster than would otherwise be the case is available through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with NHS Trusts that host the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) in Birmingham and Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs). These SLAs also include provision for fast-track out-patient appointments if Service personnel are needed for immediate operational deployment. In addition, in 2003&ndash;04, up to &pound;8 million for accelerated diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation is available for use in the NHS or, as appropriate, with private healthcare providers. A pilot scheme for fast-tracking orthopaedic cases is currently being run at MDHU Northallerton. Finally, the joint MOD/Department of Health Reception Arrangements for Military Patients (RAMP) ensure that in times of conflict casualties are returned to the UK and receive the care that they need in NHS hospitals.</p>

	<p pid=".899W.2/1">There are well established procedures for the reporting of casualties and missing personnel. The overriding principle is to minimise distress to bereaved families and to ensure they received timely and accurate information. However, it does take time to establish the necessary details, particularly in operational circumstances. With plentiful sources of immediate communication and close media interest, inevitably there is a risk that families will learn of an incident before they are formally notified. The Ministry of Defence endeavours to minimise this risk. An officer is despatched to inform the family as soon as the relevant details have been established. Normally the officer would be from the relevant unit or parent establishment, but where a family lived a significant distance away, consideration would be given to using an officer from a closer unit (preferably, although not necessarily, of the same Service) or the civilian police. Service officers selected to notify families are senior and experienced; often the unit commander or deputy will conduct this important and difficult duty themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.2/2">We do not publish the names of fatalities until we have confirmation that the next of kin, and in some cases the extended family network, have been informed.</p>

Since DU strikes do not pose an immediate threat to health and safety we will not be undertaking any recovery of DU buried in the ground, except where required in small quantities for scientific purposes to support the Ministry of Defence corporate DU programme.</p>

	<p pid=".901W.8/1">Preventing transmission of disease is an important element of force health protection for troops participating in military action, including those who deployed to the Gulf. We seek to achieve this through a combination of medical intelligence to identify threats from endemic diseases and potential biological warfare agents; appropriate medical countermeasures, such as vaccination and antimalarial drugs; and physical protection measures, such as insecticide impregnation of uniforms and use of mosquito nets and appropriate insect repellents. In addition, educating personnel in the use of good hygiene and sanitation practices and enforcement of appropriate Health and Safety regulations play an important part.</p>

Any loss of life, particularly civilian, is deeply regrettable, but in a military operation the size of Operation Telic it is also unavoidable. Through very strict rules of engagement, the use of precision munitions and the tactical methods employed to liberate Iraq's major cities, we are satisfied that the coalition did everything possible to avoid unnecessary casualties. We do not, therefore, propose to undertake a formal review of Iraqi casualties sustained from <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-19">19 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".914W.11/2">On the completion of the combat phase of the campaign in Iraq, units which had a role in the stabilisation and rebuilding phase remained in theatre. Reservists serving with those units remained with them. Units which did not have a role in the stabilisation and reconstruction phase returned to the United Kingdom and, in the main, the reservists attached to them returned with their units; however, some reservists from these units with scarce and badly-needed skills were re-deployed to other units in theatre which had shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.11/3">Regular members of two units, 33 and 34 field hospitals, returned to the UK shortly after the cessation of hostilities in order to take on another operational role and for a period of leave before re-deploying back to theatre. Reservists who were attached to 34 field hospital, and had skills required for the continuing operations, remained in theatre to complete up to six months' deployment.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.11/4">Reservists called out for the current operations in Iraq have been advised that their deployments will be for up to six months; the end of tour date for their units has not yet been decided but is unlikely to be more than six months after deployment. The expectation is that all reservists will return with their regular units.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.11/3">We are aware that difficulties over pay or allowances were experienced by a small number of Territorial Army personnel during their period of mobilisation. In most instances, these were the result of administrative delays in the processing and passing of key information to the Army Pay computer systems. Reports from units indicate that a small number of reservists had a short delay before payment of their Reservists' Hardship Allowance and Reservists' Standard Award because the paperwork had to be manually assessed and there were some instances of incomplete or missing paperwork.</p>

There are no separate &quot;military prisons&quot;. However, detention facilities are available at guardrooms in units and establishments in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world. When it is necessary to hold an individual in custody pending their trial or sentencing, they are usually held at a local detention facility. An average of around 1,000 personnel per year have been held at the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) in Colchester. The following table gives the number of attempted suicides, suicides, and incidents of self harm of members of the armed forces either in custody or awaiting a custodial sentence at the MCTC in Colchester.

	<p pid=".921W.2/1">Efficiency targets for the Training Group Defence Agency (TGDA) were set as input targets for the years prior to Financial Year 2002&ndash;03. Achievement was &pound;20.354 million in FY 1999&ndash;2000 and &pound;6.441 million in Financial Year 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/2">In Financial Year 2002&ndash;03 efficiency targets and measurements were presented to and approved by the PSX, which enabled the efficiency PSA to be expressed in output terms.

	<p pid=".921W.2/3">Following the QQR and associated revaluations of assets, which would distort absolute figures, the definition of efficiency was reviewed and restated as a percentage reduction compared with the initial baseline set as the outturn from Financial Year 2000&ndash;01. This declared mat TGDA would achieve a 0.75 per cent. per annum reduction in the average cost of a recruit graduating from initial specialist training.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/4">In Financial Year 2002&ndash;03, TGDA met the 0.75 per cent. target and believe that they have achieved a slightly greater reduction that the target set. This will be validated once year end accounts are completed.</p>

	<p pid=".922W.4/1">The United Kingdom has no choice but to implement the Food Supplements Directive in order to fulfil its obligations under the European Community treaty. The Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 take full advantage of all the flexibility available to member states in implementing the legislation, which has been welcomed by British manufacturers and retailers of food supplements.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.4/2">The costs to the British food supplements industry will result from mandatory new labelling requirements in the Directive, from reformulation of products where necessary, from dossier preparation where industry chooses to do this and from possible future loss of products from the market. The Government's assessment of the costs associated with implementing the Directive, including those due to removal of products from sale, are set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.4/3">The Food Standards Agency does not hold information about the numbers of food supplement products on the UK market. According to information provided by industry, Annex I of the Food Supplements Directive excludes from use six minerals that are currently used in products marketed in the UK and around 300 chemical forms of vitamins and minerals currently used in products on the UK market are not included in Annex II. However, these may continue to be used in food supplements after <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase> provided the criteria in Article 4(6) of the Directive are met.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.4/4">Many groups have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the Directive, and hence the implementing Regulations, on the UK market. The Government understand these concerns, many of which are also set out in the RIA. Given anxieties about the cost of dossier production and the timescale for dossier submission, the need for a meeting with European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to discuss requirements for dossier content has now been agreed, following representations from the Food Standards Agency. The EFSA and relevant parties will meet to discuss the potential for simplified dossiers. The European Commission supports this move.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.6/2">I believe this question refers to standard 31.7 of the care homes for adults (18 to 65) standards, which says that volunteers should supplement and not replace paid staff and that volunteers should not undertake tasks which are the responsibility of paid staff. The equivalent standard in the care homes for older people standards is 36.5.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.6/3">The intention of these standards is to ensure that volunteers are not used to enable a care home to avoid employing suitably qualified, competent and experienced staff in numbers appropriate to meet the assessed needs of the residents. There is no intention in either standard to prevent volunteers assisting with lifting residents in the care home where this is appropriate and subject to the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 being taken into account.</p>

	<p pid=".931W.5/2">There are many measures already in place to help women who suffer from endometriosis. We are determined to improve the awareness of endometriosis and provide funding to the National Endometriosis Society, through the Section 64 general grants scheme towards their core activities. We are also providing &pound;39,000 to the society to produce information leaflets. One leaflet is for women to encourage those with symptoms to discuss with their general practitioner and another is for GPs to highlight the symptoms so they can refer women for investigation and treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".931W.5/3">We support GPs, knowing more about endometriosis. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence released a guide to the National Health Service in 2001 on appropriate referral practice. The referral advice covers eleven common conditions and has been developed as an educational resource for local health communities to develop their own local service guidelines. The advice is structured to provide clinical criteria on which to assess the urgency of referral across the range of conditions. Although endometriosis is not one of the conditions included in the advice, this might help give us an effective way of offering referral guidance to GPs on endometriosis among the range of other common conditions. We also want to see gynaecologists undertaking continuing professional development so they are kept abreast of the latest knowledge and best practice.</p>

	<p pid=".932W.8/1">The main Government agency for research into the causes and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department for Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. In 2001&ndash;02 (the latest year for which a figure is available), the MRC spent &pound;1.2 million on research on both endometriosis and the general physiology of the endometrium.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.8/2">The MRC always welcomes high quality applications from the scientific community for support into any aspect of biomedical research and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.8/3">The Department of Health funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service. The Department also provides NHS support funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities that takes place in the NHS. In the NHS, research priorities are identified through widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services. They take account of the burden of disease, potential benefits and departmental objectives, as well as the responsibilities and work of other research funders. As an outcome of these on-going processes, the Health Technology Assessment Programme recently published the report of a research project on the management of menorrhagia, which is sometimes associated with endometriosis. A research report on the diagnosis of endometrial abnormality is expected to be published in February 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".939W.2/1">Feedback from the independent complaints advocacy service (ICAS) pilots has been collected in two ways. Statistical data were collected from the ICAS pilots on a quarterly basis and the information received from the second quarter provided information for tenderers of the new service on volumes of caseload broken down into levels of complexity of complaints. Qualitative analysis of regular ICAS pilots' reports and regional meetings of ICAS pilots informed the tender requirements by raising issues such as working to consistent national standards and the need for arrangements with specialist providers for complex casework. A final evaluation of the pilots is now under way and will build on feedback on issues such as relationships with national health service complaints and patient advocacy liaison services departments, as well as best ways for working with vulnerable groups. A final report will be published in October 2003 and will inform on-going service provision by the new ICAS providers as well as the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health with its role of monitoring the ICAS service.</p>

	<p pid=".940W.2/1">The Government are committed to developing nurses in England through their national nursing strategy, 'Making a Difference'. A comprehensive programme of national and local action has been taking place. This will expand the workforce, strengthen education and training, provide a modern career framework and decent pay, improve the working and employment conditions of nurses, and develop their leadership skills and equip and empower them to take on new, expanded and more satisfying roles.</p>
	<p pid=".940W.2/2">Accreditation to the Improving Working Lives (IWL) Standard is also creating well-managed, flexible working environments that support all staff and promotes their welfare and development, in and out of the work place. IWL sets a model of good human resource (HR) practice against which national health service employers and their staff can measure the organisation's HR management and against which all NHS employers are currently being kite-marked. It is also an integral part of the HR performance management process.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.0/1">Since it was established in April 2001, the National Health Service Leadership Centre has drawn up development portfolios for chief executives, executive directors and clinical staff across the NHS. Most recently a development portfolio has been developed with the NHS Appointments Commission for chairs. These programmes are designed to provide focused development and have helped to track the careers of some senior staff in the NHS. More recently, the Leadership Centre has established a career development and succession planning scheme known as 'NHS Leaders'. This is intended to build and strengthen leadership across the NHS; to ensure that all senior leaders have personal development plans and are supported in their career development; to provide information to support appointments and succession planning; and to provide tailored development for newcomers to improve the performance of the NHS. A database of all senior leaders has also been compiled which will track the careers of these leaders.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.0/2">The NHS Appointments Commission has established a record keeping system for all chairs and non-executives which records their service to the NHS. This is particularly useful when encouraging non-executives to apply for chair positions. The Commission also records those individuals who resign from their board.</p>

	<p pid=".954W.3/1">Good progress has been made since the national health service prostate cancer programme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-06">6 September 2000</phrase>, setting out the Government's approach to improving prostate cancer services in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.3/2">As part of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP), evidence-based primary care resource packs were sent to all general practitioners in England from <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-23">23 September 2002</phrase> to aid them in counselling men who are worried about prostate cancer, ensuring the men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.3/3">Other elements of the PCRMP include ensuring that a systematic and standardised follow-up pathway is available for individuals whose test result is above the PSA threshold and action to improve the quality of laboratory testing of PSA samples. Primary care and laboratories were informed of the related recommendations from the scientific reference group, which supports the PCRMP in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.3/4">By 2003&ndash;04 the Department of Health will be directly funding &pound;4.2 million of research a year on prostate cancer. This is a twenty-fold increase compared with 1999&ndash;2000. Two National Cancer Research Institute prostate cancer research collaboratives have been established in Newcastle and London. Funded research includes studies on various treatments for prostate cancer, improving the PSA test and ethnic differences in prostate cancer incidence. The National Cancer Research Institute considered prostate cancer as part of its Strategic Analysis in 2002, but made no specific recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.3/5">The Department is funding a Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase availability of further information about prostate cancer. This is supporting the creation, review, provision and dissemination of a range of awareness material, supported by &pound;135,000 over three years. 96.6 per cent. of patients with suspected urological cancers (including prostate) were seen for their first out-patient appointment within two weeks of their general practitioner deciding they should be urgently referred, and the hospital receiving the referral within 24 hours, in January to March 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.3/6">The cancer services collaborative is modernising cancer care, including prostate cancer, by reducing unnecessary delays in the system for patients throughout the cancer journey.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.3/7">The number of consultant urologists grew from 382 in 2000 to 427 in 2001, and is set to grow to 504 in 2005.</p>

Cerebrovascular diseases which includes stroke and related conditions, were coded to 430&ndash;438. In the Tenth Revision (ICD-10), introduced in 2001, the same conditions are coded to 160&ndash;169. However, the way in which the underlying cause of death is selected from the conditions written on the certificate changed in ICD-10. This led to an increase of about 13 per cent. in the number of deaths attributed to cerebrovascular diseases in men and 9 per cent. in women. Time trends should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effects of the change in classification has been described in detail in ONS publications.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.2/2">Many studies have been carried out on the health benefits of walking. The Department is presently undertaking a review of the evidence for the relationship between physical activity and health, which will be concerned with the full range of human activity from competitive sport and exercise to walking, cycling, dancing or activity as part of work. We hope to publish the results of the review at the end of the year to support enhanced public health efforts to promote regular physical activity.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.2/3">Further evidence of the benefits of regular physical activity, including walking, will emerge from the forthcoming local exercise action pilots (LEAP) that are being developed with Sport England and the Countryside Agency. The LEAP programme will test different evidence based community approaches to increasing access to, and the levels of physical activity, with a particular focus on hard to reach and at risk groups. Walking will be a feature of several of the LEAP pilots and will be included in the evaluation of the whole programme.</p>

	<p pid=".968W.14/1">The Home Office has always acknowledged the need to improve the accuracy and presentation of the recorded crime statistics. Two important reviews were published in July 2000 which dealt with both these points, and a range of other matters.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/2">The first was the &quot;Review of Crime Statistics&quot; (the 'Simmons Review'), which made a total of 66 recommendations. The report set out clearly some of the problems with the arrangements in place at that time and provided a blueprint for a system of crime statistics in England and Wales designed to overcome those problems and to provide a clearer and more reliable set of crime data. A group was established to oversee this review and to ensure that the recommendations were sound, and that group received cross-party support. The full review and the conclusions of this expert group, which asked only that the recommendation relating to establishing an index of crime not be implemented, are available on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/3">The second report was a thematic inspection report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), entitled &quot;On the Record&quot;. One of the conclusions of that report was that interpretation of the Home Office Counting Rules for recording crime by police forces was inconsistent and made it hard to establish the degree to which differences in crime rates were simply due to recording factors, or represented a real change in crime.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/4">As a result of both of these reports, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) developed the new National Crime Recording Standard. The Standard aims to promote a greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime and to take a more victim oriented approach to crime recording.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/5">The National Crime Recording Standard was adopted nationally with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. However, the work to establish standards for recording and greater consistency is on-going. In .addition, a new audit regime has been introduced, overseen by the Police Standards Unit in the Home Office and carried out on their behalf by the Audit Commission. The audits are designed to ensure that forces are implementing the Standard and applying the Counting Rules correctly. In addition, Force Crime Registrars are encouraged to undertake their own internal audits, and guidance has been provided to ensure that any such auditing is robust.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/6">A further data source is the British Crime Survey (BCS). The BCS is considered to be the most reliable measure of personal and household crime in England and Wales and significant improvements have been made to the Survey recently. The Survey has increased its sample size from 20,000 interviews to 40,000 and it is now conducted on a rolling year basis. The BCS also includes those crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police. While the BCS does not claim to count all crimes in England and Wales, it does provide a consistent measure of trends from one year to the next in those crimes of greatest concern to members of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/7">With regard to the presentation of crime statistics, the Review of Crime Statistics recommended that the recorded crime statistics and the British Crime Survey should be considered together. They are complementary series that, taken together, provide a better picture of crime than can be obtained from either series alone. The publication of the data in this way ensures that the public has available the most comprehensive picture of crime in a single volume and at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/8">Figures from both sources were published together for the first time in July last year in &quot;Crime and England and Wales 2001&ndash;02&quot; (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/02). The second combined volume covering the period 2002&ndash;03 has been published and copies are available in the Library. We believe that this publication provides the best and most comprehensive presentation of the latest position on crime in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/9">Due to the introduction of the new National Crime Recording Standard, this publication makes necessary adjustments to the recorded crime figures in order to present a more accurate picture of the real trends in crime underlying the recording changes. The Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate has published a further report, entitled &quot;National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS): An Analysis of the Impact on Recorded Crime&quot; to explain how these adjustments have been derived, and the impact both nationally and in individual police forces.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/10">As police forces have now had a full year in which to implement the new standard, and as the research report shows that the impact of the new standard appears to be complete for our main target crimes, I am announcing that this is the last occasion on which we will make these adjustments to the recorded crime figures.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.14/11">The Home Office is committed to continually improving both the accuracy and presentation of the statistics on crime, and will continue to make necessary changes to those statistics in order to do so in future.</p>

Stage 0 is for initial inquiries, Stage 1 to assess eligibility for a review, Stage 2 screen to expedite those cases that can be reviewed with only modest caseworker effort. Stage 2 involves those cases requiring resource intensive reviews. A few of these will proceed to Stage 3, which requires the formal appointment of an Investigating Officer. The main build up of cases awaiting review therefore occurs at Stage 2 and the Commission has provided an analysis of this.

	<p pid=".974W.2/1">London Probation Area's uplift project is intended to bring their performance on enforcement in line with National Standards so as to ensure that offenders who fail to comply with the requirements of an order or licence are returned to court quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.2/2">Latest sample monitoring (for the period April to May 2003) shows that London are meeting the enforcement standard in 53 per cent. of relevant cases compared with the national target of 90 per cent. The uplift therefore requires an improvement of 37 percentage points, or an increase of 59 per cent. in the number of cases currently enforced in order to meet the target. This would equate to approximately 250 additional cases per month.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.2/3">Rigorous enforcement leads to greater compliance, so the number of cases brought to court would reduce as levels of compliance increased.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.2/4">Based on statistics for London courts for the year 2001 (the latest for which data are available), we would estimate that few if any cases brought before the courts for breach of a community sentence would be dismissed.

The Health and Safety Executive, the sponsoring body, has not retained a complete record of organisations, including police forces, who participated in events supporting the Week's aims. However among forces in England and Wales that received regional or national awards for their activities, the total cost to those forces was estimated to be approximately &pound;10,500.

Nevertheless, depending upon the exact duties of individual flight attendants, they may on a case by case basis fall within the definition of a 'regulated position'.

In London, 46 per cent. of victims were contacted within the eight week target compared with 22 per cent. the previous year; London Probation Area's performance for the first quarter of this year has shown a significant improvement, rising to 72 per cent. for January to March 2003.

	<p pid=".983W.9/2">Support from the Home Office is equally available to all prisoners' families and is not affected by any allegation that an individual is a victim of a miscarriage of justice.</p>
	<p pid=".983W.9/3">The Home Office no longer has responsibility for reviewing the convictions of prisoners. The Home Secretary's powers to consider alleged miscarriages of justice came to an end on <phrase class="date" code="1997-03-31">31 March 1997</phrase>. These were replaced by new powers vested in an independent body, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which has a main responsibility under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 to review suspected miscarriages of justice, and to refer a conviction, verdict, finding or sentence to the appropriate court of appeal when the Commission considers that there is a real possibility that it would not be upheld. Any family member can apply to the Commission on behalf of someone believed to be a victim of a miscarriage of justice. (The Commission will not generally review a case until the normal appeal process is exhausted). We would carefully explain this to family members writing to the Home Office and redirect them to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".983W.9/4">The Home Office is funding the Royal Courts of Justice Citizens Advice Bureau's Miscarriages of Justice Project which supports prisoners, who have had their convictions referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Commission, in the period leading up to their release and for up to six months after. This service would extend to providing advice on Family/Relationship issues.</p>
	<p pid=".983W.9/5">An individual whose conviction is overturned may be eligible for statutory or ex gratia compensation for a wrongful conviction and can apply to the Home Office. Both schemes are concerned only with the suffering of the victim of the wrongful conviction, so neither makes provision for compensation for the suffering of any relative or other third party. However, in deciding the amount of any compensation award made to an individual, the assessor will take into account the costs of prison visits and of any family campaign to get the conviction quashed.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.5/1">Following the concerns raised in the Stewart report on &quot;Mobile phones and health&quot; about amplitude-modulated signals, we took expert advice from the National Radiological Protection Board's Independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR).

	<p pid=".984W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the special features from TETRA mobile terminals and repeaters pose a hazard to health&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;it is notable that the signals from TETRA base stations are not pulsed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".984W.5/5">The AGNIR experts made recommendations for long-term research to address remaining areas of uncertainty. We have taken this forward with an extensive research programme. Results to date show that TETRA technology has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells&mdash;the main concern of the Stewart report. They also confirm that all Airwave equipment fully complies with international health and safety guidelines. We have recently announced a &pound;5 million health monitoring study of police Airwave users.

Violent incidents from the BCS can be classified into a violence typology comprising domestic, mugging, stranger and acquaintance incidents. Violent crime from the BCS can also be separated into robbery, wounding, common assault, and snatch theft. The information regarding injuries sustained for this latter breakdown is not published prior to 2001&ndash;02 BCS interviews. Mugging is a popular rather than a legal term, comprising robbery, attempted robbery and snatch theft from the person. The BCS does not cover incidents against those aged under 16, nor those not living in private households.</p>

As a general rule there was a unit of one sergeant and six constables in the vicinity of the Peace Camp. Under US service regulations it is normal procedure to place warning notices in particularly sensitive areas within military establishments. Thousands of these notices are used by US military forces around the world to delineate sensitive areas.

	<p pid=".990W.11/1">The Prison Service's efforts to reduce the numbers of self-inflicted deaths in prisons are supported by a number of broader approaches for which money is allocated. These include addressing the effects of handling larger numbers and throughput of prisoners, the development of detoxification regimes, and considerable Department of Health resources allocated over the next few years to extend mental health in-reach support arrangements for prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".990W.11/2">The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year strategy to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons. The programme includes a series of inter-related projects aimed mostly at improving relevant pre-custody practices; reception, first night and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support; and strengthening investigations into deaths in custody. Investment of over &pound;21 million for the three years from April 2001 focuses on physical improvements and trials at six sites (Birmingham, Eastwood Park, Feltham, Leeds, Wandsworth, Winchester) and on full-time suicide prevention coordinators in the prisons where the risks are highest.</p>

	<p pid=".994W.2/1">We are committing significant funding to modernising and increasing the capacity of the prison estate. Funding has been provided for 2,820 additional prison places to be built at existing prisons. Two new prisons will also be opened at Ashford and Peterborough. Together with building programmes in progress, such as 400 additional places at Birmingham, the total useable capacity of the Prison Service estate will increase to around 78,700 by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.2/2">In addition, the Criminal Justice Bill outlines a range of new sentencing options, including: the introduction of two 'intermediate' sanctions &mdash;'Custody Minus' and 'Intermittent Custody' which will allow offenders to retain employment and family contact during the week while being held in custody at weekends. These are options for sentencers which avoid the unnecessary use of full-time custody.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.2/3">We have also recently extended the successful Home Detention Curfew (HOC) scheme to four and a half months. HDC, by enabling prisoners to be released early but while still being subject to restrictions placed on their liberty, facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into society.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.2/4">The Government continue to keep under review the demand on prison places and the capacity of the Prison Service to accommodate those prisoners sent to it by the courts.</p>

	<p pid=".996W.6/1">The definition of a category D prison is one that holds &quot;prisoners who can reasonably be trusted in open conditions&quot;. Sentenced prisoners may be assessed for category D conditions either on initial categorisation following sentencing or during their sentence following a review of their security category.</p>
	<p pid=".996W.6/2">The initial categorisation procedures use an algorithm to indicate a provisional security category for each individual prisoner. The algorithm takes account of: current offence(s), sentence length, previous offending, previous escapes or absconds and previous breaches of non-custodial disposals. An assessment is then made of this provisional category to determine whether it is appropriate. In the case of prisoners indicated for category D, this may typically include issues such as: current drug use; previous breaches of bail; the nature and circumstances of what may appear a fairly minor offence or vulnerability to bullying or coercion.</p>
	<p pid=".996W.6/3">Prisoners have their security category reviewed at regular intervals. Those serving 12 months to less than four years are reviewed at six monthly intervals; those serving a determinate sentence of four years or more are reviewed annually. Prisoners may be reviewed more frequently than is warranted by their circumstances. The recategoristaion process places primacy on consideration of risk. The prisoner must be able to demonstrate a significant reduction in risk (to the public and/or of escape/abscond) to warrant recategorisation to conditions of lower security. Where category D is indicated as appropriate in terms of risk, consideration is then given to other issues that might suggest that the prisoner is otherwise unsuitable for open conditions. These might be issues of control, health care requirements or the need to complete educational or offending behaviour programmes. A fundamental review of categorisation is currently under way. Among other things, the review will be looking at the procedures for placing prisoners in conditions of low security.</p>
	<p pid=".996W.6/4">These procedures apply to all prisons in England and Wales. Kirkham accepts prisoners who have been categorised D either by the local prisons or the training prisons. The prison does not accept prisoners who are serving, or who have served, a sentence for sex offences. Other prisoners who may have special requirements or present particular problems are considered on an individual basis for return to the closed estate.</p>
	<p pid=".996W.6/5">I am arranging for a copy of the risk assessment form for a move to a prison of a lower security category and the assessment criteria for Kirkham prison to be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.0/1">Mental health care issues, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and attention deficit disorder (ADD) are regularly discussed by staff in both departments in order to carry out the commitments for mental health in the NHS Plan. The NHS Plan includes provision for prisoners and a total of &pound;10 million is being invested in 2003&ndash;04 to improve mental health services for them. Mental Health needs assessments were carried in all prison establishments last autumn to better gauge that need. By 2004 some 94 prisons, including all male local prisons and the majority of women's local prisons and young offender institutions will have received funding for community mental health in-reach teams to provide more comprehensive services for prisoners with severe mental health problems.</p>
