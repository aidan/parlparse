	<p pid=".8W.0/2">Economic stability and active labour market programmes have helped people move from welfare to work in all parts of the country. As a result of our policies the number of people in work is at record levels and unemployment has fallen to levels not seen since the 1970s.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.0/3">In my right hon. Friend's constituency, between May 1997 and October 2002 the number of people unemployed and claiming benefit fell from 2,784 to 1,382 (a reduction of 50 per cent.) and long term unemployment has fallen by 75 per cent. Over the same period the New Deal has helped over 1,800 people in Copeland into jobs.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.5/1">The UK's climate change programme sets out the policies and measures in each sector of the economy that the Government have put in place or have planned to meet and move beyond its Kyoto Protocol target. On current projections, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture&mdash;mainly methane from enteric fermentation in livestock and nitrous oxide from agricultural soils&mdash;will be an estimated 14 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. This is mainly due to reductions in cattle numbers from yield improvements, and reductions in synthetic fertiliser usage&mdash;although, because emissions in other sectors are also falling, agriculture's share of total UK emissions is expected to remain at the present level of around 7.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.5/2">Action that the UK Government and the devolved Administrations are taking to reduce emissions from agriculture includes encouragement of biomass including renewable energy crops, application of the climate change levy to agricultural businesses (with some discounts for energy intensive horticultural businesses), agri-environment schemes and set-aside.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.5/1">The Government strongly supports reform of the CAP sugar regime, particularly in view of the increasing access for developing countries already agreed as part of the Everything But Arms initiative. The Council of Ministers is committed to a further review of the regime next year and we will be pressing for early decisions to allow for orderly adaptation to these more liberal trading arrangements, which will make the regime unsustainable in its present form. We also want the future regime to take account of the wider CAP Mid Term Review process on which negotiations are currently taking place.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.5/2">With regard to the dairy regime, there have already been some moves towards reform under Agenda 2000&mdash;a 15 per cent. cut in support prices phased in from 2005 to 2007, with direct aid as compensation. However, this still leaves dairy support prices well above world levels, distorting both internal and external markets, and resulting in a continuing need for milk quotas (a financial burden to producers which rigidifies farming structures and the market) to contain budgetary expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.5/3">The UK and other like-minded member states managed to secure a mid-term review of the milk quota system as part of the Agenda 2000 Agreement, under which Commission was charged with writing a report 'with a view to letting the current quota arrangements run out after 2006'. One of the four options in the report, which the Commission published in July, is for quota abolition in 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.5/4">We are now calling upon the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal based on this option, which is the only one to fully meet thecommitments set out in the Agenda 2000 Agreement. In order to bring support prices closer to world levels, in preparation for quota abolition, we would favour bringing the Agenda 2000 price cuts forward to 2004, deepening them, and phasing them over four years, to 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.8/2">The consumer cost of the CAP can be estimated by considering the difference between UK prices and world prices on agricultural food products purchased by consumers. In 2000, the latest year for which UK figures are available, we estimate that the CAP cost UK consumers around #3.5 billion through higher prices. In the same year the UK taxpayer contribution to the CAP was approximately #3 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.8/3">The UK population in 2000 was 59.8 million, implying that the average cost of the CAP of #6.5 billion in total equates to just over #2 per person per week, or #8 to #9 pounds a week for a notional family of four.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.8/4">The following table shows an approximate breakdown of consumer support between agricultural commodities. These estimates have, in the main, been compiled using the methodology utilised by the OECD to produce their estimates of the consumer support estimate. It should be noted that the aggregate estimates will be more robust than estimates for the individual commodities. It is particularly difficult to determine the appropriate gap between UK and world prices for products whose specification varies, such as fruit and vegetables, or pigs, eggs and poultry. Although there is no significant internal regime governing the production of pigs, eggs and poultry, the EU has import tariffs in place, leading to increased costs for consumers.</p>

They have a variety of different structures and forms of organisation and it is likely that many have not made themselves known to the Department.</p>

	<p pid=".25W.5/2">The UK's emissions reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce its emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels over the commitment period 2008&ndash;12. Carbon dioxide, which is the most important greenhouse gas, is one of the six gases in the basket and although the UK does not have a specific carbon dioxide emissions reduction target under the Protocol, the Government and the devolved administrations have set themselves a domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in the UK's carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by 2010. The policies and measures set out in the UK Climate Change Programme (CCP) therefore focus mainly on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.5/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is responsible for the following policies and measures in the CCP: the domestic greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme; the climate change agreements; the Energy Efficiency Commitment; the New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme; community heating; and the Government's combined heat and power (CHP) strategy. Other policies and measures in the CCP are the responsibility of the devolved administrations or other government departments including, the Department for Transport, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department of Trade and Industry, Her Majesty's Treasury, and the Forestry Commission.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.5/1">Waste Strategy 2000 set a national target of recycling or composting at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. To underpin these targets, we set statutory performance standards for recycling for all local authorities in England. Authorities are required, on average, to double recycling by 2003&ndash;04 and triple it by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/2">However, we do not expect local authorities to do this alone. The Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) spending block, which includes waste management, will be increased by #671 million by 2005&ndash;06. An additional #355 million of future PFI credits for waste projects over the same period have also been provided. The National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund of #140 million has distributed funds to a wide variety of schemes aimed at increasing household recycling rates.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/3">We have taken steps to ensure an increase in the amount of commercial and industrial waste recycled. Base line figures given for 1998&ndash;99 placed the rate of recycling for industrial and commercial waste at 37 per cent. This compares with the figure of 9 per cent. for household waste at the same time. In order to encourage businesses to further reduce waste and to put to better use any waste that is produced the Government have set the target to reduce by 2005 the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998. Producer responsibility is another tool we have to encourage increased reduction, recycling and recovery from producers (and those involved in the distribution and sale of goods)</p>

In particular, PRN and PERN revenue for plastic in 2001 was #8,591,128 of which #1,194,532 was spent on developing end use markets and #36,140 has been allocated for future investment.</p>

	<p pid=".31W.3/1">Eaga Partnership is the Scheme Manager appointed to administer the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme&mdash;now marketed as Warm Front&mdash;in three of the four 'lot' areas of England: London and the South East; the North East and North West; and the South West and West Midlands. All answers that follow relate only to the area managed by Eaga Partnership.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.3/2">In the last financial year Eaga Partnership Ltd. received over 236,000 eligible referrals. At <phrase class="date" code="">29 November 14</phrase>,538 surveys were outstanding. In addition, 49,768 households were awaiting completion of at least one of their recommended measures.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.3/3">Snagging is not a requirement of the contract with Eaga Partnership, however the Scheme does require quality installation checks on all gas central heating systems and a proportion of insulation works. If remedial work is required, following the quality inspection, the installers are contracted to undertake that work within 28 days of being contacted by Eaga Partnership Ltd.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.3/4">The waiting time for completion of works can be extended by a number of factors. These include the shortage of central heating installers, awaiting landlord permission, changes to measures specified and the installation of gas to properties. The average waiting time for completion of heating work is 72 working days and for insulation 51 working days from the time of survey. The longest wait for completion of a job was 345 working days. The longest period of work currently awaiting completion is 521 working days. These delays came about through a combination of factors including the skills shortage and the development of equipment to meet the requirements of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.3/5">The highest cost of an individual job funded by Warm Front is the current grant maximum&mdash;#1,500 for Warm Front and #2,500 for Warm Front Plus. The average grant value in 2001&ndash;02 was #454.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.3/6">Warm Front is designed to tackle fuel poverty among those most vulnerable to cold-related ill health&mdash;older householders, families with children and the disabled or those with long-term illness. The range of measures offered to a property is determined by the existing standard of the property. We are currently carrying out a review of Warm Front to assess the effectiveness of the Scheme including consideration of the eligibility criteria and measures offered.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.3/7">The Scheme Managers have responsibility for appointment of installers to work under the Scheme. To ensure the scheme gets good value for money, appointments are carried out through a competitive tendering process, with companies free to tender for work in any area. Additionally, a number of installation companies work nationally and so carry out work across several different areas.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.3/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".32W.3/2" class="indent">(a) The investment to construct, equip and furnish the Jubilee Cafeteria off Westminster Hall was #2.14 million including fees and VAT. The project also included the installation of a lift to provide lavatory facilities for visitors to the House and access for people with disabilities to the second chamber in Westminster Hall and to the meeting rooms in Westminster Hall Annexe (the XW&quot; Rooms).</p>
	<p pid=".32W.3/3" class="indent">(b) The Jubilee Visitor Caf&eacute; opened in May 2002. The running costs of the Jubilee Visitor Caf&eacute; are included within the overall operating budget for the House of Commons Refreshment Department. Payroll budgets and some other operating costs are not disaggregated and so are not available for specific services.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.3/4" class="indent">However, in agreeing the Refreshment Department's operating budget for the year April 2002 to March 2003, the Finance and Services Committee endorsed a target for the Jubilee Visitor Caf&eacute; to serve 49,600 customers in its first year of operation. Assuming this level of business, the forecast gross running cost for the year would be #165,600; after a contribution from sales of #124,000, the net running cost would be #41,600.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.3/5">Progress will be reported to the Finance and Services Committee.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.8/2">In the academic year 2001&ndash;02 there were 5,500 students with academic ages 14 or 15, funded by the Learning and Skills Council, attending FE colleges part time. (Students with academic ages 14 and 15 have actual ages between 14 and 16.) Data on the number of local education authority funded 14 to 16-year-olds in FE colleges is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.8/3">From September 2002, the Increased Flexibilities Programme enables schools, in partnerships with FE colleges, to offer pupils the opportunity of vocational learning through new GCSEs and part time placements in colleges. About 30,000 14 to 16-year-olds are participating in this programme for academic year 2002&ndash;03, the majority of whom will be spending some time in an FE college,</p>
	<p pid=".34W.8/4">Money to fund a similar cohort is being made available for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 as part of Success for All.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.8/5">As part of the planned evaluation of the Increased Flexibilities Programme a baseline data collection exercise has been undertaken to ascertain the numbers of 14 to 16-year-olds on the programme, and the proportion of them spending time in FE colleges. Data on numbers of young people on the programme for 2002&ndash;03 will be available in February 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.2/2">The Department's Special Investigations Unit has been asked to investigate 153 learning provider organisations. Of the 153, the police are investigating 100 learning providers. To date, there have been 60 arrests, which have resulted in 10 people accepting cautions and charges being brought against 14 individuals. Charges have since been dropped against two individuals investigated by the National Crime Squad because of the small amounts of money involved. 11 others are awaiting court appearances. One person has been convicted. The precise extent of fraudulent activity will not be known until all investigations are complete.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.2/2">The Strategy Unit report, XPrivate Action, Public Benefit&quot;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-25">25 September 2002</phrase>. Its 61 recommendations set out a package of measures which aim to modernise charity law and enable a wide range of organisations to be more effective and innovative.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/3">The report recommends that in future all charities should have to demonstrate public benefit. Part of the report considers what happens now with those charities that charge fees which serve to exclude large sections of the population in terms of their having to make provision for wider access for those who would be excluded because of the fees. The report cites the example of independent schools.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/4">At present there is no systematic programme in place to check the public character of charities. The report recommends that an on-going review programme run by the Charity Commission should check the public character of such organisations. It is proposed that the Commission would identify charities likely to charge high fees (such as independent schools), and undertake a rolling programme to check that provision was made for wider access. This programme will be designed to minimise red tape and will not focus on any particular sector. Short returns will be issued which ask charities what they do in terms of widening access, such as making provision for sharing facilities. It is envisaged that for the majority of cases no further inquiry will be necessary beyond the initial return.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/5">It is proposed that the Charity Commission, in consultation with charities likely to be affected and their umbrella bodies, would issue guidelines as to the level of access appropriate in particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.2/6">Of course at the moment these are only proposals. The report was out for consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>, and we shall consider the responses to this, and all the other matters addressed in the report, very carefully.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.2/2">As a result of our drive to give extra resources to the front line, there will be no increase in central government spending per pupil but a national average increase of over #540 per pupil in our plans for local government spending over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/3">It is not possible to set out now Education Formula Spending Shares (EFSS) for Devon for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06: they will depend on pupil numbers and indicator data at January 2003 and 2004. However, we have provided local authorities with increases in total Education Formula Spending for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, together with forward projections at national level of pupil numbers for those years. We have also said that there will be minimum and maximum increases for authorities as we introduce the new LEA funding system. Indicator data will be averaged over three years to provide further stability and predictability in future Formula Spending Shares. Authorities will be able to use this data&mdash;together with local knowledge about pupil numbers and indicators&mdash;to form a good estimate of what their EFSS might be in those years. That will in turn allow them to provide schools with indicative budgets for the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/4">The balance of spending between primary and secondary education is determined by local decisions made in each LEA, both in respect to local government spending and, for the most part, support from central government.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.5/2">A range of new chemical detectors will be brought into service in 2003. The Man-portable Chemical Agent Detector (MCAD) and the Lightweight Chemical Agent Detector (LCAD) will replace the existing Nerve Agent Immobilised Enzyme Alarm and Detector (NAIAD). They have been developed to provide the armed forces with a comprehensive warning capability for vapours of chemical warfare agents. A new chemical agent monitor for use in collective protection is also expected to enter service.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/3">Developments in the detection of biological warfare agents include the vehicle-mounted Integrated Biological Detection System (IBDS) which is due to enter service from November 2003. It will supersede the existing Prototype Biological Detection System (PBDS). Additionally, consideration is being given to fitting HM ships with a new Maritime Biological Detection System (MBDS) from 2007 to supersede the Interim Naval Biological Detection System (INBDS) currently in service.</p>

Additional measures are being put in place as a result of the Strategic Defence Review New Chapter to enhance the capability of the armed forces in general, and reserves in particular, to provide assistance in civil contingencies. These include the establishment of some 700 new Territorial Army posts, principally to give the regional command structure the capacity to sustain 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week working, and to provide a headquarters component for the 14 new Civil Contingency Reaction Forces.</p>

They will be aligned with existing volunteer reserve training and, in due course, with the requirements of specific regional contingency plans as these are developed in conjunction with local authorities and emergency services.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.11/1">Terrorism in the United Kingdom is criminal activity. The police and the Home Office consequently have responsibility for preventing and responding to the threat. According to the nature of the event, lead responsibility for managing the consequences of an attack from a chemical or biological agent would fall to a number of Departments, and in particular, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural .Affairs or the Department of Health. Other Departments and Agencies provide support as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.11/2">The armed forces may be called upon to provide support, from available resources, using specific military skills. The extent of assistance would, of course, be dependent on many factors, and in particular, the precise nature and scale of the incident. Most elements of the armed forces are, however, trained to operate in an environment where chemical or biological agents have been released, and they could, if necessary, provide support to the civil authorities using standard armed forces NBC equipment. As a result of work undertaken during the SDR New Chapter, NBC training will also be provided for those reserve personnel forming Civil Contingencies Reaction Forces, again using standard NBC equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.10/1">The Government will not be making a contribution towards the Hague Conference Supplementary Budget XLVIII (2002&ndash;2003). The Hague Conference Supplementary Budget came into being last year XLVII (2001&ndash;2002) when member states of the Hague Conference were invited to make a voluntary contribution towards the additional funding needed to reinforce the administration, monitoring and support for existing conventions, particularly the Children's Conventions. Last year XLVII (2001- 2002) the UK was in a position to make a voluntary contribution to the Supplementary Budget and arranged for contributions of Euro30,600.42 (England and Wales) and Euro1,601.28 (Northern Ireland) to be made over and above the standard UK contribution of Euro110,290.62. After the Netherlands the UK was the leading donor of supplemental payments during that year.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.10/2">The Hague Conference carried forward the Supplementary Budget into year XLVIII (2002&ndash;2003). Again this was based on voluntary payments since the budget had not been submitted to the Council for approval. The expected UK budgetary contribution of #117,580.65 was paid in full in early August but this year we are not in a position to make any additional voluntary payment.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.10/3">The Government supports strongly the work of the Hague Conference and the expansion of its activities. The Supplementary Budget will be assumed into the standard contributions for the next financial year and the appropriate arrangements have been made to ensure that the UK will be in a position to make its full contribution.</p>

I am unable to provide information about the specific content of the agreement at this stage, but I can confirm that UK officials operating the current juxtaposed controls at Coquelles and the Gare du Nord in Paris do not accept asylum claims. Where such applications are made they remain the responsibility of the French authorities to consider. There are no plans to adopt different procedures at Calais. The current procedure operated at Coquelles and the Gare du Nord is in accordance with the requirements of the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and the Dublin Convention. We will be consulting relevant organisations, including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), in finalising these arrangements.</p>

In conjunction with the Electoral Commission, the Office of the e-Envoy and local authorities, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is exploring what more can usefully be done&mdash;before, during and after the electoral process&mdash;to ensure the e-voting pilot programme takes full advantage of the opportunities afforded by the advent of new technologies. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's aim is to engage with and better inform voters and other key stakeholders of the electoral process, increase the opportunity for voting and maintain the integrity and security of the ballot.</p>

What bonuses are paid to these staff is therefore a matter for individual Departments and agencies. This Information is not held centrally. The new pay and performance management arrangements for the senior civil service are designed to reward and provide incentives for high performance. Under these arrangements all Departments awarded non-consolidated bonuses to their top performers. Performance bonuses totalling #6 million were paid to those who contributed most to their Department's objectives. Bonuses were paid to around 55 per cent. of senior civil service staff.</p>

	<p pid=".80W.0/1">The Navy Star Programme provides key IS support to RN vessels. A common IT infrastructure is being progressively deployed across the fleet. With the exception of two vessels, the programme will be complete by 2005. The rate of deployment is constrained by the availability of suitable fitting opportunities. All ship's staff have access to the system, which supports a comprehensive range of administrative and operational support applications, as well as standard OA facilities. An e-mail capability provides connectivity to shore users, including families and friends for welfare purposes. The system is refreshed on a cycle of upgrades to sustain and improve capability.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.0/2">A significant number of Royal Navy Command Support Systems, used for the planning and execution of maritime and amphibious operations, have been deployed operationally (39 ships and 10 shore units). An incremental rollout programme delivers regular capability enhancements. The most recent of these enhancements has been to upgrade the hardware in 2001 and 2002 to provide the latest commercial off-the-shelf systems, giving better performance and reliability. Software has also recently been improved with the release of Version 7 software. This will give direct benefit to the new Landing Platform Dock (Replacement) amphibious ships and also the aircraft carriers in their role as NATO High Readiness Force (Maritime) Commander.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.0/3">In addition to the above, the Ship Command System in the aircraft carriers and TYPE 42 destroyers, including the Landing Platform: Helicopter&mdash;HMS Ocean, is undergoing a programme to replace obsolescent display screens. The Endurance and Archer class inshore training vessels have also had electronic planned maintenance systems fitted to improve availability.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.0/4">A large proportion of the electrical/electronics systems fitted within RN vessels and their weapons systems use computers or incorporate software or firmware to support their specific functionality. Such equipment is not considered to fall within the heading of 'information technology, and accordingly, has not been included in this answer.</p>

	<p pid=".81W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 16&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-12-20">20 December 2002</phrase>. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Development and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland also attended.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/2">The Council, after lengthy negotiation, reached conclusions by qualified majority on the linked matters of Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform, urgent measures to bring about the recovery of cod stocks and the setting of total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/3">On CFP reform, the Council's conclusions were embodied in three new regulations, one addressing the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fishing resources and redefining the basic framework of the CFP, one permitting an emergency Community measure for scrapping fishing vessels, and one amending the provisions concerning Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. Key features, including some points which the UK fought hard to secure, are:</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/4" class="indent">renewal for a further 10 years of the regime confining access to the 6 to 12 mile zones to fishing vessels which have traditionally fished there;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/5" class="indent">renewal of the Shetland Box pending a Commission review during 2003 of all such access restrictions to determine whether their continued application is justified in conservation terms;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/6" class="indent">retention of the principle of relative stability for allocating fishing opportunities among member states on the basis of historical fishing patterns, explicitly including the Hague Preference arrangements which can provide additional fishing opportunities to the UK and Ireland when TACs fall below determined trigger levels;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/7" class="indent">confirmation, in relation to the access which Spain, Portugal and Finland gain to the North Sea from <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> under their Treaties of Accession, that there has been no adjustment to allocations of regulated stocks in favour of these member states, which may fish only for unregulated stocks. There is also a commitment to monitor any consequential impact on regulated stocks;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/8" class="indent">commitment to a multi-annual approach to stock management based on recovery plans, involving effort limitation where necessary, for stocks which are outside safe biological limits, and management plans for other stocks. Recovery plans will be developed during 2003 for southern hake, sole in the Western Channel and Bay of Biscay, Rockall haddock, and nephrops in the Cantabrian Sea and off the Iberian peninsula;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/9" class="indent">provision to establish Regional Advisory Councils to improve the participation of fishermen and other stakeholders in the process of managing fisheries; the ending of public aid for the building of fishing vessels at the end of 2004. In the meantime such aid will be restricted to member states who have met national limits on fleet capacity and to vessels under 400 GT. Entry of vessels to the fleet will have to be balanced by the removal of tonnage without aid, in accordance with an entry/exit ratio. Where a vessel of over 100 gross tonnes built with grant aid enters the fleet, vessels equivalent to 135 per cent. of its tonnage must be removed;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/10" class="indent">aid for modernising fishing vessels will be available only for vessels that are at least five-years-old to improve safety, product quality or working conditions, to switch to more selective fishing techniques, or to equip vessels with Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS); an increase in the maximum rate of EU scrapping grant was agreed, to help member states achieve the decommissioning of vessels whose fishing effort has to be reduced by 25 per cent. or more under the terms of a recovery plan;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/11" class="indent">aid for the permanent transfer of EU vessels to third countries will cease at the end of 2004 and be subjected to conditions in the meantime;</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/12" class="indent">a range of improvements will be made to the coherence of enforcement and control arrangements and the imposition of sanctions, with the Commission taking a stronger monitoring and co-ordinating role and VMS being extended to vessels over 18 metres from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase> and to vessels over 15 metres from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/13">On TACs and quotas, the Council started by examining a Commission proposal whose central element was severe cuts, equating to an 80 per cent. reduction in fishing mortality, in the TACs for the cod stocks for which scientists recommended a fishing moratorium, together with the species (haddock and whiting) most closely associated with them, as well as substantial TAC cuts for other associated species. A solution was negotiated under which higher TACs than proposed by the Commission were adopted alongside an emergency recovery measure for cod based on a much simplified approach which the Commission brought forward in the course of the Council.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/14">The recovery measure is incorporated as Annex XVII to the Regulation setting TACs and quotas for 2003, and will control effort from <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-01">1 February 2003</phrase> by limiting days which may be spent at sea by vessels which catch cod in the North Sea, West of Scotland and Skaggerak and Kattegat. Vessels under 10 metres in length are not subject to these controls. Different limitations (expressed as numbers of days absent from port per calendar month) are set according to the type of gear carried. Hence some vessels (eg pelagic trawlers) fall outside the scheme altogether, while nephrops vessels will be allowed 25 days per month. The number of days to be allowed for whitefish demersal trawlers was absolutely critical for the UK, given the unacceptable and devastating effect the Commission's opening suggestion of seven days per calendar month would have had on our industry. The eventual outcome was that we secured a commitment that under the terms of the various conditions attached to the limitations in the EU measure, UK whitefish demersal trawlers would be allowed a total of 15 days absent from port per month.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/15">The measure allows for some flexibility to move days between months and between vessels. The operational details for these new arrangements will be worked up urgently, in close consultation with the industry. The Council and Commission envisage that, with this emergency measure in place, a more sophisticated regime will be developed for implementation from <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>, based on proposals to be brought forward by the Commission by <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-15">15 February</phrase> and agreed by the Council by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/16">On this basis, the Council set TACs and quotas for 2003 which broadly maintain 2002 levels for pelagic stocks and nephrops but significantly reduce TACs for key whitefish species such as cod, haddock, whiting and anglerfish. Reductions of the order of 50 per cent. in the TACs for these latter species in the North Sea and West of Scotland represent a considerable gain in fishing opportunities compared with the Commission's original proposals, whilst significantly enhancing the prospects for the recovery of these stocks in the long term. The closure to sandeel fishing of the area off the north east British coast, as applied for the last three years, is renewed for 2003. For Irish Sea stocks, it was agreed that the 2002 cod recovery arrangements, which include a springtime closure of part of the Irish Sea, should continue for 2003 with reduced TACS for such stocks as cod, haddock and whiting.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/17">The Council agreed a re-allocation of existing Spanish structural funds to provide financial support to Spanish fishermen and mussel and oyster growers affected by the Prestige oil spill.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/18">The Council agreed the conclusions of the Commission's action plan for the Mediterranean, which envisages the development of specific management measures for the area.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/19">The Commissioner also presented a draft regulation on the management of fishing effort in western waters. He explained that he considered this to be necessary to eliminate any legal uncertainty concerning the applicability of some of the measures to the activities of Spanish and Portuguese vessels, following the expiry on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase> of the transitional period foreseen in the 1985 Act of Accession. No decisions were reached on this proposal, which will be examined by the Council in coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/20">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on measures to update food hygiene rules applying to products of animal origin. It also reached political agreement by qualified majority on measures to update EU rules on the use of additives in animal feed.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/21">The Council also agreed conclusions on animal welfare in third countries and on mutual assistance between member states regarding animal welfare. The Commission reported progress on developing further proposals on the protection of animals in transport.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/22">The Council was unable to reach agreement on a proposal for new rules governing feedstuffs for organic livestock. Under the relevant Comitology procedures, the Commission will adopt the new measure under its own powers in January. The Commission, having reported on the progress of its work to develop an EU level Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming, was remitted to continue its efforts and report further by the end of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/23">The Council approved by qualified majority arrangements to protect the EU market from a surge in low priced cereals from Russia and the Ukraine. The Commission reported agreements reached with the US and Canada to establish reduced tariff quotas for certain cereals and the Council authorised the Commission to implement the deal from the beginning of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/24">Over lunch, the Commission presented a paper which it proposes to submit to the WTO in the context of the Doha Round negotiations on agriculture. It proposed a number of specific reductions in tariff levels, export subsidies and domestic support. I welcomed the paper as an important first step in the process now leading up to the Cancun Ministerial meeting in September while warning that our negotiating partners were likely to press for a more ambitious outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.0/25">Under other business, Germany reported national action it had taken to reduce levels of acrylamide in food; and Italy raised concerns over the co-existence of GM and conventional agriculture.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.9/1">The Association of British Insurers have stated that they will review the situation with Government on a regular basis. Insurance matters are for the Treasury, but there appear to be no grounds for Government intervention as insurance for flood risk is available to by far the majority of those properties situated on the floodplain. People must remember that the insurance industry is a competitive one and they may benefit from 'shopping around'.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.9/2">The nature of the risk in undefended areas means that insurers cannot guarantee to maintain cover, but will examine the risks on a case by case basis, use their best efforts to continue to provide cover and will work with the owners of domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure to see what action could be taken by the property owner, the Environment Agency and the local authority, which might make the property insurable in some form. This action might include the use of accredited products, flood resilient materials and temporary defences to defend the property.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.3/1">The UN Secretary General's report covered many aspects of the problems of children affected by armed conflict, including their direct involvement. The most effective way to reduce the impact of armed conflict on children, their families and communities, is to prevent, reduce and resolve armed conflicts. My Department is working with other Government Departments to intensify UK efforts to resolve conflict. In relation to children affected by armed conflict, my Department is supporting UNICEF through a multi-year capacity-building project to increase its ability to work with all concerned to decrease the impact of armed conflict on children and to support the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation of child soldiers. We have also been supporting the work of the Secretary General's special representative on children and armed conflict. UNICEF's work on establishing national immunisation days (NIDs), mentioned in the report, is also supported by my Department.</p>

	<p pid=".90W.2/1">Precise information on the extent of humanitarian needs remains incomplete. Large numbers of people, particularly among immigrant communities but also Ivorian citizens and refugees, have been displaced due to the conflict. There are real humanitarian needs and the situation could deteriorate quickly with scope for further conflict. In December, as an initial response to immediate needs, we released 2,000 tents, 30,000 blankets and 200 rolls of plastic sheeting from our emergency relief stockpile to boost UNHCR's regional stockpile in Accra, Ghana; also contributed towards an urgent airlift of UNHCR relief items to Liberia. I have also recently approved a contribution of #1 million towards appeals from agencies working in Cote d'lvoire. We continue to monitor the humanitarian situation and are working closely with others in the international community to try to bring about a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.3/1">There has been a trend towards reintroduction of sorghum in southern Mozambique to promote resilience to drought.

	<p pid=".92W.3/2">Though sorghum resists drought a little bit better than maize, it is not a drought resistant crop, it is very labour intensive, has a long growing period and has high demands on soil fertility and moisture. Maize has also tended to experience steady market prices and an unlimited demand on the market as an export crop for Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.3/3">The FAO meeting concluded that the best solution for southern Africa would be to identify patches with the right conditions for either maize or sorghum, and that the success of the introduction of any new crop will depend on the prevailing economic and marketing prospects.</p>

	<p pid=".93W.0/1">Catherine Bertini's report, and the subsequent UN Humanitarian Plan of Action, stimulated a very useful debate in the international community on how best to respond to the growing humanitarian crisis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I agreed in October 2002 an additional #5 million DFID contribution to help meet most urgent needs of the Palestinian people. Total projected expenditure for support to Palestinians for this financial year is now #32 million. This comprises #15 million bilaterally and #17 million through UNRWA.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.2/1">Fuel supplies have been erratic in Zimbabwe for the last three years. The problem is a direct consequence of economic mismanagement. Foreign exchange to pay for fuel is very scarce, yet it is still sold at controlled prices that do not cover costs.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.2/2">Larger organisations such as the UN and International NGOs, and other Government missions including DFID, have contracted to purchase fuel direct from importers at world-market rates and pay in foreign currency. The WFP has buffer stocks, some of which are in the rural areas and their feeding programmes are not likely to be seriously disrupted.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.2/3">Smaller organisations that rely on the commercial transport industry to distribute their food have been harder hit. However, these too are becoming more adept in covering short-term fuel problems, either through building up a reserve when fuel is available, or pre-positioning food supplies in rural areas. DFID's feeding partner organisations all pre-positioned food in the rural areas for the Christmas and new year period, and food distribution has continued.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.2/4">The short-term impact of fuel shortages has therefore been minimal to date.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.9/1">The European Council at Seville agreed a number of practical changes that do not require Treaty amendment but do improve the effectiveness and transparency of the Council. These are now in place. They focus on improving the practices of the European Council, reform of the General Affairs Council, delivering more openness when legislating on dossiers subject to co-decision, and rationalising the number of sectoral Council formations from 16 to 9. These changes have already led to more effective preparation of European Council meetings during the Danish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.9/2">Heads of State and Government at Seville also agreed that the Council should consider further change in parallel with the Convention on the Future of Europe. The European Council at Copenhagen took note of a Presidency paper that set out possible models for Council reform. The Government will also continue to pursue these issues in the Convention.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.6/1">The UK supports the principle of host state responsibility, whereby each state is responsible for the security of civil aircraft leaving that state. This is enshrined in Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention 1944.</p>

The UK has contributed to the development of EU regulations which are about to be published, making basic security standards mandatory in the Union. In addition, there is also close liaison with the US Transport Security Administration, the Israeli Security Agency and equivalent bodies of other key international partners on aviation security issues.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.6/3">Using the powers of the Aviation Security Act 1982, all non-UK carriers flying into the UK have been required since <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase> to ensure that all flight doors are locked while in UK airspace or on the ground while the engines are in operation, that the flight crew do not leave the flight deck other than for certain specified reasons, and that passengers cannot obtain access to the flight deck while in UK airspace.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.6/4">As regards UK carrier operations from overseas airports, my Department issues guidance on the recommended security measures that should be implemented where the threat to those operations dictates. Departmental inspectors have been undertaking a programme of visits to particular locations to assess the security afforded to and carried out by UK carriers and, where appropriate, liaise with the relevant authorities to improve standards. The frequency and coverage of these inspections has been stepped up significantly in recent months.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.6/5">My Department will shortly be establishing Regional Aviation Security Advisers in East Africa and the Middle East. Their role will be to advise and assist the relevant authorities to improve aviation security standards in those areas and to assess and influence how flights to the UK are secured. Further appointments are planned for West Africa, South East Asia and the Indian sub-continent later in the year.</p>

The consultants are expected to report next month and will include an assessment of the impact on CO2 levels for the preferred strategy across the study area as a whole. The three regional planning bodies whose areas the study relates to will then consider the recommendations of the study and pass their advice to Ministers.

Langley Junior School applied on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-07">7 November 2002</phrase> to gain exemption from the Changing of School Session Times Regulations 1999. The application has been approved because it will enable the school to create time for a curriculum enrichment session for pupils, and planning, preparation and assessment time for teachers. The Power to Innovate was needed to enable the school to implement the changes sooner than the start of the new school year (as required by regulations).

It will be for schools to decide which European Union language is chosen. Over and above that, it is for schools to decide which and how many languages they choose to offer. Schools may decide for example to offer one main language, or one or two main languages and additional 'taster' sessions in other languages. In addition, by drawing in foreign language speakers, such as parents, those in the community and in business, schools will be in a position to offer and promote a much wider range of languages than has been possible before.</p>

There are also many online and offline ICT resources already available for teachers, including the British Educational SoftwareDatabase and the National Grid for Learning website. The Department is currently considering other ways of using ICT to support the teaching and learning of Modern Foreign Languages at Key Stage 2.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.3/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is establishing a common funding approach for 2003&ndash;04 for further education, work-based learning, and school sixth forms. This replaces the previous separate funding arrangements for these three sectors. Adult and community learning will be brought progressively into the common funding approach as far as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.3/2">The main principle of the common funding approach is that funding must follow the learner. It is built on the best elements of the former Further Education Funding Council's national system of formula based funding. The key elements of this system include funding elements for the basic costs for delivering all programmes, the extra costs for specialist programmes, learner achievement, extra support for disadvantaged learners, and higher costs for delivering provision in London and related areas.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.3/3">The LSC National Council has set up a Funding Group to consider future development of the common funding approach, including simplification of funding arrangements in response to the recommendations of the Bureaucracy Task Force. The LSC will take account of the XSuccess for All&quot; strategy document and the forthcoming Government statements on 14&ndash;19 learning and on the Review of Funding of Adult Learning. We will ensure that the outcome and implications are clear for school sixth forms, colleges and other providers of further education and training.</p>

	<p pid=".124W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/2">The Cabinet Office report, XPrivate Action, Public Benefit&quot;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-25">25 September 2002</phrase>. Its 61 recommendations set out a package of measures which aim to modernise charity law and enable a wide range of organisations to be more effective and innovative.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/3">The report recommends that in future all charities should have to demonstrate public benefit. Part of the report considers what happens now with those charities that charge fees which serve to exclude large sections of the population in terms of their having to make provision for wider access for those who would be excluded because of the fees. The report cites the example of independent schools.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/4">At present there is no systematic programme in place to check the public character of charities. The report recommends that an on-going review programme run by the Charity Commission should check the public character of such organisations. It is proposed that the commission would identify charities likely to charge high fees (such as independent schools) and undertake a rolling programme to check that provision was made for wider access. This programme will be designed to minimise red tape and will not focus on any particular sector. Short returns will be issued which ask charities what they do in terms of widening access, such as making provision for sharing facilities. It is envisaged that for the majority of cases no further inquiry will be necessary beyond the initial return.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/5">It is proposed that the Charity Commission, in consultation with charities likely to be affected and their umbrella bodies, would issue guidelines as to the level of access appropriate in particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/6">Of course at the moment these are only proposals. The report was out for consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>, and we shall consider the responses to this, and all the other matters addressed in the report, very carefully.</p>

	<p pid=".133W.2/2">The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21-year-olds who enter higher education for the first time, are given in the table. There was an increase in the index in 1997&ndash;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&ndash;99.

The members of the Council commended the Secretary General for the initiatives he had taken in November and December 2002 to bridge the gaps between the two sides and to enable them to reach an agreement. They expressed the view that the proposal put forward on <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase> as revised on <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase> offered an unique opportunity to reach a settlement in the coming weeks. They regretted that the Turkish Cypriot leadership had not responded in a timely way to the initiatives of the Secretary General; and they called for its constructive efforts to reach a settlement in conformity with the timetable proposed by the Secretary General. They welcomed the willingness of both sides to continue the negotiations in the period ahead. They underlined the importance of intensifying the negotiations so that full agreement could be reached before <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase>, in conformity with the timetable proposed by the Secretary General in his proposals. They urged both sides to work on the basis of the Secretary General's revised proposals of <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase>. The members of the Council drew attention to the unique opportunity that existed for the settlement of this long-running problem; and to the benefits for all concerned from so doing, so that all Cypriots can benefit from Cyprus's accession to the European Union. They urged all concerned to seize the historic opportunity to bring a peaceful, just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem to the benefit of all its people and the wider region.The members of the Council expressed their full support for the continuation of the Secretary General's mission of good offices and his efforts to bring about a settlement in the first two months of 2003.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".136W.3/1">There were no specific discussions of illegal immigration at the Copenhagen European Council. The European Council in Seville in June 2002 focussed on ways to tackle illegal immigration and asylum, agreeing specific tasks and a timetable for implementing them. Good progress has been made on implementing these objectives. The Greek Presidency has identified combating illegal immigration as one of its priorities. Heads of State and Governments will assess progress in implementing the Seville Conclusions at the European Council in June 2003.</p>

But we also fully support the Secretary-General's Reform report, which we believe will help to achieve a more efficient UN with resources focussed on priority activities.

Northern Ireland is reasonably well served at present by the existing transport linkages with Scotland, however there is always potential for such links to be further strengthened and enhanced, and I would expect this to happen as the private sector operators respond to new commercial opportunities and the changing market.

	<p pid=".145W.3/1">ASW is in administrative receivership and discussions with potential purchasers of the company are entirely a matter for the receivers, KPMG. My Department has therefore had no discussions with Celsa. My Department has, as you might expect, maintained a dialogue, and met, with KPMG to keep abreast of developments in order to assess the future of the company and its workforce.

The discussions between Celsa and KPMG are subject to a confidentiality agreement and so full details of the proposed agreement are not known at this stage. Celsa has indicated that if its bid is finalised it hopes to create jobs for around 600 in Cardiff. KPMG continue discussions with prospective purchasers for the parts of the Sheerness plant not included in the proposed Celsa deal and I very much hope that a buyer can be found.</p>

	<p pid=".151W.3/2">Royal Mail Holdings published their interim financial statements on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-14">14 November 2002</phrase>. These showed that in the six months to <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-29">29 September 2002</phrase> the company made a post-tax loss of #484 million on turnover of just under #4 billion.

	<p pid=".151W.3/3">The Government believe the necessary changes to remedy this disappointing performance are now under way. These changes include the appointment of new board members, a major restructuring programme under the chairman, Allan Leighton, and making available the #1.8 billion of accumulated reserves, which will back investment required in the mails business and Post Office Ltd.</p>

On changeover of payment arrangements, all customers who wish to do so will be able to access their benefits in cash at a post office counter and sub-postmasters will be remunerated for those transactions. The change in revenue as a result of changes to the method of paying benefits from April 2003 will vary according to the individual circumstances of each office, and the extent to which they develop new revenue streams, including from banking services.</p>

Banking will be a central part of the Post Office's strategy to move forward. Universal banking services, together with plans for the expansion of network banking, should lead to substantial increases in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone.</p>

There is also commercial interest in placing kiosks in retail outlets including post offices. It is expected that a commercial kiosk pilot run by E-Daily will start in Cornwall next year and that this will involve a number of post offices. Officials in my Department are in contact with other departments about the potential for using E-Daily as an information channel and I understand that E-Daily is in direct touch with other departments as well as with the National Federation of Sub Postmasters.</p>

For this reason, mineworkers with less than five years contributory service were excluded. For most MPS members, service prior to April 1961 is not included because they opted to take a refund of contributions with respect to that service, although service prior to April 1961 is counted in the cases of those who chose not to exercise that option.

The conclusions also underlined the importance of implementation of the new regulatory framework for electronic communications, and agreed that intervention in the form of state aid was not the way forward. In particular, the Council emphasised the importance of placing the information society and the telecommunications sector high on the agenda of the Spring European Council, and invited the Commission to report on these subjects in due time beforehand and if necessary put forward appropriate proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.12/3">There was also adoption of two resolutions: one on the implementation (including the benchmarking) of the eEurope Action Plan 2005; and another on promoting a culture of network and information security. Council conclusions were also adopted on eSkills. There was also an agreement on a general approach, without the need for a vote, towards the MODINIS programme which helps fund the implementation of the eEurope Action Plan 2005, and work on network security. Regarding the dti Department of Trade and Industry Commission's proposal for a Directive on the re-use and commercial exploitation of public sector information, the presidency concluded that a common position is likely to be adopted at the March Council following adoption of an opinion by the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.12/4">The Commission also gave a short presentation on its eighth report on the implementation of the current regulatory framework for telecommunications which reiterated the importance of timely, effective and coherent implementation of the new regulatory framework for electronic communications. The Commission also reported progress on its work on open platforms for digital television and 3G mobile, and on electronic identification and authentication systems in e-commerce, on which public hearings are expected in the New Year.</p>

For illustrative purposes, the report concludes that the capital costs of an HVDC link capable of transferring 2000 MW of electricity would range from #790 million for a 200 km cable to #1,700 million for a 700 km cable.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/2">The report is a useful contribution to the important debate on the best way of transmitting renewable energy generated in Scotland to centres of demand in the south.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.0/1">The UK Government have been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Under the terms of the HIPC initiative bilateral creditors typically provide 90 per cent. debt relief. However, many creditors, including the UK, go further and provide 100 per cent. debt relief to qualifying countries.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.0/2">In the provision of interim debt relief at Decision Point to reach a debt-to-exports ratio of 150 per cent. this additional bilateral voluntary debt relief is excluded. Subsequently at Completion Point if this debt ratio is greater than 150 per cent., perhaps due to new borrowing or weaker export prices, the initiative provides the option for further debt relief or 'topping-up'. Moreover, the UK has argued that we should be prepared to be proactive and flexible in providing this additional debt relief at Completion Point.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.0/3">But at present this additional bilateral voluntary debt relief is included in the calculation of any 'topping-up' needed, and the net effect is that this additional relief benefits other creditors and not the HI PC. The UK believes that this additional relief should be excluded from the calculation of topping-up at Completion Point, and this would delineate more clearly the burden sharing between all creditors, both bilateral and multilateral, in the HIPC initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.0/4">This policy would ensure that this voluntary debt relief over and above HIPC terms would be truly additional. Moreover, it would provide an additional degree of support to vulnerable HIPCs facing the challenges of a global economic slowdown and weaker commodity prices.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.0/5">However, even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still far short of the resources needed to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is our ultimate objective to make a lasting difference in the lives of the world's poorest people by achieving the MDGs, but debt relief is only part of the solution: the real issue is one of total resources. That is why the Chancellor has proposed an International Financing Facility to leverage significant additional resources from developed countries, to help achieve the 2015 MDGs. Increasing our support from $50billion currently to the $100 billion a year needed to meet the MDGs would transform the ability of countries to increase their investment in critical poverty reducing programmes. The UK Government will shortly be publishing a detailed proposal on the International Financing Facility.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.2/1">There are significant concerns about whether currently available measures give adequate estimates of house price inflation. The Land Registry produces the most comprehensive measure, covering all transactions in England and Wales. However, price changes as measured by the Land Registry are affected by changes in the composition (mix) of transactions, as well as pure price changes. Mix- adjustment is desirable as there is significant variation from one period to the next in the characteristics of properties sold size, type eg flat or house, location and other factors that affect price. Figures from the Halifax and Nationwide are mix-adjusted, and also more timely, but only cover properties purchased with mortgages from these providers. These two indicators can show significant differences, highlighting concerns as to how representative they are. The Government is concerned about such discrepancies, and is therefore planning to launch a new official house price measure in the Summer 2003, though it will not cover non-mortgage financed house purchases.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-23">23 December 2002</phrase> the Inland Revenue issued a press notice setting out measures to be included in the Finance Bill 2003 changing some of the rules for taxing life insurance companies. The proposed package of measures will remove certain anomalies and prevent a small number of companies exploiting particular circumstances to pay much less tax than other companies writing similar business. The changes will therefore protect the tax base and ensure a fairer distribution of tax across the industry. Copies of the Press Notice have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and full details have been published on the Inland Revenue's web site.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.6/2">Ministers have met members of the ASW Action Group and their constituency MPs to discuss the Group's concerns about the Cardiff and Sheemess pension schemes. We identified a number of practical ways forward and have written to the hon. Member on a number of detailed technical pension issues on the process of winding up, and has raised the concerns of the Group as appropriate within Government.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.6/3">It was also suggested that the scheme's independent trustee might like to contact the Inland Revenue to discuss the option of members being re-introduced into the State Second Pension (formerly SERPS). It may be possible, under the 'deemed buyback' provisions contained in the Pensions Act 1995, for members to have their state scheme rights restored, thus ensuring that they receive an additional pension under the state scheme, in addition to basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.6/4">The Government recognises that the ASW situation is extremely unfortunate, and that is why it acted quickly to put in place a range of measures through Jobcentre Plus, in conjunction with key partner organisations to help those employees being made redundant. No responsible Government could agree to be the guarantor of private pension savings. It would place huge liabiliites on tax payers some of whom will not have private savings of their own.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.6/5">The Government is concerned about schemes that wind up with insufficient assets to cover their liabilities. That is why it has set out proposals aimed at improving protection for scheme members in the pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement', Cm 5677. The Green Paper includes proposals to share out scheme assets more fairly, introduce some form of insurance and strengthen protection for members whose solvent employer chooses to wind up its scheme</p>

Under the programme, providers of support services and local authorities will encourage people to claim the Housing Benefit to which they are entitled, if they have not already done so. However, the impact of the programme on benefit take-up will not be measurable in isolation.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.5/1">Provision of an occupational pension scheme is a voluntary act by the employer and changes in the numbers of occupational pensions schemes since the abolition of the right to make membership compulsory in 1988 are unlikely to be related to whether membership of any particular scheme is compulsory.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.5/2">A significant number of employees are not taking advantage of the occupational pension provision of their employers. The General Household Survey (2001) indicates that less than 70 per cent of employees whose employer provides a pension scheme actually participate in their employer's scheme. As a result, the Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' Cm 5677, suggests options for employers to be able to make membership of their occupational pension schemes a condition of employment for new employees. This could be one way of increasing the numbers of employees who are members of, and contributing to, their occupational pension scheme and may have benefits for employers in terms of recruitment and retention of staff.</p>

	<p pid=".175W.3/1">The Department does not collect statistics on violence against social workers centrally. However, it did commission a national task force on violence against social workers that reported early in 2001. The task force made a number of recommendations that were accepted by Government and social care employer organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.3/2">The early targets recommended by the task force were for employers to: undertake an audit of their organisation's ability to deal with violence and abuse, do a training needs analysis for their workforce, prepare an action plan and begin to effect planned developments. The longer term target was for local authority employers to reduce incidents of violence and abuse by 25 per cent. by 2005 and the Department is working with employers to set up the means to measure their progress. The Department maintains and updates a website that was set up under the auspices of the task force on violence against social care. It is at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/violenttaskforce">www.doh.gov.uk/violenttaskforce</a>. The Department does not collect information on reported number of violent or abusive incidents by groups of staff or by services such as child protection within the national health service. However, in June 2002 the following survey was published: X2000/2001 Reported Violent or Abusive Incidents, Accidents Involving Staff and Sickness Absence in NHS Trusts and Health Authorities in England&quot;. This survey states that there were a total of 84,273 reported violent or abusive incidents across all the staff in NHS trusts and health authorities in England in 2000&ndash;01. A copy of this report is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".178W.0/1">The Reforming Emergency Care Strategy was launched in October 2001. It states that an additional 183 accident and emergency (A&amp;E) consultants will be recruited by 2004, an increase of 40 per cent., as part of the planned expansion of consultant numbers in the NHS Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".178W.0/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase>, there were 486 consultants in A&amp;E. This represents an increase of 26 per cent. since September 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".178W.0/3">Current workforce projections suggest that by March 2004, there may be sufficient trained specialists to increase numbers in A&amp;E by around 190 over a 2,000 baseline. This takes account of expected numbers of additional recruits and numbers leaving due to retirement.</p>

	<p pid=".184W.11/2">Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals are part of a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases. The precise nature of the agent responsible for CJD is not fully understood, but the most likely theory points to an abnormal form, known as a prion, of a normal cell protein. According to the protein-only hypothesis, infectious prions are composed mainly if not entirely of the abnormal form of the prion protein, which aggregates in infected tissue.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.11/3">Post mortem examination of the brains of CJD patients and BSE animals shows the accumulation of the abnormal protein and there is a massive destruction of the brain, which shows the characteristic spongy appearance.</p>
	<p pid=".184W.11/4">Although there is no direct evidence that the BSE prion is infectious to humans, obtaining such evidence could not be justified ethically as this would require humans to be inoculated with BSE agent. A judgment on the link between BSE and vCJD inevitably depends on an assessment of a range of clinical, pathological, epidemiological and laboratory based evidence. There is now convincing evidence that the agent causing BSE is the cause of vCJD, although there remains uncertainty about the future number of cases and the mechanism of transmission of BSE to humans.</p>

The service will give NHS staff a single e-mail address that can be securely accessed from within the NHS network as well as from the Internet. This will be particularly useful to NHS staff based in more than one organisation or who require mobile working in the community. Staff will also be able to access their e-mails via portable devices such as mobile phones or personal digital assistants as well as from home.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.0/1">The Department has the following monitoring mechanisms in place:</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/2" class="indent">(a) The overall performance of each council is assessed by the Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) each year, using a range of evidence from performance indicators, inspections and twice-yearly monitoring information. This assessment incorporates evidence on effectiveness and efficiency. A summary of the performance is published as a performance star rating, ranging from zero to three stars. The most recent star ratings were published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-15">15 November 2002</phrase>. A more detailed summary of performance is contained in a performance letter written by the SSI to each council. These are published on theDepartment's website, at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/pssratings/councilsbylist.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/pssratings/councilsbylist.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/3" class="indent">(b) It is the responsibility of each individual council to decide what resources to allocate to social services. Most of local government resources are not earmarked by central government. The exception is ring-fenced grants, which have to be spent in accordance with grant conditions; this is a relatively small proportion and will decrease further in future years.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.0/4" class="indent">(c) As in the answer to <i>(a)</i>, the SSI assess the performance of councils, and this includes an assessment of community care services for older people.</p>

	<p pid=".200W.11/1">The number of dentists practising in the general dental service has risen consistently in recent years. Most of these dentists spend most of their time on national health service work. However, access to routine NHS dentistry can be an issue in some parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".200W.11/2">A number of initiatives have been implemented to address this shortfall. New ways of working and new ways of paying dentists will be explored in the Options for Change field sites, which have been identified by the NHS Modernisation Agency, working closely with the profession. The learning gained from these field sites will be used to inform future changes to NHS dentistry as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".204W.14/3">The research has concluded that primary care groups and trusts have continued to build on their early achievements in establishing infrastructures and their capacity to improve services. They have continued to improve access to care, extend the range of services available in primary care settings and raise quality standards. The reports are available on the NPCRDC website at: <a href="http://www.npcrdc.man.ac.uk">www.npcrdc.man.ac.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".204W.14/4">The national primary and care trust development programme (NatPaCT) has also been working with primary care trusts (PCTs) to develop a competency framework as a self-assessment tool to help PCTs assess their organisational competence to deliver the National Health Service agenda. It provides guidance on organisational and personal competencies. The NatPaCT programme and competency framework has been made available to all PCTs and can also be downloaded from the NatPaCT website at: <a href="http://www.natpact.nhs.uk">www.natpact.nhs.uk</a></p>

	<p pid=".211W.5/1">Since March 2002, we have taken a number of steps aimed at improving the delivery of thrombolysis, including:</p>
	<p pid=".211W.5/2" class="indent">investment of #10 million from the New Opportunities fund for cardiac monitoring equipment, electro-cardiograph (ECG) machines, on 999 ambulances, to support faster thrombolysis either en route or on arrival at the acute hospital;</p>
	<p pid=".211W.5/3" class="indent">a further #14 million a year central investment over the next three years to complete the programme of providing ECGs for 999 ambulances, to provide thrombolysis training for paramedics and to modernise communications between ambulances and acute hospitals;</p>
	<p pid=".211W.5/4" class="indent">work with the coronary heart disease collaborative to ensure paramedics pre-alert hospitals that heart attack patients are on the way, so that thrombolysis can be started immediately on arrival; and</p>
	<p pid=".211W.5/5" class="indent">a rapid review of best practice with the coronary heart disease collaborative to support better delivery of thrombolysis across the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".211W.5/6">In addition, in October 2002 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence published XGuidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction&quot;. In November 2002, the Royal College of Physicians published hospital performance data by the myocardial infarction national audit project. This should help hospitals to improve the time they take to provide thrombolysis to patients with a heart attack.</p>

	<p pid=".212W.2/1">There was no such agreement. At the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-11">11 July 2000</phrase> with representatives of the British Tinnitus Association, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Health (Mr. Hutton), who then had responsibility for sensory disabilities such as tinnitus, was asked for advice about sources of support for tinnitus research. My right hon. Friend suggested that an approach should be made to the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its grant in aid from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology and which is the main agency through which the Government supports medical research.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.2/2">While it is true to say that my right hon. Friend made clear that funds for tinnitus research might be available from the MRC, it would be a mistake to imply that he undertook to secure such funds. The MRC is independent in its funding decisions and does not generally earmark funds for particular topics.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.2/3">The MRC has discussed mechanisms of funding with representatives of the British Tinnitus Association, and always welcomes high quality applications for funding medical research, which are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. The MRC is currently funding research projects related to tinnitus, mainly at the MRC Institute for Hearing Research in Nottingham. The MRC is also funding some more basic work on the auditory system, and this would inform any developments in treatments for a range of hearing disorders including tinnitus.</p>
