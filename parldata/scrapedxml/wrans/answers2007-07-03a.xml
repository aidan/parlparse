	<p pid="a.949W.9/2">The AFCS injury came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> and applies to injuries and deaths caused by service on or after that date. All injury claims made between that date and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> have been cleared and a decision issued to the claimant. Therefore none are awaiting a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.9/3">With regards to the year 2006-07, as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, there were 593 AFCS injury claims being processed. Of these, 585 claims had been outstanding for less than six months; the remaining eight claims had been outstanding for less than one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.9/4">Outstanding claims are, by definition, at varying stages of being processed, and it is therefore not possible to say how many of the 593 claims will go on to receive an award.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.9/5">Information is not held on the number of injured personnel who have not made a claim to an AFCS award. Following the evaluation of the first year of operation of the AFCS, which found that the number of claims had been less than forecast, measures are being taken to ensure full awareness of the scheme. Possible lack of awareness in the early days of the scheme does not mean that personnel will lose out: they have five years to claim from the date of the injury.</p>

We are in discussion with a number of health trusts across the UK, including in the devolved Administrations, who have indicated an interest in participating in the pilot scheme. I expect the first pilots to launch later this summer. The pilots are planned to last for two years, after which they will be evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="a.950W.11/3">MOD will commission a process and outcome evaluation of the pilots over the two-year period. This will be an integral part of the project. The terms of the evaluation, which will cover the two years of the pilots and an additional period for follow-up and report-writing, have been advised by the Project Expert Group which comprises national clinical and health care experts. The evaluation will involve a comparison of the new model of services with services previously available in the same area and will compare the particular approach of individual pilot sites. The key measures will be the assessment and treatment regimes provided, and the patient (and carer) experience and outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.952W.5/2">The FRES programme is currently in its assessment phase. In common with all equipment programmes, the decision on where manufacture will take place will be confirmed when the main investment decision has been taken. It is envisaged that the majority of the vehicles will be manufactured in the UK but existing production lines located overseas may be used to manufacture initial batches of FRES vehicles in order to promote early delivery. We are clear, however, that the intellectual property rights, design authority, and systems architecture of the final FRES vehicle must reside in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.954W.11/1">In March 2003, the MOD established a research programme into the physical and psychological health of personnel deployed (regulars, reservists and MOD civilians) on Operation Telic (Op Telic) as part of its duty of care to serving personnel and in response to lessons learned from the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict. A team led by Professor Simon Wessely at King's Centre for Military Health Research has been carrying out the bulk of this research. The first findings were published in the Lancet last year and there is so far no sign of the repeat of Gulf veterans' illnesses in Service personnel coming back from Iraq. The other main finding of a slightly increased level of common mental health problems in reserve personnel who served in Iraq is being addressed through a package of additional healthcare. We have agreed a three year extension to our original Op Telic research project and Service personnel deployed to Afghanistan (Operation Herrick) will now specifically be covered by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.954W.11/2">Our biological monitoring policy is that all military personnel and civilians on recent operations, such as Iraq (Op Telic), and any future operations involving use of depleted uranium (DU) are offered a test for total uranium in the urine. A test for uranium isotopes, which determines whether the uranium is depleted, is offered if the initial test for the total uranium gives anomalous results. Around 390 personnel have taken this test. A separate screening programme overseen by the Depleted Uranium Oversight Board (DUOB) tested a total of 496 veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict and Balkans operations.

	<p pid="a.961W.9/1">The UK Government supports the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, a key priority of which is to strengthen and diversify legal livelihoods which free farmers and other rural workers from dependence on poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.9/2">DFID has provided &pound;77 million from 2005 to 2007 to support the development of legal rural livelihoods, much of which has been channelled through the Government of Afghanistan's own National Priority Programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.9/3">Alternatives to opium poppy can take many forms. There is no one single crop which will replace poppy, and therefore DFID has provided &pound;3 million to support research into a range of alternatives including high value crops such as mint and saffron. Traditional alternatives include crops such as wheat and onions.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.9/4">However, alternatives to poppy come not only in the form of different crops. They can often be non-farm activities such as clothes-making and shop keeping. The Government of Afghanistan's Microfinance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA) has provided over &pound;133 million worth of small loans to 364,786 Afghan families to help them invest in their own licit businesses. MISFA operates in 23 provinces, including Helmand. DFID has provided &pound;15 million to MISFA since March 2004. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.9/5">DFID also provided &pound;18 million in 2005-06 to the Government of Afghanistan's National Rural Access Programme (NRAP), which has so far built or repaired over 9,000 km of roads&mdash;essential for rural farmers to access markets. So far the programme has generated over 13 million days of labour for Afghans. NRAP operates in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.9/6">DFID has also provided &pound;42.6 million in total for the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and is providing &pound;10.6 million to roll out NSP in Helmand province (2006 to 2009). NSP is helping elected Community Development Councils (CDCs), representing over 17,000 communities across Afghanistan, identify development priorities in their areas and then receive grants to undertake the work. NSP has funded over 28,000 projects in agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport, and water supply. NSP currently operates in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.9/7">DFID is making a contribution of &pound;22.7 million over three years (as part of an overall UK Government contribution of &pound;30 million) to the Government of Afghanistan's Counter Narcotics Trust Fund.

	<p pid="a.962W.2/1">DFID has been supporting the Indian Government's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) universal elementary education programme, together with the World Bank and the European Commission, for the last five years to increase educational opportunities, particularly in rural areas where 75 per cent. of school-age children live. DFID has spent &pound;210 million over the five years 2003-04 to 2007-08 in support of SSA. Over the same period the World Bank has contributed &pound;330 million and the EC &pound;100 million. SSA is the central Government's prime vehicle for delivering on the Universal Primary Education (UPE) Millennium Development Goal (MDG), and the 2002 constitutional amendment that made elementary education a fundamental right in the country. The aim is to ensure that by 2010 all children in India are receiving eight years of basic education of acceptable quality, regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/2">SSA is a priority for the Indian Government, which last year spent over &pound;1.5 billion on the programme. Over 90 per cent. of India's Government elementary schools are in rural areas and SSA has a particular focus on these institutions. Very good progress is being made:</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/3" class="indent">The number of out of school children has fallen from 25 million in 2003 to 9.6 million in 2006 and the majority of the 15 million plus children that have been brought to school are from rural areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/4" class="indent">Drop out rates have fallen, particularly in rural areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/5" class="indent">Strong progress has been made towards gender and social equity, including for Scheduled Caste children, Scheduled Tribe children and children with disabilities, particularly in rural areas; and</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/6" class="indent">The gap in education indicators between rural and urban areas is narrowing. Rural primary enrolment rates are now just 3 per cent. behind those of urban areas. In rural areas there are now 89 girls for every 100 boys enrolled, compared to 94 girls for every 100 boys in urban areas. Examination pass rates are now almost identical in rural and urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/7">DFID and its development partners are currently preparing a second phase of external support to SSA. The support will have a strong focus on raising the quality of education, through teacher development, improved assessment systems, better school management and improved classroom practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/8">In addition to SSA, DFID has just approved &pound;35 million of support for Mahila Samakhya (MS), promoting Education for Women's Equality. This is the Government of India's main programme for tackling women's empowerment through education. It supports mostly rural women to organise into village level collectives called Mahila Sanghas, which empower women to resist violence; to gain better access to education and health services; to open up economic opportunities such as microfinance; and enhance women's role in local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/9">DFID's education programme in Pakistan does not focus on rural areas specifically. We generally work through the Federal and Provincial Governments to promote system reforms so our support benefits all, including urban, rural and remote areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/10">DFID is supporting nationwide educational development through the Gender and Education Policy Support Project (&pound;3.5 million over four years) and the National Education Assessment System (&pound;700,000 over five years). Both of these jointly funded programmes benefit rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/11">DFID is also funding education activities in specific parts of the country. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) DFID is supporting a Community Participation Education Project (&pound;550,000 over two years) covering four districts, most of which are rural. DFID support to the Faisalabad Devolution Project (&pound;6.4 million over four years) includes support to develop the strategic and management capacities in the education sector in the Faisalabad district, including support for the improvement of individual schools, many of which are in rural areas. In the Punjab province more widely DFID is contributing &pound;30 million over four years to the Asia Development Bank-led Punjab Devolved Social Services Programme, 17 per cent. of which is for support to education.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/12">DFID contribution to the reconstruction of the earthquake affected areas has a substantial element of this funding is for education, reconstruction and rehabilitation, with much of the earthquake affected areas being rural. We have agreed so far to contribute &pound;44 million in budget support and technical assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) held regular discussions with international colleagues on Palestinian development and I will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.5/2">Under the UK presidency, the EU led in negotiations with the parties and Secretary Rice to agree the Agreement on Movement and Access which was signed by Israel and the Palestinians in November 2005. This Agreement states that construction of a seaport should commence. The Agreement also notes the importance of an airport in Gaza and recommends that discussions on construction, security and operations should begin. Despite this Agreement, negotiations on the seaport and airport are currently on hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.5/3">At this difficult time in Gaza the urgent priorities are to ensure sufficient and regular supplies to meet the basic needs of Gaza's 1.3 million people and to re-open external trade. However, in the longer term, establishing reliable access to the outside world will be essential for sustainable economic development, poverty reduction and a viable Palestinian state.</p>

Detainees are held in temporary confinement due to their refractory or violent behaviour, but only because that behaviour presents a risk to either themselves, to others or to the good order and discipline of the centre.

	<p pid="a.976W.0/1">We have consulted widely at every stage throughout the design and development of ContactPoint and have received a number of representations about compliance with the Data Protection Act (DPA) and about confidentiality. We have worked closely with the Information Commissioner's Office and continue to enjoy an open and constructive relationship with them. We are confident that ContactPoint is fully compliant with the DPA and that the confidentiality of children, young people and their families have been taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/2">The fourth data protection principle provides that data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The draft Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007, laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>, will bring ContactPoint into operation. The draft regulations provide that local authorities and other suppliers of data to the system must take reasonable steps to ensure that the data is accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/3">Each local authority will be responsible for the records of children in their area and will have dedicated resources, funded by my Department, to carry out data matching and cleansing to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data held on ContactPoint. The DPA provides that individuals have the right to see personal data held about them and to have it corrected, where applicable. Draft statutory ContactPoint guidance, currently out for consultation until <phrase class="date" code="">27 July</phrase>, sets out how local authorities are expected to handle requests from children and their parents to see their information on ContactPoint and to have any inaccuracies resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/4">The confidentiality and security of the information held on ContactPoint&mdash;basic identifying information on all children in England and contact details of practitioners providing services to them&mdash;is a key priority. Details of practitioners providing sensitive services, defined as sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, may only be added to ContactPoint with the informed and explicit consent of the child, young person or, where appropriate, their parent. These sensitive service practitioner contact details will be hidden from the view of users. Local authority ContactPoint teams will broker contact between the sensitive service provider and another practitioner who considers that there is good reason to know who is providing the sensitive service.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/5">There will also be special arrangements to protect the records of children whose circumstances may mean that they are at increased risk, for example, where they are fleeing domestic violence. Information that could reveal the whereabouts of the child can be hidden from the view of ContactPoint users. Decisions to do this will be taken on a case by case basis and will be based on the level of threat posed if information becomes more widely available. This is entirely consistent with the principles of the DPA.</p>

	<p pid="a.977W.8/1">To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families pursuant to the answer of 13 June 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1158W, on primary education: drugs </p>
	<p pid="a.977W.8/2" class="numindent" qnum="146545">(1)  what estimate he has made of the percentage of children at <i> (a)</i> Key Stage 1 and <i> (b)</i> Key Stage 2 who are receiving drugs education, as set out in the guidance; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this guidance in teaching young children to resist pressure to take drugs;</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.0/1">The Department's current guidance, &quot;Drugs: Guidance for Schools (DfES 2004)&quot;, replaced a number of publications for schools on drug issues, including the Department's guidance &quot;Circular 4/95: Drug Prevention and Schools&quot;, and the guidance &quot;Protecting Young People: Good practice in drug education in schools and the youth service, 1998&quot;. In doing so it updated and brought together in one document information for schools on drug education and related issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.0/2">The guidance states that all children should be receiving age-appropriate drug education in all years from Key Stage 1 onwards. Assessment of education provision in schools is undertaken by Ofsted and it tells us that many schools are already doing excellent work in relation to drugs and that the quality and provision of drug education continues to improve. We have not formally assessed the impact of the guidance on the behaviour of children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.0/3">Departments have been working since March on the new drug strategy consultation paper that will be published in July and will be the launch for a full and active consultation exercise involving all key stakeholders, service users and members of the public. We will start writing the new strategy when responses start to arrive. Education will be a key strand of the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.0/1">We have not extended physical restraint procedures in the under-18 secure estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/2">The recent inquest into the death in 2004 of Adam Rickwood highlighted a lack of clarity in the law relating to the use of physical restraint in secure training centres. Section 9 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 places certain duties on custody officers in contracted-out secure training centres, including a duty to ensure good order and discipline. It states that the powers arising by virtue of those duties include power to use reasonable force where necessary. However, the purposes for which approved methods of physical restraint may be used, as set out in rule 38 of the Secure Training Centre Rules 1998, did not include ensuring good order and discipline. In consequence, the coroner recommended urgent action to clarify the law. In response to his recommendation, we laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase> the Secure Training Centre (Amendment) Rules 2007. They come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">6 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/3">Before laying the new rules, we consulted with the Youth Justice Board and the directors of secure training centres. The board and the directors were of the view that the change to the rules should be made as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/4">I or my officials have received seven letters and four e-mail messages making representations or seeking information on this subject, including a letter from the chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/5">The change to the rules does not affect the two other types of establishment in the under-18 secure estate: young offender institutions and secure children's homes, to which other rules or regulations apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/6">The Youth Justice Board has not amended its code of practice, &quot;Managing Children and Young People's Behaviour in the Secure Estate&quot; (February 2006), and has no plans to do so. Section 10 of the code sets out the principles governing the use of physical restraint. The amendment to the rules does not affect those principles. Nor does it alter the particular techniques that may be used (though those techniques are not prescribed by the code). The particular techniques that may be applied vary between the three sectors of the estate. In secure training centres, methods approved by the Secretary of State may only be applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/7">Use of physical restraint in the under-18 estate is monitored by the Youth Justice Board, in accordance with section 10 of the code of practice. Following the introduction of the code last year, all under-18 establishments were required to conduct an assessment of compliance. The assessments were audited by the Youth Justice Board. Establishments that were not able to demonstrate full compliance were required to draw up an action plan to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.990W.0/8">All under-18 establishments must provide the board with monthly statistics on use of restraint. A new, improved system of data collection was introduced in April this year. The board is planning a further assessment of performance in relation to use of restraint later this year.</p>

The joint DFES, Home Office and DWP reducing re-offending through skills and employment action plan sets the direction for this work. There are a number of programmes specifically designed to meet the needs of women. At Holloway prison, a job club has recently been set up by the European funded Exodus project to help women with CV writing, searching for employment and interview skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.6/1">The UN has recently published a report 'Behind Walls: An Inventory and Assessment of Prisons in Sierra Leone' which documents the state of prisoners' living conditions in Sierra Leone. The work of the Department for International Development-funded justice sector development programme (JSDP) in Sierra Leone informed the preparation of the report and provided some of the information it contains.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.6/2">The JSDP is a &pound;25 million, five-year programme, which started in 2005 and includes extensive work on prisoners' rights and living conditions. Some of the JSDP work already carried out has included: the development of a Best Practice-Case Management handbook that identified problems across the criminal justice system and provided training to tackle the problems identified, which led to a reduction in the remand rate from 70 per cent. to 52 per cent. in prisons in the last year; the rehabilitation of Moyamba Prison and improvements at Kenema Prison which have improved living conditions and reduced overcrowding; the construction of water wells at Pujehun and Bo Prison; and the renovation and furnishing of a school and home for children who otherwise would have been kept in adult prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.6/3">In addition, the JSDP is helping the Prison Service to develop a strategic plan which takes into account the need to improve prisoners' rights and living conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009W.3/6">Although not currently funding any research specifically related to the biological effects of CFS/ME, the MRC remains committed to funding scientific research into all aspects of CFS/ME including evaluations of other treatments and studies into the biological basis of the condition. The MRC always welcome high-quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018W.3/2">The Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 1 was launched in April 2006 with a &pound;30 million budget. In Budget 2007, a further &pound;6 million was made available for the household stream. In May 2007, the household stream was re-launched following restructuring. In removing the monthly cap and making other changes, we cannot predict future demand with certainty. We will continue to monitor and report on grant commitments and payments. To ensure projects have sufficient time to complete we expect to allocate the majority of funding for Stream 2 projects in the first 18 months of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.0/2">The UK has a competitive and diverse mortgage market, which includes flexible mortgage products. The flexible mortgage market has grown since the late 1990s. Recent research (2004) suggests that 21 per cent. of borrowers have mortgages with flexible features. Whether or not a lender decides to offer a specific product is a matter of commercial judgment for the firm in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.3/1">In April 2003, the Government introduced the right to request flexible working for parents of children under the age of six, or 18 for disabled children. The law has been a success, and has been particularly helpful for mothers. For example, 47 per cent. of new mothers now work flexi-time compared to just 17 per cent. in 2002. In addition, the proportion of new mothers who have changed their employer when returning to work has halved from 41 per cent. in 2002 to 20 per cent. (Maternity and Paternity Rights Survey of Employees 2005).</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.3/2">The Government aim to implement the right to request flexible working for parents in a manner which fits with the needs of a high employment flexible labour market economy. The Government are working closely with employers, who are leading the way in addressing the causes of the gender gap with projects which include supporting mothers returning to work and creating better quality opportunities for staff working part-time. 115 organisations, from both the public and private sectors, have signed up as exemplar employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.3/3">More generally, the Government encourage all types of flexible working across the work force by providing detailed guidance and promoting the benefits and encouraging the sharing of best practice. Business Link also provides practical support and advice for employers on starting, maintaining and growing a business. Employers and employees can also access advice from the ACAS website and telephone helpline.</p>
