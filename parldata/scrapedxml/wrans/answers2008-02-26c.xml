	<p pid="c.1338W.6/1">There is currently no sensitive and reliable diagnostic test for bovine TB in live badgers in the field. Bovine TB is most reliably detected by post mortem examination or by the less sensitive method of taking clinical samples (for example, blood, urine, tracheal swabs and faeces) from anaesthetised live badgers. Tissue samples are then confirmed by culture <i> of Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i> M. bovis</i> ) in the laboratory. However, <i> M. bovis</i><i> </i>grows very slowly so culture results can take six weeks to several months to come through. Various blood tests can be used to measure the immune response to bovine TB, one of which takes about 30 minutes, and has about 80 per cent. sensitivity in detecting severely infected animals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1338W.6/2">The drawback of these tests for live badgers is the need to anaesthetise the badger in order to sample it, hence they are suitable for research purposes only.</p>

	<p pid="c.1340W.2/1">We have helped to support local sourcing with funding for a range of measures, which allow regional and local food producers to overcome barriers to the effective marketing of their products. Examples include &quot;meet the buyer&quot; events, encouragement for food hubs and shared distribution facilities, and key training seminars.</p>
	<p pid="c.1340W.2/2">Support from DEFRA has been boosted by the regional development agencies (RDAs), helping activities to do with the promotion of quality regional and local food culture. The level and type of RDA funding reflects each region's priorities as set out in regional economic strategies. RDAs also deliver aspects of DEFRA's rural development programme for England (RDPE). Support is available under the RDPE to improve the competitiveness of a wide range of rural businesses, which can include local and regional food producers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1340W.2/3">We have also commissioned research aimed at enabling policy makers, support organisations and the supply chain to better understand the regional and local food sector. One of these projects will investigate the practicalities and benefits of local food production. Other work will examine consumer attitudes and actual purchasing behaviour. The results will be published on our website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1340W.2/4">Finally, DEFRA's ongoing public sector food procurement initiative (PSFPI) was launched in 2003 to help deliver the Government's sustainable farming and food strategy. This aims to increase opportunities for small and local producers to tender for contracts to supply food to the public sector. Our funding for this initiative supports workshops for buyers and suppliers, regional pilot projects to develop the supply side, and a range of guidance materials aimed at both food producers and public sector buyers. More information on the PSFPI can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="c.1341W.0/1">The Gangmasters' Licensing Act 2004 creates two main offences: operating as a gangmaster without a licence and entering into arrangements with an unlicensed gangmaster. It also creates offences in connection with false documents, such as a licence or a document issued by the Gangmasters' Licensing Authority (GLA) in connection with a licence.

	<p pid="c.1341W.0/3">In addition, the GLA is investigating 105 cases where offences under the 2004 Act may have been committed. The GLA has said that from the 2008-09 financial year it will be placing increasing emphasis on enforcing the 2004 Act now that it has completed the task of designing and implementing the licensing scheme for gangmasters.</p>

	<p pid="c.1345W.5/1">National and local government and police forces work closely to achieve a high reporting standard for road accident data. Very few, if any, fatal accidents do not become known to the police. However, research conducted on behalf of the Department has shown that an appreciable proportion of non-fatal injury accidents are not reported to the police. There is no legal duty in Great Britain to report personal injury road accidents to the police, provided the participants exchange details at the scene.</p>
	<p pid="c.1345W.5/2">Research has also shown that pedal cycle casualties are underrepresented in the road accident data (STATS19). In particular, accidents in which the pedal cyclist is the only participant are not likely to be reported to the Police. Recent research using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) shows that many accidents not recorded in the police data are the result of a person (often a child) falling from a bicycle with no other vehicle involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1345W.5/3">This research was published by the Department in an article in Road Casualties Great Britain: 2006 annual report (pages 60-72). A copy of the report has been deposited in the Libraries of the House or can be found at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="c.1345W.8/1">Rule 66 of the Highway Code recommends the fitting and use of cycle bells. The 2003 Pedal Bicycles (Safety) Regulations introduced various requirements relating to the supply and sale of cycles, including the obligation for a bell to be fitted at point of sale. While the regulations do not compel cyclists to keep a bell fitted to the bicycle after the machine has been purchased, it seems likely that many will retain it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1345W.8/2">In view of the results of a previous public consultation exercise (2001-02), we consider that there is insufficient justification to make retrospective fitting of a bell obligatory on cycles already in use. Neither do we believe there is a strong enough case to require compulsory use of bells, as this would be impractical and difficult to enforce.</p>

	<p pid="c.1348W.0/1">If, as we understand, such devices are likely to be used mainly as an alternative to walking or cycling then their potential in terms of congestion relief and of carbon emission reduction is likely to be minimal. No detailed assessment of legislative requirements has been made but primary legislation would need to be amended to permit their use on public footpaths or on the pedestrian footway alongside the public highway. There is provision in section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 that would allow the Secretary of State to permit by way of an order their use on the vehicular part of the public highway. The Secretary of State has no plans to make such an order. The Secretary of State has had no discussions with her EU counterparts on this subject.</p>

Key environmental parameters for petrol and diesel are regulated in the EU fuel quality directive (98/70/EC as amended) and transposed in the UK by the Motor Fuels (Composition and Content) Regulations 1999.

	<p pid="c.1358W.14/1">A total of 27 Desert Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles operated by UK forces in Afghanistan have been lost in the past 12 months. This number reflects the high operational tasking of this system. We continue to refine our operational procedures to minimise the loss rate, but it is inevitable that some losses will occur.</p>

	<p pid="c.1365W.11/1">Full access to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office intranet (FCONet) is only possible using the FCO's secure IT infrastructure. This is regularly monitored, but it would be inappropriate to disclose these arrangements in detail. Staff working outside FCO buildings may also access a limited form of FCONet through the internet. Staff may use any external computer to do this and the FCO therefore does not monitor the location of these terminals. Control of this limited access is by user authentication (password) and, where necessary, checking transaction records.</p>

	<p pid="c.1366W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not had recent discussions with his counterparts in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova on these issues. However, we remain concerned about all forms of human trafficking globally and are committed to tackling it wherever possible. The issue is raised regularly at EU Councils and is discussed at both ministerial and official level between EU partners. In addition, UK law enforcement agencies work closely with foreign counterparts in many source and transit countries, helping them to build enforcement capacity and to facilitate information exchanges. At the recent UN-Office on Drugs and Crime's Global Initiative on Fighting Trafficking forum held in Vienna, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Coaker) represented the Government, along with participants from the UK Human Trafficking Centre and HM Revenue and Customs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1372W.0/1">We remain concerned about all forms of human trafficking globally and are committed to tackling it wherever possible. The issue is raised regularly at EU Councils and is discussed at both ministerial and official level between EU partners. The Government's ratification of Albania's EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which will help reduce human trafficking and smuggling in the Balkans region, is a good example of our commitment to working with other governments. In addition, UK law enforcement agencies work closely with foreign counterparts in many source and transit countries, helping them to build enforcement capacity and to facilitate information exchanges; an initiative is currently taking place in a number of EU countries, led by the UK and Poland, under the auspices of the G6. The Government also part-funded the secondment of two Romanian police officers into a Metropolitan Police joint unit to exchange experience, skills and knowledge in the fight against the criminal exploitation and trafficking of Romanian children to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1372W.0/2">The Government raise human trafficking issues more widely at bilateral and international meetings beyond the EU. At the recent UN-Office on Drugs and Crime's Global Initiative on Fighting Trafficking forum held in Vienna, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Coaker) represented the Government, along with participants from the UK Human Trafficking Centre and HM Revenue and Customs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1372W.3/1">The Government remain deeply concerned by the increasing use of capital punishment in Iran. We regularly make representations to the Government of Iran, in our bilateral contacts and through the EU, to express general concern about the use of the death penalty in Iran and to raise individual execution cases. In 2007, the EU presidency did this on more than 20 occasions in both meetings and public statements. The EU has issued two further declarations on the death penalty in Iran already this year. We also discuss human rights issues bilaterally with Iranian officials in London and Tehran. In the last 12 months we have raised serious concerns about the use of death penalty on seven separate occasions. This has included specific instances when capital punishment has been carried out in Iran, for example the executions of Mohammad Moussavi, Jafar Kiani, Makwan Moloudzadeh and Mohammad Reza Tork.</p>

We understand that approximately 300 executions were carried out in 2007, compared with 177 in 2006 and 94 in 2005. This has included growing numbers of public and collective executions (eg the execution of two men in central Tehran in August 2007), and the first confirmed execution by stoning for five years in July 2007. Iran continues to execute juvenile offenders&mdash;at least four were put to death in 2007. We have concerns that not all death sentences are the result of a fair trial and that capital punishment continues to be applied for charges such as adultery, rape and drug related offences.

In compiling civil contingency plans, the FCO's objective is to protect British nationals in a situation that poses a serious threat to their safety and, in a worst case scenario, to assist their departure to a place of safety. As part of this process, FCO missions continually assess the risk to British nationals and plan accordingly. Our high commission in Nairobi's civil contingency plan was reviewed and updated in February 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1376W.2/2">The government of South Africa is acutely aware of the impact of power cuts and our high commission in Pretoria is following the situation. In his <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase> budget, Finance Minister Manuel allocated a further &pound;60 billion Rand for energy infrastructure investment. The South African government has also committed itself to launch a large-scale energy saving campaign in the near future. At the Southern Africa Development Community Energy Ministers meeting last week, South Africa agreed to honour her contractual obligations with regard to the power supply to the rest of the region.</p>

The competition was advertised in OJEU and a number of organisations expressed interest in the contract, eight were shortlisted and four bids were received. This service went live in April 2007.

This framework was advertised through OJEU and went live in April 2004. Each requirement identified within the Department is competed within the appropriate lot of the framework or through other appropriate commercial arrangements e.g. PAN Government frameworks, CIPHER Communications Framework. Expenditure with Capita on consultancy and interim personnel from April 2004 to December 2007 is &pound;5.63 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1381W.3/19">In 2005, Capita Business Services Ltd. was one of 32 suppliers awarded a Framework Agreement under the Department's UNderpinning IT DeliverY (UNITY) project. The UNITY Project was designed to put in place commercial arrangements for the procurement of IS/IT services for DWP which complemented existing contracts. As a result of a formal competition, the UNITY suppliers were selected to compete for business within specific areas or lots. Capita Business Services Ltd. is eligible to compete for business in lot one (application development) and lot two (infrastructure development), if invited to do so by DWP. The procurement was conducted under public procurement regulations with a Contract Award Notice published in the OJEU on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1381W.3/20">Capita Business Services Ltd. is one of 23 suppliers that met those criteria in lot one and one of 12 suppliers successful in lot two. The Framework Agreement itself has no value attached to it, nor is there any guarantee that suppliers will be invited to compete for, or be awarded, any specific business for the four year duration of the Framework, which expires in 2009.

Expenditure from April 2004 to March 2007 was &pound;85.38 million. Capita had a contract also for the delivery of winter fuel payments which ended in May 2005, following a re-competition. Expenditure from April 2004 to the end of the contract was &pound;4.84 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1381W.3/23">DWP can access Cabinet Office contracts for the delivery of PCSPS payments (Capita) and their framework for senior level recruitment where Veredus (a Capita subsidiary) is a supplier. In addition, there has been ad-hoc expenditure with Capita for example for the provision of miscellaneous training, IS/IT, property services and access to work payments, to aid in the employment of disabled workers. Expenditure from April 2004 to December 2007 in these areas is &pound;2.99 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1381W.3/24">All DWP contracts are awarded on a balance of quality and cost, to provide optimum value for money for the Department. All contracts are underpinned by key performance indicators and where appropriate, service credit regimes should performance not reach the required standard. DWP also has standard clauses in respect of formal breach of contract action.</p>

	<p pid="c.1382W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how much was paid in bonus payments to staff at the Child Support Agency in each year since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.2/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency is part of the Department for Work and Pensions and operates Departmental schemes. Over the period from 2001 to 2007, three separate schemes for payment of bonuses have operated within the Child Support Agency. Each of the three schemes have different criteria on how a bonus can be earned and the percentage of the pay budget that can be applied to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.2/6" class="indent">The figures provided in the attached table highlight the amounts paid as special, Makinson and individual performance bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.2/7" class="indent">Both the special bonus scheme and the individual performance bonuses were in operation for the entire period within all parts of the Department. The guidelines, policy funding and framework for these schemes are set by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.1382W.2/8" class="indent">The Makinson bonus scheme was undertaken as part of a Treasury initiative to enhance performance in the public sector by linking performance to reward. This scheme only ran for 2002-03 and 2003-04 and was trialled in three parts of the Department, one of which was the Child Support Agency. Incentive payments made under this scheme were funded directly by the Treasury.</p>

It is not possible to predict accurately how much will be raised for good causes by that date and neither the Department nor the National Lottery Commission set targets for the net proceeds of the national lottery. However, we do share a statutory duty that requires us to do our best to ensure that they are maximised, subject to lottery games being operated with due propriety and the interests of participants being protected.

	<p pid="c.1397W.3/2">Assessment of the 101 service in the initial live areas found that the service has successfully improved public access to and satisfaction in community safety services. Through greater partnership working and better information from the public about what problems are happening where, the 101 service has helped local police and councils to target their resources more effectively and efficiently and improve the delivery of those services to the public. We welcome Sir Ronnie Flanagan's endorsement of these benefits in the final report of his review of policing, particularly in support of better neighbourhood management.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.3/3">While it was decided not to continue centrally to fund local areas, a difficult but necessary decision in the context of important competing pressures and priorities, we remain keen to see the benefits and good practice from 101 taken up as widely as possible. It is for this reason that we will be continuing to provide funding for the national 101 infrastructure, as well as providing a tool kit to help local areas to improve local services and develop locally funded 101 services where possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.1399W.2/2">However, the British Crime Survey (BCS) asks about the impact of crime and fear of crime on quality of life. The latest analysis, from the 2006-07 BCS, shows victims of crime were more likely to report that crime and fear of crime had a high or moderate impact on their quality of life than those who had not been victims. This analysis can be found in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin Crime in England and Wales 2006-07, a copy of which can be found in the House of Commons Library.</p>

Most of these challenges fall at the first hurdle and permission to bring proceedings is refused by the court; and many challenges are withdrawn by the applicants before there is a judicial determination. The exact figures for the total number of cases brought, and the outcomes in every case, are not held centrally. The information requested could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1407W.6/1">We have received almost 60 expressions of interest and are now carrying out an initial sift across Government and their agencies. This will give a preliminary indication of the sustainability and infrastructure aspects of these schemes in relation to the criteria set out in the Eco-towns Prospectus, including their approach to transport and the environment. We are also contacting local authorities and regional bodies, in areas where schemes look to have good potential and we will then publish a shortlist for consultation. We expect to publish this shortlist in the near future for extensive consultation with the public, wider stakeholders and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1412W.5/2">Overall, since 2003 there has been a reduction in long term vacancy rates in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West, and they are broadly on trajectory. For a number of years up to 2003 vacancy rates in the North West were increasing. However, since 2004 the vacancy rate trend in the North West shows a marked improvement. We expect long term vacancy rates in housing market renewal pathfinder areas both in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West to fall as they move into the next phase of their interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1412W.5/3">The Department's annual report for 2007 includes a trajectory which illustrates the intermediate stages towards achieving the targets by 2016.</p>

	<p pid="c.1412W.8/4">During the first consultation phase, the consultants arranged three workshop sessions. An open invitation to participate was extended for the first of these events. It was attended by over 90 delegates of whom more than 50 per cent. were from the private sector. Two further closed sessions involved delegates selected and invited by the consultants because of their personal knowledge and expertise: 16 of the 44 invitees to these sessions were employed in the private sector. The consultants also extended an open invitation for further contributions via the GI Panel website and invited written submissions and the opportunity for personal interview by one of the consultants. The consultants received a number of written statements including contributions from three private sector trade associations and 13 individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1412W.8/5">In addition, the GI Panel itself includes representatives from the Association of British Insurers, the Demographic User Group, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and the Association for Geographic Information, together representing the views of the wider UK geographic information, including over 50,000 companies and individual professionals from the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.1425W.6/2">Regional Ministers are not allocated separate budgets and their support costs are funded by their own Departments and the Government Office Network from within existing budgets. To provide a breakdown of the financial costs to support each regional Minister would incur disproportionate costs. In addition to the staff in their departmental Private Offices and Government Offices, each regional Minister, with the exception of the Minister for the North East of England, also has 40 hours per month from a dedicated GNN press officer.</p>

Overall in 2006, global child deaths reached a record low of 9.7 million, down from 13 million in 1990. The report showed that solid progress has been made in a number of countries such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda and Tanzania.</p>
	<p pid="c.1431W.0/2">The report also highlighted that a concentrated push is required to accelerate progress in West Africa and parts of Asia to cut child deaths. MDG 4 is inextricably linked to MDG 5 (to improve maternal health) as 40 per cent. of children under the age of five are dying within a few days of birth. This is why the Prime Minister has called for 2008 to be a year of action towards meeting the MDGs especially those concerned with child mortality (MDG 4) and maternal health (MDG 5), which remain the most off-track.</p>

The first such review should take place starting in December 2008, in the light of entry data for the 2008/09 academic year. That would be an opportunity to have another look at pharmacy and other subjects in the light of the data that will then be available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1432W.6/1">The Student Loans Company has established payment arrangements for borrowers from other European Union countries who dropped out of their studies and became due to make repayment in April 2007, or who have graduated and become eligible to repay from April 2008. These existing arrangements will continue to apply when the first full cohort of borrowers from EU countries enters into repayment in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.6/2">The SLC has written to all EU borrowers due to start repayment and asked them to confirm the address where they expect to reside after graduation. If they are staying in the UK, they will be expected to obtain a national insurance number and make repayments through the UK tax system. If they are going abroad they will be asked to supply an address and complete an overseas assessment form to allow repayments to be scheduled. These borrowers have been made aware of the variety of methods of repayment available to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.6/3">So that all who can pay contribute to the costs of their education we have put in place variable threshold bands which are dependent on where the borrower lives. Effective collection across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts, which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.6/4">In support of the EU repayment process the SLC is developing an enforcement strategy for borrowers who move abroad but who do not provide income details. This work is focussing on the collection of penalties, arrears and the movement of borrowers into litigation where this is appropriate. The SLC is piloting work in these areas and expects to have final arrangements in place by April 2009.</p>

In full-time equivalent terms, we expect a growth in core-fundable students of 20,000 in 2008-09 (on a full-time equivalent basis) either entering higher education for the first time or progressing to higher degrees of which some 5,000 are attributable to our decision to redistribute funding which would otherwise have funded ELQ students.</p>

	<p pid="c.1438W.0/1">The Government's student finance package is designed to ensure that finance should not be a barrier to a higher education course. Student loans from the Government are not like commercial loans: interest is paid at the rate of inflation, so in real terms students only pay back what they borrowed. For income contingent loans available since 1998, repayment is linked to earnings and borrowers only repay if their earnings are over &pound;15,000; from April 2012 they will be able to take up to five years 'Repayment Holiday' and those taking out a student loan from 2006 have their debt cancelled after 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1438W.0/2">During the passage of the Enterprise Act in 2002 there was a growing awareness about student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt. There was a rise in the number of bankruptcies/Individual Voluntary Agreements (IVAs) notified in 2003. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. Provisions were therefore included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on bankruptcy. Currently student loans are not exempt from IVAs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1438W.0/3">The increase in student loan borrowers with bankruptcies and IVAs should be seen in the context of the increases in the general population. Figures from the Insolvency Service show that between 2002 and 2006 the number of individual bankruptcies in England and Wales more than doubled; the number of IVAs increased seven-fold.</p>
	<p pid="c.1438W.0/4">Until 2004 IVAs and bankruptcies were not recorded separately in SLC data. After the change in legislation, only IVAs are recorded, as student loans are excluded from bankruptcy debts and are not written off on discharge from bankruptcy.</p>

The Department's detailed guidance documents, &quot;Health Technical Memorandum 03-01: Specialised ventilation for healthcare premises (parts A and B)&quot; provide comprehensive advice and guidance to health care management, design engineers, estates managers and operations managers on the legal requirements, design implications, maintenance and operation of specialised ventilation in all types of health care premises. Copies of both documents have been placed in the Library.</p>

The mechanism to be used for monitoring progress and achievement is currently under consideration by a joint departmental and NHS expert group.</p>

Primary care trusts (PCTs) are funded to meet the healthcare needs of their populations, which will include the provision of cancer services. PCTs are expected to plan for and commission services, and monitor delivery of those services against local agreements. Commissioners of cancer services will be subject to the wider assurance system being developed under the 'world class commissioning' programme, and managed by strategic health authorities. The Healthcare Commission also provides an independent assessment of both providing and commissioning healthcare organisations to ensure that they are providing a high standard of care.</p>

	<p pid="c.1447W.3/1">The Cancer Reform Strategy said that to improve information for cancer patients, our immediate next step is for cancer networks to adopt and implement the tumour specific national information pathways which will be launched by the National Cancer Director on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-21">21 July 2008</phrase>. This will make nationally agreed information available to frontline cancer health professionals to offer to patients at key points in their cancer journey.</p>

The evaluation of the pilot programme, of which four sites are focusing on cancer, will take place during 2008. The evaluation will inform national implementation of information prescriptions for all people with long-term conditions, including cancer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1447W.3/3">To support the introduction of information prescriptions, the national cancer action team is working in partnership with cancer charities to develop a system to enable health professionals to generate tailored information prescriptions at any point in the cancer pathway. The system will draw on high quality national content, while making sure local details can be added. The project will be developed in 2008 for roll out in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.1447W.3/4">Providers will wish to consider how they can best audit information delivered to individual patients and whether this is meeting patients' needs. Commissioners should specify to providers through robust service specifications their requirements around patient information, which should be measurable and monitored through the quality monitoring of contracts at primary care trust level.</p>

The initial findings of the review were incorporated into the Cancer Reform Strategy, and are reflected in paragraphs 9.32-9.34. Work on a timetable for changes to payment by results for cancer services will be undertaken once the final recommendations of the review have been received and considered. We expect the recommendations to be received shortly.</p>

The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> Cancer treatments i.e. radiotherapy and chemotherapy could take place in other settings, for example a patient could be classed as a 'regular attender' or these treatments may occur in out-patients.<br/> <i> Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> Primary diagnosis codes used for cancer and neoplasms: C00-D48<br/> <i> Secondary Diagnoses</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care, Secondary diagnosis codes used for Radiotherapy session: Z51.0<br/> Secondary diagnosis codes used for Chemotherapy session: Z51.1<br/> <i> Changes to Coding Classifications&mdash;OPCS4</i><br/> Operative procedure codes were revised for 2006-07. 2006-07 data uses OPCS4.3 codes, whereas earlier data uses OPCS4.2 codes. All codes that were in OPCS4.2 remain in OPCS4.3, however the OPCS4.3 codes enable the recording of interventions and procedures which were not possible in OPCS4.2. In particular OPCS 4.3 codes additionally includes high cost drugs and diagnostic imaging, testing and rehabilitation. You may also find that some activity may have been coded under different codes in OPCS4.2. These changes need to be borne in mind when analysing time series and may explain any growth over time. More information about OPCS4 changes are available on the Connecting for Health website www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk.<br/> <i> Main Procedure/Intervention</i><br/> The main procedure/intervention is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode.<br/> <i> Secondary Procedure</i><br/> As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11 (three prior to 2002-03) secondary operation fields in HES that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1456W.0/1">Women invited to participate in the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme need to understand the potential benefits and harms in doing so and to be able to make an informed choice about whether or not they wish to take part in the Programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1456W.0/2">This is why all eligible women receive a national information leaflet on cervical screening, &quot;Cervical Screening&mdash;The Facts&quot;. This leaflet is included with each screening invitation and contains comprehensive and understandable information about cervical screening. It can be viewed at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1456W.0/4">The &quot;Cancer Reform Strategy&quot; noted concerns about the fall in the number of young women taking up their invitation to be screened. That is why the NHS Cancer Screening Programme have commissioned the Improvement Foundation to undertake work at a local level targeting this age group. The lessons learned from this work, due in 2009, will be shared with strategic health authorities and local screening programmes to develop best practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1456W.0/5">The NHS Cancer Screening Programme's press office is developing an information pack to be issued to all local screening programmes and also developing a public relations strategy, including articles in appropriate media publications, posters etc. In addition, Cancer Research UK have commissioned research on this issue, which we will monitor closely and will share the findings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1456W.0/6">Continued local action in this area is also essential and we will continue to monitor levels of cervical screening coverage through the Office for National Statistics/Information Centre for health and social care annual cervical screening statistical bulletin.</p>

	<p pid="c.1459W.3/1">Food labelling, including nutrition labelling, is the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency, which reports to Parliament through Health Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1459W.3/2">Food labelling rules are largely harmonised at European Union level and implemented in the United Kingdom by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 (as amended) (the FLR). The FLRs were made under the Food Safety Act 1990 and have been amended 32 times since inception.</p>
	<p pid="c.1459W.3/3">The agency actively and regularly engages with a wide range of stakeholders and a range of food labelling issues including the Government favoured traffic light system, as required in the development of UK policy. This includes the formal and informal consultation of over 1,100 individuals on the agency's interested parties list, consumer groups, manufacturers, retailers, enforcement and other Government Departments. The agency has carried out four formal consultations using this database over the last six months. Further consultations will take place on the European Commission's (EC) proposal during the next six months. We have also been working with the retail sector to carry out an independent evaluation of front of pack signpost labels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1459W.3/4">The agency has also recently consulted on and issued best practice guidance on country of origin labelling; clear labelling; use of marketing terms; allergen labelling and fish and meat labelling.</p>

The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health's publication, &quot;Saving Mothers' Lives: Reviewing maternal deaths to make motherhood safer&mdash;2003-2005&quot; published in December 2007 (copies of which have been placed in the Library) indicated that there were just under seven maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in the UK in the three years to 2005. The UK is very near to the top in any league table, with much lower death rates than the United States or France.</p>

	<p pid="c.1470W.3/7">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Darzi of Denham) has received three representations from the National Association of Patient Forums on engaging with the NHS Next Stage Review. Since July, Lord Darzi has visited and spoken to large numbers of stakeholders, including patient groups, and members of the public about the review. Thousands of people have already contributed their views at consultative events, via letter, email and other online channels. Representatives of patient groups also attended an International Clinical Summit in November 2007 to share ideas of leading edge care from the United Kingdom and around the world.</p>

	<p pid="c.1474W.5/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on &quot;Improving Outcomes in Urological Cancers&quot; in September 2002. It stated that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;ideally, all radical prostatectomies undertaken in each network should be carried out by a single team. Radical prostatectomy should not be carried out by teams which carry out fewer than 50 radical operations (prostatectomies and cystectomies) for prostate and bladder cancers per year&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/3">The guidance went on to recommend that</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;surgeons who currently carry out fewer than five radical prostatectomies per year should refer patients to designated surgeons who will become more specialised in this type of surgery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/5">This guidance was converted into a series of measures for inclusion in the &quot;Manual of Cancer Services 2004&quot; against which cancer networks are peer reviewed. The Manual includes measures to assess:</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/6" class="indent">the total number of radical prostatectomies and, separately, the total number of total cystectomies, performed by the multidisciplinary teams during the year prior to the team's review; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/7" class="indent">the total number of radical prostatectomies and, separately, the total number of total cystectomies, performed by individual surgical members of the team.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/8">If teams were not compliant with the criteria set out in the improving outcomes guidance during the peer review, the peer review team would have raised this as an immediate risk with the trust chief executive or their representative on the day of the visit following up this concern in writing. A trust would be expected to address this concern as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/9">Individual cancer network's performance against these measures in the 2004 to 2007 round of national cancer peer review would be set out in their local peer review reports. These reports are available on the Cancer Quality Improvement Network System website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1482W.2/4" class="indent">The data collected in the Census is owned by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Crown. ONS has a well-established reputation of maintaining Census confidentiality which it intends to uphold. Safeguarding data confidentiality and security has carried the highest priority in defining all the legal and contractual arrangements for the 2011 Census.</p>
	<p pid="c.1482W.2/5" class="indent">Confidentiality is an overriding concern, and ONS has a stringent security policy which includes specific measures to safeguard the confidentiality of personal data provided by respondents to Census Tests and to a Census. These measures cover the physical, IT, communications and internet security requirements, and comply with all relevant Government policies and standards. As for previous censuses independent security reviews will be carried out at key stages of the Census operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1482W.2/6" class="indent">All staff working with, or having access to, Census data, including any contracted service provider, will sign a confidentiality declaration to confirm their understanding and commitment to their legal confidentiality undertakings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1482W.2/7" class="indent">Currently, legal protection is afforded by the Census Act 1920 as amended by the Census (Confidentiality) Act 1991 which makes it a criminal offence for any person to disclose personal information from the Census without lawful authority. Census information is also generally protected in UK law by the provisions of the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.1482W.2/8" class="indent">From April 2008 when the power to conduct a Census and other statistical functions of my post as Registrar General for England and Wales are transferred to the newly formed Statistics Board, data confidentiality will be protected by the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 (SRSA) which will replace the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.1482W.2/9" class="indent">Any breach of the SRSA confidentiality provisions would be a criminal offence, subject to possible imprisonment and fines.</p>

	<p pid="c.1490W.9/1">The Government have prescribed that the annual canvass form that is sent to every household each autumn contains a provision allowing an elector to request a postal vote application form. The Government have expanded the information that is included on the poll card that is sent to electors at an election, and it now includes information about how to apply for a postal vote and the deadline for making a postal vote application at the forthcoming election.</p>
	<p pid="c.1490W.9/2">The Electoral Administration Act 2006 brought forward measures to increase the security of postal voting. While this increased the amount of data needed when electors completed their forms, this was balanced by the removal of the requirement for a witness signature. The available information suggests that the levels of disallowed postal votes remain low. We will wish to keep the matter under review and to explore the issues involved with the Electoral Commission and Association of Electoral Administrators.</p>

	<p pid="c.1492W.8/2">Offenders waiting for a place on a domestic violence programme are under the supervision of their offender manager from the day of sentence.

	<p pid="c.1501W.2/1">Public safety remains paramount and there is no relaxation of standards. The Prison Service Instruction issued in November 2007 identified additional measures to ensure suitable prisoners are allocated to open conditions. This includes: arrangements to ensure that categorisation reviews take place at six monthly intervals for all prisoners in the last 30 months of their sentence; reviews after successful completion of Release on Temporary licence; and that prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months in custody be considered as soon as possible after sentencing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1502W.2/1">Prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) may be considered for release by the independent Parole Board once they have completed the period of imprisonment considered necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence (the tariff period). This period is set in open court by the trial judge when passing sentence. The Parole Board may direct the release of such a prisoner only if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined. The Secretary of State may release such prisoners at any time only if exceptional circumstances exist which justify release on compassionate grounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.2/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>, 17 IPP prisoners have been released on licence. The IPP licence will remain in force for at least 10 years, at which point the licensee can apply to have it cancelled. Similar applications can be made annually thereafter. Of those 17 cases, 16 were released on the direction of the Parole Board. One prisoner was released by the Secretary of State prior to tariff expiry on compassionate grounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.2/3">Consideration of the files of the 16 prisoners released on the direction of the Parole Board indicates that 11 had completed courses specifically aimed at addressing identified risk factors. Such work could also continue as appropriate during the post release licence period.</p>

The numbers of self-harm incidents reported here are based on information supplied by prisons through the Prison Service Incident Reporting System. Many self-harm incidents often involve the same individuals, and changing numbers of incidents at different prisons can reflect the movement of such prisoners. Self-harm is a high volume incident that can be subject to technical and recording problems. While the system provides a sensible indication of the scale of self-harm the numbers of incidents should not be treated as absolute.</td> </tr>

The reduced level of random testing was expected to be compensated for by an increase in targeted testing.

	<p pid="c.1511W.2/1">Information about the number of women's safety workers in each probation area is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1511W.2/2">The cognitive behavioural programmes delivered by probation areas to tackle domestic violence are accredited by an independent panel of experts. The accreditation for the Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme and the Community Domestic Violence Programme requires that, in order for probation areas to deliver the programme as a component of a wider risk management system, they employ women safety workers either directly or under local partnership arrangements. A recent self-audit indicated that all probation areas were complying with this requirement.</p>

	<p pid="c.1528W.5/1">ContactPoint is a key element of the Every Child Matters programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. It will provide a quick way for practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.5/2">ContactPoint will be deployed to the 'Early Adopter' local authorities and two of our seven national partners in October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners by May 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.5/3">The information that must or may be included on ContactPoint is set out in the Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007 made under section 12 of the Children Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.5/4">ContactPoint will contain records for all children and young people in England who are under the age of 18. To help support the transition to adult services, there is provision for records of young people leaving care or with learning disabilities&mdash;to remain on ContactPoint up to the age of 25 but only with their consent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.5/5">Access to ContactPoint will be limited strictly to those who need it to do their job (currently estimated at around 330,000 practitioners). Before being granted access, users must complete mandatory face-to-face training, have obtained security clearance (including enhanced Criminal Records Bureau clearance) and have a user name, a password, a PIN and a security token to control their access to ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.5/6">When accessing a child's record, all users will have to state a clear reason why they are accessing ContactPoint. All use of the system will be monitored and audited and every access to a child's record will be detailed in the ContactPoint audit trail. This will be regularly monitored by local authorities, using on-line user activity reports, to ensure that any misuse is detected and that appropriate action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.5/7">One-off implementation costs will total &pound;224 million. Operating costs will be &pound;41 million per year, most of which will pay for the additional staff needed to ensure the on-going security, accuracy and audit of ContactPoint.</p>

	<p pid="c.1529W.2/2">We published impact assessments on the proposed changes to the child care registration and fee arrangements as part of the consultation exercises. On the registration requirements, our assessment did not show an effect on the supply of childminders as we are making only minor adjustments to the existing arrangements. The new system of regulation will provide Ofsted with the information it needs to determine whether essential standards of child welfare have been met and our proposals were supported by a majority of respondents in our consultation exercise last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1529W.2/3">On the proposed fee changes we expect the impact on numbers of childminders to be small. As we made clear in the impact assessment and the consultation document, we are not proposing to remove the current subsidy for registration and inspection costs and we would intend to phase in changes to the fee arrangements over three years, with the changes not complete until 2010. Local authorities are required to secure sufficient childcare available to meet the needs of working parents and have allied powers to assist providers. The fees consultation exercise closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February 2008</phrase> and we will carefully consider all the responses before publishing the Government's response in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="c.1529W.5/1">The third sector has played and continues to play a key role in the development and delivery of Every Child Matters. The sector is strongly represented on the Children's Plan Expert Groups which were set up in autumn 2007 to support the Department with developing the Children's Plan and to consider its implementation and the challenges to delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.1529W.5/2">Third sector organisations have been instrumental in the development of many individual policies, for example, Aiming High for Disabled Children (AHDC), the Government's transformation programme for disabled children's services. They continue to be key partners as we implement the AHDC programme and are represented on the Ministerial Implementation Group that oversees the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1529W.5/3">Other groundbreaking areas of the Department's business where the third sector engagement has been very influential include support for parents, particularly fathers, early years provision, services for children in care and the provision of positive activities for young people. The sector's capacity to deliver innovative services, to reach out to some of the most disadvantaged and disengaged and to provide a voice for children, young people and families is highly valued by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.1539W.12/1">The Government recognise that Family Group Conferences (FGCs) can be important and useful mechanisms to assist decision making and planning around an individual child or children. While the use of FGCs is for local authorities or other agencies to determine in individual cases, the Government have taken steps to encourage their use where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.12/2">The Government's statutory guidance &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; explains how FGCs can be used as part of systems to plan for children in need and to help in safeguarding children. It is clear that, where there are plans to use FGCs in situations where there are concerns about possible harm to a child, they should be developed and implemented under the auspices of the Local Safeguarding Children Board.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.12/3">FGCs are specifically commended in the revised Children Act 1989 Court Orders statutory guidance, published earlier this year, and included in the practice flowchart. In all applications for care proceedings, local authorities will be required to show what efforts have been made to enable the child to live with wider family and friends. An FGC would be an excellent means for a local authority to demonstrate how they have fulfilled this duty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1539W.12/4">An FGC is a complex service to provide and requires high levels of skill and competence. We have responded to concerns from stakeholders that there is a lack of skill and knowledge available in the field to deliver effective family group conference services. For this reason, we announced in &quot;Care Matters: Time for Change&quot; that we would fund a programme of regional training events to equip managers and practitioners with the necessary skills to develop and sustain the family group conference model.</p>

	<p pid="c.1541W.2/1">Schools have a statutory duty to promote pupils' well-being. An important contribution to this is developing pupils' social and emotional skills. To help schools do this, the Department is rolling out the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme, a comprehensive whole-school approach which includes a focus on school climate, learning opportunities for whole classes, learning and teaching approaches and continuing professional development for the whole staff of a school. Since the primary SEAL programme was launched in June 2005, over 60 per cent. of primary schools have started to implement SEAL, and we expect the first 15 to 20 per cent. of secondary schools to implement SEAL by July 2008. By July 2011, all schools will have had the opportunity to be supported to implement SEAL.</p>

	<p pid="c.1548W.2/1">The Government do not collect statistics on or otherwise monitor how much capital is spent on playgrounds by local authorities. We do not separately identify individual capital grants that finance capital expenditure. Only the total used to finance expenditure in a year is collected.</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.2/2">In the Children's Plan, we recently announced &pound;190 million capital funding to be spent on open-access, free play environments. Every local authority in England will receive funding by 2010-11. In addition, local authorities already receive substantial funding to support maintenance of public space. BIG lottery has just invested &pound;124 million to 2010-11 to support play in local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1558W.2/1">The Department has taken a wide range of measures to tackle the causes of bullying and is providing around &pound;1.7 million for anti-bullying programmes this year. Through the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning programme, we are developing skills in pupils including empathy, a sense of social responsibility and assertiveness which directly contribute to a school climate in which bullying cannot thrive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.2/2">Prevention is also a key theme of the guidance entitled &quot;Safe to Learn: Embedding Anti-Bullying Work in Schools&quot; which we issued in September 2007. This includes specific advice on homophobic bullying and cyberbullying, and links to guidance on bullying around racism, religion and culture that we issued in 2006. We are currently preparing further advice on how to prevent and tackle the bullying of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.2/3">We have placed a legal duty on head teachers to determine measures to promote good behaviour, respect for others and to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils as part of their overall behaviour policy. The Education and Inspections Act 2006 also provides head teachers with the power, to such extent as is reasonable, to regulate the conduct of pupils when they are off-site or not under the control or charge of a member of staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.2/4">We have issued the Anti-Bullying Charter, which includes a detailed list of questions for the school community to consider when formulating its anti-bullying policy. We have worked with and funded a number of partners, including the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), who arrange the annual Anti-Bullying Week and provide a range of advice and support to local authorities; ParentLine Plus, who run a helpline for parents whose children are being bullied and provide other resources through their 'Be Someone to Tell' campaign; and ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) who currently run peer mentoring schemes for the Department. We also fund awards for anti-bullying work as part of the Princess Diana Memorial Awards scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.2/5">We have asked the National Strategies and Anti-Bullying Alliance to work with schools and local authorities to ensure the guidance is effectively implemented on the ground and we are monitoring this very closely. We have also asked the National Strategies to provide challenge and support to those schools which have been identified as weak or ineffective in their approach to dealing with bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1558W.2/6">My Department has gone out to tender on research into the effectiveness of anti-bullying strategies. This should help inform any further development of Government policy in this area as well as helping schools decide which anti-bullying strategies are most effective in a range of circumstances. Our partners in the Anti-Bullying Alliance, and the National Strategies work at a local level to advise schools on their anti-bullying policies and monitor the implementation of the various anti-bullying strategies.</p>

	<p pid="c.1562W.2/1">OPEN&mdash;the Online Procurement for Educational Needs system is the Department's e-procurement tool for schools that has been developed with and for schools to aid them in procuring their goods and services in one convenient location should they wish to use it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/2">Due to the complexity of the project, the development requirements of the system, and the number of schools that potentially may wish to avail of it, a decision was taken to fund OPEN for three years, up to 2011. This is within CSR07 financial period and is usual for programmes of this nature.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/3">The OPEN system is based on the existing pan-Government platform Zanzibar which is provided by ProcServe. However, it was felt that this system would not be directly applicable to schools in its current format, hence the need to employ a consultancy with the specialist skills needed to support the development of this schools-focused solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/4">The cost of the OPEN system to the Department's Purchasing Team has been incurred under a pan-Government contract with OGC.bs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/5">The cost of managing this contract, which has been running for 12 months, is &pound;141,510.</p>
	<p pid="c.1562W.2/6">The release of information relating to the amounts being paid to individual companies would prejudice commercial interests in this instance and could affect the Department's future negotiating position.</p>

	<p pid="c.1564W.2/1">The Government engaged widely with stakeholders and service users to understand how best to improve the capacity and training of social workers in the 'Options for Excellence Review' (2006). Building on these findings DCSF is investing over &pound;63 million between 2008 and 2011 in this area and announced in the 'Children's Plan' (2007) commitments to improve support and training for all social workers working with children and families. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1564W.2/2" class="indent">piloting a newly qualified social work status offering guaranteed induction and support; building a professional development framework setting out the standards expected of all social workers at each point of their career including those working in specialist areas, such as adoption and fostering;</p>
	<p pid="c.1564W.2/3" class="indent">investing in additional support to social work supervisors; and enhancing initial social work training so that it better equips social workers with the practical skills and knowledge to work with children and families across all areas, including adoption and fostering.</p>
	<p pid="c.1564W.2/4">More detail about these areas will be announced in the work force action plan due to be published early this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1564W.2/5">The General Social Care Council (GSCC) requires all qualified social workers to undertake at least 15 days of professional development in a three-year period as a condition of their registration. In October 2007 GSCC introduced a new post-qualifying award for social workers specialising in children and families services to better equip them with the specialist skills needed in this area. The award has a focus on social workers' competence in assessing, planning, using professional judgment and managing risks to meet the needs of children and young people including in the areas of foster care and adoption.</p>

This is an improvement on the current system, where private employers such as parents are unable to check whether a tutor they use to work with their child is on a barred list. Moreover, the ISA will continuously monitor new, relevant information on the individual from criminal convictions and referrals and will notify employers, including parents, if an individual ceases to be ISA registered.</p>

	<p pid="c.1566W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1566W.2/2">Improving progression towards further and higher education and encouraging young people to continue learning for longer is vital to improve the life chances of young people and meet our economic needs. The total number of 16 to 18-year-olds in education and training increased by 15,500 to 1,547,000 at end 2006, the highest number ever. The 14-19 reforms&mdash;outlined in the '14-19 Education and Skills Implementation Plan' (2005) and 'Raising Expectations: staying in education and training post-16' (March 2007) are designed to encourage more young people to continue learning for longer and to gain the qualifications they need to progress to further and higher education.</p>
	<p pid="c.1566W.2/3">Last month the Government published &quot;World Class Apprenticeships: Unlocking Talent, Building Skills for All&quot;. It set out a wide range of steps which will improve apprenticeships for the future and ensure that an apprenticeship place is available for all qualified young people by 2013. This will play a major part in raising the participation age in learning to age 18.</p>
	<p pid="c.1566W.2/4">We also aim to increase participation in higher education (HE) towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30, with growth of at least 1 percentage point every two years to 2010/11. In November 2006 the then Department for Education and Skills published &quot;Widening participation in higher education&quot;. It showed the policies being pursued in four areas&mdash;raising educational attainment, raising aspirations, improving applications and admissions, and measuring performance&mdash;which individually and collectively help to encourage and enable people from a wider range of backgrounds to go on to HE. Since the publication of &quot;Widening participation in higher education&quot; my Department has announced that the successful Aimhigher initiative will continue for another three years in its efforts to raise young people's attainment and aspirations and improve their progression. The Government have also launched nine regionally-based excellence hubs&mdash;university partnerships which are delivering a national programme of outreach opportunities for gifted and talented learners, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1566W.2/5">The Government are convinced that there is much to be gained by encouraging stronger partnerships between schools and universities and wants every secondary school to have a university partner. To that end, last year the Department for Children, Schools and Families and my Department jointly published &quot;Academies, Trusts and Higher Education: prospectus&quot; which sets out one way in which universities can work more closely with schools to create a better understanding of HE, encourage a wider range of applicants and ensure young people are properly equipped to make the most of HE.</p>

	<p pid="c.1567W.5/1">The Department's estimate of the number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) cannot be disaggregated to regional level. However, we can estimate the number of young people NEET using figures drawn from the client management systems maintained by Connexions services. The following table shows the number and proportion of young people aged under 18 NEET in each Government office region at the end of December 2007 based on Connexions data.</p>
	<p pid="c.1567W.5/2">The figures relate to 16 and 17-year-olds known to Connexions and are not directly comparable with statistics on 16 and 17-year-olds NEET published annually by the Department of Children, Schools and Families. This is because the Connexions NEET measure excludes those on gap years, or in custody and young people who attended independent schools or were at school outside England may also be excluded. In addition, the Department's statistics relate to the young person's academic age, rather than calendar age.</p>

	<p pid="c.1568W.2/1">The Youth Opportunity and Capital Funds (YOF and YCF) were established in April 2006 as complementary, universal, funds operating under a single management framework. The funds demonstrate how innovative and creative young people can be when they are truly empowered, delivering a wide range of high quality projects and activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1568W.2/2">Interim findings from the independent evaluation of the funds were published in July 2007: Research report number DCSF-RR004 is available on the DCSF's website. The research found that the funds were meeting their objective to give young people a voice through consultation and control over resources. Local authorities had involved young people in the design and development of the funds, with young people involved as decision-makers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1568W.2/3">Overall, around 570,000 young people have benefited directly from the funds. In addition, management information shows that over a third of the young people involved as decision makers or project leaders were from traditionally disadvantaged groups. The guidance for the funds is clear that particular care should be taken to encourage those groups who face barriers to participation. This includes young people from low income families, young disabled people, young care leavers, looked after young people, young offenders, young carers, young refugees, young lesbians and gay men, young black and minority ethnic people, travellers and those in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1568W.2/4">On the basis of this evidence it was agreed in comprehensive spending review 2007 that the funds should continue until at least 2011, at the current rates of funding with an additional &pound;25 million of new investment being made available in the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
