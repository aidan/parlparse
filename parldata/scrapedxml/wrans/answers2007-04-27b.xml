These measures were incorporated into the Department's Better Regulation Simplification Plan which was published in December 2006. Recommendations such as the discretion to correct minor errors on application forms and clarifying the flexibility on the scale to be used in plans are being addressed in the revision of statutory Guidance to licensing authorities. We expect to publish revised Guidance in the early summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1345W.6/1">At the Human Rights Council's (HRC) second regular session in September 2006, the UK&mdash;both nationally and through the EU&mdash;actively participated in interactive dialogues with more than 40 UN Special Rapporteurs on the basis of their annual reports. During this process we drew particular attention to the human rights situations in a number of countries, including Cuba.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.6/2">It is anticipated that the 2007 annual report issued by the Special Rapporteur on Cuba will be discussed at the June session of the HRC. The EU again plans to participate in this dialogue, with the objective of highlighting the serious concerns it has over the human rights situation in Cuba. In addition, as a member of HRC, Cuba will be among the first countries to undergo Universal Periodic Review, a mechanism for evaluating each country's human rights standards. The UK supports this system.</p>

The following GOF programmes have projects in Latin America: Climate Change and Energy, Drugs and Crime, Economic Governance, Human Rights and Sustainable Development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1346W.2/2">GOF-funded projects have achieved some notable recent successes in Latin America. Our Embassy in Mexico City, along with the British Council, received an award in October 2006 from then President Fox for their GOF-funded governance work. In Colombia, GOF projects have focussed on strengthening the prosecution service and implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. One project, part-funded by GOF and aimed at improving the case handling of and protection for child victims of sexual exploitation, received a UN21 Commendation for outstanding field projects. Out of 4,500 project nominations, only 20 received an award.</p>

	<p pid="b.1350W.3/2">Funding for the national health service bowel cancer screening programme from the strategic health authority (SHA) bundle was allocated to Yorkshire and the Humber SHA to manage on behalf of all 10 SHAs in England. NHS Cancer Screening Programmes currently manage the budget on behalf of Yorkshire and the Humber SHA through a service level agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.3/3">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes make payments directly to NHS trusts who host the bowel cancer screening hubs and local screening centres. The payments are made on a population served basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.3/4">It is for SHAs working in partnership with their primary care trusts (PCTs) and local stakeholders to organise and provide services for their local populations. SHAs were asked to bid for their local endoscopy services to become local screening centres as part of the second wave of the bowel cancer screening programme for 2007-08. These bids have been assessed, and second wave sites are currently being finalised. We are anticipating a considerable expansion of the programme in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.3/5">The expectation is that funding for the programme will be in PCT baseline allocations once the programme is fully rolled out across England by December 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1351W.2/1">Under the dental reforms introduced in April 2006, primary care trusts (PCTs) are commissioning an increasing volume of national health service dental services, which is likely to result in further workforce increases. In 2005, the Government expanded the number of dental school places by 25 per cent. in order to support longer term increases in the dental workforce. The number of training places at the University of Leeds Dental School has been increased from 53 to 75, with an additional six places allocated to an outreach training scheme in Hull. The first cohort of new dental graduates will qualify in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.1353W.6/1">Afghanistan is DFID's sixth largest programme and we are Afghanistan's second largest bilateral donor. We are focusing on three things: building effective state institutions; improving economic management and aid effectiveness; and improving the livelihoods of rural people. We plan to spend &pound;107 million in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1353W.6/2">To help build effective state institutions, DFID provided &pound;1.6 million to the World Bank to help the government restructure key ministries in Kabul and the provinces. Pay reforms are helping to attract and retain qualified civil servants, doctors and teachers, and we have just finished supporting the government to come up with a comprehensive capacity building plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1353W.6/3">DFID's economic programme is working to strengthen the government's capacity to manage and grow the legal economy. We are providing &pound;165 million from 2006-09 through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund to fund recurrent costs such as doctors' and teachers' salaries. We are also raising the quality of public spending and level of domestic revenues through technical assistance worth &pound;15 million in the Ministry of Finance, and increasing opportunities for enterprise in Afghanistan with a &pound;9 million portfolio on private sector development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1353W.6/4">DFID's Livelihoods programme is playing a major role in supporting the government of Afghanistan to create an environment that will foster opportunities for legal livelihoods, including support to the National Solidarity Programme (&pound;28 million over six years to fund community-based projects); the Microfinance Investment and Support Facility Afghanistan (&pound;15 million over three years); and the Horticulture and Livelihoods Programme (&pound;7 million over three years). We are also supporting the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development and the Ministry of Agriculture in policy formulation and programming (&pound;4.5 million); funding research into alternative crops (e.g. mint and saffron) and other livelihoods (&pound;3 million); and assisting the government in preparing national land policy and reform (&pound;335,000).</p>
	<p pid="b.1353W.6/5">DFID has also committed up to &pound;20 million of our 2007-08 budget to support the UK effort in Helmand. Last year we contributed &pound;4 million (part of an overall commitment by Her Majesty's Government of &pound;6.2 million) to support quick impact projects such as school construction and repairs. Our commitment also includes &pound;30 million over three years (2006-09) for the government of Afghanistan's Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development Programme, which will benefit around 590,000 people and create 15,000 new jobs through speeding up the draw down of national programmes to Helmand.</p>

	<p pid="b.1355W.2/1">The UK made AIDS a centrepiece of the 2005 G8 and EU presidencies. We pressed for and secured international commitments to universal access to HIV treatment. We subsequently worked hard to ensure that this commitment was endorsed and expanded by the international community in the Political Declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS (<phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June 2006</phrase>). This declaration committed to achieve comprehensive HIV prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010. It also agreed that countries would develop ambitious targets, including interim targets for 2008, to measure progress towards universal access. Crucially, it also set out a process by which countries will develop national AIDS plans to scale up towards universal access by 2010; and made the commitment that no credible, costed, national AIDS plan should go unfunded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/2">By early 2007, 90 countries had developed targets for achieving universal access, and at least 23 countries had proceeded with costing their strategic plans. The UK is pressing UNAIDS to define what constitutes a credible national AIDS plan. We are also pressing for a multi-stakeholder process in country to review universal access plans as they are developed, to agree their credibility and ensure they are fully funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/3">We will push hard to ensure an ongoing focus by the G8 on achieving its commitment to universal access. We see our work with UNAIDS as central to unlocking the G8 and international community's commitment to funding credible, costed national AIDS plans. And we will ensure that this work is discussed as we prepare for the G8 Heiligendamm summit in June.</p>

	<p pid="b.1356W.10/1">The Unauthorised Waste Activities (UWA) group was established to co-ordinate regional enforcement action against unauthorised waste activities. In addition to its co-ordinated enforcement actions, the group has also held seminars in conjunction with the Garda Siochana. The group first met in September 2004 and met six times in the first year The group was then reformed into a smaller regional co-ordinator working group which has gone on to meet seven times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356W.10/2">The focus of the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste (TfS) Group has been on better and consistent enforcement by local authorities of the legislation covering cross-border movements of waste. This has involved action to check legitimate waste movements to Northern Ireland, development of guidance and training and liaison with European regulators. The TfS group first met in September 2004 and has met 13 times to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356W.10/3">The work is ongoing but has been acknowledged as bringing about better enforcement of environmental legislation on the island of Ireland. The research undertaken has enabled the scale of illegal waste activity on the island to be quantified and future plans to tackle it determined.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356W.10/4">Participation in the groups has led to improved communication and liaison between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland enforcement authorities involved in illegal waste enforcement cases. Increased co-ordination of enforcement activity on both sides of the border has led to a major reduction in the trafficking of illegal waste from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland. At the same time, there has been a reduction in the movement of illegal waste to Europe and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="b.1357W.6/1">A person's name may appear on the electoral register only if they reside at an address within the electoral area. Residence is not defined in law, but it is held to entail a considerable degree of permanence. It is for the Electoral Registration Officer to decide, in light of the relevant circumstances, whether a person may be said to be resident at a particular address. This includes second home owners, in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1357W.6/2">It is possible for a person to appear on more than one electoral register. It is for the Electoral Registration Officer to decide on the basis of the information provided to them. Due regard must be given to the purpose and other circumstances of the person's presence at or absence from an address. For example, where a person is staying at a non-permanent location for a particular time, they may be considered to be either (i) resident at that address because they have no home elsewhere or (ii) not resident there if they do have a home elsewhere. Absence due to the performance of any duty associated with office, service or employment, or absence due to attendance at an educational course, does not constitute an interruption to a person's residence. For example, a student who has a permanent home address and a term-time address, and spends about the same amount of time in each, can be registered lawfully at both addresses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.2/1">The provisions of the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988 (CMARs) dealing with misleading advertisements directed at consumers will be replaced from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April 2008</phrase> by regulations implementing the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD). The UCPD introduces a general prohibition on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices. For the sake of clarity the UCPD sets out how practices may be unfair by misleading consumers through action or omission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.2/2">As a consequence, the scope of the original Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive (MCAD), which the CMARs implement, has been narrowed to cover only business-to-business relationships.</p>

	<p pid="b.1362W.2/2">I understand that, BT has applied a price differential between customers who pay their accounts by direct debit and those who pay by other means for a number of years. This reflects the increased processing and debt management costs associated with payments not made by direct debit. Such differentials are common practice among communications providers and utility service providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1362W.2/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May 2007</phrase>, BT is changing how it presents this differential from a discount for those customers paying by direct debit, to a charge for those paying by other means for a number of years.

	<p pid="b.1362W.2/4">The Light User Scheme and In Contact Plus will not be affected by the increased charge. These are the special tariff schemes offered to vulnerable customers by BT as a result of the Universal Service Obligation placed on the company.</p>

	<p pid="b.1364W.0/1">There have been various studies of lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions for cars (although they have not compared different fuel technologies). These suggest that a clear majority&mdash;around 80 per cent.&mdash;of CO2 emissions arise during the operational phase of a vehicle's life rather than during construction and disposal. We therefore consider that focusing on in-use emissions remains an appropriate approach to reducing the CO2 footprint of vehicles. At the same time, manufacture and disposal are important, and we welcome measures by industry to address emissions created during these phases. With respect to fuel cell vehicles, life cycle CO2 emissions are likely to be largely dependent on the energy source used to manufacture the hydrogen for the fuel cell.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364W.0/2">The picture is different for pollutants that may affect local air quality, such as volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, and particulate matter. Industry figures suggest that over half of such emissions are created during manufacture and disposal of vehicles. For fuel cell vehicles, almost all the local air pollution emissions are created during manufacture and disposal.</p>

The Government provide information on basic bank accounts to benefit customers and pensioners to help them decide which account to have their benefit paid into.</p>

The campaign is working with trusted intermediaries in regular contact with financially excluded people such as housing associations and charities, to provide information on the availability of bank accounts and other mainstream financial products and services. The campaign is advised by a stakeholder forum, which includes charities representing the elderly and those with learning disabilities.</p>
