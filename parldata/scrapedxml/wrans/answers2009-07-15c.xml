The relatively small number of descents made in 2007 is due to an increased availability of military aircraft in that year.</p>

The MOD, therefore, has not paid this new tax liability in full. Urgent discussions are taking place between the MOD and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the amount of property tax owed. We are seeking an agreement that is fair and equitable, and assurance that the services received in return from the Ascension Island Government represent best value for money.

	<p pid="c.382W.6/2">UK passengers travel on a range of global airlines. Within Europe, we suggest that any mandatory system to be fitted to commercial passenger aircraft would have to be required and approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency, on the basis of evidence that it was necessary and fit for purpose i.e. capable of detecting any specific items of concern in the circumstances where these might occur. In the UK we are conducting research to ascertain what substances are in cabin air, and at what concentrations, both in normal circumstances and during occasional &quot;fume events&quot;. When we have obtained and assessed this information, it may be appropriate for the UK to recommend some kind of detection systems.</p>

	<p pid="c.387W.8/2">According to the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory, landfill activities accounted for 3.2 per cent. of UK total emissions in 2007. This is from methane and corresponds to 41.5 per cent. of UK total methane emissions in 2007. The UK agrees with the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the proportion of carbon dioxide in landfill gas is about 50 per cent. The UK does not separately estimate emissions of carbon dioxide from landfills because to do so would be to double count with carbon stock changes estimated in the land-use, land-use change and forestry sector. This is in accordance with the international guidelines for reporting greenhouse gases to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>

	<p pid="c.390W.0/1">DEFRA has policy responsibility for the five injurious weeds covered by the Weeds Act 1959 (Common Ragwort, Creeping or Field Thistle and Spear Thistle and Curled and Broad Leaved Dock) and also for invasive species, such as Japanese knotweed and water primrose.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.0/2">We have not issued any specific guidance to local authorities on controlling the weeds covered by the Weeds Act 1959. However, the Code of Practice on How to Prevent the Spread of Ragwort provides comprehensive guidance on how to develop a strategic and cost-effective approach to control of common ragwort. It is intended for use by all landowners and occupiers but is particularly relevant for large-scale organisations managing significant land areas, including local authorities and other public bodies. The code of practice and other information about the control of injurious weeds is available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.0/3">Advice on the management of invasive non-native weeds is available from a number of sources including the websites of the Environment Agency and the Great Britain Non-Native Species Secretariat. In addition, DEFRA published the Horticultural Code of Practice in 2005, which provides best practice advice concerning the acquisition, use and disposal of plants.</p>

	<p pid="c.392W.6/1">It is not possible to differentiate between fines given to retailers and those given to licensees of public houses. Additionally, data on the collection of fines for specific offences are not held, therefore the answer given in table 1 shows the sum of all fines imposed for offences relating to the sale of alcohol to under 18's. The actual amount collected, and the status of the defendant is not known.</p>

	<p pid="c.399W.5/2">Fees have been frozen at the 2006-07 level, meaning the cost of a disclosure has not increased since April 2006. This has been achieved as a direct result of year on year internal efficiency savings and year on year increases in demand.</p>

	<p pid="c.401W.5/2">A DNA sample may only be taken from a child under 10 with the consent of a parent or guardian. Such samples are taken from children aged under 10 for elimination purposes to assist in the investigation of an offence e.g. from children who are the victim of a crime or who had legitimate access to a crime scene. These samples are then destroyed and not put on the actual database. Information on the number of such samples taken and the average length of time for which they were retained is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.401W.5/3">The DNA profiles of all children aged under 10 taken by England and Wales police forces have been removed from the National DNA Database, and the database is monitored to ensure that this remains the case.</p>

The amnesty was just one facet of our knife crime strategy, which focuses on tough enforcement, education programmes and support for wider prevention work. We are continuing our support to local initiatives and projects through the Community Fund, which was established in December 2008 and will provide financial assistance to 144 groups over three years.</p>

	<p pid="c.411W.3/17">The CRB has now issued over 20 million disclosures since inception and operates to a set of published service standards (PSS) which are to issue 95 per cent. of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days. While the CRB has consistently exceeded their targets for standard disclosures, there have been problems in meeting the target set for enhanced disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.3/18">To address these problems associated with delays, the CRB has set up an improvement plan with their delivery partners, including the police forces. This is aimed at maintaining a balanced output of applications on the system while also reducing the number of aged cases. This work has started to show an improvement in turnaround times but the CRB will continue to monitor forces performance in line with its own performance.</p>

	<p pid="c.415W.2/1">Warm Front is the main Government scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England and is managed by eaga plc. Over 1.9 million households have received assistance with heating, insulation and other energy efficient measures since the scheme's inception in June 2000. Funding for the scheme has been increased to more than &#163;950 million in the current spending round. The scheme is managed for the Government by eaga plc.</p>
	<p pid="c.415W.2/2">The carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) is an obligation placed on energy supply companies that have more than 50,000 customers to achieve CO2 savings in the homes of domestic consumers-40 per cent. of which must be met by installing measures in the homes of a priority group of low-income consumers in receipt of qualifying benefits or are aged 70 and over.</p>
	<p pid="c.415W.2/3">Energy suppliers do not disclose the amount of money that they spend on promoting CERT measures, as they regard this as being commercial-in-confidence. However, we understand that under the previous two phases of the energy efficiency commitment (EEC), which ran from April 2002 to March 2008, suppliers invested &#163;1.325 billion promoting measures. The Government's estimate of likely spend for the current CERT is &#163;3.2 billion. With 60 per cent. of this investment expected to be directed at the Priority Group, the total investment over nine years would total &#163;2.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.415W.2/4">DECC has provided funding of &#163;3 million between 2008-09 to 2010-11 under the Low Carbon Buildings programme-together with revenue funding from partners-to deliver pilot microgeneration projects for deprived communities in the north-east, Yorkshire and Humberside, East of England and, possibly, Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.415W.2/5">The new Community Energy Saving programme (CESP) will see the main energy companies deliver energy efficiency measures worth around &#163;350 million to homes in low income areas around the country. The scheme will deliver both carbon savings and fuel bill savings to assisted households, and subject to parliamentary approval is expected to come into force in September this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.415W.2/6">The Government are currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of our fuel poverty policies. The review is examining whether existing measures to tackle fuel poverty could be made more effective and whether new policies should be introduced to help us make further progress towards our goals.</p>

	<p pid="c.419W.5/1">DECC has been working closely with the energy sector through the Energy Emergencies Executive Committee (E3C) for over two years in order to identify and mitigate energy supply risks specific to an influenza pandemic.</p>
	<p pid="c.419W.5/2">Within the power generation industry, work has focused on a number of risks to the continuity of generation including; a severe shortage of manpower, unavailability of primary fuels for generation and disruption of the supply chain for essential chemicals and other goods.</p>
	<p pid="c.419W.5/3">On the particular question of fuel supplies, these are mainly coal, gas and nuclear.</p>
	<p pid="c.419W.5/4">In the case of coal, fuel stocks currently stand at about three months supply, and this figure would usually rise as we approach the winter. These stock levels are thought to be sufficient to cope with any disruptions caused by a flu pandemic, where the peak impact might be intense but would be of a relatively short duration.</p>
	<p pid="c.419W.5/5">For gas fired power stations the supply route is robust, with gas being transported by pipeline via the main national gas transmission network. We are working with gas network owners via E3C to ensure appropriate business continuity plans are in place to minimise the likelihood of disruption to gas supplies.</p>
	<p pid="c.419W.5/6">The UK's nuclear power station need to replenish their nuclear reactor fuel on a regular basis, however the impact of a delay in the replenishment programmes would be a gradual reduction in output rather than complete loss. The risk of a disruption to supply arrangements is deemed to be very low, however British Energy and Magnox are working with the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to understand what flexibility exists within current regulations to help extend the life of fuel cells and thus reduce the frequency of the refuelling process if necessary.</p>

The programme is flexible and able to incorporate both robust technical site investigations and ongoing interactions between the project and potential host communities.

	<p pid="c.424W.15/1">The Department for Work and Pensions' statement of equality of opportunity is:</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/2" class="indent">&quot;The Department is committed to providing services which embrace diversity and which promote equality of opportunity. As an employer we are also committed to equality and valuing diversity within our workforce. Our goal is to ensure that these commitments, reinforced by our Values, are embedded in our day to day working practices with all our customers, colleagues and partners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/3">This means that our internal policies are designed to ensure equality of opportunity for our existing and prospective employees. For example, we carry out all our permanent recruitment exercises under fair and open competition and we monitor the procedures carefully to make sure that they do not unfairly discriminate against anyone. We are a Disability Symbol user and operate the Guaranteed Interview Scheme for disabled candidates. We are a Local Employment Partnership employer.</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/4">Our statement of equality of opportunity applies to our policies and to the services we offer. We carry out equality impact assessments on new policies and services and when we make changes to existing ones. This ensures that equality of opportunity is taken into account at the earliest stage of policy and service development and that:</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/5" class="indent">the Department's strategies, policies and services are free from discrimination;</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/6" class="indent">due regard is given to equality (specifically disability, gender and race) in decision making and subsequent processes; and</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/7" class="indent">opportunities for promoting equality are identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/8">In order to consider the impact of equality of opportunity on our policies and services and to ensure the Department's diversity and equality work is showing real results and comparing well to comparative work carried by external organisations, we have also participated in external benchmarking exercises. External benchmarking also gives us the opportunity to share best diversity practise with other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.424W.15/9">Our approach to equality is set out in a variety of publications, including:</p>

	<p pid="c.425W.2/2">It is important that individuals aiming to, or who are already working within the public sector have access to funding, such as Access to Work, in relation to their support needs. Individuals working, or about to work in the public sector have been eligible for Access to Work support since the inception of the programme in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="c.425W.2/3">We believe, however, it is right for public sector employers to set an example to other employers by recognising the value to them of taking responsibility for managing workplace disability adjustments. The Strategy Unit Report &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot; published in January 2005, stated that there are strong grounds for asking employers in the wider public sector to fund workplace disability adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="c.425W.2/4">As a result of this, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>, ministerial Government Departments have funded the workplace disability adjustments required by their disabled staff out of their running costs, instead of using the Access to Work programme. Ministerial Government Departments are required to provide the same level of support for their employees that would be expected under the Access to Work programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.425W.2/5">Jobcentre Plus continues to provide and fund assessments, and continues to provide information and advice to disabled staff and their managers. There are no plans to remove Access to Work funding from people working in other parts of the public sector, and individuals working in these public sector organisations can still apply for Access to Work funding.</p>

Jobcentre Plus is a national organisation and delivers its services from around 850 locations around Britain. Those include Jobcentres, Contact Centres and Benefit Delivery Centres. We also operate from a small number of head office and regional office sites in different parts of the country where co-location arrangements apply.</p>

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus are continuously reviewing existing service delivery arrangements in order to meet the challenge of the current economic climate and the planned welfare reform changes for the next two to three years. The latest reviews have taken account of the latest known information on the expected increases in business and customer volumes.</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/6" class="indent">The latest review has identified that around 50% of Jobcentre Plus offices currently face a capacity challenge. This challenge will be met through a range of solutions and we are unable to provide the data to fully respond to your questions (a, b, c and d) until all of these solutions have been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/7" class="indent">In the light of the unprecedented customer demand we have secured the required funding to convert or extend our existing buildings where necessary. In addition we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach facilities, often delivering advisory and other support on Partner's premises. We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally. This includes some offices opening to the public on Saturday. We will only acquire new space where all other measures are insufficient.</p>
	<p pid="c.428W.2/8" class="indent">To date estates work has been undertaken and completed on 18 of our buildings at a cost of &#163;1m, increasing our capacity to deliver additional customer service to the public. Estates work is planned for a further 151 buildings. This work is currently at an early stage and therefore the costs are not fully known.</p>

	<p pid="c.435W.3/1">The inclusion of credit card facilities extends the range of options available for payment. Payment routes available elsewhere were considered-there is precedent for the acceptance of credit and debit cards in other areas of public services. In addition, payment by credit card is already well established in many magistrates courts and all fixed penalty offices. Bailiffs operate under well-defined behaviour standards and there are no incentives to favour credit cards over the other current methods of repayment. There are a range of routes available to any debtor who genuinely cannot afford to pay. HM Courts Service is currently evaluating the scheme of taking payments by credit and debit cards. I am awaiting the results of the evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="c.447W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice is aware of the proposed merger of the Staffordshire and West Midlands probation areas. A joint application is anticipated in July for trust status, although this may be delayed to later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.447W.0/2">Any merger will require the continuation of very strong links with other criminal justice agencies, including the police, HM Courts Service and the Crown Prosecution Service. This will include continued active participation in the Staffordshire Local Criminal Justice Board public protection arrangements. The present chief probation officer for Staffordshire has met all the relevant agencies and explained the importance of local delivery and co-working in any trust arrangement. The proposed merger was discussed at the Staffordshire Criminal Justice Board meeting on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-28">28 April 2009</phrase> chaired by the then chief constable of Staffordshire Chris Sims. In a subsequent letter he said that members understood the merger and indicated strong support for the proposal based on local delivery units with devolved responsibilities. The Secretary of State will continue to require coterminus arrangements to be maintained with Staffordshire criminal justice agencies, should a merger of Staffordshire and West Midlands probation areas be approved.</p>
	<p pid="c.447W.0/3">The Secretary of State in approving any trust application needs to be assured that management is properly devolved to the level of local delivery units. In the case of Staffordshire these units will be aligned will Staffordshire county and Stoke on Trent. The Secretary of State would expect to see a trust appoint to such management units staff at assistant chief officer level who are both experienced and competent to oversee performance and partnership working. In addition there will be a single chief executive and chair of joint Staffordshire and West Midlands Board who will be responsible for ensuring performance across the trust and effective local partnership in all the local delivery units and to ensure the efficient and effective stewardship of public funds, working under a contract to the director of offender management for the West Midlands region.</p>
	<p pid="c.447W.0/4">The Secretary of State has made it clear in statements and answers to previous questions that any proposals on probation trust arrangements should come from local areas and not be provided either regionally or nationally. Individual probation boards, including Staffordshire, would have to consider the merits of merger based on business cases that would address both administrative and staffing costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.447W.0/5">As the Secretary of State has yet to receive an application for the trust status by the combined area it is not possible to make a detailed estimate of changes to both administrative and staffing costs. However, any such proposal would have to demonstrate that front line delivery of probation service duties and responsibilities to protect the public and reduce re-offending will be maintained whilst overheads, administration and management costs would be reviewed. No budgets have been allocated to Staffordshire or West Midlands probation areas for the period beyond March 2010.</p>

Since the peak year of 2003-04, court-ordered secure remands have fallen by 40 per cent. and remands in custody by 21 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.448W.5/2">In each particular case it is for the court to decide, in the light of all the circumstances, whether to grant bail, to remand the young person to the care of a local authority or, if the young person is aged 17, to remand him or her in custody. (Some boys aged 15 and 16 may also be remanded in custody.)</p>

The data also show the average maximum and minimum fine imposed on those sentenced for selling tobacco to a minor in each year. These data are presented on the principal offence basis. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence, the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed. Where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences, the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.</p>

	<p pid="c.452W.5/2">Cost of assistance to UK citizens abroad is covered by a levy of approx. &#163;15 on all passports sold in the UK by the Identity and Passport Service and overseas by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

The question &quot;How satisfied are you with your life overall these days?&quot;, with a response scale of 1-10, has been included in a number of studies over time, including the British Household Panel Survey, managed by the Institute for Economic and Social Research at Essex University.

	<p pid="c.462W.6/1">We are currently still in the first year of diploma teaching so it is too early to assess its impact on local accountability. Each diploma line of learning will be evaluated for the first three years after roll out and we will analyse the findings of the evaluation to ensure the implementation is having a positive impact on the education system.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.6/2">One of the main aims of diplomas is to widen educational participation among young people. Data on the types of learners taking up diploma places will be available for analysis later this year, and this will help us to identify and address any areas of inequality.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.6/3">With regards to academies and local accountability, all academies must have a local authority governor and a parent governor. Governing bodies are bound by law to act in the best interest of the academy, its pupils and the local community. They must set out their proposals for working with other schools and the wider community in their annual development plan. All academies are inspected by Ofsted on the same basis as other schools, and their results are published along with all maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.6/4">A major goal of the academies programme is to tackle educational inequality and there are a number of measures that guarantee this is achieved. To ensure a fair admissions process, academies, like maintained schools, are required to follow the School Admissions Code. The independent PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluation said that there was no evidence that academies have a negative impact on neighbouring schools in terms of pupil profile and therefore not created any inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.6/5">The School Census shows that the proportion of pupils with special education needs (with and without statements) in academies is 29.5 per cent.-compared to an average of 19.2 per cent. for all schools. The proportion of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals in academies is 33.8 per cent.-compared to an average of 14.4 per cent. for maintained secondary schools. Between 2007 and 2008 the rate of improvement for pupils gaining 5 A*-C grades (including English and maths) that attend academies and are eligible for free school meals has been double the national improvement rate, 5.3 percentage points compared to 2.4 percentage points.</p>

	<p pid="c.464W.2/4" class="indent">Your parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="c.464W.2/5" class="indent">The method used by Ofsted to record numbers of childcare places changed with the introduction of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in September 2008. Ofsted now holds two registers, the Early Years Register (for settings providing for children between birth and aged five) and the Childcare Register. The Childcare Register has two components, the compulsory register (for settings providing for children aged between five and seven) and the voluntary register (for settings providing for children older than aged eight). These registers replace the single register previously held for settings providing for children between birth and aged seven.</p>
	<p pid="c.464W.2/6" class="indent">For providers only registered on the Early Years Register, or those registered on both the Early Years Register and the compulsory part of the Childcare Register, the only change is to the breakdown of age ranges recorded on the new registers.</p>
	<p pid="c.464W.2/7" class="indent">For those providers only registered on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register, there is no maximum number of places stipulated. The maximum number of places a setting on the other registers can offer is set out in their conditions of registration.</p>
	<p pid="c.464W.2/8" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Dawn Primarolo MP, Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.469W.3/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.3/5" class="indent">Information relating to the academic level of qualifications held by inspectors was not provided to Ofsted when social care inspectors transferred from the Commission for Social Care Inspection in April 2007. As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-26">26 June 2009</phrase>, Ofsted employs 44 Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI) with a social care background, who manage and undertake inspections of local authority children's services. Ofsted also employs 149 social care inspectors, who regulate and inspect a range of social care providers, such as residential homes, fostering and adoption agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.3/6" class="indent">Of the 44 HMI, 42 hold a social work qualification recognised by the General Social Care Council, the qualification required for social work practice. These qualifications were awarded at different academic levels depending on the course attended (from the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work to a Masters degree) but all hold the same professional status. The requirement to hold a degree as the minimum level of social work qualification was only introduced in 2003. One HMI holds a residential work qualification which is not recognised as a social work qualification.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.3/7" class="indent">The 149 social care inspectors hold a variety of social work, social care and related qualifications and had considerable experience in providing children's social care services prior to joining Ofsted.</p>

	<p pid="c.469W.6/1">Following the commitments made in the Children's Plan in 2007 and the national Play Strategy in 2008, every top-tier local authority in England will receive either play pathfinder or playbuilder funding between 2008-11 through the play capital investment programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.6/2">Of the 152 top-tier local authorities, 30 are play pathfinder authorities and the remaining 122 local authorities are all playbuilder authorities. On average, every play pathfinder authority will receive around &#163;2 million capital funding and &#163;500,000 revenue funding, while playbuilder authorities will receive around &#163;1 million capital and &#163;45,000 revenue funding, over the current spending period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Play pathfinder authorities will use their allocated funding to deliver a minimum of 28 play areas plus a new staffed adventure playground, while playbuilder authorities will deliver a minimum of 22 play areas by 2011. The play areas that are delivered can be either completely new areas or existing areas which are significantly refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.6/3">Local authorities have joined the programme, and so started receiving their funding, in two phases: wave 1 started in April 2008 and wave 2 in April 2009. Bolton, Bury, Rochdale and Tameside are all wave 1 authorities, while the other six authorities in the Greater Manchester area (City of Manchester, Oldham, Salford, Stockport, Trafford and Wigan) joined the programme in April 2009. Of these, 10 local authorities, both Rochdale and Wigan are play pathfinders, while the others are all playbuilder authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.6/4">The following tables show the capital and revenue funding allocated to Greater Manchester authorities and the phase they each joined the capital play programme. Allocations for 2010-11 are indicative and will be confirmed in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.6/5">Decisions on where the capital funding is spent within local authority boundaries are taken locally, based on grant requirements around improved play spaces being provided where they are most needed and based on a robust consultation process with local children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.469W.6/6">We are encouraging all Members of Parliament to proactively engage with their local play capital programmes as they roll out, and we are asking local authorities to ensure that their local Members of Parliament and council elected members are appropriately consulted, and briefed, about where the capital funding is spent.</p>

	<p pid="c.471W.2/1">Following the commitments made in the Children's Plan in 2007 and the national Play strategy in 2008, every top tier local authority in England will receive either play pathfinder or playbuilder funding between 2008-11 through the play capital investment programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.471W.2/2">On average all play pathfinder authorities will receive around &#163;2 million capital funding and &#163;500,000 revenue funding, while playbuilder authorities will receive around &#163;1 million capital and &#163;45,000 revenue funding. Play pathfinder authorities will use their allocated funding to deliver a minimum of 28 play areas plus a new staffed adventure playground, while playbuilder authorities will deliver a minimum of 22 play areas by 2011. The play areas that are delivered can be either completely new areas or existing areas which are significantly refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="c.471W.2/3">Local authorities have joined the programme, and so started receiving their funding, in two phases: Wave 1 started in April 2008 and Wave 2 in April 2009. Hertfordshire is a Wave 2 playbuilder authority and will receive capital funding of &#163;541,001 in 2009-10 and &#163;609,820 in 2010-11 and revenue funding of &#163;27,633 in 2009-10 and &#163;18,422 in 2010-11. Allocations for 2010-11 are indicative and will be confirmed in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.471W.2/4">Decisions on where the capital funding is spent within local authority boundaries are taken locally, based on grant requirements around improved play spaces being provided where they are most needed and based on a robust consultation process with local children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.471W.2/5">We are encouraging all members of parliament to proactively engage with their local play capital programmes as they roll out, and we are asking local authorities to ensure that their local members of parliament and council elected members are appropriately consulted, and briefed, about where the capital funding is spent.</p>

Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase> have discussed the issues of rarely cover individually with our social partners on the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group on a number of occasions over the last few months.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.1/2">General guidance on the rarely cover provisions was issued at the end of April. A copy of this has been placed in the House Libraries. It makes clear that teachers should, from September 2009, be required to cover for absent colleagues only rarely, in circumstances that are not foreseeable.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.1/3">Since April, the Department has been working hard with social partners to produce additional guidance on the rarely cover provisions. This will include guidance on learning outside the classroom which is designed to help schools plan effectively for these activities, which we all agree are an important part of the curriculum. The additional guidance, which will be subject to a period of consultation, will be issued shortly and a copy will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.1/4">No estimate has been made of the number of learning outside the classroom activities that have been cancelled because of a lack of cover over the last 12 months and where schools take note of the new guidance, we do not anticipate that the rarely cover provisions will result in reduced opportunities for learning outside the classroom in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.493W.2/6">Furthermore, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 requires those with responsibility for the building (usually the employer, owner or occupier) to carry out a fire risk assessment based on the particular circumstances and use of the premises. Under the order, the responsible person must put in place whatever fire protection measures are adequate and appropriate to mitigate the risk to life in the event of a fire. The order is not prescriptive about what specific fire safety measures are required. This is a matter for the responsible person based on the outcome of their risk assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.497W.8/1">The Islam and Citizenship Education (ICE) Project is jointly funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and the Department for Communities and Local Government. The DCSF awarded a contract, worth &#163;318,652, to the School Development Support Agency (SDSA) running from February 2008 to July 2009 to develop and pilot citizenship lessons for use in mosque schools. The SDSA, working in conjunction with Muslim communities, has successfully delivered this contract. We are currently in the process of tendering for the next stage of the ICE Project to roll out the lessons to mosque schools nationally. Apart from fulfilling their contractual obligations, the SDSA and community-based organisations have made no financial contribution towards the ICE Project.</p>

HEFCE estimate that the allocation these ASNs funds an additional 10,000 part-time entrant places (in headcount terms) and 3,000 full-time entrant places in 2009. This is in addition to the number of entrants in 2008. Data on the number of entrants in 2008 will not be available until early 2010.</p>

However, it is possible to provide notional figures for the amount of grant distributed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for teaching and research apportioned by the number of learners (full time equivalent) in each year. It should be noted that there have been some significant changes in HEFCE's funding methodology over this period which means that the following table should not be read as a time series. In addition the data do not take account of other sources of public funding, for example from the NHS or the Research Councils. Crucially it should be borne in mind that institutions have a significant degree of freedom in terms of how their grants are distributed internally. It is for that reason that the figures given are notional and should not be read as the actual level of resource attached to any particular learner.</p>

	<p pid="c.505W.0/2">It is an important principle set out in legislation (sections 65(1) and 68(2b) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992) that Ministers cannot intervene in the funding decisions for individual institutions made by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). As is the case with other universities, London Metropolitan University receives grant from HEFCE under a Financial Memorandum which sets out how it should properly account for its public funding. It is for the Funding Council to keep the financial health of the institutions it funds under review to protect the public interest, including ensuring that public funds are properly spent.</p>
	<p pid="c.505W.0/3">The University will wish to consider a bid to HEFCE's Strategic Development Fund to support its future plans. The final decision on restructuring and forward planning must rest with the University and I remain confident that Higher Education provision in general across London will be sufficient to meet the diversity of demand. No Government, however, can give a commitment to protect every course or department at any particular institution.</p>

It has also always been my view that a similar review should be conducted into the actions of the university itself, and I have made that view clear in discussions with the Funding Council. I am therefore pleased that London Metropolitan has now commissioned Sir David Melville and Deloitte to conduct such a review. I believe that this must look at all aspects of what happened at London Metropolitan, including issues of governance.</p>

DFID, the Asian Development Bank and the Danish Government will also co-fund the rehabilitation of a hydro-power plant in Gereshk. The project is expected to triple electrical generation capacity, benefiting 200,000 people.</p>

DFID's current list combines a mix of the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and the Fund for Peace's Failed States Index (FSI). We will update the list every two years with the next update due in October this year.</p>

In addition, this financial year we expect to spend a further &#163;7.6 million on early recovery assistance in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.11/4">We have earmarked the remaining &#163;20 million for reconstruction when access restrictions are eased and it is possible for projects to start.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.11/5">Since the political situation in Gaza remains fluid, we cannot give exact figures on how much will be spent this year. However, we aim to maintain flexibility so that we can respond at short notice if possible. The amount of further support to the PA for this financial year, which would also benefit Gaza, is still to be decided.</p>

However, we have always recognised that there are circumstances in which it may be clinically appropriate to prescribe a particular brand of drug even where a generic is available if the prescriber considers it essential for the patient to receive that specific product.

	<p pid="c.524W.11/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not held such discussions with local authorities. The Food Standard Agency (FSA), however, as the central competent authority in the United Kingdom for controls on feed and food (safety and standards) uses statutory powers to monitor and audit local authority performance which include reporting on sampling activities by local authorities. Local authorities are measured against responsibilities set out in the Statutory Food Law Code of Practice (separate parallel codes of practice exist for each of the four UK countries). Local authority monitoring and audit information is available from 2000, and can be found at:</p>

However, the cost effectiveness of the analytical provision for local authorities is assured as a result of the current requirement for local authorities to appoint a public analyst through competitive tender. This allows local authorities to choose to send samples to laboratories that are competitive in terms of price and quality of service.</p>

Because of a perceived imbalance in the numbers of tourists being treated by both parties, under the bilateral agreement the UK has provided the Isle of Man with an annual allocation, to fund clinical referrals to the UK, of around &#163;2.5 million in recent years. The UK will no longer provide this, once the agreement is terminated.

	<p pid="c.532W.5/1">The Department's National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network (CRN) provides the health service infrastructure to support clinical trials and other studies funded by both commercial and non-commercial organisations. All eligible studies funded by research charities are automatically entitled to CRN support. The network is currently supporting 850 such studies. They comprise some 38 per cent. of the total CRN portfolio.</p>
	<p pid="c.532W.5/2">The cost of the CRN in 2008-09 was &#163;158 million. It is not possible separately to identify what part of that expenditure was attributable to the support given to research charity funded studies.</p>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03. to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 6 prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> PCT/Strategic health authority (SHA) data quality</i><br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed. Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.546W.0/1">Efficiency savings could not be anticipated in advance of national health service use of the framework. These will be determined on a case-by-case basis, dependent upon type of support required by each individual commissioning authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.0/2">Some commissioning authorities stipulate a requirement for Framework for procuring External Support for Commissioners (FESC) suppliers to commit to the generation of a degree of savings. This differs from procurement to procurement, and will be dependent upon the type of commissioning service being procured. To date, in those contracts where this stipulation has been made, FESC suppliers have committed to guaranteed savings totalling &#163;18 million. This figure does not include any additional incremental savings subsequently achieved during the course of a contract.</p>

	<p pid="c.549W.2/1">Information provided to the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), initially by the Health Protection Agency and subsequently by Government offices, shows that a total of 100 schools, including six special schools, had closed by <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-09">9 July 2009</phrase>. Of those schools, 93 had reopened by <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-09">9 July</phrase>, leaving seven schools closed, including five special schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.2/2">There is no statutory duty on schools to report their closure to DCSF, so this data is not necessarily complete.</p>

	<p pid="c.549W.5/2">Now that the management of swine flu has moved to the treatment phase, testing for confirmation of individual cases is no longer taking place, the Health Protection Agency will not have statistics about number of cases and where they are occurring.</p>

	<p pid="c.550W.2/2">Tattoo removal may be available on the NHS, according to local primary care trust policies, if a clinician considers that an individual patient's health requires it.</p>

	<p pid="c.550W.5/1">The &#163;80 million Preventative Technology Grant was granted to local authorities with social care responsibilities to provide telecare services, however this funding was not ring-fenced. Specific details of how this money was used by individual local authorities was not gathered, however it is known that the number of new telecare and telehealth users have increased by over 200,000. Any residual Preventative Technology Grant money was allowed to be carried over into 2008-09 to help sustain momentum. No money has been recovered by the Department and local authorities are expected to have used grant funding for telecare purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.550W.5/2">During the period of the grant over &#163;80 million worth of business has been procured through the PASA Telecare National Framework Agreement.</p>
