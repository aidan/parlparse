	<p pid="b.659W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-22">22 February 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.659W.3/2">All European Union member states have a requirement to inspect at least 5 per cent. of single payment scheme (SPS) applications each scheme year to confirm eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.3/3">The majority of these eligibility inspections are carried out by RPA using remote sensing. Remote sensing uses very high resolution satellite images to check the land area in a selected zone and then to check it matches what the farmer has claimed for on the SPS application form. The geographical zones to be inspected are selected as far as possible in counties not having been previously selected and this explains why part of Gloucestershire has been included. Claims in these zones are targeted using a risk-based approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.3/4">RPA employs a specialist contractor to undertake preliminary checks using remote sensing. When the findings reach RPA, they are checked against the SPS claim and the Rural Land Register (RLR) and then if necessary conveyed to the farmers concerned. In previous years remote sensing inspection cases have generally been paid later in the regulatory payment window, which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June</phrase>. This year and because RPA has been more successful in paying farmers earlier non payment of remote sensing cases appears more pronounced.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.3/5">Owing to the complex and scientific nature of analysing thousands of hectares of land cover and topography using satellite imagery, RPA inevitably discovers instances where it is difficult to interpret what the imagery is showing, for example because of atmospheric conditions or apparent land use and management changes, which require further clarification with the farmer. This year has also been more complex because of the work to update all of the boundaries, position and accuracy of the land in the RLR.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.3/6">RPA must ensure that findings from these inspections are taken fully into account before a claim can be paid, which often necessitates ongoing communications with farmers to reach an accurate outcome. Because of the range of checks on claims some will inevitably take longer than others to complete. Remote sensing processing is being carried out as quickly as possible and RPA is working to make these payments as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.664W.5/1">Information is not recorded in the format requested and would require requests for and detailed analysis of data returns from all prisons in England and Wales. To do so would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.5/2">The combination and extent to which these methods have been used to seize drugs is specific to individual prisons, and will have varied over time as priorities and tactics have changed and evolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.5/3">Local searching strategies are based on an individualised assessment of risk while containing mandatory actions set out in the National Offender Management Service's (NOMS) National Security Framework. NOMS searching policy is based on: common law principles of decency; human rights principles of necessity and proportionately; and not subjecting prisoners to degrading treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.5/4">An intimate search is defined as a manual search of buccal, anal and/or vaginal cavities. Intimate searching runs a significant risk of causing internal damage, particularly where the subject is non-compliant. Only qualified medical practitioners or registered nurses are able to undertake an intimate examination and will do so only with consent and for health-related reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.5/5">NOMS policy on searching in prisons does not permit intimate searches to be conducted. Where prison staff suspects internal concealment, the prisoner may be placed in confinement until the item is produced and/or referred to health care whenever there are concerns about health, for example, due to the concealment of drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.666W.9/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's policy is to send out vehicle tax renewal reminders around three weeks before the existing tax disc expires. This gives customers, plenty of time to get a new tax disc. The Agency's online and telephone based tax disc services are available 24 hours a day to ensure that customers need never miss the deadline for taking action.</p>
	<p pid="b.666W.9/2">Renewal reminder notices are sent as a courtesy. The registered keeper of a vehicle is responsible for ensuring it is correctly licensed, even if a renewal reminder is not received. Our assessment is that there is no evidence that reminders were unduly delayed during recent bad weather and that 3 million motorists licensed their vehicles during January.</p>

	<p pid="b.674W.6/2">The turbine delivered in September 2008 requires other materials, namely mechanical and construction equipment, to make it functional. These have not yet been moved to the Kajaki area. While the dam does not operate to its full capacity, currently it does provide electricity to the population of Helmand. Two generators are in place and being used, along with diesel-powered, local generation to increase supply. While the security situation in the area makes access and delivery to Kajaki challenging, supplies, including oil, are being delivered. USAID, the US federal government agency responsible for the US effort in the field of development and reconstruction, is leading the work on the refurbishment of the power station. They continue to plan to make the facility fully operational.</p>

	<p pid="b.678W.2/1">The Nimrod MR2 and Hercules C130K aircraft perform other tasks aside from long-range search and rescue. We therefore cannot comment on actual capability levels as this is classified information.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.2/2">The UK has responsibility for search and rescue operations within a specified area, which includes the North Atlantic out to 30 degrees West and both the Nimrod MR2 and Hercules C130K aircraft are capable of covering the entirety of the UK's search and rescue area of responsibility. The maximum time on task is dependent on a wide range of factors including load, configuration and weather, and this can be extended through use of diversions as far afield as Iceland in the north or indeed the Azores in the south. Additionally, the Hercules C130K has the capacity to air-to-air refuel which could significantly extend its time on task if it was required.</p>

	<p pid="b.687W.2/1">Since coming to office in 1997 the Government have developed a number of initiatives, both nationally and locally, to tackle child poverty. Salford has built on these national policies and developed their own local strategy to drive their child poverty agenda forward. My Department and Salford's local strategies have provided and strengthened family support through universal targeted specialist approaches including:</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.2/2" class="indent">the Common Assessment Framework;</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.2/3" class="indent">Children's Centres and Family Intervention Projects to maximise family and parenting support; and</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.2/4" class="indent">the &quot;Think Family&quot; Pathfinder which encourages family and community learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.2/5">In addition to these initiatives, Salford is benefiting from the new multi-service assertive Outreach Teams and Children's Centres which together are able to provide parents with a range of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.2/6">Children's Centres, in particular, disseminate up-to-date information on job vacancies, education, training and volunteering, and often act as the first &quot;port of call&quot; for those seeking specialist financial advice. Children's Centres provide a liaison point with Job Centre Plus to offer parents information on employment and skills and co-ordinate community-based learning and training. Their work is underpinned and further enhanced by the introduction of 35 community workers and teams of lone parent advisers, who are also located within the centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.2/7">Salford is also part of the Manchester's co-ordinated support for separating parents pilot, one of the eight child poverty pilots being undertaken nationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.688W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-10">10 February 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/4" class="indent">Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/5" class="indent">In line with the Education and Inspections Act 2006 Ofsted is charged with providing an annual performance rating for children's services for each local authority area. The children's services rating is a wide-ranging and robust assessment of the outcomes for children and young people that is strongly based on the evidence from Ofsted inspections of early years provision, schools including special schools and Pupil Referral Units, colleges, fostering and adoption services, children's homes, safeguarding and looked after children services inspections.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/6" class="indent">In addition, as one of the partner inspectorates, Ofsted has contributed to both the organisational and area assessments which together make up the Comprehensive Area Assessment of local areas, The children's services rating is a significant factor in the organisational assessment overall score for each council. For Ofsted and local authority children's services the Comprehensive Area Assessment replaces the annual performance assessment and the joint area review programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/7" class="indent">The Comprehensive Area Assessment was introduced in April 2009. Consequently costs are provisional and have been estimated for 12 months. Full audited costs will be available from the end of June. Taking into account the time contributed to this work by Her Majesty's Inspectors, data analysts, management and administrative staff, the estimated cost of Ofsted's contribution to the 2009 CAA is &#163;18,829 per local authority. Please note that this estimate does not include any allocation of corporate overhead.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.2/8" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Vernon Coaker MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.694W.3/3">Alongside the strategy we published statutory guidance on impartial careers education, setting out how schools must deliver high quality impartial information about learning options that promotes the best interests of pupils. An accompanying resources pack supports schools in implementing the statutory guidance. The provision of careers advice in schools is based on a partnership between the school and the Connexions service and other specialist services commissioned by the local authority. We will shortly consult on draft Directions and statutory guidance for local authorities in the delivery of such services.</p>

	<p pid="b.695W.0/1">No guidance has been issued to local authorities on whether lead members and other councillors who are required to register under the vetting and barring scheme will also be required to undergo Criminal Records Bureau checks. Individual councillors may currently undergo CRB checks because of particular functions they may exercise for the local authority for which they are a member, for example being a member of the local authority's fostering or adoption panel. The Government confirmed in their response to Sir Roger Singleton's report 'Drawing the Line' on the vetting and barring scheme, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-12-14.50"><i> Official Report,</i> 14 December 2009, column 50WS</phrase>, that they intends to review their requirements for CRB disclosures.</p>

	<p pid="b.697W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-23">23 February 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question (318531) on how many investigations under the Charities Act the Charity Commission has conducted relating to breaches of articles on the grounds of (a) political activity and (b) providing a platform to Hizb ut-Tahrir and associated groups; and how many (i) mosques and (ii) other charitable organisations have had their charitable status revoked following investigations of each type.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/4" class="indent">Your question refers to 'investigations'. It may be helpful to provide some background information on the way in which we carry out our investigatory compliance work, which has changed significantly over recent years. Prior to our strategic review in 2005, our practice was to carry out all investigations as formal statutory inquiries under section 8 of the Charities Act 1993. We now carry out a wider range of compliance work dealing with problems in charities. This includes assessment cases, monitoring, non-statutory investigations that we call regulatory compliance cases, as well as section 8 statutory inquiries. We now reserve statutory inquiries only for the most serious cases of regulatory concern. Last year, for example, we conducted 1,504 assessment cases and 211 monitoring cases, and completed 167 regulatory compliance cases and 21 statutory inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/5" class="indent">The statistical information we hold for the purposes of our investigations is not designed to identify the sort of data you are looking for. However, I have looked at our statistics for both non-statutory investigations and statutory inquiries for the last three complete financial years going back to 2006-07 and can provide the following information.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/6" class="indent">In relation to (a), we have carried out 29 investigations regarding political activity since 2006-07, out a total of 736 investigations. These 29 investigations were to examine allegations or concerns about inappropriate political activity and campaigning by charities, or charities making political donations or giving support to a political party. I should point out that revocation of charitable status is not a legal remedy if a charity has broken political campaigning rules. Our role in these cases is to make good the breach (for example, to ensure inappropriate payment by a charity to a political party is repaid) and ensure steps are taken to prevent recurrence.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/7" class="indent">As you may know, charities can campaign and undertake political activity but cannot have political purposes. If we find that an organisation, although registered as a charity, does in fact have a political purpose, it cannot be a charity in law. In these cases, we would remove the organisation from the Register of Charities because it was never in fact a charity. Our records show that we have removed two charities from the Register on this basis: one in October 2001 and the other in July 2004. Regarding part (i) of your question, I can confirm that neither of these organisations were mosques.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/8" class="indent">In relation to (b), our statistical information does not allow us to readily identify on a historical basis cases regarding allegations that a charity may have provided a platform to Hizb ut-Tahrir. However, I can confirm that we have no current statutory or non-statutory investigations into such concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.0/9" class="indent">I hope this is a helpful response to your question.</p>

As part of those discussions, the UK argued against the need for an EPP.

	<p pid="b.711W.2/1">Since the rollout of Airwave radio in 2001, the Government have funded research into the safety of Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) technology. None of the research to date has produced any evidence that Airwave terminals or masts are harmful to the health of police officers or the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.720W.2/1">Towns and cities can play a big role in tackling climate change. Many local authorities in towns and cities have set themselves targets to reduce emissions in response to National Indicator 186. We have set out our expectation of how planning authorities in towns and cities can plan new development to ensure carbon emissions are reduced in our Climate Change Planning Policy Statement (PPS) and we will shortly be consulting on a revision to the PPS. As part of the Eco-towns Programme we have set out sustainability standards for eco towns in our eco towns PPS. These include the requirement that the developments as a whole must be zero-carbon. We are working with nine groups of local authorities and individual local authorities to pilot the concept of local carbon frameworks, a new approach for local authorities to set themselves ambitious targets and plans for reducing carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="b.720W.8/1">The Planning Inspectorate has issued guidance on the length of time a (i) Traveller or (ii) a demonstration encampment may be in place before it is deemed permanent or authorised. The guidance issued by the Planning Inspectorate is in the form of the Inspectors Handbook, which covers professional planning matters dealt with by Inspectors. Annex E of ODPM Planning Circular 01/2006 'Planning for Gypsy and Traveller sites' states that planning permission may not be required for any development if the use of the land has been established over a period of time without valid planning enforcement action have been taken by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.8/2">No guidance has been issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government or the Planning Inspectorate on the length of time a temporary encampment may be in place before becoming rateable for council tax or business rates. No minimum period is defined by statute. It is established rating law that a transitory occupation of land does not amount to rateable occupation. Whether the necessary permanence of occupation has been established for liability to arise will depend on the facts in each case.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.8/3">A Traveller<sup>(1)</sup> or demonstration<sup>(2)</sup> encampment can become permanent, and authorised, for planning purposes through the express grant of planning permission for such a use, unencumbered by a condition limiting its use to a specified period, or by the imposition or removal of an appropriate condition attached to an existing planning permission by the formal process set out in s.73 and 73 A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The only other means by which a use of land can become lawful is where it continues, uninterrupted and in essentially the same form, for a period of 10 years and the evidence exists to prove that this has occurred, on the balance of probabilities, such that a Certificate of Lawful Development under s.191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 can be granted. In a similar way a use can become immune from enforcement action under S.171B of the 1990 Act after a period of 10 years, if a local planning authority has not taken enforcement action before that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.729W.2/2">All private landlords in Scotland must be registered (or have applied for registration) with the local authorities where they let private property. Once an application has been submitted it is assessed by the relevant local authority who determines whether the landlord is fit and proper. There are a number of sanctions available to local authorities if a landlord fails to register, or continues to let property after being refused registration. The sanctions include reporting the case to the Procurator Fiscal for prosecution. However, the most popular and successful sanction so far has been the rent penalty notice (RPN). If a local authority serves such a notice, it suspends the tenant's liability to pay rent for the period of the notice. If an RPN is used, the tenant is notified to stop paying rent and, if housing benefit is in payment, the local housing benefit office is informed that an RPN is in place and that housing benefit should not be paid for the period of the notice.</p>

	<p pid="b.730W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what outreach work is undertaken by Jobcentre Plus, and what plans she has for the future of such work. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has locations across the country providing outreach services which meet the needs of customers and communities, reaching the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in society. These outreach services complement our core services delivered through other channels.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/5" class="indent">There are various outreach schemes that Jobcentre Plus operates. Among them are: District Community Outreach, which provides ease of access to advice and support within the local community; Prison Outreach which provides specific support to prisoners as part of their preparation for release by offering both benefit and job broking advice; and School Gates which is a support initiative to increase the amount of employment and enterprise support provided to parents in and around their child's school.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/6" class="indent">In addition there is a small team of advisers working directly in community locations in three Jobcentre Plus Districts-Merseyside, South London, and South Tyne and Wear Valley. Their objective is to work with partners locally, in particular with social housing providers, to engage with residents, challenge attitudes to worklessness and offer a holistic service to address the barriers that prevent individuals or households from finding work.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/7" class="indent">Recognising this early success we announced in the White Paper an extension to this approach. Therefore, we will be funding 11 new teams in addition to the original three, from April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/8" class="indent">For the future, I see outreach being a continued way of delivering our services. We will continue to work with partners at a local level to establish new and innovative ways of sharing premises, facilitate the provision of more cohesive local services, promote our services to a wider customer base and potentially reduce overall Government estate costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what equality training is (a) compulsory and (b) made voluntarily available for Jobcentre Plus employees. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.2/4" class="indent">All new starters to Jobcentre Plus are required to work through the compulsory Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Induction Programme. The programme sets out the actions that should be taken to successfully induct and settle new staff into DWP, including sections on Diversity and Equality. To facilitate this programme, support is provided to line managers and staff via a checklist, which has been produced to provide clear guidance on the process, what needs to be done and by when.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has in place a comprehensive foundation learning programme in which Diversity and Equality feature within two key products. The first is the 12 hour Diversity and Equality Awareness for Excellent Customer Service workbook. The workbook is designed to highlight Jobcentre Plus' commitment to supporting Diversity and Equality in all that we do within our business. It provides an introduction to the diversity of Jobcentre Plus customers, and as the learner works through they are sign posted to the DWP Diversity and Equality site where they are expected to gather information in order to successfully answer questions and exercises covered within the workbook.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.2/6" class="indent">On completing the workbook learners undertake the Core Key Skills for Excellent Customer Service training event. The event provides learners with the understanding, skills and knowledge required to provide excellent and accessible customer services to all Jobcentre Plus customers. The event reinforces and builds on the knowledge gained from undertaking the workbook and provides coverage on: Equal Opportunity, Values &amp; Beliefs, Customer Groups, Cultural Awareness and Diversity and Equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.2/7" class="indent">Dependant on their job role and the staff's interaction with the customer within Jobcentre Plus, an additional training event is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.2/8" class="indent">Further training events available to Jobcentre Plus staff include:</p>

	<p pid="b.744W.12/4" class="indent">94 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/5" class="indent">98 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/6" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008 the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 people within City and Hackney PCT has increased from 69.9 to 81.8.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/7" class="indent">In September 2009, at Barts and the London NHS Trust, 98.3 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/8" class="indent">In September 2009, at Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 98.5 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/9" class="indent">Between September 1997 and September 2008 the number of consultants at Barts and the London NHS Trust increased from 177 to 417. Between September 1997 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses increased from 1,991 to 2,641.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/10" class="indent">Between September 1997 and September 2008 the number of consultants at Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust increased from 29 to 86. Between September 1997 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses increased from 615 to 1,029.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/11" class="indent">93.4 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Barts and the London NHS Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/12" class="indent">96.2 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/13">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Hackney North and Stoke Newington will have also benefitted from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/14">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/15">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/16" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence;</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/17" class="indent">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together&quot; Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision for a National Care Service for all adults in England which is fair, simple and affordable. The Department has consulted widely on this reform and is currently analysing the responses, which will feed into a White Paper later this year;</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/18" class="indent">The National Carer's Strategy (&quot;Carers at the heart of 21st century families and communities&quot;) launched in 2008;</p>

	<p pid="b.744W.12/22">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy which has had a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/23">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent. of children (aged 2 to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.12/24">Overall, life expectancy at birth for men has increased from 74.5 years (1995-1997 data) to 77.7 years (2006-08 data) while for women, life expectancy at birth has increased from 79.6 years (1995-97 data) to 81.9 years (2006-08 data).</p>

	<p pid="b.751W.8/1">The figure of 6.54 hours per week is drawn from the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) modelling, which is in turn rooted in current patterns of care. The PSSRU model shows an average package of community-based care for those in the critical Fair Access to Care Services category of around 8.7 hours per week. The PSSRU assumes, on the basis of Personal Social Services EX1 return (PSS EX1) data, that 74 per cent. of this package-around 6.5 hours per week-is home care. The Department then assumes that around 85 per cent. of the home care hours-around 5.5 hours per week on average-is personal care.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.8/2">The cost estimate for the Personal Care at Home Bill implies eight hours of personal care per week for new entrants to publicly funded care.

This allows consideration of the options that are available to help ensure that patients continue to get the medicines they need.</p>

	<p pid="b.759W.0/1">LSC funding for this type of provision is part of a much wider and more complex funding framework and any proposals for redistribution would need to be considered in this wider context.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/2">The White Paper made it clear that a concerted and sustained effort from partners and stakeholders at national and local levels would be required to bring the Learning Revolution vision to life. The new funding and planning arrangements set out in Chapter 4 of The Learning Revolution are playing a key role in this transformation and so from August 2011 the Skills Funding Agency will channel funding for informal adult learning in local or sub-regional areas through identified Lead Accountable Bodies. We will invite all local authorities to take part in these new arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/3">We are working closely with the Local Government Association, the Local Education Authorities Forum for the Education of Adults, the Association of Colleges, Ofsted and other delivery partners to develop a Lead Accountable Body model that will enable local authorities to discharge this pivotal leadership role. Accepting the role of Lead Accountable Body will enable local authorities to better position their own resources alongside those of the Skills Funding Agency, as part of a local learning infrastructure. This in turn will help to promote the wider personalisation agenda across a number of fronts, and enable other local services, like libraries, to play an important role in broadening choice for local people.</p>

	<p pid="b.762W.2/1">In the 2008/09 academic year there were 70,195 part-time first degree students in their first year of study and 135,000 students in any other year of study. It is not possible to accurately identify final year students as course timescales can vary, particularly for part-time students. However 36,855 part-time first degree students qualified in 2008/09. This will discount students who completed their final year, but did not qualify.</p>
