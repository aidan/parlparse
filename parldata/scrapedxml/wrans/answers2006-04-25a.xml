	<p pid="a.971W.3/2">The Animals Act 1971 currently has the effect of placing strict liability on the owner of animals that cause harm whatever the circumstances. This appears to be inconsistent with current liability law in other areas which allows for a general defence of reasonable care. The Government have acknowledged that there may be a case for an amendment to the Animals Act and expects to launch a consultation shortly on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.971W.6/1">Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.6/2">Kingston-upon-Hull city council submitted their last Updating and Screening Assessment (USA) in July 2003. The authority subsequently carried out a Detailed Assessment in respect of nitrogen dioxide, particles (PM10), and sulphur dioxide, which was submitted to my Department in May 2004. In light of the conclusions of the Detailed Assessment, Kingston declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in respect of nitrogen dioxide, in August 2005. Kingston is currently developing their air quality action plan, which will set out measures to work towards meeting the air quality objective. They have included measures within Hull city council's local transport plan, which should improve the capacity to deliver cleaner air within the AQMA.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.6/3">The next round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities are asked to submit a new Updating and Screening Assessment by end of April 2006, which will be considered by my officials. My Department will be assessing Kingston-upon-Hull's report as part of this exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.972W.5/1">H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in a sample from the partially decomposed body of a Whooper swan found on the causeway at Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland. The swan is the first case of H5N1 detected in a wild bird in the UK and our current hypothesis is that it originated outside Great Britain. Ongoing intensified surveillance across the UK has not identified any other positive live or dead wild bird. There is also no evidence that the virus is present in domestic poultry.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.5/2">Poultry keepers within a 2,500 sq km wild bird risk area around the area where the swan was found have been required to house their birds. All bird keepers throughout the UK are encouraged to continue their efforts to maintain high levels of biosecurity and develop their plans to bring their birds indoors should that become necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.5/3">The implications of the Whooper swan finding have been discussed with ornithologists and a revised veterinary risk assessment has been published. It concludes that the current measures put in place throughout Scotland are adequate and proportionate at present. The situation will continue to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.5/4">We are monitoring the market impact of avian flu closely. The European market is currently volatile, and the knock-on effects of significant downturns in some member states (notably Italy and France) are being felt domestically in terms of lower prices. So far, however, consumption of poultry products has not been significantly affected in the UK.</p>

This will allow action to be taken, even if the animal is not currently suffering. Under the Bill, we have proposed that the maximum penalty for an offence of cruelty will be raised to a fine of up to &pound;20,000 or imprisonment for 51 weeks, or both.</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.6/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/2" class="italic">Domestic Waste</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/3">There are two targets for local authorities to achieve in respect of domestic waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/4">The first is to meet the challenging national target set by the EU Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/5" class="indent">By 2010 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste land filled to 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/6" class="indent">By 2013 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 50 per cent. of that produced in 1995</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/7" class="indent">By 2020 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 35 per cent. of that produced in 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/8">This target is being delivered through a combination of measures/drivers designed to assist and encourage local authorities. In particular the Government have established the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) with an aim of driving waste management solutions up the waste hierarchy, improving the sustainability of waste management. WIP delivers this through the following nine work-streams:</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/9" class="indent">1. Local Authority Support Unit</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/10" class="indent">2. Local Authority Funding</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/11" class="indent">3. Waste Minimisation (managed by WRAP <sup>1</sup> )</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/12" class="indent">4. Efficiency</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/13" class="indent">5. Education (managed by WRAP)</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/14" class="indent">6. Kerbside recycling (managed by WRAP)</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/15" class="indent">7. Research</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/16" class="indent">8. Data</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/17" class="indent">9. New Technologies</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/18" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> WRAP&mdash;Waste Resource Action Programme</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/19">Recycling is towards the top of the waste hierarchy, together with minimisation and reuse, and each of the work-streams includes effort towards these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/20">Local authorities are responsible for meeting the EU targets and contribute individually to the overall target through compliance with the Local Authority Trading Scheme (LATS) scheme. This provides landfill allowance allocations for each authority and measures their performance against these targets. The scheme allows authorities to trade their allowances (buying, selling, or borrowing from future years) with penalties applied to those who fail to meet the scheme requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/21">The second target is the Defra PSA6 target to:</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/22" class="indent">Enable at least 25 per cent. of household waste to be recycled or composted by 2005&ndash;06, with further improvements by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/23">Although looking more widely than biodegradable waste this target focuses on household&mdash;rather than municipal&mdash;waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/24">WIP monitors and assists with the delivery of this target in a number of ways but in particular through programmes of work delivered through WRAP, and the work undertaken by the Local Authority Support Unit programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/25" class="italic">Commercial Waste</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/26">The current targets, and therefore WIP remit, does not extend to commercial waste. Current policy is for local authorities to manage commercial waste through the usual commercial processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/27" class="italic">Plastics</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/28">The Biodegradeable municipal remit of WIP does not extend plastics, however WRAP are using other Defra funding to engage with industry to develop recycling markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/29" class="italic">Recycling/Composting Performance for Swindon borough council</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.6/30">The Recycling/Composting Performance for the last five years for Swindon borough council is outlined in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.980W.8/1">Most recent data from the Environment Agency (2002&ndash;03) indicate that 44 per cent. of waste produced by business in England and Wales was recycled. This level of recycling exceeds what is being achieved for household waste, and is up from 37.5 per cent. in 1998&ndash;89.</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/2">The Government have identified a need for further action on recycling by businesses and producer responsibility makes an important contribution to increasing recycling. The policy is aimed at ensuring that businesses take responsibility for the environmental impact of products that they place on the market, particularly once they become waste. Recent waste legislation, such as that implementing EC directives on packaging and end-of-life vehicles, places various requirements on producers, including recovery and recycling targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/3">Government funding from the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme is another significant element of the Government programme to increase recycling by businesses, by funding resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes. Various BREW delivery bodies are charged with returning &pound;284 million, from additional landfill tax receipts, to business over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/4">Initiatives already under way to encourage recycling by businesses, under BREW and other programmes, include:</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/5" class="indent">work by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), to improve the range and quality of recycled products and to increase the demand for them;</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/6" class="indent">a WRAP-led pilot of sector-specific help for small businesses. Following this pilot, DEFRA will consider how recycling services for small businesses might best be developed;</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/7" class="indent">work by Envirowise to provide resource efficiency advice to businesses;</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/8" class="indent">the DTI Technology Programme, which facilitates research and development into resource efficiency, including in the area of waste management; and</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/9" class="indent">the Environment Agency's pilot of an online internet service for small businesses: 'What do I do with my waste?'. The pilot is working as an extension to the Agency's existing guidance service for small and medium sized enterprises ('NetRegs').</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/10">The Government are currently reviewing its Waste Strategy for England. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase>, DEFRA issued a consultation document on the review which suggested various proposals to increase business waste recycling and recovery. The proposals include a wider role for local authorities in fostering better recycling services for small businesses, better integrating municipal and business waste management and continuing to develop markets for recycled materials. The consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase>. Following the consultation, DEFRA will issue a revised strategy which will take account of comments received from stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.8/11">The Government do not have an estimate of the proportion of waste recycled by business in the last 12 months. However, the Environment Agency estimates that 53 per cent. of all business waste regulated under the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) regime was recycled or re-used in 2004. DEFRA is developing a data strategy to provide future data on waste arisings and recycling.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.0/1">There is currently no legislative requirement to recycle spent batteries. However, the Government support the development of the proposed EU Batteries Directive as its objectives are consistent with those in the Government's Waste Strategy and Sustainable Development Strategy. Both aim to reduce the quantity of hazardous and non hazardous waste batteries going to landfill and increase the recovery of waste materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.0/2">The proposed directive, which might be expected to come into force in the UK in 2008, sets targets for the collection and recycling of all waste batteries. We expect that producers of batteries will have collection and recycling obligations to meet. The exact form these may take will not be decided until the directive has been finalised and we have completed formal domestic consultation with all parties concerned. It is expected that producers will need to work closely with waste management companies and local authorities, among others, in order to collect and recycle waste batteries in line with the likely obligations under the directive.</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.3/1">The Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund was challenge based, and in each of the three bidding rounds applications were received from a large number of local authorities. Defra considered in full each application against set criteria agreed with an expert advisory panel, comprising key representatives from across the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.3/2">The panel separately assessed each application and Defra officials took into account their recommendations before final decisions were taken by the Minister of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.3/3">Support was given to the best local authority projects designed to either minimise the amount of household waste generated, or those that aimed to provide more new or improved facilities for re-use and recycling and composting.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.3/4">Herefordshire council submitted a bid in round 2 of the Fund (2003&ndash;04) that was unsuccessful. However, the council did not submit a bid in either the first or third rounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.3/5">The Government's Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) provides a range of support, analysis and assessment work to compliment the funding and help local authorities deliver the best waste minimisation and recycling services.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.3/6">Herefordshire council has received funding for a number of different projects from Defra, which are detailed in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.3/17">In addition, in December 2005, Defra wrote to all local authorities regarding the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant (WPEG). This is a 3-year targeted grant totalling &pound;260 million over 3 years, which is replacing the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund from 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.3/18">Every English local authority with waste management responsibilities received a portion of the &pound;40 million allocation in 2005&ndash;06. The allocations for the next two years were announced at the end of 2005.</p>

Most were instances of planned maintenance for which users of the network are normally given seven days' notice, and which is normally undertaken either at weekends or before 9am and after 7pm on weekdays.

In the medium to longer term the Parliamentary ICT service has begun a fundamental re-assessment of the technologies used and services offered to remote users.

No specific test is prescribed that involves motorcycles, or any other particular sort of vehicle, because they are not considered to present any distinct problems. The operational tests do however involve measuring the speed of any passing traffic including motorcycles. The Home Office are wholly satisfied that when used in accordance with their type approval, the manufacturers' instructions and the Code of Practice issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers all type approved devices are accurate and reliable on motorcycles and in the evidence they produce.</p>

Given the size and complexity of the site, the LDA has decided that it is necessary to exercise its powers of compulsory acquisition so as to be sure of securing possession of the land when required.

	<p pid="a.999W.2/1">For 2005&ndash;06, the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) system was used to distribute resources for nursery education between local authorities. The formula for under 5s used pupil numbers, weighted for deprivation, area costs and sparsity to divide up the overall total of resources for under 5s. That resulted in a unit of funding for under 5s of &pound;2,980 for Nottinghamshire. For 2006&ndash;07, the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) replaced Schools FSS, and &pound;82 million was added to the total of DSG to fund the increased entitlement for nursery education from 33 weeks to 38 weeks per year. DSG has a single unit of funding for all pupils from 3 to 15: the baseline figure for Nottinghamshire for 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;3,246 per pupil; and the figure for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;3,457 per pupil, which takes account of the additional funding for the increased entitlement for nursery education.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.0/1">The provisions set out in clause 42 of the Education and Inspections Bill will permit the schools adjudicator to consider any aspect of a school's admission arrangements in addition to the aspect which is the subject of the objection. The Bill does not give the adjudicator any power to consider schools' admission arrangements where he has not received an objection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.0/2">Admission forums have a different remit. They are required by regulations to give advice to admission authorities on their admission arrangements, and where this advice is not followed, clause 38(8) of the Bill will enable them to refer objections to the adjudicator. As part of this process, they should see all local schools' admission arrangements and will be able to request these where they have not been supplied.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.0/3">Admission forums will also be able to prepare and publish reports on how well an area's admission arrangements engender fair access and work in the interests of parents and children. The local authority, neighbouring local authorities, and admission authorities in their area will be required by regulations to provide the admission forum with any information they hold that will enable them to produce their report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003W.5/2">All LEAs and educational establishments should have procedures for dealing with allegations against staff that aim to strike a balance between the need to protect children from abuse, and the need to protect staff and volunteers from false or unfounded accusations. Any decision to suspend or dismiss a teacher is taken locally, School Staffing (England) Regulations 2003 give both the governing body and the head teacher the power to suspend any person employed or engaged to work at the school. Usually such action is agreed by the governing body, though where a decision should not be delayed, the head teacher may use their discretion to remove a teacher by suspending or terminating their employment with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.5/3">Employers have a statutory duty, under the Education (Restriction of Employment) Regulations 2000, to make a report to my Department when a person is dismissed from employment on the grounds of misconduct or resigns in circumstances which would have led to their dismissal if they had not resigned. With the support of the panel of experts chaired by Sir Roger Singleton Panel it is then the responsibility of the Secretary of State to consider whether to prohibit the person from working with children in the future by placing them on List 99.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.5/4">Where an individual who states they are employed to teach or work with children is convicted of a sexual assault, the police also report this for consideration. A number of convictions are considered sufficiently serious to warrant an immediate and automatic bar from working with children&mdash;'an offence contrary to section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (sexual assault)'&mdash;is a conviction that would result in an automatic bar from teaching.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.3/2">The table also shows the value of housing capital receipts set-aside by local authorities to repay debt.

The amount invested in housing was &pound;4.1 billion i.e. almost 2&frac12; times the amount received in receipts. The ratio is expected to increase substantially in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1014W.8/1">During the NATO campaign, persecution by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia military led to the temporary exodus of over 500,000 Kosovo-Albanian refugees moving to Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Shortly after the campaign ended a large majority of those Kosovo-Albanian refugees returned. However, after the end of the campaign an estimated 65,000 to 70,000 Kosovo Serbs left Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.8/2">Since 1999 the overall numbers of Kosovo-Serbs, previously displaced from their homes, returning to Kosovo has remained disappointingly low. Uncertainty over the outcome of the final status process and its impact on the sustainability of returns create significant disincentives to return to Kosovo. Economic security remains very limited. Weak property rights protection, discouragement from the authorities in Belgrade and shortages of social housing all contribute to an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. We are encouraging Kosovo's Provisional Institutions to take the essential actions necessary to enable those who wish to return to do so and create an environment conducive to facilitate returns. We are also urging the Government in Belgrade to sign the protocol on returns agreed in September 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-30">30 March 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary wrote to the Brazilian Foreign Minister in support of Craig Alden's application for Presidential Expulsion. The Brazilians rejected this application. Both my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Common wealth affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, who is responsible for Consular matters in Latin America, have subsequently raised Mr. Alden's case with their Brazilian counterparts on a number of occasions asking that they take account of the human rights issues involved in Mr. Alden's case. Most recently, my noble Friend Lord Triesman of Tottenham raised Mr. Alden's case with the Brazilian Foreign Minister in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.0/2">Since his arrest, Mr. Alden and his family have expressed concerns over his safety while in prison. We have taken his fears about his safety seriously and officials from our Embassy in Brasilia have made numerous successful representations to the Brazilian authorities, requesting that he remain apart from other prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.0/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office remains completely impartial in respect of the substance of any allegations against Mr. Alden. However, we share the concerns about the fairness of his trial, which we continue to raise with the Brazilian government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.3/1">As part of the 2005&ndash;08 pay settlement for delegated grades, agreed in November 2005, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) agreed with the Trade Union Side (TUS) to undertake annual Equal Pay Audits and to review the findings on completion with the TUS.

	<p pid="a.1016W.6/1">15 nations took part in this UK exercise in November 2005 as part of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The exercise identified a number of lessons, with extensive and valuable feedback provided by participating nations. The need for appropriate and timely access to information from a range of sources reinforced the importance of cross-government involvement from the outset. Sharing of information between PSI nations was also shown to be vital, highlighting the need for secure and reliable communications channels to be established. Almost all nations commented on the need to continue to improve inter-departmental operations and awareness within their own governments. A number of important issues were raised which will be examined in future PSI exercises, such as the disposition of cargo after an interdiction and how the Suppression of Unlawful Acts at Sea protocols will affect the legal basis for interdiction. The cost effectiveness and benefits of running a federated exercise in national capitals showed that this way of hosting exercises could reduce the cost without compromising the high standards associated with PSI events.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/2">The UK has benefited a great deal from running Exercise Exploring Themis and from our involvement in other PSI exercises. The main benefits have been improved intra-Government co-ordination, better understanding of the legal environment and improved technical abilities, such as communications. These factors have all contributed to improved UK maritime security. The exercise also enabled governments from 15 nations to co-ordinate their efforts to address potential future weapons of mass destruction proliferation threats. Effective joint international action helps to address maritime security for UK shipping outside UK territorial waters.</p>
