The Department is committed to working with the Tees Valley Metro promoters to help them to develop their business case and I look forward to seeing the final document in due course. Funding for part or all of these proposals will need to be identified in the Regional Funding Advice (RFA2) transport investment programme for the North East. In this respect, the RFA2 response from the North East Region is to be submitted to Government at the end of February.</p>

	<p pid="c.739W.7/1">The Aspirations research, published jointly by the Social Exclusion Taskforce, DCSF and CLG in December 2008, is highly significant and directly informs the new Inspiring Communities programme announced in the New Opportunities White Paper yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.7/2">Aspirations have an important influence on young people's educational attainment. This research found that young people in some deprived areas are less likely to develop high aspirations. These areas often feature close knit social networks; stable populations and isolation from diverse economic opportunities. Government have made great progress in deprived areas but pessimistic attitudes can be formed over generations and are hard to shift.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.7/3">The Government are investing &pound;10.1 million in a new Inspiring Communities campaign, bringing together local businesses, schools, parents and the wider community to find innovative ways to inspire young people and tackle attitudinal barriers.</p>

	<p pid="c.742W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many people died from factors attributable to cold weather in (a) each London borough and (b) each English region in each of the last 10 years. (247032)</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.5/4" class="indent">Estimates of excess winter deaths are based on the difference between the number of deaths during the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November) and the following four months (April to July). It is not possible to say whether these deaths were related to cold weather. The table attached provides the number of excess winter deaths in (a) each London Borough and (b) each government office region from 1997/98 to 2006/07 (the latest available).</p>

This included an assessment of how far the Government's vision of the state and the third sector working together at all levels and as equal partners can bring about real change in our public services. The Government welcomed the Committee's recognition of the capacity of the sector to deliver excellent and innovative public services but also acknowledged the need to build a robust evidence base that supports the case for more public and private investment in the third sector as a delivery partner. This is why, through the Office of the Third Sector, &pound;5 million has been invested in a new third sector research centre, led by Birmingham university, which will collect and disseminate evidence about the true social and economic value of the sector to society. Government are also investing in a four year National Programme for Third Sector Commissioning, which is providing training for up to 3,000 commissioners of public services to ensure they get the best out of working with the third sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.752W.3/1">Aimhigher projects are delivered through the 44 area-based Aimhigher partnerships of schools, colleges and universities. Partnerships submit plans to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), summarising the type of activities they intend to undertake. However, they are not required to detail their activities with primary schools separately and do not set out the costs of individual activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.752W.3/2">From 2004 to 2007, HEFCE supported the 'Professor Fluffy' project based at the University of Liverpool. &pound;274,000 was provided jointly from Aimhigher and HEFCE's own funds. The 'Professor Fluffy' project aims to raise awareness of higher education at an early age. In 2004, Professor Fluffy started a tour of primary schools in Greater Merseyside. In a project called 'Professor Fluffy's Greater Merseyside Primary Roadshow', year five and six pupils take part in a range of activities aimed at raising aspirations and introducing the vocabulary of higher education. The project reaches over 140 primary schools a year in Greater Merseyside of which 30 also participate in a visit into one of the colleges or universities. Professor Fluffy's resources are linked to the key stage 2 national curriculum and include the Professor Fluffy comic book, activity booklet and over 20 curriculum modules, e.g. five modern languages and a variety of STEM subjects. The children, and their parents, are also able to access Professor Fluffy's own interactive website which has had over a million pages viewed over the last couple of years. At the end of the programme each pupil receives a special Professor Fluffy certificate in a 'graduation ceremony' to celebrate their participation, together with their very own Professor Fluffy. In addition to the roadshow and university visits, a teachers' pack, offering five sessions, will be available shortly for purchase by schools. The Professor Fluffy concept and delivery models have been franchised to over 20 partners across the country. So far, Professor Fluffy has visited over 350 primary schools and talked to 30,000 primary pupils and their parents.</p>

The timing and duration of the review and the publication of its results will enable us to fulfil the commitment given to the House in 2004 that there will be no vote before 2010 at the earliest, and to enable the review to present Parliament with an evidence-based report covering the full range of the issues it has been asked to consider through its terms of reference.

The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &quot;equivalised&quot;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. Median incomes are used as the national average in the publication.  5. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.  6. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.  7. Data for Northern Ireland are only available from 1998-99 to 2000-01 onwards.  8.

	<p pid="c.769W.4/1">Communities and Local Government does not hold a record of the number of local authorities who have set up multi-agency monitoring groups.

	<p pid="c.774W.11/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-11">11 November 2008</phrase> I personally wrote to the main trade associations representing public house operators and occupiers to help ensure that their members are clear about the change in approach to the rating assessments for pubs following the introduction of the smoking ban.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.11/2">The chief executive's office of the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) was in direct contact concerning this issue with representatives of those same trade associations back in June&mdash;very shortly after receipt of the legal advice which prompted the change of view on the validity of proposals to reduce rating assessments on account of the ban.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.11/3">The VOA was in regular contact with the various representatives and in particular the rating advisor to the British Beer and Pub Association throughout the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.11/4">Staff in VOA local offices made every effort to contact those pubs who had made proposals earlier on, which were then treated as invalid, to tell them about the change of view. Various members of staff made presentations to local rating forums/trade groups in order to heighten awareness.</p>
	<p pid="c.774W.11/5">An article has recently been published in the <i> Morning Advertiser</i> (a widely read licensed trade magazine)&mdash;primarily this provides answers to questions about the 2010 rating revaluation, but also the opportunity was taken to further clarify the smoking ban issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.0/1">Information on the number and value of agreed planning obligations for affordable housing by each local authority is not collected centrally. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government has produced research reports into the value of planning obligations in England for 2003-04 and 2005-06 based on a sample of authorities across the country. These reports are available on the Department's website. New research covering 2007-08 has been commissioned and will be published in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.0/2">The findings estimate the total value of affordable housing agreed using planning obligations has risen from around &pound;1.2 billion in 2003-04 to &pound;2 billion in 2005-06. Of this amount for 2005-06 &pound;211.5 million was estimated to be attributed to agreed direct payments and the remainder account for in-kind payments. The value of affordable housing delivered in 2005-06 was estimated at &pound;1.4 billion. The estimated value of affordable housing delivered against agreements should be considered in context, as not all of the permissions to which the agreements are attached will be implemented and some others will be renegotiated.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.0/3">The Government are clear that local authorities should be open and accountable over the collection and use of s106 monies. We will explore whether more can be done to strengthen this local accountability through the Empowerment White Paper published in July 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.778W.2/2">The Committee's Report on coastal towns raised the important issue of the difficulties that can arise when looked-after children are placed away from their home area. We are determined that every looked-after child must be provided with the appropriate support by the local authorities responsible for their care.</p>
	<p pid="c.778W.2/3">The Children and Young Persons Act 2008 recently received Royal Assent and section 8 sets out the considerations that local authorities must have regard to when they are considering making a placement for a looked-after child. This includes giving first consideration as far as is reasonably practicable to a placement being near a child's home and within the local authority's area. We will be issuing regulations and statutory guidance on section 8 which will provide more detail about the responsibilities of placing authorities. This will include that where children have to be placed at a distance from their home areas, the placement is the most suitable to meet their needs; and that relevant information about the child is shared with the local authority in the area where the child has been placed. Furthermore, section 16 of the Act reaffirms local authority responsibilities to ensure visits to looked-after children including those placed out of authority and a long way from their homes.</p>

However, following a recommendation of the independent Smith review of the Home Office crime statistics, the British Crime Survey is being extended to include those aged under 16 years from 2009. This will assist in providing a clearer understanding of youth victimisation. We know that young people are more likely to be victims of other young people, and we are committed to driving down levels of youth victimisation. Through the implementation of the YCAP, we have introduced a new national objective to substantially reduce the number of young victims by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/3">As part of YCAP, in October 2008 we announced that five areas across the country have been awarded a share of nearly half a million pounds to undertake pilot work to create the next generation of support services for young victims of crime.</p>

	<p pid="c.784W.2/5">Also it was announced in September 2008 that &pound;56.5 million of the YCAP money will be used to tackle youth crime across England in 69 local authority areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/6" class="indent">Each of the 69 areas were being offered &pound;700,000 to implement an intensive package of action over the next three years, with an immediate cash injection of &pound;90,000 available to each local authority in (2008).</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/7" class="indent">This builds on the excellent work already under way in many local areas across the country and on the Government's track record in investing in children and young people. Measures will include:</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/8" class="indent">Operation Stay Safe&mdash;using safeguarding laws to remove young people at risk from the streets at night;</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/9" class="indent">street-based teams of youth workers and ex-gang members to tackle groups of young people involved in crime and disorder;</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/10" class="indent">increased visible police patrols during after-school hours;</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/11" class="indent">expanding Family Intervention Projects to respond more effectively to families at risk;</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/12" class="indent">providing positive activities for young people;</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/13" class="indent">placing youth offending team workers in police stations so that young offenders can be dealt with and directed to the most appropriate service at the earliest opportunity; and</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.2/14" class="indent">making young offenders feel the consequences of their actions by expanding reparation during their leisure time, including on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>

	<p pid="c.788W.5/1">At <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>, there were 136,709 subject profiles on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) from persons currently aged under 16 submitted by police forces in England and Wales. The estimated number of individuals represented on the NDNAD is lower than the number of subject profiles as some profiles are replicates. The subject profile replication rate is currently calculated as 13.3 per cent. The estimated number of individuals aged under 16 is 118,527.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.5/2">The NDNAD does not hold information on criminal histories such as subsequent charges, cautions or convictions; this information is held on the police national computer (PNC). Information on the number of young persons aged under 16 who have a profile on the NDNAD and who have a conviction is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, some information is available on the number of persons aged under 18 on the NDNAD who have a conviction. This was obtained from the NDNAD and the PNC on 9-<phrase class="date" code="2008-04-10">10 April 2008</phrase>. The NDNAD data indicates that, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-10">10 April 2008</phrase>, there were 349,934 subject sample profiles relating to persons aged 10 to 17 on it. Taking the replication rate into account, it is estimated that the 349,934 profiles are equivalent to 303,393 persons aged 10 to 17. Data obtained from the PNC on 9-<phrase class="date" code="2009-04-10">10 April</phrase> indicates that, of those estimated 303,393 persons, 264,297 (87.1 per cent.) had a conviction, caution, reprimand or had received a final warning and 39,095 (12.8 per cent.) had not been convicted, cautioned, received a final warning/reprimand and had no charge pending against them.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.5/3">At <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>, there were 70 subject profiles on the NDNAD from children currently aged under 10 submitted by police forces in England and Wales. The profile replication rate is not likely to apply to children aged under 10 as, in England and Wales, they are below the age of criminal responsibility and they cannot be arrested, prosecuted or convicted. Samples may only be taken from them with the consent of a parent or guardian.</p>
	<p pid="c.788W.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-16">16 December 2008</phrase> I announced that the Government would take immediate steps to remove the DNA profiles of children aged under 10 from the NDNAD.</p>

	<p pid="c.789W.2/1">Numbers of profiles added to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) where the person concerned was under 18 (regardless of their current age), are shown in table 1. Numbers of profiles added to the NDNAD where the person concerned is currently under 18 are shown in table 2. Numbers of profiles added to the NDNAD where the person concerned was under 18 at the time the profile was loaded but is now over 18 are shown in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="c.789W.2/2">The figures provide a snapshot of the numbers added to the NDNAD by police forces in England and Wales as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-26">26 November 2008</phrase>. In each table the numbers are broken down by gender and the police force which added the profile.</p>
	<p pid="c.789W.2/3">'Unassigned' means that the police representative did not complete the section of the form referring to the person's gender.</p>
	<p pid="c.789W.2/4">The number of profiles on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals as a profile may be a replicate, that is, a profile may have been loaded on more than one occasion. This can occur if a person gives a different name, or different version of their name on separate arrests, or if a profile is upgraded. The current replication rate for the whole NDNAD is 13.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.789W.2/5">The replication rate for profiles added by particular police forces may vary from this. Therefore a figure is given in each table for the estimated number of individuals on the NDNAD added by English and Welsh forces, but figures are not given for the estimated number of individuals added by each police force.</p>

The Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency has regularly updated the Home Affairs Select Committee with all of the most robust information available. In her letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-23">23 July 2008</phrase> she advised the Committee that the agency is now removing or deporting around a fifth of all individuals direct from prison an average of 180 days before their release date. For the remaining individuals it is taking the agency around 130 days, on average, to deport or remove them from the UK. A copy of this letter is available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.804W.5/1">In September 2007, the Home Secretary set up the Tackling Gangs Action Programme to focus renewed action in neighbourhoods in Birmingham, Liverpool, London and Manchester where guns and gangs have caused serious harm. The initial &pound;1.5 million programme ran for six months to March 2008 but the work is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="c.804W.5/2">This targeted approach delivered rapid results&mdash;a 51 per cent. reduction in firearms-related injuries across the four cities in six months. Recent quarterly statistics show that firearms offences continue to fall, with a reduction of 22 per cent. in April to June 2008 compared with the same period in the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.804W.5/3">A further &pound;1 million of funds has been allocated to build on enforcement work, community reassurance and Third Sector delivery of support in the four TGAP areas. A Practical Guide was published in May to local partners highlighting examples of good practice on gang prevention. In September, we launched a gangs guide to parents to help prevent their children becoming involved in gangs and due to demand, a further 250,000 are being made available. More recently, &pound;4.5 million of additional funding over the period 2009-12 was announced for local community groups in targeted areas. The new fund will provide grants for intensive work with young people most at risk of gun, gang or knife crime through mentoring and outreach work.</p>

	<p pid="c.805W.0/1">The information requested is given in the following table. Detections (or 'clear ups') can be subdivided into sanction and non-sanction detections. Sanction detections are now the preferred method, providing a more meaningful comparison of individual force performance. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances. Some forces have already abandoned their use on non-sanction detections altogether. The reductions in the use of non-sanction detections are clearly demonstrated by the figures given in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.0/2">There are variations in detection rates across police force areas. These variations reflect a range of factors, including differing resources available to investigate crime, varying force priorities and the crime mix within the wider offence groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.0/3">Different offence types have different detection rates so any changes in the 'crime mix' will also affect the overall rates of detection. Furthermore, the most numerous crimes have the greatest influence on overall detection rates. Sanction detections rates for individual offence groups by police force area are published in Table 7.04 of 'Crime in England and Wales 2007-08' which is available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.806W.2/1">Since March 2003, overall crime has fallen by 18 per cent., exceeding the 15 per cent. target set out in the Home Office's public service agreement. That reduction is greater than would have been forecast based on socio-economic factors alone, and we are confident that the right policies and systems are in place to continue to cut crime and that they provide the flexibility needed to respond to future economic challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.806W.2/2">Decisions on the distribution of local resources in response to varying demands are matters for the chief constable and the police authority for the force concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.806W.2/3">The three-year funding settlement for the years 2008-09 to 2010-11 that we announced last year reflects the Government's continuing commitment to improve policing and reduce crime further. The police service in England and Wales has benefited from a significant increase in resources over a sustained period. On a like-for-like basis Government grant for the police will have increased by over 60 per cent. or over &pound;3.7 billion between 1997-98 and 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.807W.6/1">The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) undertakes a range of operational activity in order to fulfil its functions as defined in sections 2 and 3 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. As referred to in its latest annual report, SOCA's contribution to the UK Serious Organised Crime Control Strategy in the two years since it was formed has been:</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.6/2" class="indent">2006-07: 404 operations and projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.6/3" class="indent">2007-08: 459 operations and projects. In addition, as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> SOCA was undertaking 173 inquiries (single strand investigations).</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.6/4">Operations are multi-faceted and the activity is tailored to that which is most likely to have the greatest impact on harm at the time. During the lifetime of an operation a SOCA investigation may switch between a criminal investigation and an investigation that seeks to disrupt an individual, group, or criminal activity other than by way of a criminal investigation and vice versa, or it may look to prosecute some members of the group and use civil or other powers against others. SOCA does not therefore hold information on the number of separate criminal investigations within operations. Information on the number of arrests and convictions flowing from SOCA's work is set out in the SOCA annual report.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.6/5">Every SOCA tasked operation will include a financial element and criminal confiscation will be pursued where appropriate. Where SOCA has decided to take forward a criminal confiscation investigation in conjunction with a criminal investigation, these investigations are in persona e.g. against the person not in rem e.g. against the property.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.6/6">SOCA therefore does not measure each criminal investigation in terms of assets involved, but in terms of the criminal's benefit from their conduct.</p>

The NCEI is initially focusing on optimising data collection to enhance our understanding of the inequalities that exist; promoting research to fill gaps in the evidence; and spreading and sustaining good practice in NHS organisations. The NCEI has undertaken a good practice survey to identify current projects aiming to reduce inequalities in cancer care, including cancer screening.

The NHS Information Centre and the Yorkshire and Humber SHA have been asked to investigate this.<br/> <i> Small numbers:</i> To protect patient confidentiality, trusts with less than five deliveries have been removed. <i> Ungrossed data:</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Data quality:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Assessing growth through time:</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Coverage and data quality:</i> The maternity tail data coverage is not as complete as the rest of HES data. There are a number of reasons for the coverage and data quality issues such as:<br/> trusts submitting a significantly higher number of delivery episodes compared to birth episodes;<br/> trusts failing to submit data on the number of birth episodes where they record a high number of delivery episodes;<br/> trusts failing to submit delivery&mdash;the reason for this is that approximately 20 trusts have a standalone maternity system which is not linked to the Patient Administration System;<br/> trusts identifying a high number of maternity beds available, but not recording any information about deliveries or births;<br/> trusts identifying that they have no maternity beds available, but recording a high number of birth and delivery episodes; and<br/> some trusts have space in their maternity system to record nine birth tails, whereas other systems have space for 18. As deliveries, miscarriages and abortions are all recorded in the birth tail, there are cases where nine tails is not enough to record all of the relevant data . Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, coverage of hospital deliveries was 72.6 per cent. on average, whereas that of home deliveries was 13.6 per cent. on average. The incomplete coverage problem is significantly compounded by the data quality issues outlined above.<br/> <i> Finished Consultant Delivery Episode (FCE)</i>: A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes.<br/> Maternity events taking place in either NHS hospitals or in non-NHS hospitals funded by the NHS will be recorded as ordinary &quot;Delivery&quot; episodes.<br/> &quot;Other Delivery events&quot; are delivery events other than those resulting in delivery or birth episodes under NHS funding or in any other facility supplied under a service agreement with the NHS.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.820W.2/1">The key indicators that we use are the average number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) in children and the number of adults with no natural teeth. Information from the decennial national child dental health surveys shows that DMFT in 12-year-old children in England declined from 5.0 in 1973 to 0.7 in 2003, which means that children in this age group are among children with the best oral health in Europe. Meanwhile the adult surveys show that between in 1968 and 1998 the proportion of adults with no natural teeth fell from 37 per cent. to 11 per cent. However, we are not complacent. AH primary care trusts (PCTs) are required to undertake an assessment of the oral health needs of their populations to inform their commissioning of primary care dental services. In September 2007, we published 'Delivering Better Oral Health: An evidence-based toolkit for prevention', which provides practical, evidence-based guidance to help dental teams promote oral health and prevent dental disease. A copy has already been placed in the Library. During 2008, the Chief Dental Officer and other leading members of the dental profession contributed to three regional conferences for PCTs and dental care professionals on implementation of the toolkit. Also, through reforms made to the legislation governing the fluoridation of water, we have given communities with high levels of dental disease a real option of having their water fluoridated.</p>

Data Quality: Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens, any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.  <i> Source:</i>  The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.826W.5/1">Practices with extremely low or high rates, generally have small numbers of patients. For example, if there is only one patient and that patient is exception reported, then the rate will be 100 per cent. If that patient is not exception reported the rate will be 0 per cent. The highest exception rate for practices with substantial numbers of patients are almost always substantially below 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.826W.5/2">The exception rate for coronary heart disease (CHD) 8 for England in 2007-08 was 8.96 per cent. (compared with a rate of 5.26 per cent. across all indicators). The interquartile range of practice level exception rates for CHD 08 was 5.21 per cent. to 11.28 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.826W.5/3">There is evidence that some practices, whether in deprived or more affluent areas, are using exception reporting inappropriately. Manipulating quality and outcomes framework (QOF) data in order to increase rewards without delivering the required level of quality for patients is clearly unacceptable&mdash;and also unfair on the majority of practices who comply with QOF requirements. Primary care trusts are responsible for verifying evidence of achievement. They should analyse exception rates and recorded prevalence, investigating any outliers, correcting payments where necessary and taking action if they uncover any actual fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.826W.5/4">The Government are committed to ensuring in consultation with the profession, that QOF continually develops and supports leading edge quality of care for patients based on best available evidence. We will look at exception reporting and prevalence recording patterns as part of that process.</p>

	<p pid="c.827W.8/1">Departmental Directions, issued in September 2005 by authority of the Secretary of State for Health under section 17 of the National Health Service Act 1977 to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), specify that priority for transplants should be given to group 1 patients (mainly people ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or in countries with which the UK has reciprocal health arrangements) rather than group 2 (those not in group 1). Group 1 includes European Union residents. Group 2 patients are only entitled to an organ if there is no one in group 1 who is clinically suitable. It is the responsibility of the consultant registering each patient for transplant to confirm eligibility, and NHSBT and/or transplant centres are then responsible for ensuring organs are correctly allocated based on eligibility information supplied.</p>
	<p pid="c.827W.8/2">The transplantation of donated organs into non-UK EU residents who qualify for NHS treatment is guided by European law, which effectively regards such patients as having equal access to the NHS. Decisions over accepting a patient on to the transplant waiting list rests with the individual transplant centre. Article 3 of Regulation 1408/71 provides for equality of treatment under the regulation. Therefore health care should be provided in the UK to another European economic area national on the same basis as it would be to a UK national. Under EU Regulation 1408/71 a citizen of a member state can seek prior authorisation (via an E112) from their health authorities to go to another member state for planned state-sector treatment. The decision about whether to authorise a referral is a clinical one by that citizen's member state, taking into account factors such as whether undue delay applies or whether it is a specialist treatment that the home state cannot supply. The citizen's member state covers the cost of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="c.827W.8/3">Patients receiving transplants in the UK would normally receive organs from UK donors. The exception to this would be organs supplied from elsewhere in the EU under reciprocal arrangements which exist to offer organs to other member states if there is no clinically suitable patient in the member state of origin.</p>

	<p pid="c.834W.2/2">The UK Government do not make its own estimates of cause-specific mortality. The World Health Organisation (WHO) publishes information on cause-specific mortality for countries, regions and globally. The latest available estimates are for 2002 and show that an estimated 376,000 people drowned, making it the third leading cause of unintentional injury death globally after road traffic injuries and falls. These global burden of disease figures are an under-estimate of all drowning deaths, since they exclude drowning due to floods (cataclysms), boating and water transport. The vast majority (approximately 97 per cent.) of all drowning deaths occurred in low and middle-income countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.835W.9/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises the importance of biodiversity conservation to its poverty reduction efforts and continues to channel significant financial support to the sector through a range of mechanisms. DFID is responsible for UK contributions to the Global Environment Facility (GEF)&mdash;the financial mechanism of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In 2007-08 DFID provided &pound;35 million to the GEF&mdash;of which one-third is allocated to biodiversity conservation. DFID has Partnership Programme Agreements (PPAs) with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and International Institution of Environment and Development (IIED). In 2007-08 DFID provided &pound;3.699 million to WWF and &pound;1.793 million (2007-08) to IIED.</p>

	<p pid="c.835W.9/3">Other areas of our work that contribute indirectly to endangered species protection include our advice to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)&mdash;particularly on financing conservation, and on forest and fisheries governance.

	<p pid="c.839W.2/1">Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education (2006) makes clear that everyone in the education service should help keep children and young people safe. They should do this by identifying those who are suffering, or likely to suffer significant harm, and take appropriate action with the aim of making sure they are kept safe both at home an in the education setting.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/2">Through the school curriculum children are supported to develop their capacity to empathise, show respect and form positive relationships with other people. Schools have specifically reported less conflict, calmer classrooms and better relationships as a result. As part of the National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence the DCSF continues to work with the Home Office and in June 2008, new materials were launched specifically for schools and for young people to raise awareness of forced marriage. These were sent to all secondary schools, pupil referral units, local authorities and Local Safeguarding Children Boards.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.2/3">To support the most vulnerable children, including those whose childhood is being ruined by abuse of any kind, the DCSF is providing &pound;30 million to support the expansion and integration of the NSPCC's listening services. This money will allow the NSPCC to expand their services significantly so that more children can be given the advice and help that can be so important. The Government are also investing &pound;102.5 million over 2008-11 in the deployment of parent support advisers (PSAs) with over 1,500 PSAs and similar professionals currently working in schools. These professionals support families across a range of issues, which can include domestic abuse, and in particular focus on prevention and early intervention.</p>

	<p pid="c.840W.3/1">The 10-year drug strategy &quot;Protecting families and communities&quot;, published in February 2008, set out a series of steps to address the problems associated with young people's misuse of drugs, alcohol and volatile substances. The main action that has already been taken is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.3/2">A review of drug and alcohol education has taken place and, in response to its recommendations, in October 2008 Government committed to review existing guidance on the subject by September 2009 and to conduct an independent review of how its decision to make PSHE statutory status could be translated into a practical way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.3/3">To continue helping to prevent drug use among young people (11 to 18) by changing their attitudes and perceptions towards drugs and drug users, a new FRANK Cocaine campaign was launched in December 2008. Awareness of FRANK remains very high: in the latest tracking study (report July 2008) 83 per cent. of young people were aware of the campaign. This figure is unchanged from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.3/4">A cross-government working group has been set up, informing thinking for next Drug Strategy Action Plan, measuring impact of existing interventions with at risk families, identifying research priorities and informing the rollout of Think Family reforms at local level.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.3/5">The drug strategy committed to publish guidance to help the commissioning and delivery of treatment services with a greater focus on the needs of parents and families, and to that effect the National Treatment Agency (NTA) published carers' guidance in October 2008. The NTA will also shortly be publishing updated commissioning guidance for local partnerships which will include a specific section on commissioning appropriate services for parental drug users, including pregnant drug users. The document will also provide guidance to commissioners on supporting families around drug use and involving them in the commissioning system.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.3/6">To meet our commitment to provide intensive support to substance misusing parents through a range of recently established family interventions, targeting families at risk, the substance misuse agenda has been included in remit letter for local parenting support advisers; Family Pathfinder status has been awarded to 14 areas, one focussing on substance misuse; and, substance misuse has been included in the broad remit for parenting and early intervention projects. Furthermore, family intervention pilots (FIP) have been extended to 500 further families affected by substance misuse. NTA are working with DCSF in the development of the child poverty family intervention projects in 10 pilot areas during 2008-09. This will be rolled out to further areas in the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.3/7">To meet our commitment toward encouraging better take-up of free child care for three and four-year-olds (and two-year-olds in pilot areas) to improve access to treatment for parents, the NTA will be publishing family friendly treatment guidance for commissioners and providers in spring 2009. NTA is also continuously working on ensuring that parents seeking access to treatment are aware of free provision.</p>

	<p pid="c.841W.5/1">The Entry to Learning pilot programme was announced in the Children's Plan in December 2007. It builds on the successful work that is already done by innovative third sector and local authority funded provision in restoring the confidence and self-esteem of young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). The programme aims to improve young people's progression from this provision to more formal learning to ensure that they are able to advance and gain the skills and qualifications they need to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/2">Having developed the Entry to Learning programme with input from the Learning and Skills Council and a number of experienced third sector providers, we invited all local areas to express an interest in taking part in the pilot in July 2008. We received over 30 expressions of interest and selected four local areas for the first phase of the pilot: Brighton and Hove (with East Sussex), Birmingham, Sandwell and Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/3">Working closely with these areas and building on lessons from the Activity Agreement and Allowance Pilot, we developed a detailed specification for Entry to Learning to guide local areas as they developed their plans for implementing the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.5/4">Grant letters were issued to all four local areas in November 2008, formally beginning the pilots and allowing the local areas to recruit project managers for the programme. All four areas submitted detailed implementation plans, which were signed off by my Department in early December. The local teams are now engaged in delivery against these plans, recruiting the trusted adults who will support young people through this programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.842W.2/1">The family is fundamentally important to society and is where most individuals get the support they need to progress throughout their lives. The &quot;Children's Plan&quot; set out the Department's strategic direction for supporting families to ensure that children are given the best possible start in life. This includes empowering parents to make informed choices; helping families out of poverty, while maintaining a work life balance for parents and families; supporting strong couple relationships; increasing the availability of parenting programmes and support to help parents improve their ability to be effective parents; and providing support to families who are struggling or where parental problems (such as drug abuse or mental health) get in the way of positive parenting to get the family back on track.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.2/2">The &quot;Children's Plan One Year On&quot; set out recent progress towards these aims. This includes refocusing efforts to ensure that every local authority now has a parenting strategy which set out how services are available across a continuum of need from universal services through to very targeted interventions for the most vulnerable families; ensuring that the workforce understands the value of parental engagement and the specific role they can and should play; and introducing a single commissioner to lead on developing local services for parents. We have also recently announced extra support for separating parents and their children to cope better with the impact of parental separation and conflict. The Government have also made significant progress in tackling child poverty and supporting working parents through flexible working, extended maternity leave entitlement and the introduction of paternity leave.</p>

	<p pid="c.843W.8/1">Figures collected by Connexions services show that 94.2 per cent. of 16-year-olds who completed compulsory education in 2008 said that they wanted to remain in learning, and received an offer under the September Guarantee. This is an increase from 91.8 per cent. in 2007, the first year of the Guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="c.843W.8/2">The Guarantee was extended to 17-year-olds in 2008, and almost 80 per cent. of those who had been engaged on a short course or who were not in education, employment or training (NEET), also received an offer.</p>
	<p pid="c.843W.8/3">Statistics on the proportion of young people participating in learning, or who are NEET, are published annually by DCSF. The proportion of 16-year-olds in learning has risen steadily over the last seven years, with an acceleration in 2007 when the September Guarantee was first introduced. It is not possible to separate out the effects of the Guarantee from other factors, but feedback from local areas suggests that it had a significant impact on supporting this improvement. 2008 participation and NEET statistics are due to be published in June 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.843W.8/4">Successful delivery of the Guarantee is a key step towards preparing local authorities, and their partners, for the raising of the age at which young people will participate in education or training to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015.</p>

	<p pid="c.852W.2/1">The Youth Alcohol Action Plan (YAAP) published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase> set out a comprehensive approach to address the problems associated with young people's alcohol consumption. The key steps that have already been taken are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.852W.2/2">Antisocial behaviour and violent crime related to outdoor drinking by young people is being tackled through the introduction of a number of new initiatives through the Policing and Crime Bill announced in the Queen's Speech in December 2008. Subject to parliamentary approval, this would include the introduction of a new offence of persistently possessing alcohol in a public place by under 18s; increasing the penalty for the offence of consuming alcohol in a designated public place; ensuring that when police confiscate alcohol from under 18s that they also take a record of their name and address and if they are under 16, remove them to a place of safety; and by lowering the age for direction to individuals who represent a risk of disorder powers, so that police can now disperse groups of under 16s.</p>
	<p pid="c.852W.2/3">The Policing and Crime Bill also would introduce a mandatory code for the alcohol retail industry which will include further action to reduce underage sales; and the offence of selling alcohol to children would be changed from on three or more to two or more different occasions. The Home Office has provided funding to encourage greater take-up and acceptance of the proof of age standards scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.852W.2/4">We committed to ensuring that parents were made to be responsible for their children's alcohol related antisocial behaviour, with greater use of acceptable behaviour contracts and parenting contracts. The Home Office will shortly be launching a series of practitioner training workshops to improve the skills of frontline practitioners on the tools and powers at their disposal to tackle alcohol-related harms, which will be followed up by revised guidance to the police, health and children's services in all local areas to strengthen their approach to dealing with young people drinking in public places.</p>
	<p pid="c.852W.2/5">Targeted work on reducing the harm arising from young people's substance misuse, of which alcohol plays a part particularly with vulnerable young people, is being taken forward through actions set out in the drug strategy, &quot;Drugs: Protecting Families and Communities&quot; (published in February 2008). This includes improving the specialist treatment available to those under 18s with substance misuse problems, with alcohol dependency the main factor in over 1/3 of all those currently being helped; ensuring a focus on identifying problems early through children's services, including where a child is affected by parental alcohol misuse; and supporting the most vulnerable young people through targeted youth support and substance misuse workers in all youth offending teams. To target families at risk, family intervention pilots (FIP) have been extended to 500 further families affected by substance misuse including alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="c.852W.2/6">Furthermore, Government have committed to ensuring that young people and their parents are provided with appropriate information to prevent them from suffering from the risks of alcohol use. We will shortly be issuing guidance from the Chief Medical Officer what consists responsible drinking, and we expect to consult with parents and young people on what information and advice they would find useful to their decisions about young people's drinking and to help reduce harms caused by it. We anticipate that consultation on the information and advice will form part of a wider social marketing campaign on young people's drinking.</p>
	<p pid="c.852W.2/7">A review of drug and alcohol education has taken place and, in response to its recommendations, in October 2008 Government committed to review existing guidance on the subject by September 2009 and to conduct an independent review of how its decision to make PSHE statutory status can be translated into a practical way forward.</p>

	<p pid="c.855W.3/1">As I referred to in the answer I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-26">26 November 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-11-26.2138"><i> Official Report</i>, column 2138W</phrase>, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has substantially increased the level of resources devoted to addressing climate change. We do not intend to alter this approach following the creation of the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Addressing climate change continues to be a top priority for the Foreign Office and is a key part of Departmental Strategic Objective (DSO) 7.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.3/2">The distribution of the new locally-engaged staff and UK-based diplomats to which I referred in my previous answer will be in line with FCO priority countries for HMG's objectives on climate change. These are: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey and the USA. The newly recruited staff are located in: Caracas, Bogota, Lima, Brasilia, Vancouver, Ottawa, Santiago, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, La Paz, Washington and across the US network, New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Beijing and across the China network, Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpar, Bangkok, Manila, Tokyo, Seoul, Pretoria, Cape Town, Berlin, Rome and Warsaw. UK-based diplomats have been recruited at grades SMS, D6 and C4. The newly recruited staff have a range of responsibilities which vary depending on the climate change and energy priorities of the mission in which they are based. These priorities are set out in each mission's business plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.3/3">Members of DECC sit on the FCO's DSO 7 programme board and the Strategic Programme Fund Board, while the FCO sits on the cross-Whitehall International Climate Change and Energy Board, which is chaired by DECC. The International Strategy and Campaigns Unit (ISCU) was also created in early 2008 to co-ordinate HMG policy on aspects of climate change policy. The UK Government are critically aware of the need to ensure our climate change and energy policies are developed and delivered in a coherent manner.</p>
