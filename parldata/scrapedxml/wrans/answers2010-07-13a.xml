	<p pid="a.602W.0/1">Under the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s Food Supply contract the prime contractor, Purple Food Service Solutions, sources the majority of pig meat products from British suppliers, although bacon is currently sourced from other EU suppliers. This is because when the requirement was originally competed in accordance with EU and MOD procurement regulations British suppliers were unable to demonstrate sufficient value for money for supplying bacon.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.0/2">While no specific discussions about the terms of the Food Supply contract have been held with officials from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), informal discussions about the sourcing of bacon from non-UK sources have taken place during regular and routine meetings held between MOD and other Government Departments, including DEFRA. These discussions are aimed at assisting British companies to better compete for MOD food contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.609W.11/1">There are two routes commonly taken by school parties wishing to visit Parliament. They may either contact Parliament's Education Service directly to book onto its regular visit and workshop programme, or contact their constituency MP who can sponsor a tour organised through the Central Tours Office (CTO). Both services are heavily oversubscribed.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.11/2">Member-sponsored tours take place when Parliament is sitting. The CTO opens booking for Member-sponsored tours six months in advance; the number of tours available is limited by the sitting times of both Houses. Currently, there is some availability in October, November and December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.11/3">Education Service visits to Parliament are booked in advance on a term by term basis; schools book direct with the Education Service and are used to this practice. All available visits generally book up on the day they are released. Visits between April and July 2010 were booked in January 2010, and visits between September and December 2010 were booked in April 2010. There are currently over 16,000 young people with confirmed bookings for education visits in the remainder of 2010. The next booking date is <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-06">6 October 2010</phrase>, when places on the visit programme between January and March 2011 will become available. The bookings line number is 0207 219 4496. Full details of the education visits programme and the booking process can be found on the Education Service website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.609W.11/5">Unfortunately, with the accommodation currently available to the Education Service, it cannot meet the existing demand from schools, despite the substantial increase in capacity in recent years (up from 11,000 in 2005-06 to 40,000 in 2009-10). In the last Parliament, the House of Commons Administration Committee's report &quot;Improving Facilities for Educational Visitors to Parliament&quot; published in April 2007, recommended that a dedicated space for school visitors should be provided, and this is now in the Works programme. It is envisaged that the planned Education Centre would allow an increase in the number of places available on education visits to 100,000 per year from 2013.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.2/2">In addition, all officers at our overseas Posts have access to an online anti-corruption toolkit. This offers a wide range of guidance on dealing with bribery and corruption while overseas. It includes sections on:</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/3" class="indent">UK legislation relating to bribery and corruption,</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/4" class="indent">how, when and to whom officers should report allegations or suspicions of bribery or corruption by UK businesses or individuals,</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/5" class="indent">how to deal with allegations of corruption by UK officials,</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/6" class="indent">encouraging reporting by members of UK companies or organisations overseas, and</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/7" class="indent">advice to business.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/8">The advice to business section includes guidance for officers on how to advise UK companies on managing the risks of overseas corruption, including best practice on key issues such as:</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/9" class="indent">bribe solicitation, extortion and duress,</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/10" class="indent">so-called 'facilitation payments',</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/11" class="indent">gifts and hospitality,</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/12" class="indent">third party partners, and</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/13" class="indent">a list of additional resources companies can refer to on bribery and corruption issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/14">A standard script for business is included in this section, giving details of sources of further support and guidance for businesses concerned about bribery and corruption issues as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/15">An annual e-gram on bribery and corruption is sent to all our Posts, for the attention of all officers, outlining the current UK law, officers' obligations under the law, and sources of support and information available to them and to businesses. This e-gram also forms part of the anti-corruption toolkit.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/16">With the exception of the script for business, the toolkit and other documents mentioned have been designed for use by Foreign and Commonwealth and UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) officers. It is not therefore appropriate to place them in the Library, but I would be happy to forward a copy to you for your personal information if you so wished.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/17">Further information is available to both officers and businesses through the Overseas Security Information for Business service, hosted by the UKTI website. This provides UK business with country-specific information relating to the security related risks, including bribery and corruption risks, which companies face when operating overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/18" class="italic"> Script f or Business</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/19">Foreign bribery is a business risk that needs to be actively managed, like fraud or embezzlement. Corruption adds up to 10% to the total cost of doing business globally, and up to 25% to the cost of procurement contracts in developing countries. Moving business from a country with low corruption levels to a country with medium or high corruption levels is found to add costs equivalent to a 20% tax on foreign business.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/20">There are a lot of useful, free resources available to help businesses manage this risk. For example, as part of the Government's efforts to support business integrity, the UK is funding the Business Anti-Corruption Portal, which is of particular use to Small and Medium Enterprises<sup>(1)</sup>, providing summaries of international studies and knowledge about particularly exposed markets, sectors and regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/21">One of the first steps in managing the risk of bribery is for a company to implement a robust anti-bribery policy through training and disciplinary procedures. A clear and consistent message from the top is the essential core of successful anti-corruption policy, backed up by a robust internal audit programme. Recent enforcement action against UK companies has demonstrated that companies need to look beyond written corporate policy, to ensure effective implementation and monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/22">There are a number of business guides for designing and implementing an anti-corruption policy, such as Transparency International's Business Principles<sup>(2)</sup> and the International Chamber of Commerce's Rules of Conduct<sup>(3)</sup>. A number of industry sectors have also developed sector specific guides, specialist codes of practice and transparent procurement agreements<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/23">UK exporters and investors should also ensure that their management control systems meet international standards for anti-corruption. The Government encourages UK businesses to follow the voluntary OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises<sup>(5)</sup>, which includes specific anti-corruption guidelines. Companies should also consider additional due diligence when engaging foreign agents or operating in weak governance zones<sup>(6)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.2/24">The Government is aware that petty corruption and bribe solicitation remain a problem for UK exporters and overseas investors. The best defence against bribe solicitation and demands for 'facilitation payments' is good preparation and participation in local integrity pacts or other anti-corruption initiatives. There is also a growing body of specialised anti-corruption risk management for these problems, including international initiatives such as RESIST<sup>(7)</sup> (Resisting Extortion and Solicitation in International Transactions).</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.3/1">The Department for Transport has not made any estimate of the value of savings attributed to the prevention of road death and injury at specific speed camera sites. However, the Department's guidance does recommend that speed and collision data are collected by road safety partnerships and the contribution cameras make to casualty reduction monitored and reviewed, at least annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/2">The Department has estimated that the camera sites included in the former national safety camera programme have together been saving approximately &#163;400 million per year of casualty and accident costs since 2007. This estimate is based on the findings of the 'National Safety Camera Programme: Four Year Evaluation Report' (PA Consulting and University College London, December 2005), with some assumptions about how casualty savings have reduced since, for example due to reductions in casualty levels for other reasons. It includes savings at both speed and red light camera sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/3">The Department's latest estimates of the annual cost to the UK economy of road accidents are published in Reported Road Casualties Great Britain (RRCGB): 2008 Annual Report, on page 28, table 2c.

A formal response was published in January 2008 entitled 'Better Outcomes: The Way Forward-Improving the Care of Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children'.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.0/2">Although not pursuing a formal consultation, the UK Border Agency is in regular and frequent discussion with its partners on improvements to policy and process around dealing with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. For example, a number of children's charities and refugee groups have recently been asked to review proposed amendments to the Processing an Asylum Application from a Child instruction to reflect changes in policy to remove some unaccompanied children to their country of origin where adequate reception arrangements are in place. In circumstances like this, comments and recommendations from partners will be factored into the revised instruction rather than being the subject of a formal response to consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.649W.3/2">The analysis that underpins various Government policies to reduce carbon emissions includes an assessment of carbon cost-effectiveness<sup>(1)</sup>. Carbon cost-effectiveness analysis provides an estimate of the net social cost per tonne of CO2 reduction resulting from a policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.3/3">In the last Administration's March strategy on household energy management it was estimated that cavity wall insulation has a carbon cost of &#163;48/tCO2 (it saves money rather than costs money). Further detail can be found in Annex 2 of the Initial Assessment of Impacts at:</p>

	<p pid="a.649W.3/5">For the recently introduced Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) scheme, the estimated average carbon cost is in the region of &#163;460/tCO2, estimated over the period 2010-30. Further detail can be found on page 27 of the published Impact Assessment at:</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.3/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/consultations/elec_financial/elec_financial.asp">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/consultations/elec_financial/elec_financial.asp</a>x</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.3/7">However, as the impact assessment makes clear, there are benefits of the policy (such as community engagement) that are not monetised and are therefore not included in this figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.3/8">The calculation of the &quot;&#163;/tCO2&quot; metric needs to be caveated because it relies on forecasts of the specific mix of low carbon energy (technology type and scale) that will be incentivised under FITs and on projected technology costs through time which in reality will be uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.3/9">Similarly the projected carbon costs effectiveness of renewable heat measures published in the Renewable Heat Incentive Consultation Impact Assessment is estimated at &#163;57/tCO2 for measures installed in the traded sector and &#163;75/tCO2 for measures in the non-traded sector. These values represent average lifetime (2010-45) cost effectiveness across different range of measures and fossil displacement assumptions. Further detail can be found on page 20 of the published Impact Assessment at:</p>

	<p pid="a.649W.3/11">It should be noted that the estimated carbon cost effectiveness values are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the underlying calculation. However the values do highlight the general ranking/impact of the different options.</p>

In 2006 the amendment to Part L was expected to last for five years. As SAP is frozen for the period the amendment is in force it was, therefore, necessary to set the carbon dioxide emission factor for electricity based on a projected level of decarbonisation for five years. Government's decarbonisation projections, based on an average value, were used for this purpose. The same procedure was used to determine the factor listed in SAP 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.9/1">There are no estimates of the effects of participation by businesses in the CRC scheme on numbers of jobs. However, by 2020 we estimate that the scheme will save participants around &#163;1 billion per year through cost effective energy efficiency measures. This money could be used to sustain or create jobs but that will be a decision for participants. In addition the increased demand for energy efficiency advice and installation of equipment together with wider Government energy efficiency measures will stimulate opportunities the energy efficiency sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.2/1">The final impact assessment on the CRC Energy Efficiency scheme published on 19<sup>( )</sup>January 2010 by the previous Administration contained a small firms impact test. The impact test concluded that, based on current energy prices, organisations with annual electricity bills below around &#163;0.75 million were unlikely to meet the scheme's 6,000 MWh qualification threshold. As such, smaller organisations below this threshold are exempt from participation in the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.5/1">While no targets have been set for household energy saving for 2050, it is clear that we will need wholesale and radical changes to the energy performance of our housing stock in future. The new Green Deal initiative will help us achieve, or exceed, the binding targets for carbon reductions set during the previous Administration and will set us on the path for the long-term changes that are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.5/2">Under the Green Deal we will introduce a new finance package to make it as easy and attractive as possible for householders to lag their lofts, fill wall cavities, and take further steps to reduce their use of energy in the home. Households will be able to install not only the basic cavity and loft insulation measures, but go further to provide comprehensive packages for households that can deliver real energy, money and carbon savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.652W.6/1">I am today placing in the Libraries of the House copies of three reports for my Department by P&#246;yry Energy Consulting on aspects of security of gas supply. They concern:</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/2" class="indent">&quot;GB Gas Security of Supply &amp; Options for Improvement&quot; (March 2010);</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/3" class="indent">&quot;Security of Gas Supply: European Scenarios, Policy Drivers and Impact on GB&quot; (June 2010);</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/4" class="indent">&quot;Global Gas and LNG Markets &amp; GB's Security of Supply&quot; (June 2010).</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/5">These paint a broadly benign picture of the outlook for security of gas supply into Great Britain in the years ahead. In a central scenario, with falling gas demand in the UK and where central assumptions on gas supply and demand in the rest of the world are met, GB's gas market is robust to a wide range of shocks. Many such scenarios would not require voluntary gas supply interruptions or lead to gas supply shortages.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/6">However, the outlook is not risk-free. The reports indicate the following conclusions:</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/7" class="indent">demand levels for gas are important: whereas the GB gas market is robust to a wide range of shocks provided that gas demand is falling over time (largely driven by the promotion of energy efficiency), in circumstances where UK or EU gas demand is higher than expected, the GB gas market becomes more vulnerable;</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/8" class="indent">while the risks of &quot;voluntary&quot; gas supply interruptions, and of gas supply shortages, are low, they are not negligible: there are potential scenarios, in the not-too-distant future, where voluntary interruptions would be required;</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/9" class="indent">even in those scenarios where gas supply is fully maintained, i.e. without voluntary gas supply interruptions or gas supply shortages, the wholesale gas price in the GB market could reach very high levels: P&#246;yry identify circumstances where the wholesale price could increase to 90 - 220 p/therm.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/10">Ofgem's work on &quot;Project Discovery&quot; has also indicated that there are scenarios where the security of our gas supply could be severely tested.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/11">It is important, in the interests of GB gas consumers, that, so far as feasible, these risks are managed. This reinforces the national need for additional gas supply infrastructure. There may also be a case for adjustment to the regulatory framework, to improve gas market operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/12">The coalition agreement commits the Government to ensuring that our energy markets deliver security of supply. We shall take full account of the present reports in our current consideration of potential legislative measures for inclusion in the Energy Security and Green Economy Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.654W.2/1">The Government are committed to an ambitious agenda on renewable heat. Analysis by DECC has suggested that under one scenario in which the UK meets its target for 15% of total energy to come from renewable sources by 2020, around 12% of UK heat demand could be met by renewable heat. As of 2007 only around 1.1 % of UK heat demand was met from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.654W.2/2">The Government are therefore committed to tackling the financial and non-financial barriers faced by the renewable heat sector. In particular we are currently looking closely at the renewable heat incentive (RHI) proposals. We will look to make an announcement on the future of the proposed RHI scheme as soon as possible.</p>

From the information gathered, HMRC is able to tackle avoidance through operational work, identify where legislation could be strengthened to reduce the risk of avoidance, and evaluate the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.2/4">HMRC estimate that the overall tax gap was &#163;40 billion in 2007-08. This estimate and the underlying methodology was published in &quot;Measuring Tax Gaps 2009&quot;, available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.660W.2/9">which attributed the tax gap, using management assumptions, to the different behaviours driving it. Avoidance was estimated to account for 17.5% of the total tax gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.2/10">Previously, in March 2008 HMRC published details of analysis from 2005 that attempted to derive broad-brush estimates of the direct tax gap at the start of the decade:</p>

	<p pid="a.706W.2/1">It is not policy that organisations in receipt of funding from the Department should refrain from lobbying the Department. Anyone, including the public, can lobby hon. Members and peers; this is part of the relationship between the state and its citizens in a democracy. The Department funds around &#163;115 billion of resources for health and social care (in England) and we expect to discuss and debate the policies for which these funds are allocated with stakeholders and the manner in which valuable front line services are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.706W.2/2">Voluntary organisations, community groups and social enterprises across the country do extraordinary work every day to improve the lives of others. One of the key principles of the 'Compact on the Relations between Government and the Third Sector in England' is to recognise and support the independence of the third sector; including the right within the law to campaign, to comment on and to challenge Government policy (whatever funding relationship exists). To ensure that we can make the most of the sector's potential, an open, honest and transparent relationship with the Department is essential.</p>

This has been evaluated and the programme is planning to continue and extend this work.
