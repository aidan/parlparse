	<p pid="b.620W.0/11">Where a payment is still outstanding, this will usually be because there is a flag on the IT system which is preventing it from being processed. There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. For example, there may be outstanding issues arising from a compliance monitoring inspection or from cross-checks against land parcel data held on the rural land register, both of which we are required to carry out in order to demonstrate our ability to comply with EC Regulations. Delays may also be caused by one of a number of IT-related problems such as the agreement being under amendment, data integrity issues or invalid agreement holder details. However, in all these circumstances, officials make every effort to resolve the issues delaying payments as quickly as possible.</p>

By June 2003, immunisation services were available in all districts, and post war, more than 750,000 children under five years were vaccinated in catch-up campaigns. Funds enabled health teams to trace 34,000 immunisation drop-out children in Basra, Dhi Qar and Muthanna governorates.

Since 2003, UNICEF programmes (undertaken by the Iraq Ministry of Health with the assistance of US AID and WHO) have supported eight immunisation rounds, with each covering on average 4.7 million children under five years of age. Measles control activities have also been effectively implemented, with a 91 per cent. reduction in reported cases in 2005 and the first seven months of 2006 compared with 2004. Iraq is polio free for the sixth consecutive year.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.3/3">Immunisation coverage in Iraq rose from 60 per cent. in 2003 to 83 per cent. in 2005, largely owing to UNICEF (and World Health Organisation) programmes. Figures are not available for the numbers of children vaccinated on an annual basis.</p>

In 2006-07 Lancashire local authority received a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocation of &pound;606.9 million and revenue grants of &pound;114.9 million&mdash;a total of &pound;721.8 million to fund the education of nursery, primary and secondary school aged pupils.</p>

	<p pid="b.629W.3/1">The Romford constituency falls within the local authority of Havering and the information supplied is the level of funding which applies to all of Havering. In 2006-07 for Havering local authority, the Department allocated a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) of &pound;133.8 million and revenue grants of &pound;22.8 million, totalling &pound;156.6 million to fund education in the area. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, it is not possible to split the DSG allocation between primary and secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.3/2">The 2006-07 DSG figure is not on the same basis as the &pound;160.2 million that Havering received in 2005-06 under Education Formula Spending plus revenue grants.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.3/3">It is for Havering&mdash;in consultation with its school forum&mdash;to distribute its DSG and Standards Fund grants to the schools it maintains. However, it is expected that local authorities will take account of the priorities that Ministers identified within the DSG envelope (personalised learning at Key Stage 3, personalised learning in primary schools, more practical learning options for pupils aged 14 to 16, implementing planning, preparation and assessment in primary schools and increased entitlement to free early years provision). The distribution of School Standards Grant and School Standards Grant (Personalisation) is determined centrally and set out in the conditions of grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.3/4">Guidelines for the distribution of the DSG are contained in the Department's Technical Note and the &quot;Setting School Budgets 2006-07 and 2007-08: guidance note for LAs and School Forums&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.3/5">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) took responsibility for funding of school sixth forms in April 2002. In 2006/07, the total funding allocation for schools sixth forms in Havering local authority was &pound;6.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.3/6">The LSC is responsible for funding post-16 education and training more widely, so in addition to the funding for school sixth forms the LSC funds colleges and other providers to deliver further education and training to young people and adults in the Havering local authority area.

	<p pid="b.629W.3/8">A copy of this document has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.3/9">In October 2005 we set out our post-16 funding strategy for 2006-07 and 2007-08 in &quot;Priorities for Success&quot; which was published by the LSC. The strategy clearly set out our funding priorities, which included supporting higher participation among young people and helping disadvantaged adults to gain basic and Level 2 employability skills. The strategy was updated in the LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities, published in October 2006.</p>

The Code of Practice makes clear that it is in the interests of all concerned that statutory assessments should be carried out in a timely manner. It is therefore important that each part of that process is conducted with all reasonable speed. This would include input from educational psychologists (EPs).</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.5/1">In 2006-07 support has been given to two projects which help secondary teachers to focus on engaging pupils in their musical learning and so raise standards. These projects are the Secondary Strategy's Key Stage 3 music professional development programme, which received &pound;255,000 of funding support, and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation's Musical Futures project, which received &pound;145,000 of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.5/2">At the request of Government, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is carrying out a review of the secondary curriculum to reduce prescription, improve coherence and create further opportunities for schools to meet the needs of all their pupils. This will build on the increased engagement created by the above projects. A formal consultation on the new secondary curriculum will begin on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February 2007</phrase>. Revised programmes of study will be available to schools for planning purposes in September 2007, with implementation beginning in September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.5/3">In total we have invested over &pound;500 million in music education between 1999 and 2008 and &pound;95 million will be invested in 2007-08 alone, which includes &pound;10 million primarily to boost school singing. The focus of this funding has been on improving access to instrumental and vocal tuition for primary school pupils, which evidence shows to be the time to make the greatest impact on musical take-up. In the future secondary school pupils will have benefited from the &pound;10 million investment in primary schools announced earlier this month.</p>

	<p pid="b.640W.4/1">The Electoral Commission informs me that it has conducted no specific research on this issue. However, as part of its regulatory oversight of party finances, the Commission periodically requests details from all political party accounting units of their income and expenditure to enable it to check that every unit required by law to submit its accounts to the Commission is doing so. The Commission also, for the same purpose, regularly cross-checks information about donations accepted by accounting units against records of accounts submitted.</p>

	<p pid="b.644W.5/1">The proposals contained in the White Paper, &quot;Personal accounts: a new way to save&quot; present a significant opportunity to the financial services industry, including pension providers. As a result of automatic enrolment, pension schemes and providers in the existing employer-sponsored arena will see an increase in membership and contributions. The personal accounts scheme will be delivered by the private sector creating competition for new contracts for administration and fund management services. It is estimated that the reforms will result in an annual increase in household saving of &pound;4 to 5 billion a year, and in the long term the personal accounts scheme will have between &pound;100 billion and &pound;200 billion in funds under management.</p>

	<p pid="b.652W.8/1">Before the financial assistance scheme is able to start processing applications for individual scheme members, the pension scheme has to complete the notification and qualification processes. These involve the trustees and administrators providing basic scheme information to the FAS Operational Unit. They then have six months to provide data on individual members before a notice requiring provision of this information can be issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.8/2">'Notification' of a scheme occurs when trustees or members formally notify the FAS of their scheme's basic details, after which a scheme can then be considered for FAS qualification. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-29">29 December 2006</phrase>, the average time taken (since FAS operations started in September 2005) from 'notification' of a scheme to the date of the first payment to a member of the scheme was 190 working days.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.8/3">Within this period, the average time taken (over the last 12 months) by the FAS Operational Unit from first receipt from the trustees or administrators of member data to the date of the first payment to a member of the scheme was 24 working days.</p>

	<p pid="b.660W.5/1">We provided an estimate of the overall costs of setting up a personal accounts scheme in &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system: Regulatory impact assessments and technical appendices&quot;. As part of our commercial and procurement process we are engaging with the financial services sector and other organisations to help estimate costs. However, current estimates are necessarily subject to change at this stage. We will be refining our estimate working with the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, and firm estimates will not be available until later in the procurement process. In order to reduce costs and delivery risk we expect suppliers to re-use existing systems, where practicable, in delivering the Personal Accounts service; therefore their engagement in the cost estimating process is essential.</p>

	<p pid="b.661W.0/1">Figures from the Family Resources Survey show that there are relatively few individuals, an estimated 330,000, who have multiple jobs, earn more than &pound;5,000 per year and are not currently contributing to a private pension. Analyses of such small groups using the FRS sample are not robust enough for publication, but can be used to provide broad indications of the characteristics of individuals within the group. Further analysis using the main longitudinal surveys is not possible as sample sizes are smaller than for the Family Resources Survey, increasing the risk that individuals within the sample will be unrepresentative of the overall group.</p>
	<p pid="b.661W.0/2">The following table shows an analysis of the individuals from the 2004-05 Family Resources Survey with multiple jobs who earn more than &pound;5,000 per year and are not currently contributing to a private pension, by age band and employment status. Although these figures do not provide firm evidence of the employment patterns of a group of individuals over the course of their working lives, they show considerable variation across different age groups, providing some indicative evidence that the characteristics of the group vary at different points of the working life, and suggesting that the majority of individuals currently in multiple jobs are unlikely to remain in multiple jobs throughout their working life.</p>

Separately, UN Security Council resolutions 1718 and 1737 contain country specific proliferation finance elements. These elements aim to disrupt the transfer of material and technology, which could contribute to the weapons of mass destruction and missile programmes of North Korea and Iran respectively. The use of financial measures could be a powerful tool in rolling back programmes of concern.</p>

	<p pid="b.669W.2/1">This decision is deeply disappointing and will only increase international concern. If Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful, as the Iranians claim, then it is in Iran's interests to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to resolve outstanding issues. Barring so many inspectors from the country will hardly help.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.2/2">The IAEA has asked Iran to reconsider the decision. But the IAEA has also said that even if Iran does not, 'there are a sufficient number of inspectors designated for Iran and the IAEA is able to perform its inspection activities'. Iran has a legally binding obligation under United Nations Security Council resolution 1737 to provide 'such access and co-operation as the IAEA requests' to verify suspension and clarify outstanding issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.670W.3/2">The Secretary of State for the Home Department Office has received reports of the difficulties that Iraqi business and other Iraqi travellers state they face in obtaining Iraqi travel documents. The Home Office is charged with maintaining the security of the UK border and the integrity of UK border control. The responsibility for issuing travel documents to Iraqi nationals rests with the Iraqi authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.3/3">The Iraqi authorities issue a number of travel documents, some of which are universally accepted abroad, others of which are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.3/4">The Iraqi S-series passport, originally introduced by the Interim Iraqi Government in 2004, may be used for travel to many countries in the immediate region and beyond and is available from regional offices in Iraq. However, the document is of poor quality with a lack of security features, making it highly vulnerable to counterfeiting or alteration. For that reason, acceptance of the S-series passport for travel to the United Kingdom was phased out between <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase>. There are no plans to reverse or review this decision which would open the UK to immigration abuse. The S-series is also not accepted by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland and the USA.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.3/5">The new G-series passport, issued from April 2006, includes modern security features and is acceptable for travel to the UK. In Iraq, the G-series is issued in Baghdad only but it can also be applied for at Iraqi missions abroad, including in London. There are also the N-series and H-series Iraqi passports. These are no longer issued but are acceptable for travel to the UK within their stated validity if issued prior to <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March 2003</phrase> or if issued or revalidated after that date by the Coalition Provisional Authority or (in the case of the H-series only) by the Iraqi Interim Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

It is essential that both sides commit to the cease-fire agreement and demonstrate this by acting to stop the violence, human rights abuses and bloodshed. The only viable route to a peaceful resolution of the Sri Lanka conflict is at the negotiating table. We fully support the role of the Norwegian Government in facilitating negotiations in furtherance of the peace process.</p>

Those who fail to re-tax are identified from the DVLA record and issued with a penalty notice.

	<p pid="b.681W.2/5" class="indent">Doubled the capacity of its wheel clamping operation from 50,000 to 100,000 per annum;</p>

	<p pid="b.692W.0/2">The MOD is currently investigating recycling used cooking oils as bio-diesel. No such fuel has yet been produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.0/3">At present cooking oils are disposed of from MOD sites locally, usually through multi-activity contracts. Costs associated with such disposal activity are not routinely recorded but are estimated to be in the region of &pound;100,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.0/4">The MOD disposes of used fuel oils via a specialist contractor for onward sale for use as marine diesel, for use in the domestic heating market or disposed of as incinerator fuel. Over 4,500 tonnes of fuel oil has been disposed of in the past six months in this way. Under the terms of the contract the MOD receives a percentage of the revenue generated and there is therefore no net cost to the Department from this disposal activity.</p>

	<p pid="b.694W.9/3">The Home Secretary rejected this proposal in his response to the Race Monitor's annual report 2005-06 in November 2006, which is published on the same webpage. However, he indicated that we were considering a new approach to the substantive asylum interview to allow the claimant's legal adviser to play a more significant role. To this end we are currently piloting and evaluating an approach in Solihull which encourages legal representatives to work with the case owner to ensure all relevant evidence is correctly identified and taken into account before the asylum decision is made.</p>

	<p pid="b.706W.2/1">Under Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, where an agency employs migrants and provides their services to a user, then it is the responsibility of the agency to check and record specified documents belonging to those employees. Where an employment agency is simply recruiting people to be employed by a client, then it is the client's responsibility to carry out those checks.</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.2/2">IND investigates allegations of illegal working nationwide by adopting an intelligence-led approach and adapting resources, where appropriate, to carry out specific operations that will yield the greatest results. Compliance with our immigration laws will continue to be enforced in order to remove the most potentially harmful people first.</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.2/3">Work permits are only issued to employers that have a clear responsibility for determining the duties and functions of the post. Consequently, work permits are not issued to agencies where they are employing a person solely to provide that person's services to another employer. This restriction also applies when the employment would be supplementary to a job for which a work permit has been issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.2/4">The Work Permits (UK) Compliance Team undertake checks on employers, who may have used agencies to find their staff, to ensure that they are complying with the work permit arrangements. This includes checking that the information about the employer and job is accurate and that the offer of employment is genuine.</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.2/5">Checks can be carried out at any time during the application process or during the validity of the work permit. If minor discrepancies are found, employers are required to make appropriate adjustments in order to comply with work permit rules. However, where there is non-compliance and information cannot be verified, the compliance team will revoke the work permit permission and consequently curtail the leave that the migrant has to remain in the UK.</p>

The council's proposal to the panel estimated that a new casino would result directly in between 200 and 400 full-time equivalent jobs. No seasonal figures were submitted with the proposal, though it was anticipated that a new casino would support the objective of increasing year round employment in Torbay.</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.0/1">Representatives of the Nottinghamshire Local Criminal Justice Board have visited a number of buildings put forward by the Nottingham city council to assess their suitability for use as a criminal court. That assessment was intended to enable the board to decide whether the building could, with or without modification, meet minimum requirements. These include minimum health and safety standards to ensure the safety and security of court users, judiciary and other visitors to the building; compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act; and separate rooms to enable solicitors to take instructions from their clients.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/2">In addition to this, each of these buildings is used by many other organisations including cr&egrave;ches and youth groups and they are used as meeting places for older people. The board therefore recognises that even after identifying a building which has some potential for use as a court, the community users must be engaged in discussion before any final decision is made. If this involves alteration of the building, such alterations must be carried out in a way which does not adversely affect the other uses of these amenities.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/3">Accordingly, the board is making careful assessments of all the premises identified for consideration and being sensitive to the needs of existing users. It is committed to finding a suitable community building for these sittings as soon as possible and will work with the city council to achieve this. In the meantime, these cases will commence being heard at the magistrates court in May.</p>

	<p pid="b.719W.3/1">National health service patient address and other demographic information has historically been compiled in individual local records held by general practitioners and hospitals. Information, including changes of address, is sometimes shared in the course of referrals, but data held by one NHS body may not always reflect changes notified to another.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.3/2">Over time, a single authoritative source of patient demographic data, known as the personal demographics service (PDS), will be used by all general practitioners and hospital computer systems in England. Access to the PDS will reduce clinical risks arising from a failure to match patients with their clinical record, and help minimise cases of correspondence and documents being misdirected. Early evidence from one trust has shown a sixfold reduction in misdirected mail addressed using PDS-held data.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.3/3">The PDS, which first went live in June 2004, already contains information for all the patients within England, and is currently accessible across the NHS, with over 310,000 users, and receives over 26 million inquiries per month. The volumes are growing over time, with increasing patient benefits and efficiency improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.3/4">There will be no physical or electronic links between the PDS's other non-NHS databases, and other Government departments and public agencies will not be able to access the data it contains.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.0/1">The term data controller is defined in the Data Protection Act 1998, and can relate to either individuals or organisations. Each general practitioner (GP) practice, or single-handed GP, is a data controller for health records containing personal data where the practice or GP determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, the personal data are, or will be, processed. This is the case whether the records are held electronically or on paper, and whether the records are held within the GP surgery or hosted elsewhere.

The totals for January to September for Central Derby PCT and Greater Derby PCT have been combined with the October total for Derby City PCT (5N7) to give the 2006 value.  <i> Notes:</i>  Derby City PCT was formed in October 2006 from Central Derby PCT and Greater Derby PCT. Due to rounding, the sum of the components may not equal the totals. Children are defined as 0 to 15-year-olds, and as 16 to 18-year-olds in full-time education. <i> PCA Data</i> Prescription information is taken from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, supplied by the Prescription Pricing Division (PPD) of the Business Services Authority (BSA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions. <i> Prescription</i><i> Items</i> Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item. <i> Exemption Category Estimates</i> The exemption data are identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and rely on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case. Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a one in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. The information we have is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. To reflect this we have rounded the exemption figures appropriately&mdash;figures less than 1,000 are shown as &quot; * &quot;; figures between 1,000 and 100,000 have been rounded to the nearest 1,000; figures between 100,000 and one million have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 and figures between one million and 10 million have been rounded to the nearest 100,000. Data for total of all ages have not been rounded since they are not exemption data.</td> </tr>

This growth has led to unemployment levels falling from 3.7 per cent. in 1996 to 1.9 per cent. in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.2/3">The GVA (Gross Value Added) also increased by 72 per cent. between 1995 to 2004 in Northamptonshire and is above the national average at &pound;18,298 per head (UK average &pound;17,700).</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.2/4">Manufacturing will continue to play an important part in the county's economy with the presence of award winning companies such as Timsons, Veux, Arcotronics, Krohne, Weetabix and Cummins.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.2/5">Northamptonshire is also becoming a market leader in high performance engineering around the motor sport industry, and Government, through the East Midlands Development Agency, has recently supported this growth through the development of the 30,000sq.ft Silverstone innovation centre.</p>

The ASHE includes imputation of missing earnings and hours information in individual questionnaires, and weighting by categories defined by age band, gender, occupation and region. It also introduces additional samples likely to include a higher proportion of low paid employees.

	<p pid="b.743W.5/1">The answer is provided in the following table. Tax thresholds are the point at which income exceeds personal allowances. Individual spouses and civil partners are taxed separately and not as a household. The additional tax relief that is available for older pensioner married or civil partner couples reduces the tax liability of the spouse or civil partner who claims it. The amount depends on the age of the older partner and income of the claimant.</p>

	<p pid="b.750W.6/1">The Government are committed to reducing the harm caused by alcohol misuse. Some areas have found producing an alcohol harm reduction strategy helpful as part of their wider drugs and misuse plans but the Government have no plans to introduce a formal requirement for these. We will want to ensure that where Local Area Agreements can contribute to the delivery of the Government's and local areas' response to alcohol misuse, including alcohol harm reduction strategies, they do so. Many local areas have already chosen to include targets including stretch targets relating to alcohol misuse in their Local Area Agreements. Local Area Agreements have also facilitated enhanced partnership working between local bodies of the type that is necessary to ensure that there is a comprehensive response to alcohol misuse. The duties on local authorities and their local partners proposed in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill will further facilitate such joint working, including by making Local Area Agreements the single mechanism for central and local government to agree targets to reflect the key priorities for improvement in each local area.</p>

A national panel made up of senior civil servants and two people from the private sector interviewed the promoters of the bids that they judged strongest on paper, and then recommended which bids Ministers should agree to support. Ministers accepted the panel's recommendations. Bids were unsuccessful for a variety of reasons and the panel has offered to provide feedback to unsuccessful bidders whom they met. Other unsuccessful bidders are receiving feedback from Government offices. The feedback is aimed at giving authorities a clear idea about any gaps in their analysis, strategy or delivery plans with the aim of helping them to prepare for any future bidding round.</p>

I am pleased to announce our intention to make this amendment in the current financial year. It is proposed that this new regulation would apply until the end of March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.753W.2/1">Communities and Local Government is currently engaged in examining the means by which we monitor the impact of policies on cohesion, including those relating to social housing. This builds on the existing evidence base. For example, recently published evaluations of choice-based lettings schemes have shown that choice tends to result in more dispersed&mdash;not more concentrated&mdash;patterns of lettings involving minority ethnic households.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.2/2">The role of local authorities and housing associations in contributing to community cohesion is one of several matters being considered by the independent Commission on Integration and Cohesion, which is due to report in June 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.754W.8/1">The Government's 2003 sustainable communities plan sets out an action plan to create successful, thriving and inclusive communities, urban and rural, across England. In addition, the Government's 'Rural Strategy', published in 2004, sets a clear vision for bringing about sustainable rural communities. It aims to achieve social justice, economic and social regeneration and an enhanced rural environment in the English countryside. It describes how we will place communities and their needs at the heart of rural regeneration, with services delivered in a way that is responsive to local people and focused on need.
