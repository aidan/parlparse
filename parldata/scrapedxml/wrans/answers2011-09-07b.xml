	<p pid="b.615W.2/1">The new rules for the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme 2011-12 were announced in March 2011. Under the new scheme, the available budget will be divided into quarterly budgets and then shared pro-rata between all claims received. Obviously we hope that the budget will cover the full rate of VAT for all claimants but, if it doesn't, an apportionment will be made and this will be announced on the Listed Places of Worship website. The first payments in this financial year are due to be made at the end of the second quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/2">By returning to the pre-2006 scope of the scheme we estimate that the available budget should be sufficient to pay all claims in full but, given the high volatility of claims in the past, it's impossible to predict with certainty at this stage. I will not be in a position to confirm whether claims can be paid in full until all claims for the first quarter of the year have been submitted and processed. The rate of payment will be published on the Listed Places of Worship website once this process is complete.</p>

	<p pid="b.616W.3/1">Ofcom were directed to take a number of actions relating to spectrum in December 2010, including carrying out a combined auction of 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum as soon as possible. Ofcom consulted recently on auction design but has yet to take any final decisions on how they will proceed. Consequently I have had no discussions with Ofcom about a possible further direction in the event of a legal challenge to their proposals. The operators have expressed their concerns with the Ofcom proposals to me and I have stressed to them the Government's wish to see this auction take place as early as possible in 2012.</p>

These included a requirement for Departments to actively contract manage the performance of prime contractors, the Crown Representatives encouraging key suppliers to pay more quickly than in 30 days and encouraging suppliers to report issues of late payment to Cabinet Office's Mystery Shopper service. Departments are not required to publish payment data on a central repository, though some Departments choose to publish performance on departmental websites.</p>

	<p pid="b.624W.0/1">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) does not have reliable figures for this. Compensation for victims of violent crime is based on the injuries people sustain not the particular crimes of which they were a victim. The injuries for which CICA can compensate, and therefore provide reliable figures for, are set out in the Tariff of Injuries in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2008, but the Tariff does not contain any injuries specific to dog attacks.</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.0/2">It is worth noting that victims of animal attacks are not eligible to receive compensation from CICA unless it can be shown that their injuries resulted from a crime of violence, within the terms of the Scheme, on the part of the person controlling the animal.</p>

All staff are being offered alternative employment at other prisons or young offender institutions within the Greater London region or elsewhere. Five staff who were eligible to do so have decided to leave the Prison Service and formally retire. In line with the Service's procedures for redeployment and prison closures, staff have been offered suitable alternative employment at a location within approximately 60 minutes travelling distance of their home. Any additional travelling costs incurred by the change of location are met by the Service for a limited period to ease the process of transition.</p>

Operation Safeguard is required when the size or distribution of the prison population is such that it can no longer be managed within the available capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.2/2">Pressures in managing the population arise from a number of factors.

	<p pid="b.630W.0/1">The offences that carry mandatory minimum custodial sentences within the scope of the question are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/2" class="italic">Minimum custodial sentence of five years</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/3">The only offence in this category is possession of a prohibited firearm by an adult. Table 1 shows the number of offenders cautioned and sentenced (including absolute discharges and conditional discharges) at all courts, by result, for possession of a prohibited firearm in England and Wales from 2006 to 2010 (latest available).</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/4" class="italic">Minimum custodial sentence between 12 months and four years</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/5">There are two offences in this category: possession of a prohibited firearm by a 16-17 year old, and a third domestic burglary. For both of these offences the mandatory minimum is three years. Table 1 includes details of cautions, absolute discharges and conditional discharges for the first of these offences. Table 2 shows the number of third time domestic burglary offenders, by type of sentence in England and Wales from 2006 to 2010 (including absolute discharges and conditional discharges). Cautions data are not available for third time domestic burglary offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/6" class="italic">Minimum custodial sentences under 12 months</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/7">No offences carry a mandatory minimum custodial sentence under 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/8">Relevant legislation provides that the mandatory minimum sentence is not required to be imposed where the court finds that it would be unjust to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.0/9">Cautions and court proceedings data for 2011 are planned for publication in the spring, 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.648W.5/47">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July</phrase> I announced the outcome of the Homes and Communities Agency's assessment of the proposals of the new Affordable Homes Programme 2011-15. Through this new programme 146 providers will deliver 80,000 new homes for Affordable Rent and Affordable Home Ownership with Government funding of &#163;1.8 billion over the next four years. From this the total available to London is &#163;627 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.5/48">The Homes and Communities Agency is currently negotiating contracts with providers. Once this is completed they intend to publish on their website the allocations by local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.5/49">This Government are also providing funding to help first time buyers and maintain capacity in the house building industry through the FirstBuy programme. The scheme will help nearly;10,500 households to purchase a new build property by spring 2013 with a 20% equity loan co-funded by Government and house builders. An allocation of &#163;20.8 million for FirstBuy in London was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-20">20 June 2011</phrase>. This has been allocated on an area wide basis, as the breakdown of funding by London borough will not be known until the completion of sales.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.5/50">In addition, we have set aside almost &#163;1 billion over this spending review period for the New Homes Bonus Scheme. This scheme will match fund the additional council tax raised, using the national average in each band, for new homes and long-term empty properties brought back into use. From 2012-13 an additional &#163;350 will be payable for each affordable home. This unringfenced funding will ensure that the benefits of housing growth are visible to the communities affected. Local authorities will need to lead the debate with their communities to determine local spending priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.5/51">This Department does not hold details of local authority expenditure used to support social housing development.</p>

	<p pid="b.655W.2/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> The UK is leading the calls to reform the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to overcome its serious structural failings, which have led to the over exploitation of fish stocks including the wasteful practice of discarding fish. The UK is building support for genuine and radical change that includes providing the incentives and regulatory framework to enable us to:</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/3">catch less fish but land more of it, for example by replacing landing-based quota with catch quotas;</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/4">adopt a regionalised CFP that eliminates over-detailed central regulation; and</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/5">apply the same principles of sustainable use of marine resources within and outside EU waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/6">The UK is also calling on Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, which manage fish stocks in international and coastal waters, to set quotas that fully reflect the best available scientific advice in order to ensure the future sustainability of all species.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/7"><i>(b)</i> The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has the lead responsibility for mitigation including international negotiations under the UN framework convention on climate change. However, in order to improve our understanding of the potential impacts of ocean acidification DEFRA, DECC and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) are jointly funding a &#163;12 million research programme. This programme has strong links into the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA) which has enabled cross-national field observations and joint modelling projections to be undertaken which could not have been undertaken by any one country. As a result of this collaborative approach, EU scientists have become the international leaders in ocean acidification research. The next stage is to engage in a major joint EU-US experiment, while maintaining a strong European leadership.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/8">Scientists all around the world are working to understand what these impacts might be. The five year UK Ocean Acidification Research Programme (UKOA) is the UK's response to these growing concerns over ocean acidification and is jointly funded by DEFRA, DECC and NERC. This programme is also inputting to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations frame convention on climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/9"><i>(c)</i> The UK Government are fully involved in a wide range of international initiatives, beyond those undertaken within the European Union, to address man-made pollution. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/10">The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), which promotes the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle so that, by 2020, chemicals around the world are produced and used in ways that minimise significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/11">The Rotterdam convention, which promotes shared responsibility and co-operative efforts among parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment and to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those chemicals.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/12">The Stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife, and have adverse effects to human health or to the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/13">The UK, as a party to the Stockholm convention, agreed at the fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties on 25-<phrase class="date" code="2011-04-09">9 April 2011</phrase> to add endosulfan, a widely used pesticide, to the list of persistent organic pollutants to be eliminated worldwide. This decision was among more than 30 measures taken by parties to the convention to boost global action against POPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/14">The UK plays an active role in the convention on long range transboundary air pollution (CLRTAP) in order to tackle emissions to air of a range of harmful pollutants from the wider Europe and North America area. In 2009 the protocol on persistent organic pollutants was revised to include controls on additional organic pollutants. Amendments to the Gothenburg protocol are expected to be agreed within the next seven months leading to reductions in emissions of five pollutants (nitrogen oxides; sulphur dioxide; volatile organic compounds; ammonia and particulate matter) that lead to acidification, eutrophication, ground level ozone and particulate matter. Revisions to the heavy metals protocol are expected to be agreed within approximately the next year, bringing further controls on the metals cadmium, lead and mercury.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/15"><i>(d)</i> The UK is participating with other North sea countries in an initiative organised through the OSPAR convention for the protection of the north-east Atlantic to</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/16">model the contribution of the nutrient load of different rivers to eutrophication effects (chlorophyll and oxygen) in coastal and offshore areas of the North sea to estimate the degree of change needed in key parameters to bring the current eutrophication problem areas in the eastern North sea to non-problem area status.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/17">Action to amend the Gothenburg protocol under the CLTRAP is expected to lead to further international controls on emissions of nitrogen dioxide and ammonia, and to updated guidance on fertiliser and manure management resulting in more efficient nitrogen use and reduced levels of nutrient run off.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/18">The UK signed up to the commitments under the convention on biological diversity new Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-20 at the Nagoya Biodiversity Conference in October 2010. The Strategic Plan includes target 8 that by 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been bought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.</p>

	<p pid="b.662W.5/1">The Government are sympathetic to the plight of many off-grid energy consumers who were hit hard by high prices and supply issues last winter. We are keen that the reasons for this are thoroughly investigated which is why I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in January to ask it to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy. The OFT has launched its market study into the off-grid energy market on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-15">15 March</phrase> and will publish its findings in October 2011. The market study will provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.5/2">Vulnerable off-grid consumers, including those whose primary heating source is heating oil or liquefied petroleum gas, could be eligible for grants under the Warm Front scheme for specified heating and insulation measures up to &#163;3,500 in value or &#163;6,000 where the work includes installation of an oil fired central heating system or an alternative low carbon technology for properties off the main gas grid. Additionally the Warm Home Discount scheme introduced in April this year will require energy companies by law to give a discount on electricity bills to more of their most low income and vulnerable customers. Government are working to ensure 600,000 of the poorest pensioners receive a &#163;120 discount on their electricity bill this year, ensuring eligible households off the gas grid will benefit. Other groups such as low income families and those with long-term illnesses and disabilities may also receive this discount; they may also receive assistance under transitional arrangements from the previous voluntary agreement. In total, the scheme will benefit around 2 million households this year, with a value of up to &#163;250 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.665W.5/1">Analysis undertaken for the Renewable heat incentive (RHI) impact assessment (published March 2011) suggests around &#163;7 million of spending on biomass combined heat and power (CHP) in 2014 based on a 2.5p/kWh tariff. Our modelling assumes that biomass CHP projects will only come forward above 1,000 kilowatt thermal and are incentivised by the renewables obligation until 2013 and by the RHI between 2014-20. However, actual uptake is uncertain so some smaller projects may nevertheless come forward under the RHI. Our estimates will be subject to further analysis and updated in the light of the proposals in the forthcoming consultation on the banding review of the renewables obligation.</p>

	<p pid="b.669W.6/1">Eligibility for a staff car is currently dependent upon the nature of the duties of an appointment, and it is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s top level budget holders to identify and justify which appointments have such eligibility. For officers and civil servants holding equivalent military rank, eligibility is generally linked to command status, but certain officers holding key staff appointments may also be eligible. This policy applies across the MOD and its agencies, including the trading funds, and their chief executives.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.6/2">We are, however, reviewing departmental policy on the provision of staff cars, taking account of the need to demonstrate value for money, provide maximum flexibility and meet our sustainable development commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.6/3">The Ministerial Code, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-21">21 May 2010</phrase>, has already led to changes in the circumstances in which Ministers would be entitled to a car and driver. In the MOD, these cost-saving changes have meant that the junior Defence Ministers have given up their cars with a dedicated driver and now share a central MOD car pool with senior military officers and officials working in Main Building.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.6/4">Staff cars are an extension of the office and give Ministers and our most senior military and civilian staff a more private space to work in than public transport, so they can make best use of the time they spend travelling, with appropriate security.</p>

This includes those involved in the incapacity benefits reassessment trial, and those assessed face-to-face, cases assessed on paper scrutiny and therefore not requiring a face-to-face work capability assessment, and those that have had a recommendation based on their non-compliance with the assessment process.</p>

	<p pid="b.675W.6/1">Comparable data for the numbers of pension schemes are only available since March 2006. The numbers of active members of defined benefit (DB) pension schemes in 1995 and in 2009 are given at the end of this response.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/2">Data earlier than 2006 are unavailable as aggregate statistics on private sector pension schemes have only been routinely collated following the launch of the statutory corporation&#8212;the Pension Protection Fund (PPF)&#8212;in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/3">Estimates are for DB schemes (or DB elements of hybrid schemes) in the UK, which are eligible for PPF protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/4">These DB schemes include final salary schemes and others whose accruals are based on a career average or other average terms. According to the Occupational Pension Schemes Survey (OPSS), in 2009, 23% of private sector DB schemes were based on a career average.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/5"><i>(a)</i> (i) According to the Purple Book 2010, there were 7,751 such DB schemes in the UK in March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.675W.6/7"><i>(b)</i> (i) The aggregate balance of these schemes on a s179 basis in March 2006 was&#8212;&#163;22.7 billion. This balance represented assets of &#163;769.5 billion, and s179 liabilities of &#163;792.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/8"><i>(b)</i> (ii) The aggregate balance of these schemes on a s179 basis in July 2011 was&#8212;&#163;67.3 billion. This balance represented assets of &#163;1,001.4 billion, and s179 liabilities of &#163;1,068.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.675W.6/9">A scheme's s179 liabilities represent the premium that would have to be paid to an insurance company to take on the payment of PPF levels of compensation. This compensation may be lower than full scheme benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.676W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) uses both 0800 and 0845 telephone numbers. 0845 numbers carry a cost to members of the public, however a call-back is offered when they express a concern about the cost of the call.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.5/2">A review of the use of these numbers has recently been carried out. Its terms of reference were to consider whether the Department could stop using 0845 numbers with the objective that all calls from members of the public to DWP be free.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.5/3">A number of options were presented, and their feasibility is currently being considered. While this consideration is underway, DWP will continue to provide 0800 &#8216;free call&#8217; numbers for benefit claim lines and 0845 numbers for other calls.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.5/4">The options presented were:</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.5/5">Option (i): Replacing 0845 numbers with 0800 numbers. This would provide free calls but at significant cost to DWP due to the additional charges associated with 0800 numbers.</p>

Part of the proposal was to waive or disregard micro finance and the income generated during participation on the scheme across the current benefit system for the first two years of participation.</p>

We have therefore introduced the new enterprise allowance (NEA). The NEA provides mentoring and financial support in the form of a weekly allowance and small loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/4">The NEA is just one element in our wide ranging programme of welfare reform, a major part of which is universal credit and the introduction of the Work programme, both of which will provide more flexible ways of supporting people into sustained work including self-employment.</p>

	<p pid="b.680W.2/1">The estimate of numbers lifted out of poverty as a result of universal credit are based on an assessment of the impact of universal credit using DWP's Policy Simulation Model. This model uses data from the 2008-09 Family Resources Survey (FRS) and uprates incomes and demographics to the relevant year using projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The model is able to assess entitlement to universal credit, because of the wide range of personal characteristics reported to the FRS by respondents.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.2/2">Our best estimate of the impact of take up is included in the modelling, it is assumed that those currently taking up some, but not all of their benefit entitlements will take up in full under universal credit; and of those taking up none of their current entitlement, around half will do so under the new system.</p>

	<p pid="b.683W.2/1">Between 2001 and 2003, the Department commissioned the university of Sheffield to conduct a survey of air ambulance service provision in the United Kingdom, and review the published evidence on the costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.2/2">It found that the main benefit of air ambulances is for serious blunt trauma patients, particularly those injured in road traffic accidents with severe injuries. If an air ambulance responded to four or more of these patients per year, it could be seen as cost effective in terms of quality adjusted life years.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.2/3">However, there was not enough reliable evidence, relevant to England, to judge whether there is any benefit in any other groups of patients, and the targeting of helicopters to serious blunt trauma patients was deemed to be poor. Therefore the large number of non-blunt trauma cases attended by air ambulances currently reduces cost effectiveness overall.</p>

However, the Committee considered it very unlikely that this represents the total number of individuals affected. Instead it speculated that, given that much of the effect of air pollution on mortality is linked to cardiovascular deaths, then PM2.5s acting together with other factors, may have made some smaller contribution to the earlier deaths of up to 200,000 people.</p>

The allocation includes a recurrent revenue allocation of &#163;522.4 million and a non-recurrent allocation of &#163;27.9 million for general ophthalmic services, primary dental services, pharmaceutical services and support for joint working between health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.3/2">At the close of 2010-11, under the previous formula, Nottingham City PCT was 6.2% below target for the recurrent component of its allocation. At the opening of 2011-12, under the changes to the funding formula, the PCT was 5.7% below target.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.3/3">Nottingham City PCT received higher than average funding growth in 2011-12 to move it towards target. At the close of 2011-12 the PCT will be 4.7% below target for recurrent funding.</p>

The comic is focused on the needs of young people in both urban and rural areas and engages them through popular culture and combining accessible youth-focused media: the comic, daily syndicated FM radio and TV programmes and interactive SMS. Additional DFID investment in June 2010 raised circulation to 600,000 copies per month, with an anticipated readership of 12 million.

	<p pid="b.701W.6/1">At the meeting of Agriculture Ministers in June, G20 members agreed to ask the World Food Programme (WFP) to develop a pilot proposal for an emergency food reserves system, to complement existing regional and national food reserves. Department for International Development (DFID) staff are currently participating in the working group set up to support WFP in preparing a feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis for this pilot.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.6/2">G20 countries, including the UK, do not advocate the development of physical food reserves as a means of alleviating the effects of food price volatility in developing countries. The proposed pilot will not aim to fill commercial gaps or purchase or release stocks large enough to impact on wider food markets or commodity price levels. Other measures included in the G20 Agriculture Action Plan&#8212;such as the Agricultural Market Information System to improve data on agricultural markets and an international Rapid Response Forum to co-ordinate action when agricultural markets become more volatile&#8212;are intended to reduce the negative impacts of price volatility on the poor.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.2/1">In Kenya last month, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) released the report of a rapid assessment of Gender Based Violence in Dadaab refuge camp. The report made several recommendations including improving the access to quality health services, provision of age appropriate emotional support, establishment of female only safe areas for the reporting of protection concerns, and that all sectors of camp life must take prevention and risk mitigation actions to minimise potential risks and violence to women and girls.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.2/2">By contrast in Ethiopia there are limited data or confirmed reports of sexual assault of female refugees. However, recent assessments by aid agencies in the Dolo Ado refugee camps now hosting over 118,000 Somali refugees (of whom 53.5% are female) have highlighted a number of risk factors that make female refugees vulnerable to sexual and gender based violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.2/3">The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and other aid agencies are working with community members to improve the level of services, expertise of staff and awareness in the refugee camps to address these risks. We are working to ensure that this happens.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.2/1">The UK Government have been pressing the Government of Kenya throughout 2011 on the need to allocate more space for refugee camps, working closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The Minister for Internal Security recently confirmed that they would open Ifo II camp in Dadaab, which is expected to be occupied by approximately 40,000 refugees. However, with nearly 1,300 people, including children, arriving from Somalia on a daily basis, the process of decongesting the Dadaab camps needs to be accelerated. I raised these points with the Kenyan Prime Minister and the Minister for Internal Security during my visit to Kenya in July. The UK is also providing a substantial package of financial support through UN agencies, to assist new refugees in the Dadaab camps.</p>

	<p pid="b.705W.2/2">We carefully select the partners we work with in Gaza. They are, in the main, United Nations agencies and reputable international non-governmental organisations with proven track records of effective delivery in Gaza. Our funding to the Palestinian Authority (which spends approximately half its budget in Gaza) is administered through a World Bank managed trust fund, which has stringent audit requirements. We work closely with all our partners on project design to ensure that our support reaches only its intended beneficiaries; and that European Union and UK legislation on anti-terrorist funding is adhered to.</p>

	<p pid="b.705W.8/1">British humanitarian support to Somalia has mostly been focussed on delivering lifesaving aid where acute needs are greatest, specifically in south and central areas of Somalia, where some 2.8 million people are in desperate need of help. However, we recognise that northern Somalia has not escaped the impact of the current drought and is also suffering, although to a lesser extent&#8212;acute malnutrition rates in many southern regions are almost double those in the north, and mortality rates are many times worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.8/2">Last month I announced a &#163;25 million package of support to help over 500,000 victims of the drought across Somalia, including treatment for thousands of acutely malnourished children, urgently needed food, clean water, shelter and health care. UK support to the UN&#8217;s pooled funding mechanism, the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), is helping non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to access urgently required funds to respond to ongoing needs across the country, including in Puntland and Somaliland.</p>
	<p pid="b.705W.8/3">British aid in Somalia is being targeted to help those people most in need of emergency assistance. At present, and based on recent UN assessments, the majority of northern Somalia does not fall into this category of severity. However, my officials will continue to monitor the food security situation in the north of the country to ensure needs are being met across this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.708W.5/3">on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-28">28 July 2011</phrase>. The UK's aid programme in South Sudan will focus on enabling poor people, particularly girls and women, to benefit from more equitable and sustainable services; increased employment and livelihood opportunities&#8212;supported by private sector investment; greater security; more accountable and efficient government; and less corruption. DFID is aiming for extensive results including: 1 million people having enough food to eat; 240,000 more children completing primary school; 750,000 people to be treated for or prevented from getting malaria; 4 million people receiving life-saving healthcare and nutrition; 12 million textbooks printed and distributed to almost 2 million children; and increased private sector investment and trade by reducing cross border transport costs up by 15%.</p>

These items have been exported and the SIEL is therefore exhausted.</p>

The SIEL was for 200,000 rounds of sporting ammunition (.22 calibre). The goods on this licence have not been shipped. The Government reviewed all licences for Syria in May 2011 after the EU arms embargo was imposed. This licence was revoked as the proposed export was no longer consistent with the Consolidated Criteria, Criteria 1 (UK's International commitments to enforce EU arms embargoes).</p>

	<p pid="b.713W.2/1">It is widely recognised (e.g. the 2004 Graham Review) that market failures exist in small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) debt markets, where information needed by lenders to make judgments on individual loan applications may be expensive, or difficult to obtain. Although advances in credit assessment techniques may have helped to overcome these difficulties, barriers resulting from a lack of information may still be faced by certain types of business, in particular those that lack an established track record.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.2/2">This Department is aware that some businesses can encounter difficulties when accessing bank finance due to a lack of financial track record, or collateral. For instance, the SME Finance Monitor (July 2011) reported that, for SMEs whose borrowing requests were declined, the main reason given was lack of credit history or a poor credit history.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.2/3">In order to help viable businesses lacking a track record, the Government have extended the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme, which is targeted at such businesses and those businesses who lack security.</p>

This is a national service so it is not possible to provide a regional breakdown.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/12">BCG will be built around two main themes:</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/13">Coaching: the programme will provide coaches to work face to face with senior management teams to help them to develop and implement their strategies and develop the skills, expertise and techniques to overcome the barriers they face to growing.</p>

	<p pid="b.713W.8/15">The formal process to procure BCG began in April and has attracted considerable interest from the business community.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/16">BIS has adopted the Competitive Dialogue procurement procedure which involves strong engagement and discussion with private sector bidders. BIS is confident that the market will deliver an innovative, flexible and cost-effective solution to delivering BCG across England.

In many regions, including the north-west, European funds were used to leverage private sector investment into the VCLF. Across England almost &#163;0.5 billion (RDA funds, ERDF and private investment) has been committed to VCLFs investing in SMEs up to the end of 2015.

	<p pid="b.717W.0/1">The Hargreaves review of intellectual property and growth was charged in its terms of reference with a number of aims, including investigating what are the benefits of &#8220;fair use&#8221; exceptions to copyright and how these might be achieved in the UK. The review concluded that a broad legal mechanism similar to US fair use would not be practical within the EU framework, but that there is a need for more flexibility in order to meet new opportunities. Therefore the review recommended that the UK should make more use of the freedoms available within the EU framework, including permitting consumers to make private copies of copyright works in order to use them within fair and reasonable limits.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/2">The Government have accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the review. The Government have no intention of prejudicing the fundamental role of copyright in providing appropriate incentives for the creation of valuable works, on which much value for the UK depends. We nonetheless believe the review is right to identify activities that copyright currently over-regulates unnecessarily to the detriment of the UK, and we will propose a substantial opening up of the UK's copyright exceptions regime, as set out in our response to the review. The Government will also press at EU level for a wider set of exceptions to secure further flexibilities without prejudicing appropriate incentives for creation of works.</p>

If the exporter is aware that non-listed items may be intended for a WMD-related end-use or a military end-use in an embargoed destination they must notify the ECO before exporting the items and the ECO will determine whether or not an export licence is required. If the exporter has grounds for suspecting a WMD-related end-use they must not export the items unless they have made all reasonable inquiries as to their actual end-use and satisfied themselves that they will not be used for WMD-related purposes. A breach of any of the above requirements is a criminal offence. The Government offers an advice service regarding whether an export requires a licence or not, and strongly advises that any exporter who is unsure on this point should use this service.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.5/1">The Department for Business Innovation and Skills does not directly provide funding for research into nuclear energy. The Department provides funding to the research councils and the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) which then provide a range of support.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.5/2">The Research Councils UK (RCUK) Energy Programme will invest &#163;540 million in energy related research between 2011-15, which includes research and training related to nuclear fission energy.</p>

It is not possible to give precise figures for future spend on nuclear fission. Priorities for the whole RCUK Energy Programme will be regularly reviewed with advice from the programme's Scientific Advisory Council. In addition the EPSRC spends &#163;25 million per year on nuclear fusion energy research, primarily through the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.5/4">The Economic and Social Research Council spent approximately &#163;335,000 on nuclear energy related research in 2009-10 and &#163;4,000 in 2010-11. It is not possible to give precise figures for future spend on nuclear energy. Future spend will be determined by the proposals for funding received.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.5/5">In addition to the funding within its nuclear physics programme, which examines how atomic nuclei behave and the origin of elements, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) provided &#163;2 million in 2009-10, &#163;1.5 million in 2010-11 and &#163;0.5 million in 2011-12 for the HiPER project. HiPER is a proposed European High Power Laser Energy Research facility dedicated to demonstrating the feasibility of laser driven fusion as a future energy source. Between 2009 and 2011 STFC provided &#163;424,000 to a pilot Knowledge Exchange grant for the project 'Using Thorium as fuel in conventional Reactors'.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.5/6">The Technology Strategy Board have provided approximately &#163;200,000 in 2010-11 for Nuclear R&amp;D feasibility studies under their &#163;2 million competition to develop innovation in the supply chain with the remainder of this funding expected to be drawn down in 2011-12. Furthermore, some of the funding, which is currently being finalised, for the High Value Manufacturing Technology and Innovation Centre will support the work of the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre. The Technology Strategy Board also plan a further &#163;10 million Collaborative R&amp;D competition in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.723W.5/1">No assessment has been made as small and medium-sized enterprises can bid directly to the Regional Growth Fund (RGF) either on their own or they may come together to submit a package of projects which make a coherent whole but which individually would not meet the minimum bidding threshold of &#163;1 million. Furthermore, four out of the 50 successful bids to Round 1 were conditionally allocated funding for small and medium enterprise support schemes. RGF funding for these four schemes totals &#163;175 million, which was almost 40% of all the funds allocated (&#163;450 million) in Round 1.</p>

	<p pid="b.728W.5/1">The National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) collects information on the number of young people in specialist substance misuse services in England. In 2009-10, there were 480 young people under 18 in treatment who had opiates as their main problem drug and, of these, 294 received pharmacological interventions. NDTMS does not distinguish between opiate substitute drugs (such as methadone or buprenorphine), other prescribed drugs (such as Ritalin for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), or what they are prescribed for (in this context it could include prescribing for detoxification, stabilisation and symptomatic relief of substance misuse). Information on the doses prescribed is not recorded within NDTMS nor held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.728W.5/2">Young people's substance misuse is markedly different to that of adults. Young people tend to have shorter histories of substance use and have used lower levels of drugs for shorter periods. They are therefore much less likely to be physically dependent. 2% of young people in treatment in 2009-10 had heroin or crack cocaine as their primary problem substance.</p>
	<p pid="b.728W.5/3">Substitute prescribing for under-18s is therefore rare, and it is expected that if young people are receiving substitute prescribing, it should normally be as part of a reduction or detoxification programme. Most substance misuse interventions for young people focus on psychosocial counselling-based therapies aimed at achieving abstinence.</p>
	<p pid="b.728W.5/4">This is supported by NDTMS figures, which show that of the 294 young people with opiate problems receiving pharmacological interventions in 2009/10, 78 were continuously receiving these interventions a year later. This suggests that of the total 23,528 young people receiving interventions for substance misuse, 0.3% were prescribed methadone or other substitute opioids on a maintenance basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.730W.2/8">c. North Tyneside: 2,589.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/9">In each case, figures refer to the local authority area. Information is not available at levels below local authority such as Parliamentary constituencies. EMA take-up is defined as young people who have received one or more EMA payments in the academic year concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.2/10">EMA take-up data showing the number of young people who have received one or more EMA payments, broken down by local authority, during 2010/11 is available on the YPLA website, at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="b.730W.2/13">It is not possible to say how many young people will receive 16-19 bursaries in the 2011/12 academic year. Schools, colleges, Academies and training providers will be able to determine their own criteria for eligibility for discretionary bursaries, and for deciding the level of awards. Therefore the YPLA does not hold data about the number of young people that are expected to benefit from the bursary scheme in each local authority area. We expect that in many cases providers will want to agree a consistent approach across an area, taking account of the needs and circumstances of young people locally.</p>

In addition, all young people in Tower Hamlets who first applied successfully for EMA in 2009/10, and the majority of those who first did so in 2010/11, will continue to receive weekly payments via the nationally administered transitional arrangements in 2011/12.</p>
	<p pid="b.731W.0/2">As the new arrangements take effect we will be monitoring participation data closely, including relating to London boroughs. We also expect to undertake a formal evaluation of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund, which will allow us to consider its impact in more detail. We have at present no evidence that the introduction of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund has had an impact on participation in education and training post-16 in Tower Hamlets.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.2/1">In addition to the 900 responses to the call of evidence for Mr Darren Henley's review of music education in 2010, the Department for Education received between January and July this year almost 400 items of correspondence from people concerned about music education. It would be a disproportionate cost to the Department to break these down by type of correspondent.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.2/2">In response to Mr Henley's review of music education, the Government made clear their commitment to ensuring every child experiences a sound music education with opportunities to learn to play a musical instrument and to sing. In addition to announcing a funding settlement for music education of &#163;82.5 million for 2011-12, the Government pledged to eliminate historical discrepancies in funding. Moving to a more transparent funding formula has resulted in some local authorities receiving an increase in funding, while we have guaranteed that no local authority would lose more than 10% of its funding compared to 2010-11. The majority of the funding for 2011-12 will go to the front line to deliver music education.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.5/25">The total revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.5/26">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.5/27">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>

	<p pid="b.734W.2/3">The Department is considering responses to the Green Paper and the Government will be publishing their plans for the future of SEN and disability provision in England by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.9/1">The Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) is the European Union's vision for accelerating the development and deployment of cost-effective low carbon technologies. The SET Plan is not a funding body but rather the umbrella title for research and demonstration activities. Funding for activities promoted under the SET Plan may be provided from any of a number of sources, including the European Union's Framework Programme 7, individual European member states and private industry. Many of these sources have an interest in research and demonstration activity that predates the SET Plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.9/2">In the last three years Framework Programme 7 has awarded support to 11 projects involving UK organisations for biofuel research and development. Two further bids are currently being assessed. This has provided at least 7 million euros of support to UK institutions. However, it is likely that not all of this work is directly related to the SET Plan initiative as Framework Programme 7 has a wider scope. The Department for Transport itself does not provide any direct funding for SET Plan activities and we do not have a role in the funding decisions of other bodies that may fund this work.</p>

	<p pid="b.741W.2/1">The deployment of rolling stock is typically a matter for train operators and Rolling Stock Leasing companies, with the Department's role being limited to ensuring that tax-payers and fare-payers receive value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/2">The expansion in the number of electrified rail routes may mean that fewer diesel trains will be needed in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/3">The Department has set out the level of accessibility that it expects Pacers to have if they are to remain in service after 2019&#8212;it will be for the owners to decide whether to invest in life-extension works. Indeed, one has already released images of interior refurbishment concepts.</p>

	<p pid="b.741W.5/1">Subject to the outcome of the public consultation, HS2 would result in faster and more frequent services between London and cities in the North West. A full &#8216;Y&#8217; shaped high speed network to Manchester and Leeds would be able to accommodate trains that can carry up to 1,100 people from Manchester to London in one hour 13 minutes, and from Manchester to Birmingham in 49 minutes. In addition, high speed services through-running onto the conventional network would be able to reach other towns and cities in the North West, for example reducing the journey time between London and Liverpool to as little as one hour 37 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.5/2">As per the illustrative service specification for the &#8216;Y&#8217; network outlined in the Economic Case for the Government's proposals for High Speed 2, there would be four high speed services an hour to Manchester from London in the peak, two services an hour from Birmingham to Manchester, two services an hour from London to Liverpool (with intermediate stops at Stafford, Crewe, and Runcorn and Warrington) and two services an hour in the peak from London to Wigan, Preston and Glasgow.</p>

	<p pid="b.742W.0/1">The Government's proposed strategy for high speed rail is to construct a Y-shaped network linking directly to Manchester and Leeds. This would be able to accommodate 400 m trains carrying up to 1,100 people, enabling a significant increase in capacity to Manchester, as well as reducing the journey time to London to around 73 minutes. Other destinations in the North West such as Liverpool or Preston could also see significant capacity and journey time improvements via high speed services through-running onto the conventional network.</p>

	<p pid="b.744W.5/1">Work is under way to provide additional rolling stock on many routes around the country. Combined with the IEP, Thameslink and Crossrail projects, our plan is that 2,700 new carriages will be in service by the end of 2019. 349 additional carriages were added to the network during the coalition's first 12 months in office and progress has been made on the procurement process for carriages to be delivered under the IEP, Thameslink and Crossrail programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.5/2">The last formal rolling stock plan was prepared by the previous Administration, and published in July 2008. We will be considering Sir Roy McNulty's recommendations on rolling stock but start from the position that the rail industry should be best placed to lead on rolling stock cascade proposals, with the Government's role primarily focused on ensuring that these represent value-for-money.</p>

	<p pid="b.745W.3/1">A new franchising system has been devised to facilitate and encourage private investment, and to deliver benefits for passengers.</p>

Bidders will be expected to consider what appropriate enhancements should be made and how best to improve service quality at these stations.</p>
