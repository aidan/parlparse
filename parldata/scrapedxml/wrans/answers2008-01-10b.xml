	<p pid="b.687W.3/4">The Women and Equality Unit (WEU) was not a stand alone Department so no separate equal pay audit was ever conducted for it. The WEU was located successively within the Department for Social Security (as the Women's Unit), the Cabinet Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department for Communities and Local Government. An equal pay audit was conducted by the Cabinet Office using spring 2002 data. This review is likely to have included WEU staff in the Cabinet Office at that time, although this can not be confirmed as the review does not specify units or individuals. The Department for Communities and Local Government is currently conducting an equal pay review using June 2007 pay data, and this will include WEU staff paid by that Department at that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.690W.2/1">At the Global Fund Executive Board in April 2007, members acknowledged that the size of the fund would increase, dependent on high quality demand from countries and improved performance of the fund itself. Three scenarios of future demand had been prepared by the Secretariat, the highest one assuming that demand would rise more than fourfold by 2010, and that $8 billion per annum would be needed to support these new proposals and continue with existing programmes (representing $18 billion for the period 2008-10). The G8 noted the projected demands and pledged to work with the other donors to replenish the fund, and to provide long-term predictable funding based on ambitious but realistic demand driven targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.690W.2/2">Donor pledges and Secretariat projections now total $9.7 billion for the period 2008-10. This is a highly significant increase in resources, which allows the fund to support a substantial expansion of all ongoing programmes, and all of the new proposals which have been recommended by the Technical Review Panel, while still leaving over $750 million available for future proposals. Thus all the high quality demand for financing the current round of proposals has been met.</p>
	<p pid="b.690W.2/3">But the UK's own pledge goes beyond this. The UK has made an unprecedented long-term commitment over the eight years up to 2015, of up to &pound;1 billion. Within this framework we announced a commitment of &pound;360 million over the three year replenishment period, of which &pound;30 million is subject to demand and results. This 20 per cent. increase in our commitment means that we have maintained our share of the total replenishment at about 7.5 per cent. In addition, we also pledged a further &pound;640 million from 2011-15, providing the global fund is receiving good quality demand, continues to perform well and is demonstrating sustainable impact.</p>

	<p pid="b.690W.5/1">World Bank conditionality for lending must be in line with the Bank's policy. In 2004, the Bank abolished its use of prescriptive conditionality&mdash;the practice of pushing specific reforms. Following a review in 2005, it adopted the good practice principles on conditionality. These principles stress the importance of country ownership and commit the Bank to ensure that conditions are limited to those critical for the programme's success and are customised to individual country circumstances. In 2006, the Bank committed to avoiding conditions in sensitive policy areas such as privatisation, unless they are critical to the effectiveness of a programme and there is clear evidence of ownership by the developing country government. The UK has made it clear to the World Bank that we expect all lending to respect the commitments it has made in the last few years.</p>

	<p pid="b.691W.2/1">The World Bank's 2007 report on Conditionality in Development Policy Lending incorporates findings from consultations in eight developing countries with governments and other stakeholders. It also draws on external studies and reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.2/2">The report highlights continued improvements in the bank's practice on conditionality. The average number of conditions per bank policy-based operation in low-income countries fell from 32 in 1999 to 12 in 2006 and in 2007. There has also been a reduction in conditions in &quot;sensitive areas&quot; and the number of privatisation conditions is low. The consultations highlighted that the bank's practice has improved in respecting country ownership and increasing opportunities to debate policy options.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.2/3">The report acknowledges there is room for improvement and makes further recommendations, notably the need to involve local counterparts more fully in policy formulation and analytical work, and the need to strengthen the use of poverty and social impact analysis by bank staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.2/4">The findings of the report and the bank's commitment to further improve its performance in this area are encouraging. We continue to maintain pressure on the bank to ensure that it fulfils its commitments on the use of conditionality.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.2/2">The research referred to in the question was commissioned by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB). RSSB has no plans to publish any material relating to hammers. Having reached the conclusion that escape through windows of passenger trains should not be encouraged, RSSB concluded that the work on hammers should cease. There is therefore no final report or validated set of data relating to hammers. The final report on the overall approach to passenger containment, to which the hon. Gentleman refers in his question, is available on the RSSB website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.701W.3/1">The communications allowances was introduced in April 2007 and set at &pound;10,000 per annum for each hon. Member, with the possibility of adding money transferred from staffing and IEP&mdash;incidental expenses provision. The maximum spend from the basic allowance in one year is therefore &pound;6.46 million. The Members Estimate Committee, in its report on the communications allowance (HC 319, 2006-07) assumed similar take-up to the other allowances. As noted in the report, this equates to a likely total annual cost of the allowance of about &pound;6 million. Currently spending on the communications allowance is running below this level.</p>

During 2006-07 the Department recycled 67 per cent. of its waste, exceeding the specific target to recycle 40 per cent. of waste by 2010 and placing us in a strong position to meet the 2020 target to recycle 75 per cent. of our waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.2/2">The Department for Work and Pensions Head Office Estate (HOE) Programme undertook a diversity and equality assessment in each of the geographical areas in which closures were proposed which also addressed sustainability issues. The assessment showed that rationalisation would provide:</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/3" class="italic"> Impacts on the Environment</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/4" class="indent">More conference and meeting facilities (including video conferencing) reducing the need to travel;</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.2/6" class="indent">Good workspace practice enables the estate to better support the Department's core business while reducing resource usage and cost; and</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.2/8" class="italic"> Impacts on Society</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/9" class="indent">Improved working conditions for Departmental staff;</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/10" class="indent">Greater access to quiet rooms and open plan workspace thereby breaking down barriers, increasing staff morale and improving communication; and</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/11" class="indent">Many of the retained sites have gym facilities, nursery and holiday play schemes operating and additional facilities such as Prayer Rooms, contemplation and nursing mother rooms.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/12">In addition, the HOE Programme must also satisfy the DWP requirement to help to deliver the objectives of the 3rd UK Strategy for Sustainable Development and the programme team work proactively with others to ensure appropriate compliance is achieved including expert review of design proposals where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.719W.2/1">Since 2002-03, housing benefit and council tax benefit (HB and CTB) administration has improved significantly. In 2002-03, the national average for the time taken to deal with new claims to HB and CTB was 55 days, with the worst 15 per cent. taking an average of 99 days. These worst 15 per cent. performing authorities have made the greatest improvements in 2006-07 by processing claims in 54 days. In 2006-07, the national average had improved to 33 days.</p>

In 2006-07, HB and CTB administration accounted for only 6 per cent. of complaints, compared to 21 per cent. in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.2/3">We will continue to monitor local authorities' performance, engaging where appropriate with the poor performers and will continue to provide consultancy support and good practice on all aspects of HB and CTB administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.2/4">We are continually taking steps to simplify the system to make it easier for local authorities to administer the scheme, for example, the roll-out of the local housing allowance from April 2008 is a more straightforward and transparent way of calculating entitlement to housing benefit in the private sector. We have also developed a new IT link which passes information about DWP benefits straight to the computers of housing benefit/council tax benefit staff. These initiatives will help in the administration of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.2/1">The Department considers the issue of marginal deduction rates (MDRs) within the wider context of making work pay. It is not possible to calculate the MDR in this particular example because it would require assumptions to be made about rent levels and child care costs as well as issues such as disability. More generally, the number of families facing MDRs in excess of 70 per cent. has fallen by 545,000 since before Budget 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/2">The Government provide a broad range of support for lone parents that focuses on ensuring that work pays, that barriers to employment are addressed and that lone parents are made aware of the employment opportunities available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/3">The in-work credit (IWC) is currently being piloted in 22 Job Centre Plus districts and will be rolled out nationally from April 2008. The IWC further increases the financial benefit from a move into employment and is helping lone parents move away from benefit dependency. This, combined with tax credits and the national minimum wage, means that most lone parents are likely to be significantly better off in work.</p>

	<p pid="b.725W.5/1">DWP has specific processes in place to help ensure that deceased pensioners' details are not used for fraudulent purposes within the tax and benefit systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.5/2">When a person dies, DWP is notified of the registered death by the Office of National Statistics for deaths in England and Wales, the General Registrar's Office (Scotland) for deaths in Scotland and the General Registrar's Office (Northern Ireland) for deaths in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.5/3">When a death is notified, the date of death is recorded on the DWP customer information system (CIS) which in turn notifies the benefit systems in order to end payment of pensions and benefits. Local authorities are also notified for housing benefit and council tax benefit purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.5/4">CIS will also notify the HMRC national insurance recording system (NIRS) of this date of death for tax purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.5/5">Once an account held on CIS has a date of death inserted, there are specific checks in place to ensure that all access to deceased accounts for tax and benefit purposes is legitimate. There will often be some legitimate access to a deceased national insurance account held on CIS if for example, the surviving spouse claims pensions based on their late partner's national insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.5/6">This process helps protects the tax and benefit system from fraudulent attack using deceased pensioners' details. Processes are also in place, and will be utilised in the new year, to notify the Identity and Passport Service of deaths in order to prevent fraudulent use of a deceased person's identity to obtain, or use, a passport in the deceased person's name.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.3/1">It is inappropriate to relax restrictions designed to mitigate the risks of introducing or spreading avian influenza in the face of uncertain evidence about the potential role that racing pigeons might play.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.3/2">DEFRA's Veterinary Risk Assessment takes account of all available evidence, including evidence that pigeons can be susceptible to this disease. In particular, a study by the European Food Safety Authority in 2006 concluded that pigeons may have the potential to act as a 'bridging' species between waterfowl and poultry. It is likely that the susceptibility of pigeons to avian influenza, and the clinical picture caused by infection, is strongly associated with genetic and biological variations between different strains of the virus.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.3/3">There is research available which suggests that pigeons have limited susceptibility to some virus strains (mainly isolated some years ago), but other more recent publications<sup>(1)</sup> suggest the contrary and demonstrate that recently isolated strains of HPAI H5N1 could infect pigeons. This later study indicates that pigeons may be asymptomatic carriers of avian influenza virus.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.3/4">Pigeons could also spread AI mechanically through infective material on their feet and feathers, and there is potential, especially in long races, for pigeons to land and mingle with wild birds while still on the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.3/5">Pigeon races can still take place in the absence of avian influenza cases on the near continent. However, good biosecurity, record-keeping and notification requirements must be followed.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.6/1">Avian influenza can potentially be a fast spreading disease so it is important that we have robust measures in place to mitigate the risks. Therefore, we require any birds from outside the British Isles attending any type of bird gathering to first be resident in the British Isles for 28 days, to allow time for any clinical signs of disease to become evident. This mitigates the risk that birds might be infected when they enter the British Isles but are not yet showing clinical signs; that is, they are incubating the disease. When birds are gathered together it provides a high risk of dissemination of infectious disease should it be present.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.6/2">The geographical position of the Channel Islands means they are closer to continental Europe than the UK mainland, making it illogical to treat the Islands differently from France. For these purposes the islands are considered to be part of continental Europe rather than the British Isles. We therefore do not permit birds from the Channel Islands to attend gatherings in the British Isles without first being in the British Isles for 28 days. We have no plans to change this requirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.2/3">The transport premises exempted either tend to operate in a 24-7 environment or are places where essential maintenance takes place during the night due to the need to ensure that vehicles and the infrastructure is operational during the day. It is not open to the transport industry, without causing disruption to the wider economy, to switch operations to the daytime. In such cases, it is far more resource intensive to mitigate against light escaping into the atmosphere than is the case with other commercial premises where much of the activity will be carried out indoors and the question of light pollution can be addressed through adequate blinds.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/4">Where artificial lighting is required for operational, security and safety reasons in transport premises, it is in the public interest for Parliament to recognise this in the form of exemptions and to put beyond doubt that, in such circumstances, artificial lighting is not a statutory nuisance.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/5">The prime objective of extending the statutory nuisance provisions to include artificial lighting is to deal with local sources of bright light which cause annoyance to local residents, such as domestic security and decorative lighting.

	<p pid="b.741W.2/1">Dredging of marine minerals in English waters is carefully controlled under the Environmental Impact Assessment and Natural Habitats (Extraction of Minerals by Marine Dredging) (England and Northern Ireland) Regulations 2007. Currently, the area licensed for extraction in the UK is only 1 per cent. of the sea bed. The actual area dredged is even smaller, equating to less than 15 per cent. of the licensed area.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/2">All marine minerals dredging proposals are subject to an environmental impact assessment and must be accompanied by an environmental statement and coastal impact study. Dredging will only be permitted if conservative modelling and assessments indicate that no significant harm will occur to the marine environment and the coastline. As the dredging proceeds, such assessments are routinely checked through monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/3">The recently published Marine Aggregate Extraction summary report (Marine Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund, 2007) concluded that, based on recent research, modelling and field studies, almost all marine aggregate extraction areas are too far offshore to have any effect on the coastline.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.2/4">The Government wish to see indigenous mineral resources developed and utilised within a framework of sustainable development. Marine dredging of sand and gravel makes a significant contribution to the supply of aggregate to the construction industry, and is important for beach nourishment as well as flood and coastal defence schemes, particularly along the north Norfolk coasts. In 2006 the total marine aggregate production from the UK was 24.3 million tonnes, with 33 per cent. (8 million tonnes) derived from the east coast.</p>

When the Scottish Executive announced its withdrawal from the QMCP in June 2007, the draft consultation document was incomplete, with some further work required which would have been carried out before the planned autumn consultation. Subsequent developments have in any case overtaken certain aspects of the draft proposals. In these circumstances, the publication of the draft document in its present form would be misleading and unhelpful.</p>

This is because compensation is not payable if the disruption is caused by severe weather conditions (including flooding). Nonetheless, Severn Trent Water has put in place a community recovery fund of &pound;3.5 million to support a range of projects in Gloucestershire. This payment was made on a voluntary basis and will come from company profits rather than customers' bills.</p>

	<p pid="b.748W.8/1">Controls on imports of meat are laid down in European Community legislation. Imports are permitted from certain countries where foot and mouth disease (FMD) is present, but only where the disease is restricted to specific areas. In such cases, imports are only permitted from parts of the country that are free of disease or under strict conditions to ensure the meat does not come from any animal that may have come in contact with FMD before, during or after slaughter. These provisions are in line with guidelines established by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), the world animal health organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.748W.8/2">All meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by appropriate veterinary certification. It must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts where checks are carried out to ensure that import conditions have been met. All consignments are subject to identity and documentary checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo a physical check.</p>
	<p pid="b.748W.8/3">If an EU country experiences an outbreak of FMD, meat from that country can only be traded if it meets certain conditions laid down in Community law in relation to the origin and/or processing of the meat. Community law also allows Member States to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts of, EU and third countries where FMD is present.</p>

Authorities cannot charge for the disposal of waste classed as household waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.6/2">The CWR, as they pertain to waste, have not changed since 1992. However, it has recently come to DEFRA's attention that there is an inconsistent approach to councils' interpretation of these regulations. In the light of this, in October 2007, DEFRA wrote to all waste authorities in England clarifying its interpretation of the regulations and their waste data reporting duties.

	<p pid="b.778W.5/1">In May 2007 Government introduced the revised impact assessment process that aims to improve clarity and transparency of new regulations, including new requirements to summarise both the rationale for Government intervention and evidence supporting the final proposal. This has increased the focus on both the costs and benefits associated with regulation, with the strengthened ministerial declaration used to bolster the quality of the analysis further supported by improved arrangements within departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.5/2">The revised impact assessment process has also placed greater weight on post implementation reviews, which are used to establish whether implemented regulations are having the intended effect and whether they are implementing policy objectives efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.5/3">The Small Firm Impact Test (SFIT) is also a key element of this revised process. The SFIT enables policy makers to consider the impact that future policy may have on small business, and encourages examining at the earliest stages of policy design whether small businesses can be given a &quot;complete or partial&quot; exemption from new rules. Government are committed to creating new regulation only where it is needed, and that annual costs to micro, small and medium size businesses are quantified.</p>

	<p pid="b.779W.0/1">On the 7 of January Government published a consultation document on a Code of Practice on Good Guidance on Regulation. The Code outlines golden rules of good guidance which set the standards businesses and third sector organisations can expect from guidance on regulations. The consultation will run until the 31 of March to give businesses and others time to give their views on what the Code should contain.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/2">To reduce the burden of changing regulations for business, the majority of changes affecting business come into force on two dates (Common Commencement Dates). In October 2007 for the first time, simple, easy to understand guidance was produced with the help of business to support the changes taking effect and communicated to businesses via the Business Link website (<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a>) and business and professional organisations. Business can also sign up on the Business Link website for email alerts informing them of forthcoming regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.0/3">In addition, the Department publishes on its website an annual statement of forthcoming legislation where we provide details of all legislation for which BERR is responsible due to enter into force in the next 12 months.</p>

It is not, therefore, possible to provide estimates of the proportions of farmers becoming bankrupt. Bankruptcy statistics for the period covered are classified regionally according to the locations and areas of responsibility of Official Receivers' (ORs') offices, each of which covers a number of courts having insolvency jurisdiction, and are not directly comparable with administrative geographies, such as government office regions or districts. Additionally, statistics broken down by both detailed industry and regionally are not readily available.</p>

	<p pid="b.787W.2/1">The Department has worked closely with the Royal College of Pathologists to increase the number of paediatric pathologists in the national health service. Funding has been available for a Conversion Fellowship scheme to enable existing pathology consultants to retrain as paediatric pathologists to increase numbers in the short-term and this was vigorously promoted by the Royal College of Pathologists. However, the Conversion Fellowships were not taken up.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.2/2">However the number of trainee paediatric pathologists has risen slightly in the last few years. The Royal College of Pathologists' Paediatric Pathology Specialist Advisory Committee anticipates that any difficulties will be largely resolved as the extra trainees become qualified in the next year or two and long-term service needs will be met. Paediatric pathology will remain a specialised service and ways of working in the specialty are changing to reflect this. Paediatric pathology is developing in a smaller number of specialist centres to focus resources where there will be adequate expertise and support. We understand that coroners, including in the South West, are aware of where paediatric pathologists are currently located and are able to contact them. We have asked officials from the Department to discuss with their counterparts at the Ministry of Justice the information currently provided to coroners about the availability of paediatric pathologists.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.2/3">The Department does not collect data centrally about the number of paediatric pathologists in England. 2007 data from the Royal College of Pathologists show a total of 40 paediatric/perinatal pathology posts in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.788W.0/1">Personality disorders (PDs) are common conditions, although there is a considerable variation in severity, and in the degree of distress and dysfunction caused. The Department does not hold the requested information centrally, but research studies currently indicate a prevalence of 10 to 13 per cent. of the adult population in the community. The incidence in the sentenced prison population is around 64 per cent. for men and 50 per cent. for women. Estimates of the prevalence of personality disorders in psychiatric hospital populations vary between 36 to 67 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.0/2">The treatment of patients with personality disorders is increasing through the development of new PD services in line with the implementation of &quot;Managing Dangerous Offenders with a Severe Personality Disorder (1999), Personality Disorder; No Longer a Diagnosis of Exclusion&quot; (2004) and the Mental Health Act 2007. The development of effective services for those most a risk to the public is being piloted through the Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) programme which is a joint venture between the Department and the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.0/3">The number of people in England with a severe PD who are a significant risk to other people is currently estimated as being between 3,000-5,000. The DSPD programme provides assessment, treatment and management in conditions of high and medium security as well as in community residential and outreach services.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.0/4">In respect of all those people with a PD who are no risk to others it is intended that the provision of treatment and support for this patient population will be through the growth of PD appropriate services within mainstream mental health services. Services for this patient group have been piloted and evaluated in each region of England through the Department's PD programme and are now devolved to the national health service for wider development by primary care trusts at a local level. While there is no accurate estimate of the numbers of patients overall treated in the NHS over 1,500 patients with PD have been treated in the non forensic PD pilot services to date.</p>

Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Dr. Howells, did so with the Colombian Defence Minister and Vice President during their visits to the UK last year, and he repeated these concerns when visiting Colombia in November 2007. We have been impressed at the Colombian government's commitment to tackling this problem, but we recognise that more needs to be done. This is why the UK continues to provide the Colombian armed forces with human rights training and practical advice on military justice reform&mdash;which includes forging a closer working relationship between the Colombian Attorney General's Office and the Colombian armed forces&mdash;so to promote their adherence to international humanitarian law.</p>

	<p pid="b.792W.6/4">Since the expansion of the European Union (EU) in 2004, one of the specific tasks of the SWP has been the promotion of the exchange of information with EU Member States on aspects of health and safety in mining. The mandate of the SWP has recently been expanded to include the provision of advice to the EC on cooperation with other countries, in particular with China, in respect to health and safety in the mining and the extractive industries sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.794W.2/1">The European Commission takes fiduciary risk management very seriously. Most projects are managed internally and therefore the European Commission is able to ensure that it has complete control over all funds. The EU also funds the UN Refugee and Works Agency, which delivers support to Palestinians in Gaza, this funding is managed by strict UN controls. Other EU assistance to the Occupied Palestinian Territories is provided through the EU's Temporary International Mechanism. This provides allowances for public sector workers, including teachers, and for the poorest Palestinians. It also pays for basic services such as healthcare and provides fuel for electricity supplies. The Temporary International Mechanism is organised so that funds pass directly to beneficiaries and suppliers of goods and services. Either the World Bank or the European Commission approves all expenditure and all Palestinians paid under the Temporary International Mechanism are vetted against five different internationally recognised terrorist lists.</p>

	<p pid="b.807W.8/1">The main measure for tracking progress on increasing participation is currently the higher education initial participation rate (HEIPR). This is the sum of the HE initial participation rates for individual ages between 17 and 30 inclusive. It covers English-domiciled first time entrants to HE courses, which are expected to last for at least six months, at UK higher education institutions and English, Scottish and Welsh further education colleges, and who remain on their course for at least six months. The earliest figure is 39.3 per cent for 1999/2000 and the latest available figure is 42.8 per cent. for 2005/06.</p>

Participation rates based on this work are given on the supporting POLAR website (www.hefca,ac.uk/polar). These indicate that, for the cohort reaching 18 in 1997, the proportion of young people from Sunderland who entered higher education at age 18 or 19 was 20 per cent.. For the cohort reaching 18 in 2000, the proportion of young people from Sunderland who entered higher education at age 18 or 19 was 19 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.810W.2/1">There have been no reviews solely of the Student Loans Company in the last three years. However an end to end review of student finance delivery in England was commissioned in 2005 The review looked at the arrangements for delivering financial support to students, including the future role of the Student Loans Company. The findings of the review were published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase> and a copy of the report has been placed in the Library. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase>, I announced in a statement to the House our response to the review including plans for transforming the student finance service which will be available for new students applying in September 2008 to enter higher education in 2009/10 academic year.</p>
