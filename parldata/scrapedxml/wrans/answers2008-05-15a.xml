	<p pid="a.1663W.6/1">In 2004, the Department introduced a National Service Framework (NSF) for Children, Young People and Maternity Services to set standards. Copies of the NSF are available in the Library. Asthma has a specific care pathway within the NSF, which serves as a benchmark in guiding national health service commissioners in procuring efficient, effective and child/family orientated services, and also serves as a reference for appraisal by families, service commissioners and the Healthcare Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1663W.6/2">The NHS Choices website, launched June 2007, contains a wide and expanding range of information about asthma to help sufferers manage their condition. This includes information on causation, preventive measures, treatments, and comparative data on primary and secondary care providers. Later this year, an asthma pathway will bring together in one place a range of information about the five stages of the condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1663W.6/3">Published Quality and Outcome Framework scores indicate how each general practitioner practice in England performs in the delivery of recognised best practice in asthma care against the national standard, and that of the local primary care trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1663W.6/4">World-class commissioning is an ambitious initiative that is being rolled out across the entire national health service, with the purpose of strengthening the commissioning of health and wellbeing services across the board. The World-Class Commissioning Programme will improve health outcomes for people with asthma just as it will improve outcomes for people with any health need or condition, through transforming the way that health and care services are commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1663W.6/5">In addition, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has appraised the following asthma treatments: inhaler systems (devices) in children under the age of five years with chronic asthma; corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children aged 12 years and over; corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic asthma chronic asthma in older children (5-15 years) and omalizumab for severe persistent allergic asthma.</p>
	<p pid="a.1663W.6/6">Where NICE has given a positive recommendation that the NHS should provide this treatment, primary care trusts are statutorily obliged to provide funding, or asthma.</p>

	<p pid="a.1664W.5/1">On the recommendation of the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UK NSC), a newborn cystic fibrosis screening programme was introduced in England in 2001 to identify babies with cystic fibrosis. The screening programme is not designed to test for cystic fibrosis carrier status. A small proportion of babies (about one in 100) are unavoidably identified during the testing as cystic fibrosis carriers. This can happen if a mutation analysis of a blood sample is required after the biochemical test. In such cases, in line with other newborn screening programmes, parents will be advised that their child is a carrier. The UK NSC keeps all its policy advice under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1682W.3/3">Following Electoral Commission recommendations, section 16 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 required that councils consult the returning officer as part of their review of polling places. Councils must seek the views of people who have particular expertise in relation to access to premises or facilities for people with disabilities when carrying out reviews, and were required to carry out such a review during 2007.</p>

Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Our proposed approach is one based on education and incentivisation, rather than restriction. We believe the evidence supports this approach. However, we are keen to hear everybody's views, and our consultation seeks opinions about our general approach as well as specific measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1695W.2/5" class="indent">Information on the value of child maintenance debt is only available for cases managed by the new computer system (CS2) at constituency level from February 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.2/6" class="indent">The amount of debt on the new computer (CS2) owed by non-resident parents where the parent with care lives in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency was &pound;2,194,000 at March 2007 and &pound;2,535,000 at March 2008. The latest figures for March 2008 are un-audited and subject to change. Final national figures will be published with the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.2/7" class="indent">This debt has accrued over the 15 years of the Child Support Agency's operation and is owed by non-resident parents as a result of their failure to meet their responsibilities to their children. Some non-resident parents do their utmost to avoid their responsibilities, for example by moving house or changing jobs whenever the Agency tries to collect maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.2/8" class="indent">The Agency has collected and arranged a record breaking &pound;1.01 billion in child maintenance in the year to March 2008, of which &pound;126m was arrears.

	<p pid="a.1700W.0/3">The information is not available in the format requested because of the restrictions of the breadth and reliability of the data available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.0/4">As part of the Equality Impact Assessment covering changes to the time for claiming housing benefit and council tax benefit for pensioners and a change to the backdating period allowed within housing benefit and council tax benefit for working age customers, which is available on the DWP website, an estimate of the proportion of housing benefit and council tax benefit caseloads affected by the proposals is provided. There are, however, important caveats to these estimates which must be noted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.0/5">Figures on the number of claims that are successfully backdated are derived from the single housing benefit extract (HBSD-IAD scan). The backdating variable in the single housing benefit extract was introduced relatively recently (April 2007) and accordingly we have no means of corroborating how robust the data is against historical data. Furthermore, given that the data only goes back six months, there is an insufficient pool of evidence to derive reliable figures from the data. These concerns should be allayed with time as the scan data improves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.0/6">Based on the first six months of data available, it is estimated that approximately 0.2 per cent. of new housing benefit and council tax benefit claims would be affected. In absolute terms, this is approximately 3,000 housing benefit and 3,000 council tax benefit claims per year (in Great Britain). These figures may be subject to revision as more data become available and raw figures should be treated with caution given the nature of the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.0/7" class="italic"> Pension Credit</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.0/8">The information is not available in the format requested. Precise information on the time customers take to claim pension credit (known as backdating) is not routinely collected. The information in the following table estimates the possible maximum extent of backdating by examining the difference between the date of first payment and date at which entitlement begins. In some cases where payment starts after entitlement the delay will be due to processing times, evidence gathering and verification work which routinely accompanies claims for pension credit.</p>

(This is a year on year improvement from 14.5 per cent. in 2005-06 and 13.4 per cent. in 2006-07.) The Army continues to monitor separated service with due diligence utilising directed recruitment and retention initiatives targeted at Pinch point Trades in particular.</p>

There has been an increase over the past year due to changes in the reporting procedures that have brought the RAF into line with the RN and Army rather than an increase in commitments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1702W.13/12">These statistics require further explanation. Patient referrals cover a wide range of injuries. Furthermore, as well as serving as the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (its core task), Headley Court is also the Regional Rehabilitation Unit for London and Overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702W.13/13">Over the period covered by these statistics, there has been an increase in military operational tempo. This has led to an increase in patient activity overall and a more complex patient group requiring repeat admission to Headley Court. There have been changes in the balance between the numbers of patients requiring a ward bed and those who do not, including an increase in specialist clinics such as consultant-led visiting clinics and prosthetic clinics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702W.13/14">The increase in ward beds to the current total of 66 (through the addition of a 30-bed temporary ward annexe in May 2007) and improved ways of working have helped to enable the increased throughput of patients. However, it continues to be the case that most injuries treated at Headley Court have not been sustained on current operations in Afghanistan or Iraq. As an example, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>, 46 ward beds were occupied, of which 23 were occupied by service personnel earlier evacuated from Afghanistan and Iraq. Most of the non-ward bed spaces (around 110 in total) are occupied by in-patients on a regular basis, but mainly by patients who have sustained injuries elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702W.13/15">However, information requested by operated theatre could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1704W.3/1">The following tables provide information on current pinch point trades. As can be seen, not all of the information on current pinch point trades is available. This is largely evident in the Army figures as there is insufficient data held on the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system. During the transition to JPA, which was introduced to the Army in April 2007, some data was lost. This data is currently being rebuilt although it may be some time before reliable information is available. Target figures are not available as they do not exist. Not all pinch point trades can be rectified by inflow as the pinch point may appear at more senior levels; this loss of experience cannot necessarily be grown through inflow. Some gaps can be filled by promotion pull but the challenge is to stem voluntary outflow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704W.3/2">Data for previous years is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. All three Services employ retention measures targeted at specific trade groups. For example, in the RN financial retention incentives (FRIs) are used to retain GR7 Instructors (&pound;100,000 for pilot), MERLIN Aircrew and Lieutenant X Sub-Mariner Advanced Warfare Qualified (&pound;25,000 with a Return of Service of four years). Other incentives include more flexible use of Full Term Commissions and the introduction of a Professional Aviator Pay Spine for air crewmen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704W.3/3">Similarly, in the Army, FRIs are used as incentives for Infantry at identified key decision points and there is considerable focus on improving wastage during training. To retain Royal Engineer Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel the Army has introduced specialist pay and extended the course to increase first-time pass rate. REME Recovery Mechanic is another trade where the removal of Class 1 time bars, development of an apprenticeship scheme and the instigation of early eligibility for promotion to LCpl has helped to aid retention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704W.3/4">The RAF have FRIs for a number of trades (fire fighter, nurse and gunner); introduced more flexible manning policies (such as re-engagement to 22 years for selected Base Rank personnel) and opened up Continuance as a way of retaining experience.</p>

This announcement followed completion of the MOD's assessment of the evidence gathered during the utility vehicle trials and the further work to fully understand the commercial implications of the three competing designs.

	<p pid="a.1717W.8/1">Defence Ministers have met their counterparts on a number of occasions where the subject of NHS reservists was discussed. Officials within the MOD and the UK Health Departments have further advanced this issue under the auspices of the MOD/UK Health Departments Partnership Board. The Partnership Board is currently exploring a number of ways in which NHS staff can be encouraged to become reservists. These include targeted MOD recruitment campaigns and the education of NHS employers on the benefits to the NHS, in terms of clinical and leadership skills, of their staff being members of the volunteer reserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717W.8/2">The MOD and the Department of Health are also developing the concept of sponsored medical reservists. The aim is to encourage specialist civilian clinicians to mobilise for a limited period within a deployed medical facility. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced our intentions in a speech in April at a dinner hosted by the Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers (SaBRE) organisation. The invited guests at the dinner consisted of NHS executives from NHS Trusts in the North-West. As part of his speech he also spoke of his support for NHS staff being members of the volunteer reserves and his hope that NHS employers would actively support staff who became reservists.</p>

	<p pid="a.1720W.2/1">We welcome the European Commission's Global Climate Change Alliance, which aims to help poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change to increase their capabilities to adapt to the effects of climate change and to have their voice better heard in the international climate change negotiations. We believe that the GCCA's proposal to pilot a programmatic approach to integrating climate resilience into development planning will help to provide valuable lessons for future adaptation responses. It is essential that this is well co-ordinated with other adaptation financing initiatives and is delivered in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. We look forward to reviewing the EC's working paper on the GCCA and will consider support once this has been presented to member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.1730W.8/1">Nationally, the Government are committed to improving the life chances of children and young people, by having fewer young people affected by crime and reduce youth victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/2">The main initiative to tackle crime on and around school premises has been the Safer School Partnerships (SSPs) originally launched in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/3">SSPs are a successful mechanism for ensuring structured joint working between schools and police, to identify and support children and young people regarding as being at high risk of victimisation, offending and social exclusion. There are now about 500 SSPs of one form or another across the country. Evaluations have shown that they are proving effective in improving behaviour and attendance, developing strong and positive relationships between the police and young people, and to help young people develop a sense of being part of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/4">Because of the proven success of SSPs, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has been working closely with the Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to encourage more schools and police to engage in this type of early intervention and preventative work which is so vital to achieving the outcomes we are all committed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/5">There is already a great deal of work going on across Government to tackle offenders and help vulnerable young people achieve the Every Child Matters outcome to 'Stay Safe'. Initiatives include Youth Inclusion Support Panels and the Youth Inclusion Programme. And since 2004, we have invested over &pound;45 million in Youth Offending Teams which have pioneered antisocial behaviour prevention activities for young people at most risk. Their work includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/6" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Support Panels and;</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/7" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/8">The Home Office has invested in other prevention programmes such as Positive Futures. Around 22,000 young people are currently involved in Positive Futures projects nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/9">The Youth Taskforce has also been established at the Department for Children, Schools and Families to focus on delivering positive outcomes for young people. The Taskforce is focusing more on preventing teenagers from experiencing serious problems&mdash;such as being drawn into youth crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/10">In Stockton, the AntiSocial Behaviour (ASB) team in Stockton borough council is working closely with schools to reduce crime in and around school premises. The ASB team consists of seconded police officers, a fire officer and council officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/11">The emphasis is very much on preventing crime in the first place and building relationships with young people before crimes are committed. Each ASB officer covers specific wards in Stockton and works closely with schools in their area. They visit schools in uniform to encourage young people not to accept crime and to report it when they do encounter it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/12">Where there is a case of crime or antisocial behaviour in or around schools, the ASB officer will go and speak to the young person at school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.8/13">Where appropriate, a form will be completed detailing what they have done and their parents will be informed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1735W.5/1">The Drug Strategy is focused on illegal drugs and the most dangerous drugs, including class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine. The reason for this is that illegal drugs cause significant and wide ranging problems to individuals, families and communities, including drug-related crime and health harms. class A drug use generates an estimated &pound;15.4 billion in crime and health costs each year and between a third and a half of acquisitive crime is estimated to be drug related. Due to this, the new strategy focuses on achieving a long-term and sustainable reduction in the harms associated with illegal drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1735W.5/2">The mechanisms by which individuals may develop dependency and, therefore, the means by which such dependency may be tackled, differ in the cases of illegal drugs and legally prescribed drugs. For example, interventions to limit the supply of illegal drugs would be inappropriate to deal with prescription drugs. Similarly, the harms caused by prescription drugs differ from those generated by illegal drug use. The latter give rise to predominantly crime and social harms, whereas prescription drugs give rise to health harms and, indeed, health harms requiring interventions other than those employed in the treatment of dependency on illegal drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate for prescribed tranquillisers to be subject to the measures set out in the strategy to tackle the harms caused by illegal drug use.</p>

	<p pid="a.1744W.2/1">We have considered a range of evidence relating to risk factors which may increase the likelihood of TB in cattle herds. An association between increased herd size and an increased risk of TB herd breakdown, and persistence of infection, has been reported by several recent studies in the scientific literature. However, the relationship is not straightforward. Testing more animals is likely to result in an increased probability of obtaining a positive test result in the herd, and herd size may be a proxy for other management-related risk factors such as herd turnover rates and stocking density, farm enterprise factors, and risks from foodstuffs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1747W.2/1">In 2004 we banned pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels within 12 miles of the south west coast of England (within ICES area VIIe) as this fishery was shown to have relatively high levels of cetacean by-catch. Other bass fisheries, such as gillnetting and hand lining, and pair trawl fisheries targeting other species have not been affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1747W.2/2">The UK asked that the ban on pelagic pair trawling for bass be extended to the vessels of other member states, who are currently permitted to fish between six and 12 miles off the south west English coast (under Article 9 of Council Regulation EC No. 2371/2002), but this was turned down by the European Commission. We could therefore only take unilateral action for our own vessels out to 12 miles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1747W.2/3">There is ongoing research funded by the Department and carried out by the Sea Mammal Research Unit to monitor by-catch in all relevant UK fishery sectors, including the bass pair trawl fishery, and to research by-catch mitigation measures in order to identify measures that are effective at deterring cetaceans over the long-term and that are safe and cost-effective for the industry. Further analysis of the effectiveness of the 12 mile ban of sea bass pair trawling will be undertaken as further data becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1747W.2/4">The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 2004, based on analytical assessments of UK inshore bass stocks, suggest that the bass stock is fished sustainably. Updated assessments have been carried out by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), in 2006 and 2008. These confirm the earlier assessment indicating that current levels of both bass landings and biomass are high.</p>
	<p pid="a.1747W.2/5">The 2007 UK report to the European Commission on observed cetacean by-catch levels in certain fisheries, as required by Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004, includes estimates of common dolphin and harbour porpoise by-catch in the south-west for 2005 and 2006 in gillnet, tangle net and bass mid-water pair trawls. The UK is not due to report to the European Commission on 2006-07 observed by-catch levels until June. It is for each member state to monitor by-catch on their own vessels and submit their findings to the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1748W.9/1">Trends in global food prices are analysed annually in the 'Agricultural Outlook' prepared jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Changes in G8 policies have not been identified as major drivers of recent developments, with the exception of support for biofuel crops. There is already a substantial economic literature on the wider question of G8 agricultural support. This shows that such support tends to increase food output, reduce prices in the rest of the world, and increase the overall cost of food production by displacing production from low-cost to G8 countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1749W.2/1">The Government aim to reduce the amount of food waste created by businesses and consumers; and to encourage better management through environmentally friendly treatment of waste where prevention is not possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749W.2/2">The Government funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has a target to divert 100,000 tonnes of food waste from landfill by March 2008. Retailers agreed in the Courtauld Commitment One Year On event, in November 2006, to work with WRAP to help deliver this target. In recent months they have been joined by many significant food manufacturers. This work will provide the evidence base as to how post-consumer food waste can be diverted and the Government will be expecting retailers and manufacturers to help tackle the climate change impacts of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749W.2/3">Food waste collections from commercial businesses were promoted by WRAP's Recycle at Work programme from 2006-08. WRAP commissioned four commercial food waste trials during this time; they ran from October 2006 to June 2007. WRAP commissioned independent evaluation of the trials between October 2007 and March 2008. The Executive Summary of the evaluation will be made available on the WRAP website shortly. WRAP's Good Practice Guidance on providing recycling services to businesses is also available from the WRAP website, providing guidance on setting up and marketing recycling services to Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs).</p>
	<p pid="a.1749W.2/4">WRAP advises local authorities on waste collection arrangements.

	<p pid="a.1750W.5/3" class="indent">triggers and barriers to registration on the part of tradespeople;</p>

	<p pid="a.1750W.5/7">ENCAMS was asked to look at what materials were collected alongside litter in public places and how they were dealt with and measured as part of the development of the 'Recycle on the Go' Voluntary Code of Practice, shortly to be launched by DEFRA. This was carried out between January and March 2007 and was funded through ENCAMS' DEFRA grant. It is not yet published but a summary is available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1756W.5/2">For the future, the Government have taken steps to provide better protection and information for consumers. We have worked with the other hamper companies to put in place effective protection for customers' prepayments. The companies have responded by introducing new safeguards for consumers' money in the form of independently-controlled, ring-fenced trust accounts. These arrangements will be monitored by a new trade body, the Christmas Prepayments Association, under the terms of a new code of practice. We understand that the Association will be seeking approval of the code by the OFT under the terms of its consumer codes approval scheme. The Government have also given the Office of Fair Trading &pound;1 million for a new awareness campaign so that consumers are better aware of their options for Christmas savings and are empowered to make decisions that are right for their own circumstances. However, the Government have no plans to provide any compensation in this case.</p>

The Government published the consultation paper &quot;A Framework for Fairness: Proposals for a Single Equality Bill for Great Britain&quot; in June 2007 which looked at the case for extending the prohibition of age discrimination to the provision of goods, facilities and services, except where it can be objectively justified.

	<p pid="a.1770W.9/1">The FE reform programme which we have implemented since the FE White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances published in March 2006' is transforming the Post 16 vocational system to one which is demand led. This will enable new and emerging industries to develop the skilled workforce they will need. We have instituted a process of vocational reform inviting sector skills councils, on behalf of employers, to undertake sector skills reviews to identify key vocational qualifications for the future of their sectors. World-class apprenticeships commit us to boost the range of apprenticeships and we would expect the new National Apprenticeship Service to identify the skills needs of business involved with emerging technologies and to work with sector skills bodies to develop appropriate frameworks. Train to Gain enables employers to support the development of the workforce. Foundation Degrees Forward, an independent body funded by HEFCE, supports the development and validation of high quality Foundation Degrees. They support employer engagement across higher education programmes generally and in relation to Foundation degrees specifically. To support FE reforms the Quality Improvement Agency have recently refocused the National Teaching and Learning Change Programme enabling it to respond to local and regional needs more flexibly. This will enable teachers and lecturers to identify new teaching subjects and develop the skills learners' needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770W.9/2">In addition the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and Technology Strategy Board has issued a call to fund up to two new Innovation and Knowledge Centres (IKCs), each of up to &pound;9.45 million support over five years. IKCs will promote the early commercialisation of world class research, by combining within a single integrated centre the best research with the best business development, market analysis and commercialisation skills and partnerships to accelerate its exploitation. For each centre provision has been made to support postgraduate training.</p>

	<p pid="a.1772W.11/1">The recent upgrade of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) corporate website is part of a wider project to deliver a new web platform and improved web presence for the FCO over five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1772W.11/2">The work will provide a single technical platform for all the FCO websites (including the main FCO website, Arabic and Urdu versions of the FCO website, UKvisas website, the FCO Freedom of Information website, and 229 embassy, high commission and special mission sites in multiple languages) as well as new designs, content, functionality and a new hub and spoke model for delivering business support.</p>

The project is on target to cost &pound;19.2 million over five years. This includes running costs, for example hosting and support, and some staff salaries. The cost of the project to date is &pound;9.2 million which breaks down as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.1773W.2/1">A comprehensive review of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) online activity was undertaken during the summer of 2005 by digital agency Rufas Leonard. This produced a web strategy which set the direction for the development of the FCO's web presence for the next five to seven years. This strategy underpinned the business case for the development of the FCO's new websites which was approved by the FCO's Investment Committee in January 2006. The project to redevelop the new websites has also been subject to the Office of Government Commerce Gateway Review Process and was rated green at both Gateway 3 and 4.</p>

	<p pid="a.1776W.2/2">Future policy options are under review. We believe that our current working relationships, and contracts with our contractors in Iraq, ensure that any cases of alleged crime or misconduct would be brought to our attention promptly, so that we could investigate. Where such misconduct is substantiated our procurement guidelines specify that we can terminate the contract. We expect the highest professional standards of those holding Government contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.2/3">On the broader issue of the regulation of the overseas operations of private military and security companies, registered in or operating from the UK, my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw), requested a review by officials of the options. The review was completed in 2005 and considered ways forward including self-regulation, national regulation&mdash;based on export controls&mdash;and/or company licensing systems. We have also considered international regulation on the basis of common international values and norms. However, the review and subsequent analysis, has also highlighted difficulties with regard to implementation or enforcement, with respect to each of the options. We have also considered the complex legal matter of extra-territorial jurisdiction. These issues have since been the subject of extensive Ministerial correspondence and official consultation. If it is decided that regulation is appropriate, the Government will put the proposals to public consultation.</p>

The UN Secretary-General's Personal Envoy, Peter van Walsum, has brought the parties together for four rounds of negotiations, held in June and August 2007 and January and March 2008. The UK folly supports these negotiations, with a view to achieving a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We have encouraged the parties to maintain their commitment to the negotiation process. UNSCR 1813 called on parties to continue these negotiations in a spirit of realism and compromise, and we hope a fifth round will be held soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.1785W.0/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has been working with partners to develop a second pilot enterprise summer schools programme, within the 'Young Chambers' (YCs) initiative launched in 2007 as part of the enterprise education strategy. Partners in YCs are the British Chambers of Commerce, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT), the National Education Business Partnerships Network, and YCUK. The SSAT has invited all schools taking part in the Young Chamber programme to organise a 'summer enterprise workshop', offering support of &pound;1,000 from allocated funds. The aim of the summer enterprise workshop is to give students a real experience of business&mdash;for example around entrepreneurship, setting up and running a business&mdash;using practical input from a local business or employer, and other relevant local partners. I am pleased to say that 25 schools have applied to date, and we hope that the number will rise to around 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.1785W.0/2">We have taken account of the evaluation of the 2006 Young Enterprise summer schools, and the SSAT is sending a copy to all applicant schools to ensure that the positive lessons can be learned. That evaluation was commissioned by Young Enterprise and funded from within the allocation made to them for the summer schools. The evaluation of the Schools' Enterprise Education Network (SEEN) carried out by York Consultancy was commissioned by the SSAT and funded from within the allocation made to them for SEEN; the DCSF intends to issue an Invitation to Tender for the future management of SEEN, and in doing so will take account of the recommendations made. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman when I have details of the costs of the two evaluations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1786W.6/2">The childcare sufficiency assessments which all local authorities were required to complete by <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> took account of the affordability of childcare, which is one of the factors which can be regarded as the 'benchmark' of sufficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1786W.6/3">This Government recognise that childcare costs are a serious matter for some families in some areas, which is why we are doing more than ever before to make good quality childcare and early education accessible and affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1786W.6/4">We are investing &pound;3 billion per year to support free early education, so all 3 and four year olds, irrespective of the employment status of their parents, can benefit from 12.5 hours of free early years provision for 38 weeks per year. This increases to 15 hours by 2010 and will be delivered more flexibly to meet families' needs. In addition, we announced in the Children's Plan an additional 100m to pilot a free entitlement for 20,000 of our most disadvantaged two year olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1786W.6/5">We provide substantial help (totalling over &pound;3 million a day) through the tax credit system, in providing up to 80 per cent. of childcare costs. This helps nearly 450,000 families, with nearly 280,000 of these families being those with children under the age of five.</p>
	<p pid="a.1786W.6/6">The budget increased the commitment to childcare by announcing additional pilots to support new approaches to childcare, building on good practice from the additional childcare support provided by the &pound;33 million London Childcare Affordability Programme. In addition, the Government will also pilot new child development grants of 200 in 10 local authority areas, payable where parents take up their childcare places and have contact with their local Children's Centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.1791W.0/1">Whether a Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) check is required of an employee of a business offering a work experience placement, either as part of current statutory work related learning at key stage 4 or as part of a diploma course from September 2008, depends on the nature of the placement, and an assessment of the risks involved. Risk assessments, and CRB checks where required, are frequently carried out by Education Business Partnerships on behalf of schools which have the duty to ensure this is done. There are no plans to carry out Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) checks on everyone a young person comes into contact with during a work experience placement including those which are part of diploma requirements. This is because looking after, training and supervising a young person during the course of their placement is not part of those employees' day to day role. CRB checks, where selectively required, have been carried out on employees of businesses offering work experience placement at KS4 for a number of years. The track record in respect of safeguarding young people during their work experience is first class, with no reported instances or difficulties.</p>

This would mean that all teachers currently in service and who remain in service on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2008</phrase> would receive a minimum uplift of 2.45 per cent. About 40 per cent. of teachers progress to a higher point in any one year and these teachers would therefore receive additional increases.</p>
