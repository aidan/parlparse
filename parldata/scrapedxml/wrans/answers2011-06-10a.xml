	<p pid="a.492W.0/2">We are increasing funding for apprenticeships to &#163;1.4 billion, sufficient to train over 360,000 apprentices in 2011-12. In the Budget we announced an additional &#163;180 million package for 50,000 additional adult apprenticeship places over the spending review period. This is on top of the plans for growth in the apprenticeships programme that we published in Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth in November 2010 (for adults aged 19 and over) and the YPLA 16-19 &#8220;Funding Statement&#8221; (December 2010).</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.0/3">In support of the coalition Government's principle of greater freedom, Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. It is for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.0/4">Accordingly, take-up of apprenticeships by region follows employer demand and we are not able to provide estimates of the geographical distribution of funding or Apprenticeship places, as these would be either too broad to be of use or would be potentially misleading.</p>

	<p pid="a.493W.9/1">At the beginning of the current financial year HMRC's staffing levels were at 66,000 full-time equivalent posts. HMRC's change plan anticipates that by the end of the financial year this will have reduced to 63,400 full-time equivalent posts, a reduction that HMRC is confident can be achieved through natural wastage as people leave the department to retire or to take up new posts in other organisations. HMRC will do everything it can to avoid compulsory redundancies and these will only be used as a very last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.493W.9/2">The reduced staffing level will not be detrimental to customer service. HMRC's new customer-centric strategy focuses on the needs of its particular customer groups and enables it to provide an improved service and an improved customer experience at a lower cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.494W.8/2">The exemption in point is contained in the disguised remuneration legislation in Finance (No. 3) Bill which is being introduced to counter attempts to use third party arrangements to avoid tax on employment income. The specific provision excludes payments made to MPs by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). IPSA, who are otherwise a third party for the purposes of the legislation, makes certain payments to MPs to enable them to carry out their parliamentary duties. This is not tax avoidance and has therefore been excluded from the new rules. Other third party arrangements involving MPs would not be excluded from the new rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.496W.9/2">The Department for Work and Pensions do not hold specific management information on young carers as they are the responsibility of the Department for Education. However, 2001 census data suggests there are approximately 139,000 young carers in England, of whom 22,000 are caring for 20-50 hours a week. (More recent informal sources suggest that the numbers may be higher and we await the 2011 census data to confirm this.) Information on the number of households receiving the severe disability premium is given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.9/3">The issue of young carers is a challenging one and supporting them is a priority for is Government. The Government's new Carers Strategy, &#8220;Recognised, valued and supported: Next Steps for the Carers Strategy&#8221; has a strong focus on supporting young carers. It emphasises the important of adult and children's services, alongside the voluntary sector, working together to identify and support young carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.9/4">The Government will continue to work with local authorities and the voluntary sector to break down barriers to effective practice and support the spread of evidence-based practice. That is why the Department for Education is funding the Children's Society and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers up to &#163;1.5 million until March 2013. They will encourage 'whole family' approaches to supporting young carers and promote the new e-learning module that the Department for Education has developed for school staff on the needs of young carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.9/5">My Department are considering the position of young carers within universal credit. For individuals and households who currently receive the severe disability premium there will be transitional protection where their universal credit would be less than under the old system, provided their circumstances remain the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.9/6">Information on the number of households receiving the severe disability premium is given in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.499W.8/1">We are tackling these issues through a range of initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.8/2">The Work programme will be the single biggest payment by results employment programme the United Kingdom has ever seen, providing personalised support to an expected 2.4 million claimants over the next five years helping individuals find and sustain employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.8/3">Work programme providers will not be required to deliver centrally specified support, which may be inappropriate for many claimants, but instead will be given the freedom to innovate and develop personalised support.

	<p pid="a.499W.8/4">In addition to this, the support Jobcentre Plus advisers have available to offer is being bolstered with a series of Get Britain Working measures. Government are asking for the active engagement of employers, partners and claimants themselves in every community in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.8/5">From April 2011 we have put in place a much more flexible and personalised approach to the way Jobcentre Plus delivers to claimants. Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers will have far more flexibility to judge which interventions will help their claimants, tailored to personal and local labour market needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.8/6">To help support young people, in this year's Budget the Chancellor announced funding for up to 100,000 work experience placements over the next two years as part of our support for moving young people into the world of work and providing them with the experience that employers tell us is really important. We are also funding up to 40,000 additional apprenticeship places for young unemployed people over the life of this Parliament and plan to introduce an extension to work experience placements where employers want to offer a young person an apprenticeship which will help smooth the transition for both the employer and the young person.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.8/7">The Prime Minister recently announced an enhanced &#163;60 million package of support including a &#163;30 million Innovation Fund, provision of early access Work programme places for vulnerable 18 year olds, and additional support for 16 and 17 year old jobseeker's allowance claimants.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.2/1">We expect schools to provide a broad and balanced curriculum which meets the needs of their pupils and in particular, we said in our Schools White Paper that children should expect to be given a rich menu of cultural experiences. Darren Henley is currently undertaking an independent review of cultural education, which is expected to report at the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.2/2">A thorough review of the national curriculum is also under way, which aims to develop a national curriculum which is rigorous and results in high standards and coherence in what is taught in schools. As part of the review, consideration will be given to whether art and design, music and design and technology should remain compulsory subjects within the national curriculum and, if so, at which key stages. Drama is not currently a statutory national curriculum subject, though pupils are expected to be able to use dramatic techniques to make progress in English.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.2/3">We will be announcing our proposals early next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.5/2">We are taking a phased approach to the review of the national curriculum. We have announced that the statutory core subjects&#8212;English, mathematics and science&#8212;will remain compulsory at all four key stages in future, along with physical education. In the first phase of the review we are designing new programmes of study for those subjects, with a view to first teaching in schools from September 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.5/3">For all other subjects, including design and technology, we believe it is right that there should be a debate about whether they should remain part of the national curriculum, with statutory programmes of study, or whether it should be for schools to decide the content of their courses in those subjects as well as the way they should be taught. We have recently concluded a call for evidence on this and other issues and are currently analysing the results, along with a range of other evidence. We will announce our proposals early next year, and there will then be a further period of consultation before final decisions are taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.0/1">The Government are providing sufficient funding to pay for a place in education for any 16 to 18-year-old who wants one and all local authorities are expected to have a process to offer 17-year-olds a suitable place in education or training by the end of September. This process, which has been known as the 'September Guarantee', aims to ensure that all those who left education at 16 have a further opportunity to engage. 93.7% of 16-year-olds and 85.2% of 17-year-olds participated in education or work based education and training at the end of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.0/2">We recognise that the small group of young people who are not participating need additional support to do so. We are committed to raising the age at which all young people will participate in education or training to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015. Local authorities have a statutory duty to support young people to participate, including providing targeted support to vulnerable young people. We are providing funding for this through the Early Intervention Grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.0/3">We know that pupils who do not achieve good GCSEs are more likely to leave education at 16. We set out, alongside our plans to accept all of Alison Wolfs recommendations on vocational education, plans to review provision for these pupils, with the aim of increasing the proportion who are able to progress directly onto post-16 courses that will equip them with the skills that employers value. This review will build upon the findings of an independent evaluation of Foundation Learning, which already provides a route back into formal education for many young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.0/4">Young people all have individual needs and we want to ensure that local areas have the freedom and flexibility to meet these. We have commissioned 35 local authorities to explore new approaches to achieving full participation in their areas. This is intended to be a locally-led programme where the areas can share their findings with each other, and with authorities in areas that are doing less well, so that they can develop and build on each others' work.</p>

We have had no choice but to close the embassy in order to protect our staff from the risks that working at an insufficiently secure embassy building in Jakarta would entail. We have registered our serious concern with the Indonesians authorities and have been working extremely hard with them to reach a solution whereby security is restored at the embassy. We cannot compromise the safety and security of our British and Indonesian staff. Our embassy will remain closed until we and our Indonesian counterparts reach and implement a viable solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.9/2">The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague), has discussed this issue with Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-20">20 May 2011</phrase>, and I raised it again when I met him at the Asia Europe meeting in Budapest on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June 2011</phrase>. Senior officials at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have also raised the seriousness of this situation with the Indonesian ambassador, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-06">6 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.9/3">Our embassy is continuing to provide essential services to British nationals and businesses from secure fall-back locations but these do not offer a viable long-term alternative. However, the unfortunate and unexpectedly prolonged closure of the main building is having a damaging impact on the embassy's work, and the services we can offer UK business, British citizens and our Indonesian partners. Normal services will be resumed as soon as it is safe for staff to move back into the main embassy building.</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.2/1">We are concerned by a sharp increase in the level of demolitions in East Jerusalem and Area C. The embassy in Tel Aviv raises the issue of demolitions regularly with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, most recently in the case of Al Walaja on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-23">23 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.2/2">The focus between the Israelis and the Palestinians should be on confidence-building steps with the aim of giving momentum to re-start negotiations. In this respect, house demolitions or the eviction of Palestinians from their homes are deeply unhelpful and cause unnecessary suffering to (ordinary) Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.2/3">We continue to contribute towards the ongoing work of the International Peace and Cooperation Centre in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which helps Palestinians better understand and effectively use the Israeli planning laws to prevent houses from being subject to (a) demolition orders in East Jerusalem and Area C and to help integrate planning in Area C with Areas A and B. The project also helps to facilitate the provision of better living and housing conditions in East Jerusalem neighbourhoods through planning and zoning.</p>

A Holy See communiqu&#233; of <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-06">6 June</phrase> said that the first phase of the Apostolic Visitation had been concluded and that an account of the results of the Visitation will published by early 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.6/2">Many small businesses place great value on an apprenticeship and are prepared to invest in them. The National Employer Skills Survey (NESS) shows a national estimate of the proportion of apprentices employed by employer size.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.6/3">These data are based on repeated surveys of up to 79,000 employers across all business sectors in England. Table 1 shows information from the published 2009 National Employer Skills Survey on the proportion of apprentices employed by the size of establishment, expressed as a percentage of all apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.6/18">Additional &#163;75 million announced in the Budget to fund training and other support targeted at small and medium sized employers, particularly in industries such as advanced manufacturing, so that they can grow the number of people starting advanced and higher apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.6/19">We also worked with a group of employers, as well as the CBI and Federation of Small Businesses, to look at the 'end to end' processes faced by employers training apprentices.

	<p pid="a.515W.5/1">There has been a substantial amount of academic consideration of the relationship between employment protection legislation and recruitment levels and job creation both nationally and internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/2">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its Job Study Review of 2006 provided a summary of this evidence in its policy pamphlet &#8216;Boosting Jobs and Income: Policy Lessons from Reassessing the OECD Jobs Strategy&#8217;. It concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/3">&#8216;The link between the stance of employment protection legislation and aggregate unemployment is uncertain in theory, and in practice is dependent on the specific national context. However, there is evidence that too-strict legislation will hamper labour mobility, reduce the dynamic efficiency of the economy and restrain job creation. This may worsen job prospects of certain groups, like young people, women and the long-term unemployed.&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/4">In addition, there is international evidence that the UK has one of the least restrictive systems of employment protection in the OECD. It also has one of the highest rates of recruitment; high employment rates of women, the young and older people; and low levels of long term unemployment. There is evidence that the employment regulation system, in the UK has contributed to these favourable labour market outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/5">Finally, there is evidence that the perceptions of the restrictiveness of employment legislation differ from the actual situation in the UK. Perceptions are that employment legislation is more restrictive than is actually the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/6">In summary, there is evidence that the UK employment protection system compares favourably with many other countries in its effect on recruitment levels and job creation. However, OECD evidence also suggests that:</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/7">&#8216;the precise balance between the different policy planks depends on country circumstances and institutions&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.5/8">which suggests that it may be possible to improve upon this position. Consequently, the Government are carrying out the Employment Law Review in order to see whether further improvements in employment and growth can be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.518W.3/3">Common law has restrictions on what can be arbitrated. Some family law issues such as the custody of a child or marital status cannot be arbitrated although some family financial issues can.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.3/4">There are no specific provisions in the Arbitration Act 1996 for Sharia council or &#8220;tribunals&#8221;.</p>

Period life expectancy at birth for an area in a given time period is an estimate of the average number of years a new-born baby would survive if he or she experienced the particular area's age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout his or her life. It reflects contemporary mortality among those living in an area in each time period, rather than mortality that will be experienced throughout life among those born in the area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area could actually expect to live. 3. Figures are three-year rolling averages, based on data aggregated over three-year time periods. 4. All figures are shown rounded to one decimal place (figures for England and the areas with the worst health and deprivation are rounded to one decimal place based on published figures rounded to two decimal places). Difference between areas with the worst health and deprivation and the England average is calculated from life expectancy figures rounded to two decimal places; difference between North East and England is calculated from England figures to two decimal places and North East figures to one decimal place. 5. The areas with the worst health and deprivation were previously known as the &#8220;Spearhead Group&#8221;, which was defined in 2004 for use with associated former Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets included in the 2004 spending review. The Government have abolished the PSA system. The former &#8220;Spearhead Group&#8221; consisted of the 70 local authority (Unitary Authority and district council) areas (based on boundaries prior to the 1 April 2009 local government re-organisation) that were in the bottom fifth nationally for three or more of the following five factors: male life expectancy at birth 1995-97; female life expectancy at birth 1995-97; cancer mortality rate in under 75s 1995-97; cardiovascular disease mortality rate in under 75s 1995-97; and Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 (Local Authority Summary), average score. <i>Source:</i> Office for National Statistics</td> </tr>

The Prevent programme in health raises awareness of this form of exploitation so that, during the normal course of clinical practice, a clinician or healthcare worker may recognise that a vulnerable individual is either being groomed or drawn into violent extremism, and is therefore knowledgeable in how to provide support. Safeguarding vulnerable individuals will ensure that appropriate actions and support mechanisms can be put in place to redirect them away from criminal activity. This process is undertaken with the consent of the patient.</p>

	<p pid="a.528W.2/4">As with any other therapeutic relationship that a healthcare worker has with a patient, it is key that the safeguarding processes already in place can be used, assisting clinicians to protect vulnerable adults and children from exploitation and harm by others.</p>

	<p pid="a.538W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence has a long tradition of training international military and civilian personnel at its training establishments throughout the United Kingdom. Much of the training covers a range of activities in support of bilateral defence relationships in order to strengthen international security and co-operation. The following table gives details of countries that have participated in military training in the UK in the last nine financial years (2001-02 to 2009-10). Information for the preceding year would be available only at disproportionate cost as it was not collated and held centrally before 2001. Data for financial year 2010-11 will be available at the end of June 2011. The information collected does not include training provided at our Overseas Territories as the information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The majority of this training comprises individual students attending military courses in the UK.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40321" name="Lynne Featherstone">the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase>, raises awareness and builds support lot this as the UK's International Violence Against Women Champion. We are firmly committed to tackling sexual violence in armed conflict as part of our wider work to address violence against women and girls, in support of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.6/2">For example, DFID currently supports the United Nations' Humanitarian Pooled Fund for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which in 2010 funded several projects responding to the needs of victims of sexual violence. Through this mechanism, UK funds provided over 27,000 women with emergency medical care and almost 3,500 women with psychosocial support. The UK also works to strengthen the ability of UN Peacekeeping troops in DRC to protect civilians from sexual violence.</p>

	<p pid="a.546W.2/1">The UK Government condemn female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) as a clear abuse of the rights of children and women, wherever it takes place. The Department for International Development's (DFID's) new Framework for Results for improving reproductive, maternal and newborn health, recognises the serious health risks of FGM/C, and supports locally driven social change activities that can challenge and change norms including FGM/C.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.2/2">DFID supports measures to eliminate FGM/C through our core funding to the key UN agencies that address FGM/C, namely the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). We also provide support to programmes run by non-governmental organisations, including to the Population Council who carry out research, policy and programme work on adolescents, reproductive health and FGM/C. For example, in the Afar region of Ethiopia, we supported work to raise awareness of the dangers of FGM/C, providing training of officials and working with community and religious leaders to reach into communities.</p>

With several different organisations working on gender, previously the UN system lacked co-ordination and focus on gender equality.

In addition, in 2010 there were 353 demolitions (85% more than in 2009) of Palestinian structures in Area C, leading to forced displacement. We have repeatedly raised these concerns with the Israeli Government, being clear that Israel should take the steps necessary to ensure that the rights of people living in Area C are protected.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.6/1">We consulted on Electricity Market Reform in December 2010. Many respondents stressed the need to ensure that changes we make to the electricity system reflect importance of electricity supply at all scales of the energy market, including distributed generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.6/2">As well as the primary challenge of ensuring sufficient investment and development at a scale that delivers the large scale electricity generating capacity we need to keep the lights on, we are also determined to ensure there is liquidity at all scales of the market and to address the issue of barriers to entry for small scale and independent generators.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.6/3">Distributed generation can also be used as a form of demand-side response (DSR), where local generation is used to reduce the effective total demand of a supplier. We consider it important that any form of reliable generation or demand-side response should be able to contribute towards security of supply, so that we can achieve the appropriate level of security of supply in the most cost effective form. Further details of the Government's electricity market reform will be set out in a white paper which is due to be published before the summer recess 2011.</p>

A geomechanical study is being undertaken, along with further work by the British Geological Survey and Keele university. The implications of this information will be reviewed before any decision on the resumption of hydraulic fracture operations is made.</p>
