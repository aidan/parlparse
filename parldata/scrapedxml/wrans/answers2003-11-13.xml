	<p pid=".407W.6/2">Following discussions on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-07">Friday 7 November</phrase>, between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Secretary Mineta of the US Department of Transportation, it has been decided that for safety reasons, the first two ships currently on the way to the UK will continue to Hartlepool for safe storage, pending return to the US. This decision was taken after consideration by the Environment Agency and Government Departments of alternative storage sites. No other site is able to take the ships safely at short notice.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.6/3">The US authorities have been told that the proposed shipment of these vessels to Hartlepool for dismantling cannot be completed consistent with international rules and Community law. In this situation the law requires the ships to be returned to the United States. However, the immediate return to the United States of the first two ships, which are now approaching the Channel, would be impracticable, not least because of concerns about the weather.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.6/4">When the ships arrive at Hartlepool, the Environment Agency will place requirements on them to ensure the environment is fully protected and that the ships remain ready for return to the USA. No work is permitted on the ships given the current court injunction.</p>
	<p pid=".407W.6/5">The UK Government and its Agencies continue to work intensively with the US authorities to examine the safety and liability concerns they have raised to proposals that the second pair of ships, currently in transit to the UK, return to the US, and are looking for rapid resolution of that question.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.2/3">This Department provides guidance and assistance to planners in coastal areas by funding the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP), other research and development programmes and by promoting the production of Shoreline Management Plans which are designed to assist local planners in making decisions on future development and coastal defence needs over a 30&ndash;100 year period, taking account of natural processes and climate change effects. The Department has provided guidance on sea-level rise allowances for design of coastal defences since 1989 and these were confirmed this year in the light of the UKCIP 2002 climate-change scenarios.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.5/1">Estimates made by the Department suggest that some 400,000 ha of agricultural land and about 1 million properties are currently at risk of flooding from the sea. These all depend on coastal defences. In addition some 5,000 ha of agricultural land and 75,000 properties are at risk of coastal erosion. An assessment for Defra in 2001 suggested that the economic risk of coastal flooding could increase up to fivefold by the latter half of the century without any adaptation of defences. However, any loss of coastal land would depend almost entirely on the strategic coastal defence decisions made for each risk area.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.5/2">The Office of Science and Technology's Foresight project on flood and coastal defence is currently examining the factors that drive change in flood and coastal erosion risk, but it has not made any estimates of land loss.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.9/2">Any new variety of a GM crop which has been approved for cultivation under Directive 2001/18 also has to comply with the relevant seeds legislation before it can be added to the National List or the EU common catalogue of plant varieties. The new variety must conform with certain requirements which include an assessment of its value for cultivation and use. The yield achieved in commercial cultivation of a crop depends on many factors including the particular variety chosen, the management system, the quality of the farmland, weather conditions and so on. Therefore predictions cannot be made.</p>

This specified a maximum permitted rate of 8 litres per hectare and a recommended individual rate of 4 litres per hectare, depending on the weeds present and their growth stage. Application was permitted until the nine-leaf stage of maize. Before glufosinate ammonium could be used on a commercial scale on GM maize it would need full pesticide approval. In seeking approval the necessary data package would have to be supplied by the applicant and be subjected to the considerations of human and environmental safety which have been established for all pesticide uses. Any approval given would specify recommended and maximum application rates in the same way as the experimental permit. These conditions would be determined by the Pesticide Safety Directorate taking due account of advice from their expert advisory committee the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.</p>

	<p pid=".413W.2/2">The farm-scale evaluations were set up to assess the relative impact on wildlife of GM and non-GM management of four crops, based on practices current at the time. They were not set up to investigate the impact of any potential future management changes for either crop, although they will provide an invaluable baseline in our understanding of any such future changes.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.2/3">The decision to phase out Atrazine in the EU was taken on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-03">3 October 2003</phrase>, over a year after the completion of the last maize field trials. During the time of the trials (1999&ndash;2002) conventional maize practice predominately involved the use of Atrazine; this therefore formed a large part of the sample of FSE fields.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.2/4">In 2002 some evidence emerged that farmers in the US often mixed Atrazine with glufosinate ammonium for use on GM maize crops. In the FSE, farmers of GM maize used glufosinate ammonium alone. The industry asserted that the UK and US differed in conditions and that glufosinate ammonium alone was typical of the likely practice in the UK. The scientific steering committee, whose role it is to advise me on the conduct of the FSE, considered that in the absence of evidence either way to justify the need for Atrazine to be used in conjunction with glufosinate ammonium in the UK that trials would continue as before. Accordingly, I was not advised that any action was necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.2/5">Now that Atrazine is being phased out it clearly will not be permitted on any fodder maize crop, GM or otherwise. However, the issue of whether other licensed herbicides could be mixed with glufosinate ammonium on GM crops remains.</p>

In relation to a range of offences Defra investigators (and inspectors) have fairly standard statutory powers to enter and inspect business premises, powers to inspect and copy business documents and powers to require provision of information in relation to the conduct of the business&mdash;all these powers are normally set out in the specific legislation which creates the offence under investigation. Investigators have a surviving common law right to seize and retain any evidence relating to suspected offences.

	<p pid=".417W.2/1">The Government have noted the proposed investment programme and bill charges for South West Water for the period 2005 to 2010. These figures are drawn from South West Water's own draft business plan for the 2004 periodic review of water price limits and represent the company's opening bid in what will be another 12 months of challenge, decisions and negotiation by the regulator Ofwat.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.2/2">Full assessments of all company draft business plans will be made following receipt of guidance from the economic, environmental and quality regulators in early November and these assessments will underlie the Secretary of State's Principal Guidance, which will be issued early next year. The Secretary of State's initial guidance to the Director General of Ofwat, setting out the Government's early objectives for the review, was published in January this year.</p>

Each water company in England and Wales has produced a water resources plan setting out how it proposes to maintain the supply and demand balance of water for the next 25 years. These plans were assessed by the Environment Agency and are reviewed on an annual basis.</p>

The agency will report to Ministers on these plans as part of their advice for the fourth periodic review. The Ministerial guidance for the periodic review will be published in early 2004, and cover any related water supply issues.</p>

	<p pid=".420W.2/1">The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) aims to protect certain plants and animals by regulating and monitoring their international trade to prevent it reaching unsustainable levels. Currently CITES regulates international trade in over 30,000 species, of which approximately 25,000 are plants. The Convention came into force in 1975, and the UK became a party in 1976. Pre-Convention figures concerning the importation of parrots and other birds are not available.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.2/2">No specific study has been made of the impact of the Convention on the trade in these species. However, all EU member states are required to provide annual reports on the trade in CITES species. These are closely monitored by the European Commission, and powers are available to enable member states to take urgent action in the event that a particular pattern of trade is judged to be unsustainable.</p>

	<p pid=".426W.5/1">The remit of the Immigration Crime Team (ICT) is to tackle serious and organised immigration crime including, where relevant, identity fraud and theft. Since its inception in January 2002 it has conducted three major operations into identity fraud. Others are under development. The first concerned the identity theft of British passports and led to the arrest of 29 persons in a series of co-ordinated raids. The second involved the arrest of two men for the manufacture and supply of forged British passports and the dismantling of their criminal enterprise. Both pleaded guilty, one received a five year sentence and the other 18 months. The operation resulted in one of the largest ever seizures of high quality forged passports believed to have a street value of over &pound;2 million.The third operation is currently sub judice.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/2">Such operations are complex, involving lengthy investigation and demanding a high level of inter-agency co-operation. The ICT operates as part of Reflex, the Government's inter-agency task force created to combat organised immigration crime. Targeting identity fraud is a key priority for Reflex and while the ICT has been at the forefront of major operations other successes have been recorded by other Reflex partners. For example using Reflex funding the Metropolitan police have established a joint intelligence unit under Operation Maxim involving the Immigration Service and UK Passport Service (UKPS) with a remit to investigate identity fraud alongside related criminality.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/3">UKPS records the number of fraudulent passport applications which have been detected after passports have been issued. Figures for passports detected in each of the last five years are shown as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".426W.5/6"> <th></th> <th><i>Number</i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".426W.5/9"> <td>1999</td> <td>153</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".426W.5/10"> <td>2000</td> <td>179</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".426W.5/11"> <td>2001</td> <td>161</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".426W.5/12"> <td>2002</td> <td>1,360</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".426W.5/13"> <td>2003 to date</td> <td>489</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".426W.5/16">The significant increase in cases detected in the last two years is a result of the UKPS' access to infant death data and greater proactivity in tackling fraud. The UKPS is taking forward a range of initiatives to improve fraud prevention and detection. These include better arrangements for the recording and dissemination of lost, stolen and recovered passport information; increasing the professionalism of its fraud and intelligence units; changing the law to make passport fraud offences arrestable; investigating the use of biometrics to improve passport security; and using from February 2004 secure delivery for the despatch of all passports; and finally continuing to work actively with law enforcement agencies to apprehend, disrupt and dismantle the activities of those involved in passport fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".427W.2/1">The projected net effect on the prison population of the implementation of the provisions to reform the sentencing framework is an increase of about 1,000 by 2009. These measures include the generic community sentence and more flexible types of custody such as intermittent custody, custody minus and custody plus. The long-term impact, once all these provisions have been implemented and sufficient time has passed for their full effects to be seen, is estimated to be an increase in the prison population of about 500.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/2">Of the other parts of the Bill that have any significant impact, the firearms offences provisions in the Bill will provide for a mandatory minimum custodial sentence for unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm. The estimated effect on the prison population of the implementation of these provisions, and the implementation of the provision providing for an increase in penalties for certain driving-related offences causing death, is an increase of about 500 in the prison population.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/3">The life sentence provisions in the Bill will provide for the determination of a minimum custodial term in relation to mandatory life sentences. It is unlikely that the effect of these provisions on the prison population will be felt for at least a decade.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/4">The restriction on bail for drug users will be piloted in selected court areas. This provision aims to reduce re-offending by encouraging drug-misusing offenders into effective drug treatment programmes. Part of the pilot evaluation will focus on the likely impact of this measure on the prison population if it were to be extended more widely. A further study is being conducted to assess the likely effect on the prison population of the introduction of a presumption against the grant of bail to defendants who have failed to surrender.</p>

	<p pid=".439W.6/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has targets set by the Cabinet Office to help contribute to a reduction in public sector sickness absence. These involve an average working days lost figure of eight days by March 2006, and an interim target of 10 days by March 2004. The cumulative average working days lost figure for the period April to September 2003 was 12 days.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.6/2">Ministers and senior managers in the Department fully recognise the importance of good attendance. They are committed to ensuring that managers have effective tools to enable them to manage sickness absence, including support for individuals to facilitate a return to work after illness. People who work for the Department and who have to bear the consequences of colleagues' absence, together with the customers the Department serves, have a right to expect that level of commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.6/3">A new Departmental Attendance Management policy was implemented in February 2003. This aims to encourage good attendance and provide support to enable people to return to work as quickly as possible following an absence. Formal unsatisfactory attendance action can be considered when an absence reaches eight days in a rolling 12-month period. To measure the effectiveness of the policy, an evaluation exercise will start shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.6/4">Each of the businesses that comprise the Department has initiatives in place aimed at getting sickness absence levels down. Jobcentre Plus, which is the biggest of the businesses, has an 'Improving Attendance' task force in place. Its emphasis is on reducing long-term absences (ie those over 28 days duration), by either facilitating a return to work, or effecting a termination of an individual's contract. The Department is also participating in the 'Well-being at work' pilots that are being run by the Health and Safety Executive. These are intended to combat workplace stress. In addition, the Department is committed to discharging its responsibilities to people with disabilities by making reasonable adjustments to the workplace to facilitate an individual's return to work. A pilot will also commence shortly that will involve the early intervention of occupational health nurses in addressing, quickly, those absences which have the potential to become long term.</p>

In Uganda, the Porter Commission reported to Government in May 2003. We are urging the Government of Rwanda to publish the findings of their National Judicial Commission and to take action where allegations are proven. Our assistance to Uganda is also conditional upon the Government conducting a comprehensive and strategic Defence Review, including a thorough analysis of external threats. The UK is providing support for this process, which is about to produce its recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".443W.0/1">Malaria is endemic in The Gambia. It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality especially among children under the age of five and pregnant women. It has a significant negative impact on productivity and is a major cause of poverty. Recent studies in The Gambia have shown that malaria is on the increase. In 2000, it accounted for 60 per cent. of all out patient consultations and 57.2 per cent. of all admissions and 36.9 per cent. of all deaths, including 25 per cent. of all deaths in children under five years of age <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".443W.0/2">The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), to which DFID contributes, has recently agreed to provide US$13.8 million over five years for the prevention and treatment of malaria in The Gambia, The goal of this project, which is particularly focused on the coastal area, is the reduction of malaria morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age and pregnant women by 30 per cent. by the end of the project in the focus area.</p>

	<p pid=".443W.3/1">The UK has a long-term commitment to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). We recognise that in order to be effective the GFATM needs predictable and sustainable financing&mdash;which is why the UK recently extended its pledge by a further two years to 2008 bringing our total contribution to US$280million.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.3/2">In addition, the Prime Minister has encouraged European Union member states to contribute to the GFATM. Last month the EC agreed to accelerate the disbursement of Euros 170 million to the Fund. Currently the 15 EU member states and the Commission are the largest donor to the GFATM, having contributed around 55 per cent. of the total pledge so far of US$4.8 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.3/3">The Global Fund is one of a number of instruments to tackle these terrible diseases. Since 1997, the Department for International Development has stepped up its spending on HIV/AIDS from &pound;38 million in 1997&ndash;98 to more than &pound;270 million in 2002&ndash;03. According to UNAIDS, UK is currently the 2nd largest bilateral donor active in the field of HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.3/4">Since May 1997 DFID has committed over &pound;1.5 billion to support the development of health systems in partner countries. This will help to build capacity to deliver medicines to the poor and assist them in making effective choices about the selection of drugs.</p>

	<p pid=".445W.3/1">We continue to provide substantial assistance for St. Helena, which this year is expected to be more than &pound;10.5 million. Much of this support is needed to maintain essential government services, including education and healthcare, and to subsidise the island's vital passenger/supply ship. These and other services will be maintained: but we hope increasingly to devote a greater share of our assistance to activities that will generate more local revenue and reduce St. Helena's reliance upon our aid.</p>
	<p pid=".445W.3/2">For example, in parallel with evaluating options for the possible development of air access and with the St. Helena Government we are reviewing the routing and scheduling of the RMS 'St Helena' to see if a better call pattern for the island can be established. We also are considering further strengthening of the St. Helena Development Agency (SHDA), in addition to some existing support through the SHDA from the FCO's Economic Diversification Fund, to help stimulate private sector growth. As regards staffing, some key posts in St. Helena have been advertised recently on enhanced terms that are designed to encourage key personnel to remain and/or to attract back suitable people with St. Helenian status who are living overseas. I understand that the first of these advertisements already has resulted in the appointment of a St. Helenian who currently lives in the UK; and the initial response to advertisements for two other posts last month has been encouraging.</p>
	<p pid=".445W.3/3">We remain committed to supporting the St. Helena Government's efforts to revitalise and regenerate the island economy to the benefit of its community. Our shared goal, which may take some years to achieve, is sustainable economic and financial self-sufficiency for St. Helena.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.5/1">DFID routinely subjects all proposals for UK funding to detailed technical appraisal before spending is approved. In the case of food aid to Zimbabwe, our most recent pledge of &pound;5 million to support the Emergency Operation of the World Food Programme (WFP) followed close examination of the operational procedures set out in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the WFP and the Government of Zimbabwe on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-25">25 September</phrase>. This included the process for identifying those members of the community who are in greatest need, regardless of political considerations or affiliation. WFP conducts rigorous training of its Implementing Partners (NGOs) on these procedures</p>
	<p pid=".446W.5/2">In addition to UK's support for the WFP Emergency Operation, DFID is also providing funds directly to international and local NGOs who are undertaking humanitarian work in Zimbabwe, focusing on HIV/AIDS affected households, malnourished children and other vulnerable groups. Again, approval of financial support has been based upon careful technical appraisal of the approach and procedures for each proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.8/1">As I indicated in my previous reply, the United Nations closely monitors the delivery of food aid to its final recipients by the UN World Food Programme (WFP). In response to pressure from the UK and other donors, the WFP has already strengthened its own internal monitoring, evaluation and reporting activities. Particular emphasis is placed on monitoring and reporting of any incidences of political interference. WFP also undertakes post-distribution monitoring, in which vulnerable households who were targeted for assistance are interviewed to assess their views of the selection and distribution processes. Donors and the UNDP have jointly established a Relief and Recovery Unit with the purpose of co-ordinating information about all ongoing humanitarian activities funded by the international community. This covers not only food but also other forms of assistance such as medicines, seeds and fertilisers. It also covers the operations of NGOs directly funded by donors, outside the UN Emergency Operation.</p>

Decisions in these areas are of course for them to take. DFID keeps in close contact with the United Nations and non-governmental organisations, particularly those which receive DFID funding, and is able to offer advice where appropriate, DFID has offered &pound;3 million towards UN security measures in response to an appeal following the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad in August. DFID has also offered additional finance, if needed, for increased security provisions for those NGOs that we are supporting in Iraq. DFID, and other Government Departments, have put in place special security provisions for their own staff working in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".453W.8/1">The Department for Employment and Learning supports adult learners to develop IT skills through a range of programme and policy initiatives, These include the New Deal for 25+ for long-term unemployed people, which offers participants a range of appropriate training courses. Clients who are eligible for the Training Grant of New Deal 50 plus can access up to &pound;1,500 over a two-year period for in-work training which can include IT skills. In the further education (FE) sector enrolments on information and communications technology (ICT) courses attract an enhanced level of financial support. Some 75 per cent. of current enrolments comprise students aged 25 or over, Learndirect plays a major role in the delivery of ICT programmes. 34 community-based learning venues throughout Northern Ireland offer all adults flexible access to a range of IT programmes at minimal cost to disadvantaged learners, including those over the age of retirement. Recent modifications to the learndirect learner funding model have been introduced to attract older learners on low income.</p>

However, the Code of Guidance makes clear that, in determining relative priorities for an allocation, authorities are able to have regard to whether or not applicants have a local connection with the district. The Code of Guidance does refer specifically to the rights of persons leaving the armed forces to be included in council waiting lists.</p>

	<p pid=".458W.3/1">Section 179 of the Housing Act 1996 requires local housing authorities to ensure that advice and information about homelessness and the prevention of homelessness is available free of charge to anyone in their district. The Homelessness Code of Guidance, to which local authorities must have regard by law, states that advisory services need to be accessible to everyone in the district, and well publicised. The Code also states that authorities need to monitor the provision of advisory services to ensure they continue to meet the needs of all sections of the community.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/2">In addition, the Homelessness Act 2002 requires local housing authorities to ensure that advice and information is available free to everyone in their district about the right to apply for housing. If anyone is likely to have difficulty in making an application without assistance, the housing authority must ensure that any necessary assistance is available free of charge.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/3">The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has issued good practice guidance to assist local authorities in the development of their strategies on preventing and tackling homelessness in their area, to include information on addressing the needs of older people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and the needs of homeless black and minority ethnic people. This could include, for example, specialist mediation services for older people who have to leave a family home.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has invested &pound;2.5 million in 2003&ndash;04 with Shelter's National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS). NHAS is a secondary advice and support service provided by Shelter in partnership with the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and has been supported by Government since it was established in 1990. This service is open to anyone who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/5">The Housing and Older People Development Group&mdash;which advises the Department of Health and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on housing issues affecting older people&mdash;is looking into ways to develop and enhance advice, information and advocacy services nationally and locally for older people and their carers, to help them in making choices about housing, care and support options. The group is also looking at ways of sharing information across agencies and to support and advise the advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/6">As part of its work, the Group is also considering strategies to improving access to information about mainstream services for black and minority ethnic older people.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/7">As part of the Government's Supporting People programme, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has published a guide: &quot;Reflecting the Needs and Concerns of Black and Minority Ethnic Communities in Supporting People&quot; for housing support service providers. This can be found on the Supporting People website address at: <a href="http://www.spkweb.org.uk/files/020429impreflect.pdf">www.spkweb.org.uk/files/020429impreflect.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".458W.3/8">In addition to the Supporting People main website, a special BMESpark website has also been developed. This brings together expertise and experience in responding to the needs and concerns of black and minority ethnic communities as part of the Supporting People Programme. The BMESpark website address is <a href="http://www.bmespark.org.uk">www.bmespark.org.uk</a>.</p>

There has been nothing in the intervening period to suggest that this decision should be reversed.</p>
