As part of the Digital Action Plan, the Government will be comprehensively investigating with industry and the European Union the issues surrounding the transition to exclusive sales of integrated digital television sets. Because of our international agreements, the UK alone could not mandate the sale of integrated digital television sets.</p>

It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain, the conclusions of any study.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.0/1">The UK is on course to meet, and go beyond, its target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&ndash;12. This target covers a basket of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride); the UK does not have targets under the Kyoto Protocol for the individual gases.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/2">UK emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in 1995&mdash;the base year chosen for measuring emissions of these gases for the Kyoto Protocol&mdash;were equivalent to 4.1 MtC, contributing about 2 per cent. of the total greenhouse gas emissions in that year.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/3">Action to reduce fugitive emissions of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 manufacturing plants have meant that total emissions of HFCs have fallen significantly since then. This will be partly offset by an increase in emissions from end use markets such as aerosols, refrigeration and foam blowing as consumption of HFCs increases in response to the phase out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) under the Montreal Protocol. However, reduced levels of leakage and increased use of alternative fluids are expected to limit the increase in emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/4">Overall, annual emissions of HFCs are projected to be equivalent to 2.9 MtC in 2010, a fall of 29 per cent. from 1995 levels. The expected reductions in emissions of the other five greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol mean that the relative contribution of HFCs emissions in 2010 is projected to be the same as in 1995, at about 2 per cent. of the total UK greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

The first year of operation (2000&ndash;01) was managed under a cash regime. 2001&ndash;02 was managed under the new resource accounting system for the first time but the final outturn will not be available until the end of October 2002 which is when the National Audit Office is expected to have completed the audit of the departmental accounts. Operating costs have therefore been provided on a cash basis for consistency as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".428W.11/2" class="indent">Financial year 2000&ndash;01 final outturn: &pound;5.798 billion</p>

	<p pid=".428W.11/4">Under a cash accounting regime, operating costs include expenditure on capital projects and running costs. The outturn for 2000&ndash;01 included a transfer of some &pound;600 million from the Defence Procurement Agency to the DLO following the transfer of responsibility for the management of in-service support costs. Financial year 2001&ndash;02 included a transfer of an additional &pound;400 million for in-service support, taking the annual total transfer of in-service support costs into the DLO to around &pound;1 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.8/2">We consider that a satisfactory standard of treatment is provided to Service personnel by the NHS and private healthcare providers. The majority of Service patients treated in NHS hospitals are admitted to Ministry of Defence Hospital Units whose host NHS trusts are set targets by the Defence Secondary Care Agency, reflecting its own Key Targets for both in-patient and out-patient waiting times. Overall performance against the key targets is published in the Agency's Annual Report, which is laid before Parliament. The contracts with the NHS trusts are monitored for cost effectiveness. Some Service personnel receive treatment at other NHS hospital trusts with whom we have no contractual agreements, where this is more appropriate for them. As entitled patients, they receive such treatment free of charge. Limited use is made of private healthcare providers to enable Service personnel to be treated and returned to deployability more quickly, where this is considered cost effective.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.6/21">No sub-UK breakdowns of subsidies or compensation payments consistent with these data are currently available.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/22">Data on subsidies for the whole of the UK are available by industrial sector up to 1999, as outlined in the release 'United Kingdom Input-Output Analysis 2001', but National Accounting conventions limit these to include subsidies on production only, excluding subsidies on product. Using these National Accounts definitions, the 'Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing' industry received &pound;370m subsidies on production in 1999 across the UK, while the 'Manufacturing' industry received none (and, as before 'Tourism' is not classed as an industry under the Standard Industrial Classification).</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/23">Separately, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs publication 'Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2001' shows that subsidies on product for that industry for the UK totalled &pound;2,405m in 1999 and &pound;1,943m in 2001. No estimates on subsidies on product are available for the Manufacturing industry. No estimates on Tourism as an industry are available from any source, though the Department for Culture, Media and Sport made a statement recently about Government support for tourism, which I enclose.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.6/24">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs publication also shows a breakdown by country for these data on agricultural subsidies. The latest report was published on 3rd May 2002, and is available through their web site at http:// <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a> or through the House of Commons library.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.2/1">London Underground is responsible for development of the PPP plans for the modernisation of the underground's infrastructure. I understand that when London Underground was restructured into an operating company and three infrastructure companies in April 2000, that restructuring was effected by an asset transfer scheme. It is correct to say that the requirement of &quot;minimum ambiguity&quot; as to the responsibility for asset maintenance within the underground has been a guiding principle for the development of the PPP Service Contracts with the infrastructure companies following the asset transfer scheme. During the period of shadow running since April 2000 there has been considerable work carried out to develop detailed asset information, with clear allocation principles to be incorporated in the contract documents, the application of which will enable responsibility for maintenance and renewal of underground assets to be determined.</p>

	<p pid=".441W.2/1">My right hon. Friend has today laid before Parliament a Statutory Instrument: The Town and Country Planning (Major Infrastructure Project Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002. A Departmental Circular (DTLR Circular 02/2002) is also being issued today to accompany the new Statutory Instrument. This Circular explains the new procedures for handling inquiries into those major infrastructure projects in England, as defined in the schedule to the Rules. Copies of the Statutory Instrument and the Circular have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/2">The new arrangements for major infrastructure project inquiries, which are due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase>, are part of the package of measures announced by my right hon. Friend on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-20">20 July 2001</phrase>, to streamline the planning procedures for major infrastructure projects. The Department has also consulted on a key part of that package which is the proposed introduction of new procedures to enable Parliament to make a decision in principle on applications for major projects before the detail of the application is considered at a public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/3">The new Rules build on the improvements already made to inquiry procedure rules more generally in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/4">The key changes are</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/5" class="indent">the introduction of round table sessions will allow parties to discuss areas of concern with each other. Experience at other inquiries has shown that these can be a very effective mans of agreeing facts, and narrowing areas of disagreement, both before and during the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/6" class="indent">the introduction of a technical adviser, who will be tasked with assessing the technical evidence of all parties and will produce his own independent report on the technical issues.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/7" class="indent">the introduction of mediation into inquiry proceedings which will help to narrow the issues before and during the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/8" class="indent">A date for the delivery of the Inspector's report will be announced at the end of the inquiry. This will give certainty to the parties about the length of time.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/9" class="indent">the provision to limit cross examination where the inquiry timetable is put at risk has been introduced so that a situation should not arise where people at the beginning of an inquiry are not allowed to encroach into cross examination time allocated to those at the end of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/10">All these measures, included in the Rules, will help to improve the inquiry system for major infrastructure projects.</p>

	<p pid=".445W.0/3">When selling properties under the right to buy scheme, landlords may impose restrictions on their resale if they are located in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, or certain rural areas designated for this purpose. An owner may be required to offer the property back to the landlord (if they wish to resell within ten years) or to people who have lived or worked locally for three years. The intention is to try to ensure that more of the existing housing in rural areas is available to local people. There are currently 24 designated rural areas, and our November 2000 Rural White Paper &quot;Our Countryside: The Future&quot; encouraged other local authorities to consider seeking designation.</p>

Many of the standard responses that have been quantitatively analysed have been initiated and influenced by organised campaigns. We suggest that in order to gain a more complete picture of opinions and suggestions regarding the Green Paper's proposals, it will be necessary to consider in more detail the many suggestions and qualifying comments on the standard forms and also the large number of more detailed responses, which it has not been possible to code and quantify, submitted by a wide variety of organisations, groups and individuals.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".455W.3/1">The United States pays no rent or makes any similar payment in respect of its right to use the British Indian Ocean Territory, including Diego Garcia, for defence purposes. However, in 1965, when it became clear that the costs of setting up the territory as a separate dependency would exceed original estimates, the US Government agreed to contribute &pound;5 million towards these costs.</p>
	<p pid=".455W.3/2">No part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, including Diego Garcia, has been leased to the United States. Under the 1966 Agreement between the UK and USA Governments, the islands will remain available to meet the defence needs of both Governments until 2016, and then for a further period of 20 years, unless either side has previously given notice of termination.</p>

	<p pid=".459W.3/1">To answer this question would incur disproportionate cost. It would be necessary to identify and review every case in the European Court of Justice between the European Commission and Spain, since Spain's accession to the EU in 1986, to ascertain whether a breach of EU law was found, and consider whether the judgment had any affect on Gibraltar's law. The judgments of the European Court of Justice are published in Reports of Cases before the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, which can be found in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".459W.3/2">Any judgment of the ECJ against a member state potentially has implications for the law of another member state. The UK Government look to the Commission to ensure that all EU member states, including Spain, abide by their EU obligations.</p>

	<p pid=".459W.7/1">Over the last five years, the Department of Trade and Industry has spent the following amounts on energy research and development, covering renewables (including wind, wave, biomass, solar and hydrogen); nuclear (where DTI spending has been confined to research on fusion); coal; and oil and gas. The table gives the percentages spent in each of these categories.</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/2">The DTI supports research and development on sustainable energy technologies both through its Sustainable Energy Programme and through the Research Councils. Over the last five years, expenditure through the programme on wind energy has been in the range &pound;1.2 million to &pound;1.7 million per year; on wave energy, in the range &pound;0 to &pound;0.9 million per year; on biomass, in the range &pound;1.8 million to &pound;2.2 million per year; on solar, in the range &pound;1.4 to &pound;2 million per year; and on fuel cells (including some expenditure on hydrogen), in the range &pound;1.2 million to &pound;1.8 million per year. Relevant work supported through the Research Councils would be additional to these figures. The Sustainable Energy Programme also supports cross-technology work in the areas of technology transfer, export promotion and policy support.</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/3">Provision for research and development through the Sustainable Energy Programme increases to &pound;19 million for 2002&ndash;03 and through the Research Councils to &pound;5.6 million. Additionally, the DTI has been assigned a further &pound;5 million over three years for wave and tidal demonstration projects and a further &pound;4 million for net metering, storage and control demonstration projects.</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/4">The Government have also set up capital grants programmes in the following areas to bring forward new renewable energy technologies:</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/5" class="indent">&pound;74 million for offshore wind (including &pound;10 million from the New Opportunities Fund);</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/6" class="indent">&pound;69 million for bioenergy (including &pound;36 million from the New Opportunities Fund and &pound;3 million for biomass heating);</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/7" class="indent">&pound;20 million for photovoltaics (PV).</p>
	<p pid=".459W.7/8">The R and D and capital grants programmes supplement the substantial boost for renewable energy being provided by the Renewables Obligation. Estimated maximum payments available under the Renewables Obligation for England and Wales and the corresponding Renewables Obligation (Scotland) for 2002&ndash;03 are &pound;282 million. The level of the Obligation is set to rise each year to 2010&ndash;11, when maximum payments for the year are estimated to reach &pound;1 billion.</p>

The draft Regulations will be finalised shortly following the public consultation exercise carried out last year and further discussions with interested parties since then.

	<p pid=".467W.2/1">I have requested a study into the resilience of the electricity supply networks in an emergency, in order to obtain reassurance that we have the best possible systems in place to avoid or minimise supply failure, together with examples of good practice in emergency preparedness. Our consultants, British Power International (BPI), visited all the electricity transmission and distribution licence-holding companies in mainland Britain during March, and will be reporting shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.2/2">DTI's Engineering Inspectorate has been dealing with a small number of cases in which consumers in rural areas are complaining about frequent interruptions to their electricity supply, and Ofgem has taken important steps to strengthen the incentives on distribution companies to provide a good quality of service to consumers. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> a new Guaranteed Standard of Performance was introduced which will mean that consumers that suffer more than three interruptions of more than three hours duration over the course of the year will receive a compensation payment of &pound;50. This protection is directly aimed at 'worst-served' consumers. Ofgem has also introduced an incentive scheme for distribution companies that focuses on key areas quality of service&mdash;the number of interruptions to supply, the duration of interruptions to supply and the quality of telephone response provided by distribution companies. Taken together these mechanisms provide significant additional protection to consumers in respect of the quality of service they receive from distribution companies.</p>
	<p pid=".467W.2/3">The introduction of widespread distributed generation in electricity networks will certainly raise some technical issues not previously faced by electricity distributors. Close monitoring of developments in embedded generation is necessary by all those involved to ensure the emerging security of supply issues are identified and managed. Following on from the report of the joint DTI-Ofgem Embedded Generation Working Group (EGWG) in June 2001 <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/egwg/index.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/egwg/ index.htm</a>, the Government has recently established a Co-ordinating Group, jointly led by the DTI and Ofgem, to monitor the implementation of the EGWG recommendations and to advise Ministers of potential problems.</p>

	<p pid=".469W.0/1">I am sorry for the delay in answering.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/2">Two construction projects are planned for the use of the Juvenile Justice Board (scheduled to become the Youth Justice Agency with effect from April 2003). The projects relate to the rationalisation of the Juvenile Justice Estate and were announced in Parliament by the then Northern Ireland Minister of State, Adam Ingram on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-29">29 November 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/3">The first project, phase 1, involves upgrading security and refurbishing the accommodation on the existing Rathgael site in Bangor, to facilitate the closure of Lisnevin. The construction project is scheduled to be completed by autumn 2002. The contract was awarded as a design and build project at a tender cost of &pound;2.8 million. Private sector involvement in phase 1 relates to the appointment of a design team and main building contractor. No provision has been made for the display of flags, emblems and other symbols on the exterior and interior of buildings within this project.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/4">The second project, phase 2, is the provision of a new, purpose designed centre, also to be located on land at Rathgael. When fully commissioned, the new centre will replace the phase 1 facility. Planning the phase 2 project is at a very early stage. It is estimated to take about four to five years to complete the project. It is not possible to give an accurate estimated cost, but based on similar facilities, it is anticipated that the cost should be in the region of &pound;12 million to &pound;15 million. In keeping with Government policy, we will be examining various procurement methods including PFI/PPP. It is intended to utilise various expertise from the private sector to establish the most cost-effective method of procuring this facility. The extent of their involvement will become clearer once the project has been properly scoped and all the issues addressed as part of the outline business case.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/5">As in phase 1, no provision has been made for the display of flags, emblems and other symbols on the exterior and interior of buildings within this project.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/6">The Northern Ireland Prison Service has three construction projects planned at present, a new inmates kitchen at HMP Maghaberry, at a cost of &pound;1.9 million which will be completed in October 2003. New programmes village at HMP Magilligan at a cost of &pound;1 million which will be completed in December 2002 and a new visitors reception at HM YOC Hydebank at a cost of &pound;800,000 which is due for completion in January 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/7">A private sector contractor will be involved in the design and construction of the inmates kitchen at HMP Maghaberry. The remaining projects will involve the private sector in the construction phase only. No provision has been made for the display of flags, emblems, and other symbols on the exterior or interior of the buildings.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/8">The Northern Ireland Court Service is at the very early stage of plans to build new courthouses in Lisburn and North Down with anticipated completion dates of 2005 and 2006 respectively. Public private partnership is the preferred funding route and, in this event, the only costs incurred at completion would be consultancy from the private sector estimated at &pound;500,000. All construction work will be carried out by the private sector. Construction work for a courthouse in Dungannon is already under way and is due for completion in November this year, at an approximate cost of &pound;11 million. This is not a public private partnership project. Provision for the display of flags, emblems or other symbols at these venues will be in accordance with Government policy as articulated in the Criminal Justice Review Implementation Plan and the Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill. The practical steps to give effect to this policy would be taken at the appropriate stage in the construction project.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/9">The Northern Ireland Office has entered into an agreement with the Northern Ireland Bar to rent a new headquarters building for the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The building is currently being constructed by Bar Library Services Ltd. and is due to be completed by <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/10">As part of the Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland the DPP will be undertaking an exercise to consider the development of offices outside Belfast. The extent and number of such have not yet been identified.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.0/11">The Government's policy on the display of flags at Government buildings is set out in the Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000. The display of emblems and other symbols is in accordance with the Belfast Agreement which acknowledged the sensitivity of the use of symbols for public purposes, and the need to ensure that such symbols are used in a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division.</p>

I have written to initiate consultations with 19 organisations and I am awaiting final responses from a number of these. It is important that there is proper consultation with these organisations before final decisions are taken. As part of the consultation process, and to assist in identifying functions within these organisations which it might be appropriate to bring within the inspectorate's remit, a number of useful exploratory meetings have taken place. The Belfast International Airport Authority is one of the bodies with whom consultations are progressing.</p>

	<p pid=".475W.2/2">Payment of a single additional payment (SAP) is achieved by increasing one of the regular weekly subsistence payments by the required &pound;50. The value of all regular weekly payments is stored within each individual's computer record, together with associated explanation. NASS can, therefore, confirm the payment of a SAP to an individual and could ultimately obtain the requested statistics, but the cost in doing so would be disproportionate.</p>

	<p pid=".477W.9/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-02">2 July 2001</phrase> we replaced the exceptional hardship and exceptional circumstances schemes with improved arrangements that are broader in scope than the old regulatory provisions. Subject to certain conditions, local authorities are now able to give additional payments to any person whose housing benefit or council tax benefit is restricted where they are satisfied the person is in need of further financial assistance with housing costs or council tax liability. Unlike the old scheme there are no prescribed definitions of either &quot;exceptional hardship&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.

	<p pid=".480W.0/5">The hospital downrating rules prevents double provision from public funds as the publicly funded NHS maintains people while they stay in hospital as well as providing free treatment. Social security maintenance benefits are also paid from state funds. They are therefore not paid in full indefinitely where a person is in a NHS hospital and having their day to day living expenses met through the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.5/1">The Government has sought to improve the efficiency of further education since 1997 and colleges have delivered real improvements in value for money. Since 1996&ndash;97 the participation funding for each full-time equivalent (FTE) student has remained constant in real terms, while total funding for each FTE student has increased by 12 per cent. in real terms (reflecting the additional funds targeted on much needed capital developments, standards and teachers pay). Over the same period colleges have widened participation among learners, broadened programmes of study for 16&ndash;19- year-olds and increased basic skills provision. Qualification success rates for long (24 weeks or over) qualifications have increased from 51 per cent. in 1996&ndash;97 to 56 per cent. in 1999&ndash;2000 (the latest year available). When shorter courses are also taken into account, qualification success rates have increased from 56 per cent. in 1996&ndash;97 to 60 per cent. in 1999&ndash;2000. The Government recognises that investment is important for raising standards further and will set out future funding plans for colleges as part of the Spending Review outcome.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.5/2">The investments we are making via the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to support both school sixth forms and further education colleges should ensure that staff receive appropriate salary increases this year. The real terms guarantee (RTG) for schools with sixth forms means that their funding will be protected at least at 2000&ndash;01 levels, providing pupil numbers are maintained. Indeed in 2002&ndash;03 around two thirds of sixth forms will benefit with higher funding from the LSC's formula funding and the remaining third will be funded at their RTG level.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.5/3">We are also investing significant funding in the FE sector. In 2001&ndash;02, &pound;527 million extra was planned for FE&mdash;a 12 per cent. real terms increase, with a further 3 per cent. increase this year. By 2003&ndash;04, annual funding for FE will have increased by &pound;1.4 billion compared with 1997&ndash;98, a real terms increase of 26 per cent. It is for each college to agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with its staff in the context of the overall resources available to them. Within the total funds for FE, the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) budget is &pound;311 million over the period 2001&ndash;04. This is to reward excellent teaching and is over and above any general pay rise.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.3/1">In 1999&ndash;2000 the Government made available &pound;35 million in England for higher education capital funding. In the succeeding years, the amounts made available were &pound;50 million, &pound;100 million, &pound;145 million, and in 2003&ndash;04 &pound;194 million, to support the teaching infrastructure, modernise and improve the estates and build new medical schools. Of this, &pound;56 million over two years to 2003&ndash;04 is to help institutions meet the cost of the statutory changes relating to the access parts of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.3/2">To this, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) adds funding which it finds from its own resources to promote capital investment, often with contributions from others. For example, between 1998&ndash;99 and 2002&ndash;03 the HEFCE Poor Estates Initiative has invested &pound;291 million in the sector, supporting 149 projects at 80 institutions with a total value of &pound;950 million.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.3/3">Alongside this, the Government, in partnership with the Wellcome Trust, have plans to invest some &pound;1.75 billion in research infrastructure in universities and elsewhere over the four years to 2003&ndash;04.</p>

Publicly planned funding for higher education in England in 2001&ndash;02 is &pound;396 million more than in 2000&ndash;01, so that for the first time in over a decade funding per student will rise in real terms, and further expansion of student places will be fully funded in the following two years. In addition the sector will benefit from &pound;1 billion joint Welcome Trust and Government investment in research and technology infrastructure between 2002 and 2004, plus further funding of &pound;250 million over the three years to 2003&ndash;04 through the Office of Science and Technology for priority research in areas such as e-science and genomics.</p>

I am aware of the importance of existing qualifications to the continued running of Modern Apprenticeships and have consequently asked the Learning and Skills Council to identify which are essential until new accredited qualifications can replace them. The LSC is working closely with relevant sector bodies, including EMTA for engineering, to that end. Once the qualifications are identified and following consultation with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, I will take action to approve them. Outside the Modern Apprenticeship context, approvals will be limited to qualifications accredited by the QCA. Persons over 19 should have no problem in accessing existing courses, as LSC funding for them is not dependent on there being an approved qualification.</p>

AVCE courses give students suitable opportunities to achieve grades to enable them to follow their chosen career paths, including progression to employment, higher education or further training such as modern apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/2">QCA's work in monitoring the work of awarding bodies includes ensuring that qualifications are suitable for purpose and that students have the opportunity to achieve grades which reflect their achievement.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/3">The Secretary of State has not had discussions with the Chief Inspector on the subject in question. However, Ofsted Inspectors have programme of visits and inspections of schools and colleges to enable them to inspect standards. QCA held a two-day conference for awarding body chief examiners in November 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/4">AVCE qualifications have been designed to ensure that they are fully comparable with GCE A levels. QCA is charged with the task of maintaining standards of assessment and ensuring that it is consistent across all awarding bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/5">QCA and departmental officials have visited FE colleges to discuss the AVCE engineering course assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/6">Awarding bodies provide training and guidance to examiners on assessment. QCA is working with the awarding bodies to ensure that this training and guidance is appropriate and effective and that assessment gives a fair appraisal of students' achievement.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.2/1">We welcome the report, it shows that National Grid for Learning (NGfL) and New Opportunities Fund (NOF) initiatives along with sustained standards fund spending is making a real impact on both standards of teaching and the willingness of teachers to embrace ICT. We particularly welcome the report's confirmation that Government funding of ICT resources through the NGfL continues to make an important contribution to the development of the ICT curriculum and the use of new technologies in schools, and the recognition that this is beginning to impact on teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.2/2">The report acknowledges that the existence of the NOF programme has raised the profile of ICT training in many schools and it has helped teachers to improve their ICT skills significantly. However, we recognise that the report also raises concerns that this has not had as widespread an effect on classroom practice as intended, or as might reasonably be expected at this stage of the programme. We will be working with NOF and the Teacher Training Agency to ensure that the concerns are addressed and that we establish the most effective support for teachers who are crucial to the successful implementation of the overall programme. We also note, however, that the report recognises the excellent take up of this training and we look forward to increased evidence of impact as more schools complete their training.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.2/3">The report highlights personal access as one of the strongest influences toward successful training and classroom usage. We have provided over 50,000 teachers with PCs through various Government initiatives over the past few years, of which around 32,000 have been supplied via the Computers for Teachers Scheme. The current &pound;100 million Laptops for Teachers scheme will supply a further 100,000 teachers with computers from September 2002. Our Curriculum Online project will enable online access to digital learning materials that are easily accessible to teachers and which they can use to support the teaching across the curriculum.</p>

	<p pid=".494W.8/161" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".494W.8/162">1. Specialist schools receive a one-off grant of &pound;100,000 in their first year of designation for a capital project to support their specialist schools development plan. This matches the minimum &pound;50,000 sponsorship which they are required to raise from the private sector when they apply for specialist school designation.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.8/163">2. In addition, an annual grant is available for the four years of specialist school designation to support the costs of implementing the development plan. Assuming schools are successful in meeting the targets they set out in their initial application they can apply for re-designation for a further three years.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.8/164">3. The annual grant is currently calculated at a rate of &pound;123 per pupil up to 1,000 and over 1,200 pupils (special schools designated as specialist schools are funded at five times this rate). Funding in 1998&ndash;99 was calculated at the rate of &pound;100 per pupil up to 1,000 pupils and this was increased to &pound;120 per pupil in September 1999 to allow schools to develop the community element of their development plans. A further rise of &pound;3 per pupil was implemented in September 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".494W.8/165">4. The 2002&ndash;03 figures do not include schools that are currently being considered in the March 2002 competition.</p>

	<p pid=".512W.0/1">Costs associated with regulatory proposals are considered at the policy development stage. A regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is completed for regulatory proposals unless there are no or negligible costs, and sets out the impact, in terms of costs, benefits and risks of the proposed regulation which could affect businesses, charities or the voluntary sector. RIAs are available from the Library.</p>
