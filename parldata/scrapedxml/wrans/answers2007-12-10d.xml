	<p pid="d.1W.12/1">The Government protect commuters by regulating the average annual increases in season tickets. On Southeastern, this increase is limited to 3 per cent. above inflation from 2007 to 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.12/2">Individual fares can increase by more than the average, as long as no individual regulated fare increases by more than 8 per cent. above inflation from one year to the next. Therefore, individual regulated fares on Southeastern can rise by up to 11.8 per cent. for 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.12/3">Southeastern is committed by its Franchise Agreement to zonalise all fares in London from January 2008, including seasons. To achieve this, and to maintain a balanced fare structure, a general derogation against fares regulation was granted for a number of season fares within London. There were no specific discussions on fares from Bexleyheath.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.12/4">The new zonal fares structure on Southeastern will help pave the way for Oyster Pay-As-You-Go smart ticketing, to be rolled out across national rail in London from 2009. It simplifies the current complex system of individually-priced station-to-station fares.</p>

	<p pid="d.2W.5/1">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>, people aged 60 and over and eligible disabled people in England will be entitled to free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England, not just within their local area as at present.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/2">The costs will be apportioned to the Travel Concession Authority where the concessionaire boards the bus rather than where the concessionaire is resident&mdash;this is the only practical means of operating an England-wide concession for April next year.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/3">The extra &pound;212 million for the national bus concession will be distributed by the Department for Transport via a special grant. This extra funding is based on generous assumptions about pass take-up and trip levels and the overall probable cost impact of the new concession. We are therefore confident this funding will be sufficient in aggregate to meet the extra costs to local authorities. In addition, we have announced that we will be providing local authorities with approximately &pound;31 million for the issuing of the national pass.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/4">Any discretionary local enhancements, such as peak bus travel, are funded from an authority's own resources. Local enhancements can be restricted to eligible local residents. It is for local authorities to implement affordable local schemes taking account of their statutory obligations and their assessment of local circumstances and need.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/5">Regarding representations on the potential inequalities of the distribution of the grant funding, the Department for Transport's consultation on the formula basis for the distribution of the special grant closed on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>. The consultation included a number of different options for distributing the new funding, taking account of likely cost drivers, including bus patronage, eligible residents and visitors. A summary of the responses will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.5/6">The provisional special grant distribution was announced on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase> and will be the subject of a parliamentary debate in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="d.3W.2/1">The Department provides funding to encourage cycling through a number of different mechanisms. These are through a central budget, to local authorities through the local transport plan (LTP) settlement, and to the Mayor of London via a total transport grant through Transport for London (TfL). These combined give the following spend:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.3W.2/4"> <td></td> <td><i> Cycling spend</i><i>  (&pound; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.3W.2/5"> <td>2002-03</td> <td>50.2</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="d.3W.2/9"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>60.3</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.3W.2/12">The DfT integrated block element of the LTP settlement was worth &pound;547 million in 2006-07 while TfL received &pound;2.4 billion. It is for local authorities and TfL to determine their spend on cycling.</p>
	<p pid="d.3W.2/13">This is a partial picture. There are many other initiatives that can contribute to the encouragement of cycling. For example, road safety and traffic calming schemes such as 20 mph zones or through programmes such as the Sustainable Travel Towns where all forms of sustainable travel including cycling are encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="d.3W.2/14">It would, therefore, be impossible to disaggregate the expenditure from these programmes and initiatives that have a direct impact upon encouraging cycling.</p>

	<p pid="d.12W.6/1">One of the key objectives of the modernisation of the West Coast Main Line is to provide capacity for growth in passenger and freight over the next 30 years with substantially faster and more competitive journey times. Therefore, from the December 2008 timetable change, much greater use will be made of the fast lines with up to 11 trains every hour. This means that only two of these can call at Watford Junction.</p>
	<p pid="d.12W.6/2">The more fast line trains that call at Watford Junction, the lower the frequency that can operate to and from Euston. This would then reduce the benefits to passengers overall of the scheme, because the West Coast Main Line service as a whole would not be able to accommodate the projected demand. As a result of the new timetable, two of the 11 hourly services will call at Watford Junction. Watford Junction passengers are also able to interchange with a range of services at Milton Keynes.</p>

	<p pid="d.20W.5/1">The UK is vulnerable to the introduction of exotic animal disease as global trade in animals and animal products increases. Despite sophisticated systems of import control, we cannot hope to reduce the risk of introduction of disease to zero. Climate change and the threat of bio-terrorism also present new means by which animal disease could be introduced to this country. We must therefore ensure we can prepare for, and react quickly to, all disease outbreaks.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.5/2">The Government's ability to respond to outbreaks of exotic animal disease depends on having ready access to specialist facilities where diseases can be diagnosed quickly and with confidence, and where research is carried out on animal pathogens and the mechanisms to deal with disease outbreaks. This was highlighted by the pressure put on existing facilities during the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak in the UK. At least some of this work must be done in a facility with high bio-containment capability.</p>

We put the ban in place due to the high risk nature of bird gatherings when there is great uncertainty over the presence of undetected infection in other parts of the country immediately after an outbreak. We kept this ban under constant review and, following a veterinary risk assessment once we knew more about the spread of disease, we lifted the ban after 11 days.</p>
	<p pid="d.21W.2/2">It is a long established principle that the Government do not meet the costs of consequential losses due to disease control measures. It is inevitable that such measures for avian influenza will disrupt bird gatherings due to the need to prevent wide-scale disease spread for both animal and human health reasons. No Government could commit itself to insure bird keepers against the cost of all the losses resulting, directly or indirectly, from disease outbreaks or the action taken to deal with them.</p>

	<p pid="d.30W.9/1">The Association of British Insurers' Statement of Principles sets out members' commitments on availability of flood insurance in association with Government commitments on effective management of flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.9/2"><i> (a)</i> A full programme of Government-funded works across the country is currently forecast to considerably exceed the Spending Review target to improve protection from river flooding and coastal erosion for more than 100,000 households between 2005 and 2008. Our investment is making real improvements possible across the country but, regardless of future levels of funding, it would be unrealistic to expect the Government to address all flood and coastal erosion risk problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.9/3"><i> (b)</i> Spending on flood and coastal erosion risk management across central and local government has increased from &pound;307 million in 1996-97 to some &pound;600 million this year and will increase further to a minimum of &pound;650 million in 2008-09, &pound;700 million in 2009-10, reaching &pound;800 million in 2010-11. This represents a significant real terms increase.</p>

Member to the reply given by my colleague the Minister of State for Housing on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-29">29 October 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report, </i>column 673W, as this is a matter for the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.9/5"><i> (d)</i> Flood risk mapping is an important part of the Government's strategy on public awareness. DEFRA funds the Environment Agency to map flood risk as part of our strategy to ensure that the risk from flooding is better understood by all concerned. The Environment Agency continues to improve the flood mapping available to the public, local planning authorities, the emergency services and insurers.</p>
	<p pid="d.30W.9/6"><i> (e)</i> The Government's developing strategy to improve flood risk management, &quot;Making space for water&quot;, seeks to identify improvements in urban flood risk management where there is a complex interaction of drainage systems and a number of different organisations involved. As part of this, DEFRA is funding 15 pilots in different locations around the country to test new approaches to urban drainage management and clarify responsibilities. We are also developing proposals for how the current range of responsibilities for urban flood risk should be managed and the role of the Environment Agency in this.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">8 October</phrase>, DEFRA announced a package of assistance worth &pound;12.5 million aimed at supporting those livestock farmers in England most severely affected by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD), including those in the restriction areas. Implementation of all elements of the package is well under way and some are almost completed.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.5/2">&pound;8.5 million was allocated to provide support for our hill farmers. Approximately &pound;8.3 million has now been paid out. The rest of the payments are expected to be made by the end of December.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.5/3">&pound;1 million was allocated to raise the level of subsidy from 10 per cent. to 100 per cent. for the National Fallen Stock Scheme for farmers in the FMD Restricted Zone while it was in place. This scheme closed when the Restricted Zone was lifted on <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.5/4">&pound;2 million was to promote the sales of lamb, beef and pork domestically and in our export markets. The first payment of &pound;250,000 has been made. Lamb promotion activity has begun and additional beef promotion will start later this month. The demand for lamb from European partners is proving strong. Preparatory work has started for promoting third country exports of pork once we have regained World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) freedom, and additional domestic pork promotion will start in January.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.5/5">A donation of &pound;1 million was made to the Arthur Rank Centre for disbursement to Farming Help charities, which provide advice and practical and emotional support to farming families. &pound;500,000 has already been transferred.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.5/6">All domestic control restrictions have now been lifted, and the only restrictions remaining in place are those placed on movements to ensure eligibility for export to the EU.</p>

	<p pid="d.35W.5/1">The gamebird shooting industry involves the shooting of the native grey partridge and red grouse in addition to non-native gamebirds such as red-legged partridge and pheasant. These populations are managed for shooting and there is no evidence to suggest that shooting has resulted in population declines. In order to enhance gamebird populations, a range of native birds and mammals are killed legally as part of pest control campaigns. These species are generalist predators, including foxes, stoats, weasels, carrion crows and magpies. There is no evidence to suggest that this has an adverse affect on populations of these species, although little information is available on which to assess the impacts of killing stoats and weasels. The illegal persecution of native birds of prey, especially for the threatened hen harrier in England, has been associated with game rearing interests and remains a serious problem.</p>
	<p pid="d.35W.5/2">Natural England is working to establish management agreements with landowners and managers, including those associated with the game industry (especially on sites of special scientific interest), to restore peatlands by the blocking of drains and agreement of burning plans. In addition, DEFRA has recently set up a policy project to coordinate the Government's work on peat. This aims to protect and enhance peat under all forms of management. As a part of this work, we plan to commission research to assess the environmental impacts of peatland management.</p>
	<p pid="d.35W.5/3">We are aware of the potential for damage of unregulated or poorly practised burning. This is why we introduced the Heather and Grass etc. Burning (England) Regulations 2007. The regulations protect people, property and the natural environment, and introduce new rules to safeguard carbon-rich soils. In addition, we have published the Heather and Grass Burning Code 2007. The regulations and the code have the support of Natural England and key stakeholders, including the National Farmers' Union and the Moorland Association.</p>

	<p pid="d.38W.0/2">As part of the SAPO licence, we require Merial to apply rigorous standard operating procedures. In relation to the valves, these mean that each time the centrifuge is used, two operators must certify that the valve is locked shut and its integrity is confirmed by pressure tests before and after each batch. In addition, the preventive maintenance system includes regular inspections and although the valves on the centrifuge have a three-year life expectancy, they are replaced annually. All these checks must be recorded.</p>

	<p pid="d.38W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase>, Merial informed DEFRA of a biosecurity incident at Pirbright and, although the incident was contained, the use of live virus was immediately suspended as our paramount concern is the security of the site. An inspection team urgently conducted detailed checks and we are considering what further action needs to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="d.38W.6/2">It is too early to say what implications this may have on the production of a bluetongue vaccine. However, this suspension does not prevent Merial from conducting development of a bluetongue vaccine as their Pirbright site is primarily a production, rather than research, facility; Merial conduct the majority of their research elsewhere. There are also two other manufacturers of bluetongue vaccine, Intervet and Fort Dodge. We are currently considering bids from all three companies that were submitted following our recent tendering exercise and we plan to make an announcement on the outcome shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.42W.2/1">No specific estimate has been made by my Department on the number of waste facilities needed. However, DEFRA's Waste Infrastructure Delivery Programme (WIDP) is maintaining a national overview of existing and planned residual treatment capacity to ensure that resources are applied in the most effective manner. It is the responsibility of local authorities, working on their own or in partnership with neighbouring authorities, to procure waste management facilities suited to local needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.2/2">While we are confident that we have enough infrastructure in place to meet our 2010 EU Landfill Directive target, current estimates suggest that we still require an increase in diversion capacity to allow us to meet the 2013 and 2020 targets. This infrastructure will help to facilitate an increase in both recycling and composting and diversion from landfill. The number of facilities required will depend upon the nature of waste delivery authority procurements, the technology selected and the size of individual plants.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.2/3">We are currently aware of 81 plants across England (covering a range of treatment and disposal technologies) that are scheduled to become operational from 2008 onwards. These will potentially provide the capacity to treat an extra 10.3 million tonnes of municipal waste. With the ongoing engagement WIDP is undertaking with authorities, the combination of authorities' ambitions and the utilisation of the &pound;2 billion private finance initiative credits recently announced in the comprehensive spending review, the Government believe sufficient infrastructure can be delivered to meet our obligations under the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.2/4">It remains vital that regional spatial strategies and local development documents look forward and make adequate provision for the appropriate types and scales of infrastructure and waste treatment facilities needed. It is also important for specific and suitable sites to be identified in local plans.</p>

	<p pid="d.50W.2/2">The Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF) is made up of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, 16 Air Assault Brigade and the High Readiness Mechanised or Armoured Brigade. None of these units is currently deployed in a JRRF capacity. The elements of the JRRF that are currently held at high readiness, therefore, are the Lead Commando Group (LCG) and the Lead Airborne Task Force (ABTF). The LCG is made up of elements of 3 Commando Brigade, while the ABTF is currently provided by the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA). The remaining element of the high readiness reserve is provided by the Spearhead Land Element. The ABTF is due to be replaced by a Small Scale Focused Intervention Battlegroup, based on a Light Infantry Role Battlegroup, between February 2008 and January 2009; its readiness may vary over time depending on the unit rostered.</p>
	<p pid="d.50W.2/3">For non-discretionary JRRF tasks, equipment holdings exist to ensure mission success. However, some equipment types might need to be re-apportioned from supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, dependent on the task, to ensure that appropriate quantities were available.</p>

	<p pid="d.53W.5/1">While they are in the armed forces, British service personnel receive free medical treatment through the Defence Medical Services. When they leave the armed forces and when reservists are demobilised, the responsibility for their health care is transferred to the NHS. For in-service personnel and reservists, the Department annually commissions some &pound;29 million of activity (out-patients and in-patient care) from the five NHS trusts hosting MOD Hospital Units (MDHUs) and from University Hospital Birmingham NHS foundation trust (UHBFT). This includes approximately &pound;6.5 million for emergency care that we pay the MDHU host trusts and which is delivered under emergency access standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/2">The remainder (some &pound;22.5 million annually) is used to commission accelerated access care over and above current NHS waiting times. Many service personnel are also referred into their local district general hospital by their referring GPs. In addition, we spend just over &pound;1 million annually for other fast track access outside our MDHU host trusts.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.5/3">Introduced in 1953, NHS Priority Treatment was restricted to veterans with disablements accepted under our Armed Forces Compensation Scheme as service-related. The Health Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase> that extended priority treatment will be available to all veterans whose conditions are suspected by the general practitioner of being service-related. Any costs will be paid for by the NHS. I announced the launch of the new veterans' mental health pilots in parallel as an important initiative to improve services for those with mental health problems. The MOD will provide start up costs to the six pilot sites participating in the scheme and cover the cost of project evaluation; we expect the total cost of the pilots to the Department to be some &pound;500,000. Any pilot cost beyond this will be the responsibility of the local NHS trusts.</p>

	<p pid="d.54W.2/1">Within the terms of the Annington contract the return of void married quarters to Annington Homes does not generate a receipt for the MOD. Under the terms of the Profit Share Agreement with Annington Homes Limited, however, when MOD hand back surplus married quarters to Annington Homes and subsequently Annington Homes sell the properties, 22 per cent. of the proceeds of the sales of surplus MOD properties is returned to HM Treasury. These monies enter a consolidated general cash account and are not paid directly back from HM Treasury to the MOD.</p>

	<p pid="d.54W.5/1">The policy applied in these situations is set out in Tri-Service Accommodation Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.5/2">Following the death in service of a serviceman or woman, the bereaved spouse/civil partner and their family have continued entitlement to Service Families Accommodation (SFA) for a reasonable period to assist them in coming to terms with their bereavement and to enable them to determine their longer term housing requirements. A period of two years is offered. Retention of SFA may be extended beyond the two year period at the discretion of the local service commander in consultation with welfare, medical, and educational authorities and with Defence Estates Operations&mdash;Housing. The objective of the policy is to help the bereaved spouse/civil partner in their transition back into the civilian community. At no time will a bereaved spouse/civil partner and their families need to leave a property until they have secured suitable alternative accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.5/3">Once a decision has been taken to medically discharge an individual from the service, the Defence Medical Services health team who have been caring for that individual will liaise with appropriate civilian healthcare providers (e.g. General Practitioner, primary care trust, civilian mental health team, or NHS Hospital Trust) to ensure the transfer of care and patient history takes place. In addition, specialist health social workers will manage the individual's wider resettlement issues, liaising with relevant civil agencies such as local housing authorities, financial authorities, service welfare and charitable organisations. The objective is again to ensure that the individual's transfer into the civilian environment is as smooth and as seamless as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.5/4">For personnel compulsorily discharged on medical grounds, 93 days continued use and occupancy of the SFA is permitted after the date of discharge. Thereafter, extensions of up to 93 days at a time may be granted on compassionate grounds at the discretion of Defence Estates Operations&mdash;Housing, in consultation with the appropriate local service commander. No personnel discharged will need to leave SFA until an appropriate alternative accommodation has been secured.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.5/5">The Joint Service Housing Advice Office (JSHAO) is available to all service personnel and their families, offering advice and guidance in sourcing social and private accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="d.64W.6/1">Figures for those participating in apprenticeships funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) can be derived from the individualised learner record (ILR). The programme-led apprenticeship (PLA) is an initiative to enable more learners to enter an employed status apprenticeship programme. When they achieve their agreed goals, learners cease to be on a PLA and then become mainstream apprentices. It is possible to calculate participation for programme-led apprenticeships from the ILR data, but not their progression onto mainstream apprenticeships and therefore the associated framework achievement.</p>

The Border and Immigration Agency can advise the names of the colleges removed and the numbers of students granted further leave to remain on the basis of their studies at these colleges. However, some of these students may have started their studies in the UK at these colleges, found them to be non bona fide and transferred to a genuine education provider. At present, it is not mandatory for a foreign student to notify the Border and Immigration Agency when they change their place of study.

However, we have consistently made clear that if a physics or chemistry department closes at one institution, the Higher Education Funding Council for England should seek to maintain capacity elsewhere and we announced last year that the Council should report to us on how provision can be maintained in this way. Some science subjects are starting to become more popular and the measures we are taking to increase demand and the extra &pound;75 million announced last year should help to sustain capacity as demand increases. Physics and chemistry are also taught as major subjects at some 50 and 70 UK institutions respectively. The latest figures published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that the number of students who have been accepted for entry to full-time undergraduate courses in chemistry in autumn 2007 is up by nearly 13 per cent. compared to 2005, while the figures for physics have increased by 10 per cent. over the same period.</p>

	<p pid="d.68W.0/2">The basis of the estimate of economic benefits of raising the participation age (RPA) is new joint research by Sheffield university and DCSF. The research's central estimate of the additional benefits of RPA is around &pound;2.4 billion for a single cohort of young people discounted over their lifetimes. This research was published alongside the introduction of the Education and Skills Bill to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>. This estimate was derived in three stages:</p>
	<p pid="d.68W.0/3" class="indent">1. Modelling how many additional young people participate in full-time education as a result of RPA;</p>
	<p pid="d.68W.0/4" class="indent">2. Modelling the attainment of these additional participants; and</p>

	<p pid="d.72W.2/1">The Government are committed to reducing excessive alcohol consumption among young people. In June of this year, the Home Office, Department of Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families jointly launched 'Safe. Sensible. Social. The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy' which builds on lessons learned and progress made since the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England (published in March 2004). The renewed strategy outlines the Government's long-term commitment to tackling alcohol-related harms among young people through a combination of robust enforcement of the law, information and awareness raising through communications campaigns to help them make informed decisions about alcohol, and treatment for those that need it.</p>
	<p pid="d.72W.2/2">We have recently carried out a Tackling Under Age Sales of Alcohol campaign which saw overall failure rates failing to 14 per cent. and have just begun a Responsible Alcohol sales campaign. The Department's recent Confiscation of Alcohol campaign to support the commencement of new powers and support the use of existing powers in relation to the confiscation of alcohol resulted in large volumes of alcohol being seized from young people drinking in public places. In addition, we launched Alcohol Arrest Referral pilots in Cheshire, Ealing, Manchester and Liverpool in October that aim to reduce re-offending by individuals who have been arrested for alcohol-related offending.</p>
	<p pid="d.72W.2/3">We see information and awareness raising as key to reducing excessive alcohol consumption by young people. The Know Your Limits binge drinking campaign has been successful in raising awareness of the dangers of binge drinking. We will, in the new year, launch the next phase of the Government's alcohol communications campaign which will seek to raise awareness of units and target the tolerance of drunkenness.</p>

	<p pid="d.73W.5/1">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the standard conditions placed on project licences allow for the sourcing of laboratory animals (listed in Schedule 2 to the Act) from abroad only if authorised and if no suitable animals are available in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/2">Visits by the Inspectorate are risk based, depending on the need to monitor standards of husbandry and care or the progress of improvements. When appropriate they are timed to coincide with applications for acceptance or continued acceptance of an overseas centre. The Inspectorate will usually consider a visit necessary before giving advice on the continuing acceptability of a centre and may regard a visit as appropriate if concerns about an accepted centre are raised.</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.5/3">On this basis, an overseas centre approved to supply non-human primates to designated establishments will be visited about every two to four years depending on the findings from the previous visit, the need to reassess on site and whether animals are being supplied from the site. Between visits interim assessments are made from information provided by other visitors and responses to specific questions on current care and accommodation</p>

These figures are for the whole NDNAD and cover persons sampled by police forces in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and by other UK forces such as the Channel Islands.</p>

	<p pid="d.84W.0/3">Approximately 3,916,500 persons with a DNA profile retained on the NDNAD had provided a sample following arrest by police forces in England and Wales; and 21,600 persons provided a sample voluntarily for forces in England and Wales. The number of persons on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. fewer than the number of subject sample profiles. It is currently estimated that 13.7 per cent. of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database. Nonetheless, a long-term exercise is under way to identify issues associated with the removal of all such redundant replicate profiles.</p>

Discretionary referral of conduct matters to the IPCC may be done only with the authority of a DPS officer of the rank of Detective Superintendent or above. The IPCC, which has guardianship of the police complaints system, also has the power to call in an investigation where circumstances justify their involvement.</p>

This was conveyed to the solicitors for Mr. and Mrs. Mohamud in January 2007.</p>

Any activity (such as advice to a member of the public or responding to antisocial behaviour) carried out while on patrol is recorded separately.

	<p pid="d.92W.0/1">The time spent by police officers on paperwork and other administrative duties remains an inevitable, but often necessary part of the process of protecting the public. We are, however, taking measures to reduce the time spent on these activities in order to increase the time police officers are able to spend on front line duties. These measures include: improving custody management working practices and processes; streamlining and providing greater local flexibility over performance management requirements; and providing a new &pound;50 million capital fund to support wider access to time and paperwork saving innovative electronic fingerprinting and mobile data technologies.</p>

The provisions relating to this are contained in regulation 14 and the determination at annex D of the Police Regulations 2003. Guidance, which is available to police forces and police authorities, is contained in the Home Office Guidance on Police Unsatisfactory Performance, Complaints and Misconduct Procedures; there is further clarification of the provisions relating to retirement by officers under investigation/suspension in Home Office circulars 55/2003 and 8/2005, which are available on the Home Office website.</p>

	<p pid="d.98W.12/1">Europol has a role to play in combating terrorism across the EU by providing support to the European law enforcement community through their research and analysis capability.

It also enables Europol to provide alerts to the law enforcement agencies throughout Europe.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.12/2">The provision of terrorist incident data to Europol by the law enforcement community also allows them through their analysis of all data they receive, to identify any association or connection between a terrorist suspect and other possible suspects based elsewhere in Europe.

	<p pid="d.139W.2/2" class="italic"> Temporary accommodation</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.2/3">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation is collected quarterly at local authority level, in respect of households rather than people. Information reported each quarter by local authorities about their activities under homelessness legislation includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. This data is published in our quarterly statistical release on Statutory Homelessness, available on our website and placed in the Library each quarter. The latest release was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-10">10 September 2007</phrase> and contains data for the period April to June 2007:</p>

	<p pid="d.139W.2/5">The latest figures show that there were 84,900 households in temporary accommodation in England on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June 2007</phrase>. This is down from 101,000 in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.2/6" class="italic"> Overcrowding</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.2/7">Over the period 2003-04 to 2005-06 it is estimated, from Survey of English Housing figures, that there were 47,000 households in England living in severely overcrowded conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.2/8">The benchmark for assessing whether or not a household is overcrowded or severely overcrowded is the Bedroom Standard. This is determined for each household in accordance with its age/sex/marital status composition and the relationship of the members to one another. A separate bedroom is required:</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.2/9" class="indent">for each married or cohabiting couple;</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.2/10" class="indent">for any other person aged 21 or over;</p>

	<p pid="d.139W.2/14">This standard is then compared with the actual number of bedrooms (including bed-sitters) available for the sole use of the household.

	<p pid="d.139W.2/15">If a household has fewer bedrooms than implied by the standard then it is deemed to be 'overcrowded'. Since one bedroom will be sufficient for single person households and for married/cohabiting couples, these households cannot be overcrowded according to the bedroom standard. If a household has two or more bedrooms fewer than implied by the standard then it is deemed to be 'severely overcrowded'.</p>

Circular 09/98: 'Town and Country Planning (playing fields) (England) Direction 1998' which relates to the loss of playing fields, whether for schools or for the wider community, will also be directly relevant.</p>

	<p pid="d.155W.3/3">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has provided the national tourism agency, VisitBritain (and its predecessor bodies), with funding since 1997 to promote Britain internationally, and England domestically, as an attractive tourist destination. The west midlands has benefited from this support for the sector, in common with the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.155W.3/4">From 1997-98 to 2002-03, funding passed from the English Tourist Council (ETC, formerly the English Tourist Board) to the Heart of England Tourist Board (HETB), which represented both the east and west midlands. In 2003, the regional development agencies, including Advantage West Midlands (AWM), took on strategic responsibility for tourism support in the regions. Since then, AWM has worked with partners in the region to reorganise tourism support structures, including the development of Tourism West Midlands to oversee the delivery of the West Midlands Visitor Economy Strategy, and has allocated revenue funding to the development and promotion of tourism.</p>
	<p pid="d.155W.3/5">AWM has led significant capital investment in tourism infrastructure and facilities through a number of funding streams, including European structural funds. Businesses in the tourism sector also benefit from access to skills and training programmes funded by the Learning and Skills Council, and business support schemes delivered through Business Link West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="d.155W.3/6">In addition, DCMS has made substantial investment in heritage, arts and culture since 1997. These sectors, in addition to their intrinsic value to the nation's cultural life, benefit the visitor economy by attracting visitors.</p>

	<p pid="d.160W.8/1">I am committed to maintaining the excellent language skills of Diplomatic Service staff and to modernising the ways in which those skills are acquired. Following a review of the provision of language training, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services concluded in 2006 that its language teaching services cost between 15 and 40 per cent. more than comparable providers and that it should no longer provide language teaching services to the FCO.</p>
	<p pid="d.160W.8/2">At the same time, the FCO conducted a policy review of language training which recommended a number of reforms, including more group and in-country teaching. These changes would further increase the cost of in-house teaching. The FCO therefore concluded that it would be a better use of public money to outsource the language teaching requirement. A key element in the new arrangements was a strict quality control and monitoring component to ensure that the quality of teaching was maintained. My right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Margaret Beckett) approved the decision to close the Language Centre on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March 2007</phrase>. Since then we have taken a number of further actions to implement this decision, culminating in the closure of the Language Centre in October 2007.</p>

Friend the Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> raised human rights concerns during his visit to Turkmenistan in September. Our embassy in Ashgabat will continue to lobby the Turkmen Government with our EU partners in support of individual cases. Mufti Ibadullah and Geldy Kyarisov were among a number of prisoners of concern who were released this year, after UK and EU lobbying. Maral Yklimova too was allowed to leave the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.164W.6/2">An ad hoc meeting on human rights took place in the margins of the EU's Joint Committee meeting with the Turkmen Government in Ashgabat in September 2007. Issues raised included the importance of allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to prisoners, further relaxing restrictions on foreign travel and individual prisoners of concern. Human rights were also raised during President Berdimuhamedov's visit to Brussels in November when he met Mr. Barroso, Mr. Solana and the Foreign Affairs, Trade and Energy Commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="d.164W.6/3">We welcome the action the Turkmen Government has taken so far to begin to relax travel restrictions and to encourage Turkmens to travel and study abroad, but there remains a long way to go. We hope that the recent willingness by the Turkmen Government to engage with the EU, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, the UN and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe under President Berdimuhamedov will lead to positive, substantive progress on human rights and democratic reform. We will continue to work with international partners to build on the work the Turkmen Government has begun on fulfilling its human rights obligations through civil society development, good governance and the rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="d.166W.3/2">The UK believes the IWC is the internationally recognised body for the management and conservation of whale stocks and any amendment to the ICRW would need to be ratified by all parties. The UK sees no advantage in pressing for the termination or renegotiation of the 1948 International Whaling Convention, as this is the legal instrument by which a general moratorium on commercial whaling has been upheld since 1986. In addition, Japan is unlikely to sign up to a new convention that restricts her current 'scientific' whaling.</p>

	<p pid="d.168W.8/1">The emergency response has been rapid, especially that of the Government of Bangladesh, which has taken a strong co-ordination lead. Relief efforts have reached nearly all affected areas, but there is room for better co-ordination in reaching the ultra poor and most needy. The water availability crisis has passed, due to the high attention given to this by the government, supported by others, including the military and some donors. However, a large number of people remain in makeshift camps that are still in urgent need of water, sanitation and hygiene support. The UK is looking to support meeting these short to medium-term needs by allocating &pound;2.5 million, from our &pound;7 million pledge for cyclone relief, to CARE, OXFAM GB, and Save the Children UK. This will focus on water, sanitation and hygiene promotion in the most affected areas.</p>

	<p pid="d.171W.2/4">A large proportion of these funds are used for construction of new school infrastructure in both new and existing schools. The Ministry of Education reports that 2,322 new classrooms have been built in 2007 (in primary and junior secondary schools). Toilet blocks, furniture and, in some poorer areas, housing for teachers are also provided. Smaller amounts of UK funding are also provided for school construction through EC micro-projects, through the World Bank, and through the Education For All fast track initiative.</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.2/5">For the last six years, DFID has been supporting the government of Nigeria, at both state and federal level, to build the capacity to use its own resources more effectively in the provision of basic education including school construction. Support is focused on three major initiatives all of which seek to improve school facilities:</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.2/6" class="indent">DFID's capacity building for universal basic education project (CUBE) supports capacity building in Kano, Kaduna and Kwara states, including in the implementation of the World Bank's state education sector project (SESP). The wider SESP will support the renovation and construction of classrooms in 98 schools in the three states;</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.2/7" class="indent">The &pound;26 million girls education project (GEP) is funded by DFID and implemented by UNICEF in six Nigerian states (all six of which have large numbers of girls out of school). GEP provides support for educational materials, some minor renovation work and water points and toilets for 720 schools in the six states.</p>
	<p pid="d.171W.2/8" class="indent">From 2008, DFID's new &pound;106 million education sector support programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) will provide technical assistance to up to six Nigerian states to improve the planning, procurement and construction of schools, including the provision of small grants to communities to help them manage and improve local facilities.</p>

	<p pid="d.173W.5/1">The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains critical. Malnutrition rates have risen sharply since the heavy rains in the autumn, particularly in the camps. Ongoing violence has led to a further 260,000 people being displaced this year alone, adding to the more than two million people already living in camps across the region. The camps are overstretched and becoming increasingly volatile. The increase in needs has been compounded by an escalation of attacks by armed groups against humanitarian agencies. This is having a serious impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver vital aid to those in need.</p>
	<p pid="d.173W.5/2">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor in Sudan, having given over &pound;275 million in humanitarian aid since 2004, over &pound;145 million of which has gone to Darfur. The UK is playing a leading role in improving the effectiveness of the humanitarian response such as the &pound;40 million 2007 contribution to the Common Humanitarian Fund. The UK is also a strong supporter of international efforts to build on local-level peace-building and the AU/UN-led Darfur peace talks which commenced on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase> in Libya. We urge all parties to commit to full participation in the next phase of talks.</p>

That remains the Government's view.</p>
	<p pid="d.176W.2/2">The House of Lords reached a unanimous decision that pleural plaques do not constitute actionable or compensatable damage. The decision is based on fundamental principles of the law of negligence&mdash;firstly, that compensation can only be payable where there is actual damage, and secondly that compensation is not payable simply for the risk or the worry that something might happen in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.176W.2/3">Overturning these fundamental principles in the case of pleural plaques would create uncertainty in the law and could raise the possibility of claims being made much more widely for the risk of an illness occurring or for worry that something might happen.. This would considerably increase the level of litigation and the possibility of weak or spurious claims, and could have damaging effects on business and the economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.182W.2/2">The recruitment process for Prison Officers is by way of a Job Simulation Assessment Centre to assess that candidates are competent to undertake the role. If they are successful in the assessment process, they are deemed capable to work in any prison establishment.</p>

However, this information is now being recorded centrally by the Ministry of Justice and figures will be available shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.3/2">Sickness absence can become a disciplinary issue when someone is off sick without authority (either absent from work for more than seven days but has not provided a doctor's certificate, or fails to ring their line manager on the day of their sick absence attendance) and does not improve following a meeting and an agreed action plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.3/3">Appropriate warning levels can be issued at any stage. Warnings are not issued because someone is unwell, they are issued for non-attendance at work, and are part of the process for managing absence. If someone were to be found to have misled their employers about the absence they would be dealt with under the conduct policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.3/4">The health referral can be used at any stage, and is not a disciplinary sanction. For example, if someone had a pattern of frequent short-term absence, a referral could be done to see if there were any underlying medical problems. Similarly if someone disclosed diagnosis of a serious medical condition, a referral could be done immediately to identify any reasonable adjustments that could be made.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.3/5">Within Her Majesty's Prison Service, Prison Service Order 8403 Management of Attendance contains the policy on dealing with sickness absence. 2,066 members of HM Prison Service staff have been dismissed for the reason of medical inefficiency or medically retired over the last five years.</p>

The package includes financial incentives, in work support and if appropriate, participation in a joint NHS / Jobcentre Plus Condition Management programme, so they can understand and manage their condition with a view to returning to work. The adviser identifies when, and if other specialist advice or provision is needed.</p>

	<p pid="d.193W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Employment and Welfare Reform has asked me to reply to your question about the estimated number of Jobseeker's Allowance claimants who are contacted about their claim more frequently than every two weeks; every two weeks; and less than every two weeks. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/4" class="indent">The vast majority of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance are required to attend the Jobcentre at least every two weeks to show they are actively seeking and available for work, and therefore remain entitled to payment. During certain key stages of the claim people are required to attend more frequently for short periods.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/5" class="indent">In 2006/07 there were 2.3 million claims for Jobseekers Allowance. Of these, about 60% (1.3 million) left before 13 weeks, and will have attended a Jobcentre Plus office on a fortnightly basis during that time. Those claiming beyond 13 weeks (about 965,000) will have had a combination of weekly/fortnightly contacts, depending upon the duration of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/6" class="indent">Additionally, in 2006/07 there was a total of 29,350 interviews with 7,337 customers suspected of working while claiming benefit, but where there was not enough evidence to warrant a full fraud investigation. These customers were required to attend the Jobcentre Plus office for a series of interviews arranged to take place on days other than their normal day of attendance in order to disrupt any potential work pattern.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.2/7" class="indent">The only exception to the requirement to attend the Jobcentre fortnightly or weekly is people who are able to maintain their claim by post, for example because of the distance they live from their nearest Jobcentre Plus office. While these people are not required to actually attend the Jobcentre as frequently as other customers, they are required, by post, to show they are actively seeking and available for work on a similar fortnightly or weekly basis, depending upon the length of their claim. We do not have information on the number of postal claimants, but the (postal) eligibility rules mean they only ever represent a small percentage of the overall number claiming Jobseekers Allowance.</p>

	<p pid="d.193W.5/2">Jobseeker's allowance regulations do not normally allow claimants to refuse an offer of employment if they would not be made financially better off by accepting the offer. However, there are easements which allow good cause for refusing a job which are considered by an independent decision maker. They will look at all the available evidence, and it is possible, they will consider the claimant has good cause for refusing an offer of employment, if they would not be made financially better off by accepting the offer.</p>
	<p pid="d.193W.5/3">The impact of these measures was considered in our Green Paper, &quot;In Work, Better Off: Next Steps to Full Employment&quot;, and in the subsequent consultation on its proposals. We will be responding to these in our White Paper Response.</p>

Column 2 is based on paying UK pensioners the current full value of the basic state pension of &pound;87.30 per week uprated by the relevant Average Earnings Index of 3.5 per cent. and rounded to the nearest five pence, which gives a figure of &pound;90.35 in 2008-09.<br/> 3. Column 3 is based on the value of the current level of the pension credit standard minimum guarantee of &pound;119.05 per week for a single person, uprated by the relevant Average Earnings Index of 3.5 per cent. and rounded to the nearest five pence, which gives a figure of &pound;123.20 in 2008-09.<br/> 4. Column 4: Sixty per cent. of median population income for a single person with no children after deducting housing costs was &pound;108 per week in 2005-06 (Households Below Average Income: An analysis of the income distribution 1994/95&mdash;2005/06 (Revised), DWP). This figure has been uprated by average earnings to &pound;121.60 per week in 2008-09.<br/> 5. In the financial years up to and including 2013-14 Treasury economic assumptions have been used to model earnings uprating.

'All pensioners' is defined as all individuals over state pension age living in the United Kingdom. The estimates do not include pensioners claiming a UK pension, but living overseas. Including this group would increase the estimated costs.<br/> 8. The estimates are consistent with mid-2004 GAD population projections. We are currently in the process of revising our expenditure projections in line with the mid-2006 ONS population projections.<br/> 9.

	<p pid="d.197W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated 10 <i> D</i> ecember 2007:</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions relating to the operation of the discretionary Social Fund scheme. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is solely responsible for administering the Social Fund, including making initial decisions on applications for loans and Community Care Grants and providing the first tier of review for applicants dissatisfied with their original decision. Decision makers must adhere to the Directions issued by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and take account of guidance he has given. They should also have regard to the state of the budget in the Social Fund unit they are attached to. Decision makers are fully trained in the principles of decision making and the rules relating to the Social Fund.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/5" class="indent">Social Fund Inspectors working at the Independent Review Service for the Social Fund (an independent statutory body) provide the second tier of the review for customers dissatisfied with the review decision made by the decision maker in Jobcentre Plus. Customers who are still dissatisfied may apply for Judicial Review.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/6" class="indent">Inspector's decisions are returned to Jobcentre Plus and are used as a learning resource for decision makers. The Social Fund Commissioner, the head of the Independent Review Service, has provided assistance to Jobcentre Plus by making his staff available to assist us in training our decision makers. Inspector's decisions have always been a useful resource for Jobcentre Plus decision makers. We are now formalising that as part of an enhanced checking regime designed to improve the standard of decision making.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/7" class="indent">The particulars of each application are recorded on the national Social Fund Computer System. For Budgeting Loans this includes the reasons for the decision and repayment terms. For Community Care Grants and Crisis Loans, in addition to recording the details on the computer system, decision makers are required to complete a written decision which explains in details the reasons why an award has been made or refused.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/8" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus monitors customer service through the Mystery Shopper Programme, which is an independent measure of the accuracy and comprehensiveness of information given to customers. The scenarios used by the Mystery Shopper include some questions about elements of the Social Fund. Performance against these questions contributes to the wider Customer Service Target.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/9" class="indent">Social Fund decision makers are advised to alert customers, where appropriate, to charitable sources of funding such as the Family Fund. Decision makers refusing an award from one part of Social Fund will as a matter of routine consider whether an application to another part of the fund might be successful. When a decision is made to refuse a Community Care Grant the decision maker will automatically consider whether a crisis loan can be awarded. Similarly, if a Crisis Loan is refused the decision maker should consider whether the award of a Community Care Grant is appropriate. Where neither is appropriate consideration should be given to issuing a Budgeting Loan application form to the customer as legislation does not permit us to treat an application for a Community Care Grant or Crisis Loan as a Budgeting Loan.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/10" class="indent">The Community Care Grant scheme operates within the constraints of a cash limited budget and awards are made based on prioritisation of customer need which ensures that available funding goes to those with the highest priority needs. In each case the decision maker considers the nature, extent and urgency of need and whether the priority of the need can be met from the relevant budget allocation.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/11" class="indent">I hope that this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.201W.7/2">The Climate Change Bill, which was introduced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase>, will require Government to assess the risks climate change poses to the UK, and to report to Parliament. The first national risk assessment, which includes energy issues, will be carried out within three years of enactment of the Bill, with subsequent assessments being published at least every five years. In addition, the Bill will also require the Government to publish and regularly update an adaptation programme. This will set out the Government's objectives in relation to adaptation to climate change and their proposals and policies for meeting those objectives. As part of preparations for developing this programme, the Government will be publishing an adaptation policy framework in spring 2008 .</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.7/3">BERR has been actively engaged in those adaptation responsibilities included in its remit. The Department's responsibilities primarily affected by the impacts of climate change include those relating to energy, telecoms and regional economic performance. In relation to the energy sector, there are already a number of existing obligations relating to security of supply in place which help to ensure that adaptation to climate change occurs. The electricity companies have general obligations in relation to continuity of supply via the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations, which are enforced by BERR. Electricity and gas utilities also have a general legal duty under the terms of their licence to ensure adequate levels of security of supply. These are enforced by Ofgem, who have powers to require electricity and gas utilities to provide them with the information necessary for Ofgem to assess compliance with the duty.</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.7/4">As evidenced by the response during the flooding in the summer, Government are working, and will continue to work closely with industry&mdash;including telecoms&mdash;to ensure services are restored to customers as soon as possible following any weather-related or other events which may cause disruption to service.</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.7/5">In relation to the Department's regional responsibilities, the Review of Sub-national Economic Development and Regeneration published in July indicated that it was essential that every region plans to ensure that it is resilient to a changing climate. The Review confirmed that the Government propose to give the regional development agencies the executive responsibility for developing single integrated regional strategies which set out the economic, social and environmental objectives for each region.</p>

	<p pid="d.209W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.8/2">The Government are committed to increasing the number of young people studying science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) as set out in the Science and Innovation Investment Framework and 2006 Next Steps. These commitments are focussed on encouraging young people to study STEM subjects right throughout the educational system from the early stages and beyond. The Government are providing support for activities that help enthuse young people about engineering and science. For example DCSF sponsors the science and engineering after school clubs run by STEMNET and the Engineering Education Scheme which engages engineering companies with schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.8/3">The DCSF is also in the process of commissioning a programme of careers support and guidance, and a communications campaign both with the aim informing young people more about the varied and exciting opportunities that exist in STEM in pre and post-16 education and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.8/4">From September 2008 young people will have the option to take the Diploma in Engineering which will be available at all three levels 1, 2 and 3. The nature of the 14- 19 Diploma programme means that young people acquire the education they need to progress to further learning and employment within the sectors that relate to their diploma of choice and outside too.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.8/5">DIUS funds the Science and Engineering Ambassadors scheme, run by STEMNET, for scientists and engineers to act as role models for schoolchildren. DIUS also sponsors the Royal Academy of Engineering. One element of their work includes developing programmes to enthuse and engage young people in engineering subjects, for example, the Technology and Engineering in Schools Strategy (TESS), through which the professional community of engineering institutions and other stakeholders are taking a co-ordinated approach to work within schools to promote engineering and technology.</p>
	<p pid="d.209W.8/6">At HE level the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) are funding the National Engineering Programme (NEP), of which the London Engineering project is the first part to get off the ground. After creating a successful working model with the London pilot project, the programme will extend to six other cities in England. Managed by the Royal Academy of Engineering, this Programme, the aim of the programme is to change the face of UK higher education in engineering, widening participation and strengthening engineering as a strategic subject.</p>

	<p pid="d.213W.0/2"><i> </i>Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 provides regulatory guidance which insolvency practitioners must follow when seeking approval for their fees. Matters to be considered by the approving body (usually the creditors) include the effectiveness with which the insolvency practitioner has carried out his duties and the value and nature of the assets with which he has had to deal. In October 2004 the court issued a practice statement which provides guidance on matters that will be taken into account when the court is dealing with an application for review of remuneration.</p>
	<p pid="d.213W.0/3">Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Rules 1986 provides the percentage rates that may be charged on both the realisation and distribution of assets where the remuneration of a liquidator or trustee has not been fixed by the liquidation/creditors' committee or the creditors at a general meeting. The percentage scale provided in Schedule 6 is taken from the scale that at one time was applicable to official receivers. However, provisions in the Enterprise Act 2002 introduced a new financial regime for official receivers, whereby creditors pay for the costs of the official receiver's administration of cases. Such costs are now provided for in a Fees Order and do not relate to the remuneration limits set out in Schedule 6.</p>

If the Government were to confirm their preliminary view that it would be in the public interest to allow private sector energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations, we have proposed to undertake a strategic siting assessment (SSA), in combination with a strategic environmental assessment, to develop robust, objective and transparent criteria for assessing the suitability of sites for new nuclear power stations.</p>

	<p pid="d.216W.2/2">As the Government's response to the national public consultation on the post office network explained the arguments for a longer local consultation period were considered but the Government decided to confirm their decision for a six week local consultation period reflecting the approach followed during the latter stages of the urban reinvention programme. The early stages of developing Post Office Ltd.'s area plan proposals involve detailed plan development discussions with Postwatch and the involvement of local authorities in advance of formal public consultation. When combined with the subsequent six weeks of public consultation, the Government believe that this enables sufficiently robust consultations to take place at a local area level. We are also mindful of the fact that the organisation representing sub-postmasters argued for a speedy local consultation to minimise uncertainty for sub-postmasters and customers.</p>

	<p pid="d.218W.8/1">In order to meet the challenging target of 20 per cent. of the EU's energy to come from renewable sources by 2020, we are taking steps to increase the amount of electricity, heat and transport fuel generated from renewable resources. I understand the question relates to my right hon. Friend's comments on biomass, marine and tidal range power and wind, each of which has a part to play in meeting this target.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.8/2">We already plan to increase the capacity of offshore wind farms from the 400 MW currently installed to more than 8 GWs, and we will shortly be announcing proposals to allow a further significant expansion. We are also considering the barriers to further deployment including the potential difficulties that wind farms pose to air traffic and defence radar and ensuring an appropriate balance between enabling offshore wind farms and protecting shipping. We will also ensure that the new Marine Bill responds sensitively to the environmental issues that are posed by offshore wind farm development.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.8/3">We are also exploring the potential for major new investment in energy from wave and tidal sources and we have already announced a study of the feasibility of generating tidal energy from the River Severn. This alone could provide 5 per cent. of Britain's electricity needs. We have also announced that we will include tidal lagoons and barrages below 1 gigawatt capacity within the scope of the renewable obligation, potentially benefiting projects such as those being proposed for Rhyl and Swansea Bay.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.8/4">Meeting our target will also require greater use of renewables to heat our homes and our buildings so we will introduce new measures to bring forward renewable heat with a call for evidence in January prior to a full consultation on this. And as we expand renewable heat we will need to ensure that wherever feasible and economic we generate electricity and heat together. So instead of all our energy being generated remotely, more can be supplied locally, making more efficient use of our energy resources. In transport we will do more to stimulate sustainable forms and sources of bio fuels.</p>
	<p pid="d.218W.8/5">We are also legislating to reform the renewables obligation, to bring forward newer technologies, and we will introduce in our Planning Bill new measures to speed up the planning system for major infrastructure projects whilst ensuring the public are properly consulted.</p>

	<p pid="d.224W.6/1">Agencies addressing children's needs are encouraged to work closely with parents and carers. For example, schools and local authorities are statutorily required to have regard to the special educational needs (SEN) code of practice; among other things, the code stresses the importance of all professionals (in schools, local authorities and other agencies) actively seeking to work with parents, valuing the contribution they make. The code also reminds local authorities that section 332A of the Education Act 1996 requires them to arrange for the parent of any child in their area with special educational needs to be provided with advice and information about matters relating to those needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.224W.6/2">The Children Act 2004 provides a statutory framework for cooperation between local authorities, partner agencies and other relevant organisations to improve outcomes for all children including those who have been diagnosed as experiencing an attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Given that this disorder often entails difficult or challenging behaviour, supporting the child to address his or her behaviour is in itself helpful to his or her parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.224W.6/3">Drug treatment for ADHD should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified health care professional with relevant expertise and should be based on comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug therapy may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.224W.6/4">Health care professionals are encouraged to work closely with education and social care services to ensure appropriate interventions are offered. These interventions should include focusing on the child's behaviour in the context of his or her relationships at home and in the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="d.224W.6/5">If there are concerns that a child may have additional needs which require a range of services, or it is unclear what his or her needs are, agencies are increasingly using the common assessment framework (CAP) to identify appropriate ways forward. Within the CAP and its associated guidance, there are prompts for practitioners to consider a wide range of factors and the potential role of other agencies.</p>

The Department is unable to estimate the differential impact of these factors, but the research evidence is summarised in chapter 14 of the previously cited paper &quot;Gender and education: the evidence on pupils in England&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="d.232W.5/1">Schools do not have to apply to the Department for Children, School and Families to become a trust or foundation school. A change of school category to foundation and the acquisition of a trust are &quot;prescribed alterations&quot;. To make such a prescribed alteration the governing body must publish proposals in accordance with provisions in the Education and Inspections Act 2006, regulations made under that Act and having regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State under that Act. The proposals are then decided by the governing body (or the Schools Adjudicator where proposals to acquire a trust have been referred by the local authority). There is no role for Ministers in the decision-making process.</p>

It will be mandatory to hold the qualification (rather than be working towards it) from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2009</phrase>. The NPQH prepares candidates for the role of headship and is a benchmark qualification underpinned by the National Standards for Headteachers.</p>

	<p pid="d.254W.5/1">The importance of phonics in the teaching of reading has always played a key part in our guidance to primary schools. Following the publication of Sir Jim Rose's &quot;Independent review of the teaching of early reading&quot;, we accepted all of the review's recommendations, and we have paid particular attention to the recommendation that phonics should be taught as the prime approach to learning to read. We have renewed the Primary National Strategy's framework for teaching literacy to reflect this. The renewed framework now says that systematic phonics is the best route to teach children to read. With help from Jim Rose, we have developed a high quality systematic phonics teaching programme, Letters and Sounds, to support teachers in implementing these changes. To help schools that wish to choose a commercial scheme instead, we have published guidance on a set of criteria which define the key features of an effective phonics teaching programme and which build directly on the review's recommendations for high quality phonic work. Publishers of such schemes are able to provide a self-evaluation against these criteria on our phonics website.</p>
	<p pid="d.254W.5/2">We have taken steps to ensure that local authorities have the capacity and expertise to support schools in developing effective phonics teaching. The Primary National Strategy's Communication, Language and Literacy Development programme has provided training in early reading for every local authority and funded additional consultants to lead this work in 50 targeted local authorities. This programme will build greater quality and capacity in the teaching of early literacy through developing work on speaking and listening and strengthening leadership and management of early literacy in schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.254W.5/3">We are also working with local authorities and the Training and Development Agency to ensure that newly qualified practitioners are equipped with the necessary skills to implement the recommendations from Sir Jim Rose's review.</p>

They can do this by complying with their duty to participate; having a reasonable justification as to why they were not participating; or by showing that they are taking the right steps towards participation. In these cases the young person would not get a fixed penalty notice. If the young person does not pay the fixed penalty notice the local authority will have the power to prosecute them in the Youth court. If a fine is unpaid, it is enforceable using the Youth court's usual powers, such as taking the money from wages or imposing an unpaid work requirement.</p>

From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-30">30 November 2006</phrase> a further 221 schools were registered for an assessment and by the end of this period four schools had been assessed. From <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December 2007</phrase> a further 254 schools were registered for an assessment and a further 18 schools were assessed. This brings the total number of schools that have been registered to 601 and the number assessed to 22. The ratings achieved so far are broken down as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.257W.2/5"> <td><i> Type of school</i></td> <td><i> Number of pass ratings</i></td> <td><i> Number of good ratings</i></td> <td><i> Number of very good ratings</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.257W.2/6"> <td>Primary</td> <td>1</td> <td>6</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.257W.2/7"> <td>Secondary</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.257W.2/8"> <td>Academy</td> <td>1</td> <td>4</td> <td>2</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.257W.2/11">Some of the early schools may have been at an advanced stage of design when DCSF issued guidance in 2005 on the ratings expected and may also have suffered from a lack of experience of sustainable design. As designers get more experience of designing sustainable schools we expect to see a higher proportion of schools achieving the expected standard. There will always however be schools where site constraints mean that some of the BREEAM credits are unavailable making it very difficult and probably uneconomic to achieve a very high rating in these cases. It should be remembered that BREEAM credits are only given where designs exceed regulatory minimum standards as laid out in the building regulations and the like.</p>
	<p pid="d.257W.2/12">We will be monitoring the results as they come in for the 579 schools that have been registered for an assessment but for which the assessments have yet to be completed. We do not know the names or the construction costs of the schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.266W.2/1">Herefordshire local authority will receive a basic increase per pupil in their allocation of dedicated schools grant (DSG) of 3.1 per cent. for 2008-09, and 2.9 per cent. for 2009-10 and 2010-11, together with funding for the following ministerial priorities: personalised learning and SEN; and bringing the authority up to the level of the funding formula in 2005-06. This results in increases of 4.7 per cent. 3.9 per cent. and 4.5 per cent. per pupil, and an above average increase of 13.6 per cent. for the three year period as a whole. Further details of the calculation of Herefordshire's DSG allocations can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.266W.2/3">The starting point for the calculation of Herefordshire's 2008-09 DSG allocation is its DSG guaranteed unit of funding per pupil, which in turn depends on the amount the authority budgeted to spend in 2005-06. This was closely related to the schools formula spending share (FSS) calculation, which took account of the needs of rural authorities through an addition for pupils in primary schools: this recognised the additional costs faced by rural authorities in keeping open more small primary schools than other authorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.271W.5/2"><i> </i>Standards of teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools have risen substantially since 1997. This is as a result of a number of factors, including challenge and support through the Primary and Secondary National Strategies. They provide; continuing professional development to primary and secondary schools to support them in raising standards in teaching; support better use of pupil performance data and challenge schools and local authorities to set ambitious targets for their pupils. In 2007-08 funding of &pound;45 million was provided for the West Midlands in 2007-08 to support improvement programmes in teaching and learning with specific focus on core subjects through the National Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="d.274W.2/2">It is not possible to answer the question in precisely the way it has been asked. Total Government funding for higher education has risen from around &pound;500 million in 1979 to some &pound;10 billion today, but successive Governments have not allocated funding on the basis of particular areas or types of provision, but largely on the basis of supply and demand. We are keen to raise both the demand for and supply of sustainable higher education opportunities in Cornwall and will continue to work with a range of partners to try to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="d.275W.2/1">Under the policy to raise the participation age 16 and 17-year-olds will still be able to work, as long as they are in some form of education or training alongside this. There will be no effect on those currently in full-time employment, and there will never be a situation in which full time employees suddenly have to change to part time working&mdash;the first 16-year-olds to be affected are aged 10 now. Young people will know before entering employment at 16 that they have to be in learning part time. And they will not all necessarily work part time. Some will work full time and be provided will accredited training by their employer, and we will encourage employers to do this. Some may rearrange their working hours to attend part time training, rather than working fewer hours. The impact assessment for the Education and Bill was published alongside the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase> and copies have been placed in the Library of the House. The impact assessment sets out that the estimated foregone productivity cost to the economy of some young people being released for education or training for one day a week who might otherwise have worked full-time is estimated to be around &pound;4.3 million per cohort.</p>

	<p pid="d.276W.3/2">The UK compensation scheme is significantly more generous than the minimum requirements set in EU legislation. The Tripartite Authorities, following an exercise involving the then Economic Secretary, the Governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA in November 2006, came to a shared view that work should be undertaken on potential reforms to the FSCS, The Tripartite Authorities were regularly updated on the progress of this work throughout 2007, which culminated in the proposals contained in FSA document 'Financial Services Compensation Scheme&mdash;Funding Review (March 2007)' and the Tripartite discussion document 'Banking Reforms&mdash;Protecting Depositors: A discussion Paper (October 2007)'.</p>

	<p pid="d.281W.2/2">The revenue yield from taxing all capital gains at the income tax rates announced for 2008-09 with indexation allowance but without applying taper relief would be of the order of &pound;3 billion a year by comparison with the current (2007-08) regime. This is a broad estimate that assumes continuation of the tax-free annual exempt amount and takes into account the likely taxpayer response to the change.</p>

	<p pid="d.293W.9/1">The Department is not responsible for air ambulances, and does not routinely collect air ambulance data centrally. However, the Department has previously commissioned research into helicopter emergency ambulance services. The research undertaken estimated that there were 16 air ambulances operating across 14 organisations in England and Wales and that an the average annual operating costs of an individual air ambulance were around &pound;0.8 million a year (based on data from 11 of the 14 organisations, ranging from 2000 to 2001-02). In addition, representatives from ambulance trusts and air ambulance charities are currently working together to seek to improve joint working practices and procedures and undertook a survey of air ambulance charities in August/September 2007 to which 14 air ambulance organisations responded. Those responses indicated that there were 24 helicopters and that the average expenditure per helicopter per annum was &pound;0.8 million. Neither piece of work provided information on insurance costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.9/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, the Department has made clear that it would normally expect the national health service to meet the cost of clinical staff on air ambulances, but the levels of such funding are not collected centrally. It is for NHS ambulance trusts to decide whether they provide any additional funding to the air ambulance charities.</p>

	<p pid="d.296W.6/1">All care homes are subject to the Care Homes Regulations 2001, which include a requirement that the provider has an effective complaints procedure. All residents have access to this. Normally, the expectation is that in the first instance the complaint should be raised with the provider. In addition, people whose care needs have been assessed by local authorities, or whose care is commissioned or funded by local authorities, have access to the statutory local authority social services complaints procedure. If the local authority response does not satisfy the complainant, they are entitled to refer the matter to the local government ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="d.296W.6/2">People can also raise concerns with the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI). CSCI welcomes representations about the standard of care in care homes and reports of suspected abuse, and will respond to these as appropriate. CSCI's role in doing so is that of a regulator, where issues are raised that impact upon the safety of services and compliance by the provider with the regulations. However, CSCI does not have a role in resolving complaints for individuals.</p>
	<p pid="d.296W.6/3">In addition, anyone receiving national health service health care, irrespective of their circumstances, is able to make a complaint under the NHS complaints procedure, for example, care home residents registered with a general practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="d.296W.6/4">The procedures for complaints relating to care homes have not altered since the current regulatory regime for care homes was introduced in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="d.297W.2/1">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is responsible for all aspects of regulation and inspection of care homes in England, including those providing nursing care. CSCI employs inspectors with a range of professional skills for dealing with a mixed caseload, including approximately 300 inspectors who are registered nurses. Where possible, CSCI will assign inspectors with a nursing background to inspect nursing homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.2/2">CSCI expects non-nurse inspectors to discuss any clinical issues arising at inspection with nursing colleagues in their team. As part of this process, CSCI has good practice guidance, known as &quot;clinical triggers&quot;, for inspectors in respect of several areas such as nutrition, continence management and medication. These triggers alert inspectors as to when it would be appropriate to instruct the service provider to contact local health services to arrange specialist nursing assessment for a resident or, to seek advice from a clinical colleague within CSCI to ascertain whether enforcement action may be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.2/3">CSCI has a source of specialist nursing advice in its Head of Health Policy and Quality. CSCI also has a head pharmacist; where there are concerns around medication, a pharmacist inspector will inspect the service. All inspectors receive training in all methodologies and tools.</p>

	<p pid="d.297W.5/1">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is responsible, under the Care Standards Act 2000 and associated Regulations, for all aspects of regulation and inspection of care homes providing nursing care.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.5/2">Up until April 2005, all care and nursing homes were required to be inspected twice yearly. From April 2005, CSCI's inspectors started using new ways of inspecting social care providers, based on the aims set out in the consultation document, &quot;Inspecting for Better Lives&quot;. The new inspection methodology is designed to place the people who use social care services and their experiences at the heart of the way CSCI inspects and regulates care services.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.5/3">From April 2005, CSCI has carried out key inspections for care and nursing homes at a frequency determined by the quality of the service. A key inspection is a thorough, detailed inspection, under which CSCI will assess all of the key national minimum standards. For example, a &quot;poor&quot; quality service will receive a minimum of two key inspections a year, an &quot;adequate&quot; service will receive a minimum of one key inspection a year, a &quot;good&quot; service will receive a minimum of one key inspection every two years, and an &quot;excellent&quot; service will receive a key inspection a minimum of once every three years.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.5/4">CSCI also carries out &quot;random&quot; and &quot;thematic&quot; inspections, which are short, focused inspections on a specific theme or area.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.5/5">The Healthcare Commission is responsible for inspecting hospitals. The Healthcare Commission checks annually that core standards are in place across each national health service trust. If inspected, a trust is required to provide evidence that standards are in place in each part of the organisation. This includes wards for older patients. About 20 per cent. of trusts are selected for a core standards inspection each year.</p>
	<p pid="d.297W.5/6">In addition, in February 2007, the Healthcare Commission carried out a more in-depth review of dignity and care arrangements for older patients in hospital. Twenty-three hospitals were visited and a range of observations and interviews of ward staff were undertaken. The report of the findings can be found on the Healthcare Commission website at:</p>

The extension of priority treatment to all veterans will not affect serving military personnel, as their arrangements for accelerated access to the national health service are not changing. As with the current arrangements for priority treatment for war pensioners, decisions about priority treatment for all veterans will be made by the relevant clinicians, and will be subject to clinical need. There should be no significant additional cost: the policy is about prioritisation of future referrals.</p>

In relation to stoma and incontinence appliances, the Department proposed that products of less than 0.1 per cent. of market share should be excluded for benchmarking purposes.</p>

	<p pid="d.329W.2/1">Independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) have been able to provide additional surgical capacity in the south-west while offering patients a wider choice of hospitals for their treatment. The treatment centres have helped local national health service hospitals in achieving their own maximum waiting time targets. Prior to the opening of the treatment centres, the local NHS used private sector capacity in an unstructured way to manage demand from general practitioners, but the introduction of treatment centres has reduced the requirement for this.</p>
	<p pid="d.329W.2/2">We do not expect any hospital trust which is providing high quality, accessible services that meet patient needs to sustain a negative impact under Payment by Results, but ultimately it will be for patients to decide where they are treated under Choice.</p>

	<p pid="d.331W.9/2">As a result of granting ACRA an extension to its work programme, it was not possible to announce three-year allocations to PCTs in time to give them sufficient planning time. Therefore, it was decided to make a one-year allocation to PCTs for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.9/3">The operating framework, due to be published in December, will set out the national priorities for the year ahead in the context of the comprehensive spending review (CSR), which set out the high level priorities for the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Together with the high level growth figures announced in the CSR, this should allow each PCT to make reasonable assumptions for their longer term plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.9/4">Therefore, even though PCTs have received a one-year allocation only for 2008-09, they should still be able to plan financially and it should not prevent PCTs from entering into three-year agreements with local partners.</p>

	<p pid="d.333W.0/1">There are a number of factors that mean the national health service is well positioned to manage with a reduced rate of funding growth while continuing to deliver significant improvements to patient care.</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.0/2">In the years covered by the 2007 comprehensive spending review (2008-09 to 2010-11) the NHS will receive real terms growth of 4 per cent. per year. This is significantly higher than the long-term average of around 3 per cent., so we should not consider the next three years as a period of low growth. On top of the growth in funding, the NHS will deliver annual average value for money improvements of 3 per cent., and the cash released will be available to improve patient care. The Department will publish the value for money agreement in December, which will support local delivery of the savings. In addition, the NHS is now in a sound financial position and better able to cope with reduction in the growth in funding.</p>
