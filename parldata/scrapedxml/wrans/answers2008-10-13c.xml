	<p pid="c.836W.3/1">The &pound;9.325 billion funding package for the games announced in March 2007 included a provision for contingency of &pound;2.747 billion. As announced, &pound;500 million of this was transferred to the Olympic Delivery Authority's (ODA) baseline funding, and &pound;238 million was set aside as a contingency for wider policing and security. This left a balance of &pound;2,009 million: &pound;968 million of which is programme-wide contingency for ODA programme-wide risks, and &pound;1,041 million of which is Funders' Group contingency for risks beyond the project and programme level.</p>
	<p pid="c.836W.3/2">To date &pound;21.5 million of ODA programme-wide contingency has been allocated to cover the net contingency requirements of a number of programmes. In addition &pound;95 million of Funder's Group contingency has been allocated to the ODA as interim funding to enable work on the construction of the Olympic village to continue uninterrupted despite the current turmoil in the financial markets.</p>
	<p pid="c.836W.3/3">There is no direct spending from contingency, because once allocated it is incorporated into the ODA's programme expenditure. It is therefore only possible to provide information on the contingency allocated to the ODA and on ODA actual spend. Information on allocated contingency and actual spend are provided in the six- monthly progress updates. The next progress update will be published in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.839W.3/2">Encouraging business growth is a key aim of the Department, and &quot;Enterprise: Unlocking the UK's Talent&quot; (available at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file44992.pdf">http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file44992.pdf</a>), published in March 2008, announced a number of new measures designed to support business growth. For example the Government are:</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/3" class="indent">encouraging women's enterprise, an area where the UK is lagging behind major competitors, through initiatives such as women's business centre pilots;</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/4" class="indent">improving access to finance to support business growth such as extending eligibility to the Small Firms Loan Guarantee;</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/5" class="indent">encouraging innovation, a key driver of growth, through initiatives such as the launch of innovation vouchers.</p>

	<p pid="c.839W.3/7">Although the global outlook is uncertain, through maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, the Government have created an environment conducive to businesses growth, and contributed to a thriving business sector:</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/8" class="indent">The UK has a record number of businesses&mdash;4.7 million at the start of 2007&mdash;around 970,000 (26 per cent.) more than in 1997;</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/9" class="indent">Private sector employment has risen by 1.7 million (8 per cent.) since 1997;</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/10" class="indent">Business survival rates are higher than a decade ago&mdash;92 per cent. of VAT registered firms still registered after one year; 71 per cent. after three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/11">The UK is the only G7 economy to have avoided any quarters of contraction in output since 2001, in spite of slow growth in key export markets in the recent past; and over the past 10 years the UK has enjoyed more stability in terms of GDP growth and inflation than in any decade since the war.</p>

	<p pid="c.840W.9/1">Under the House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978, House staff are employed by the House of Commons Commission. The Act requires the Commission to keep staff conditions of service broadly in the line with those in the Home Civil Service. This requirement applies to redundancy arrangements. The Members Estimate Committee report, Review of Allowances (HC578), considered the central employment of Members' staff by the House but rejected this in favour of Members themselves remaining the employer.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.9/2">Members' staff are employed by Members, under standard contracts prepared by the Department of Resources. The contract requires the Member to review annually his or her employee's salary. Members can then decide whether an increase is appropriate, which could depend on factors such as staff performance and budget constraints. Automatic pay rises would restrict Members' ability to match the needs of their office to the resources available.</p>

	<p pid="c.846W.11/2">Funding for public libraries is allocated to local authorities by the Department for Communities and Local Government, as part of the local government settlement. Local authorities then distribute funding among local library authorities. In addition, funding for various libraries related programmes such as &quot;Boys into Books&quot; and &quot;Book Ahead&quot; are made available from other funding streams in Government to fulfil certain strategic aims.</p>
	<p pid="c.846W.11/3">We have defined the &quot;Newcastle upon Tyne area&quot; as the locality containing Newcastle upon Tyne city council, Gateshead metropolitan borough council and Sunderland city council.

	<p pid="c.846W.11/4">As funding arrangements relate to specific financial years it is not a simple matter to provide 12-month projected spend from a set starting point within year.</p>

	<p pid="c.851W.5/1">The provision of a cr&egrave;che on the estate has not been considered since July 2003. Following a feasibility study and a survey of Members, the Commission weighed the options carefully and considered that most parents prefer younger children to be cared for at or near their home. Child care vouchers continue to be available for staff of hon. Members and staff of the House. Following suggestions that the voucher scheme be extended to Members, the Commission recently asked the Administration Committee to look at child care again and assess the level of demand among Members for any change to the current arrangements.</p>

Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology uses alcohol attributable fractions (AAFs). These AAFs consider a much wider range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimate the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. This methodology is currently being finalised and figures will be made available in due course.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State recommends that all United Kingdom residents intending to travel either within or outside of Europe, take out private travel insurance before they go. Within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, the European Health Insurance Card does entitle British tourists to treatment that may become necessary during their trip including maternity care, renal dialysis and managing the symptoms of pre-existing or chronic conditions. The UK also has reciprocal agreements with a limited number of non-EEA countries which provide UK residents with emergency treatment at a reduced cost or sometimes for free. However, neither of those provisions cover UK residents for all potential healthcare costs for example, repatriation back to the UK or private sector treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.862W.6/1">The role and functions of the Central Authority are established through International law. The Central Authority has no power to transfer jurisdiction. Only a court seized of proceedings regarding a child may do so, and then only in accordance with international law.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.6/2">Where a child is subject to an interim or final care order, and the family removes the child from the UK against the wishes of the local authority with care of the child, the local authority is entitled to use the Hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction to obtain return of the child from the jurisdiction to which he or she has been taken. The Central Authority is legally obliged by that convention to transmit an application for return of the child to the jurisdiction to which the child has been taken. These matters are not susceptible to policy review because they arise as a result of the UK's international legal obligations.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.6/3">Upon return of the child under the convention, the courts here have jurisdiction to deal with all issues regarding the welfare of the child, and will take into account the importance of the child's family and sibling relationships. The mechanism in the convention providing for swift return of a child wrongfully removed is important in ensuring that children's cases are heard by the courts of the jurisdiction where they are habitually resident, which will be best placed to assess the child's welfare. Further, it ensures that people cannot seek to evade proceedings and orders by removing the child to another jurisdiction in the hope of escaping the attention of the authorities or getting a more favourable outcome from the court of another country which is less well-placed to assess the child's welfare than the courts of his or her habitual residence. This is essential for child protection.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.6/4">If a parent or parents of a child subject to a care order wish to emigrate they can apply to the court prior to the emigration for an order allowing the move. In determining that decision the court can hear from all appropriate parties. If such an order is made the family is free to move and the courts of the new jurisdiction would assume jurisdiction for the child once its habitual residence was established there.</p>

	<p pid="c.864W.5/3">To implement these provisions, underpinning rules and regulations will be required. A recently completed scoping exercise, which involved a series of meetings with relevant stakeholders, identified issues that require further public consultation. It is anticipated that the consultation will generate representations from a wide range of stakeholders, including the enforcement industry, local authorities, other Government Departments and lobby groups. Our proposed approach to progressing this and achieving implementation of the Act is being developed and we anticipate that this part of the work will be completed shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.864W.5/4">Although formal consultation on the regulations has yet to begin, correspondence is regularly received on the enforcement reforms contained within parts 3 and 4 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act. However, due to volume, it is considered time disproportionate to review all correspondence to identify representations specific to unpaid parking fines.</p>

	<p pid="c.870W.2/3">The armed forces are underpinned by a culture of discipline which is reinforced through codes of conduct. Military law supplements UK civilian law but does not replace it. The Ministry of Defence takes seriously all unlawful acts committed by service personnel, but recognises that unlawful behaviour can be indicative of wider social or mental health problems. A variety of measures are therefore in place to address such problems where they arise and to reduce the risk of former and serving personnel encountering such difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.870W.2/4">Welfare support is available for all personnel in service, for their families and for service leavers, and we have arrangements in place to identify and address mental health problems quickly where they arise. All personnel receive a mandatory briefing and a guidance pack to help their return to civilian life. Since 2006-07, those leaving service early are assessed for their vulnerability to social exclusion and offered specialist help. A pilot project is in progress to test whether mentoring would also reduce the risks that vulnerable leavers can face when leaving the armed forces. Veterans facing difficulties in their civilian lives also have access to the free Veterans helpline and the Veterans Welfare Service which can signpost to sources of advice and help.</p>
	<p pid="c.870W.2/5">Through the 'Prison In-Reach' initiative, which the Government put in place in partnership with the relevant Third Sector organisations, veterans who have offended (and their families) are made aware of the specialist support available to them, both before and after release. In addition to the improvements in mental health care during service, a new model of community-based mental health care is being piloted at six sites across the UK providing veterans with access to culturally sensitive expert care; if successful, it is intended to roll out the model more widely. In areas not covered by these pilots, veterans serving since 1982 have access to specialist mental health advice from the Medical Assessment Programme at St. Thomas' hospital in London; this service is available to those veterans in prison whose health professions would like an expert assessment. The Ministry of Defence and National Offender Management Service are working in partnership to put in place measures to assess the current veteran offender population; this work should inform what further measures might be appropriate to help those who have served in the armed forces and to reduce offending.</p>

	<p pid="c.871W.2/1">The steps taken to investigate the death of a prisoner by non-natural causes are essentially the same as for all deaths in prison custody. In every case the police are notified and will investigate. Once their investigation is concluded the prisons and probation ombudsman initiates a further independent investigation. The key elements of their investigation are:</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/2" class="indent">a named investigator will lead the investigation and a family liaison officer will liaise with the bereaved family.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/3" class="indent">the investigator examines all relevant documents and policies, and will interview relevant staff and prisoners as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/4" class="indent">the primary care trust will also carry out a clinical review of the health care provided to the person before their death.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/5">Other required actions following any death in prison custody are set out in Prison Service Order 2710: Follow up to Deaths In Custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/6">Investigations into non-natural cause deaths, particularly suspected homicides, can take much longer to complete than those into apparent natural causes because, investigations by the prisons and probation ombudsman are suspended until the police have completed their investigations.</p>
	<p pid="c.871W.2/7">The costs of death in custody investigations are borne centrally by the Ministry of Justice and can vary widely. The prisons and probation ombudsman estimates that the average costs of his office in 2007-08 in carrying out deaths in custody investigations, including those occurring in prisons, young offender institutions, and among the residents of approved premises, was just over &pound;16,000 per case. Separate figures for specific types of deaths such as non-natural are not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.872W.9/14">Assault data are complex and the numbers need to be interpreted with caution. The numbers supplied refer to the number of individual assault incidents; these may also include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact events and allegations. Information recorded as assault incidents may involve one or more victim.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.9/15">NOMS and the Prison Officers Association are jointly committed to 'zero tolerance' on assaults on staff. The Secretary of State for Justice has written to the Attorney-General and Home Secretary, both of whom are committed to pursing a robust and consistent approach to the involvement of the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in prosecuting such assaults. Along side working with the CPS and the police, enhanced guidance is also currently being developed by Police Advisers Section in NOMS headquarters on a much wider agenda of crime reporting in prisons. This guidance will address the subject of the reporting and investigation of allegations of assault on prison staff and aims to provide national consistency in classifying and responding to crime committed in prisons. The guidance will be an important step in making sure that the most serious incidents are referred to the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.9/16">Assault information is categorised and recorded at establishment level. The recorded incidents of assaults on prison officers are not completely exclusive to officers; establishment recording sometimes includes assaults on other prison staff in this category.</p>

	<p pid="c.881W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to reply to your questions on the processing of Maternity Allowance applications. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.2/4" class="indent">We started to centralise the administration of Maternity Allowance claims in December 2007 and migration completed in August 2008 into four central units throughout the country at Yeovil, Wrexham, Hanley and Bury St Edmunds Benefit Delivery Centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.2/5" class="indent">Clearance times for Maternity Allowance had increased slightly over the summer months resulting in a backlog of 7000 cases awaiting action. This is as a result of an increase in births leading to an increase in Maternity Allowance applications by a fifth. This increase coincided with centralisation into the four units and a temporary dip in productivity associated with retraining existing members of staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.2/6" class="indent">We are responding to these difficulties by increasing the staffing in the centralised sites by a fifth, so they can cope with the increase in new applications. The 7000 backlog cases are being dealt with separately by sharing the cases across our wider network of Benefit Delivery Centres. We are making progress now on clearing these cases. Over the last 5 weeks record numbers of claims were cleared, by over 1,000 more than the weekly intake. The backlog has now reduced to 2000 cases. We expect to have fully cleared the backlog within the next two weeks.</p>

	<p pid="c.883W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking for the details of the Labour Force Survey showing the number of economically inactive people who want to work and can work and who are not counted in the ILO definition of unemployment. (226198)</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/5" class="indent">Estimates of economic activity and inactivity derived from the Labour Force Survey (LPS) follow the international convention as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). This does not require the LFS to record specifically whether people can or cannot work and, consequently, estimates on this precise basis are not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/6" class="indent">According to the LFS, people who are economically inactive are neither in employment nor unemployed and can be further categorised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/7" class="indent">1. those who have been looking for work in the past four weeks but are unable to start work within the next two weeks;</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/8" class="indent">2. those who have not been looking for work in the past four weeks but would like to have a regular paid job; and</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/9" class="indent">3. those who have not been looking for work in the past four weeks and who would not like to have a regular paid job.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/10" class="indent">This applies to all people aged 16 to 69. Economically inactive people aged 70 and over who were not looking for work are not asked if they would like a regular paid job and are therefore included in the third category.</p>
	<p pid="c.883W.2/11" class="indent">Estimates for all three categories are provided in the attached table and are for the three month period April to June 2008, the latest available. As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="c.905W.0/25">It must be remembered that new CCF contingents are only one way to increase the numbers of cadet units in schools. As mentioned in the Service Personnel Command Paper, the MOD continues its work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families on increasing the number of cadet units in state schools and therefore no targets have been set for the number of CCF contingents to be created in the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.0/26">Currently, the only new CCF contingent is planned for Wellington Academy, Wiltshire. This CCF will start up in September 2011 and THE Capital works are being funded by the Department for Children Schools and Families in this instance.</p>

	<p pid="c.908W.5/1">The Veterans Strategy has three main pillars, delivered in close partnership with other parts of Government and the Third Sector: these are high quality preparation for service leavers returning to civilian life; advice and support for those ex-service personnel who need it and the promotion of understanding and recognition of the role veterans play in society. Support takes many forms including the provision of occupational pensions and no-fault compensation, resettlement training, help with employment and accommodation, as well as welfare support and tailored health care for those areas where veterans have special needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.908W.5/2">The needs of veterans and the provisions to meet these are kept under review in consultation across Government and with the charitable sector. Most recently, the Nation's Commitment outlined in the Service Personnel Command Paper of July 2008 reviewed areas of existing provision and set out the further enhancements that will be delivered in the support for service personnel, their families and veterans. These commitments will be assured by a reference group that will provide regular external and cross-Government audit, including an annual report to the Prime Minister and Defence Secretary.</p>

	<p pid="c.910W.8/1">MOD is committed to protecting the health, safety and well-being of its employees and has a number of procedures in place to reduce stress at work. A stress management framework, based on the Health and Safety Executive's management standards, is available to all employees and gives easy to use advice on the successful prevention, recognition and management of stress at work.</p>
	<p pid="c.910W.8/2">Our Intranet Web Portal complements this with a page dedicated to health promotion which carries specific advice to employees on how to reduce stress. Responsibility for identification of the factors leading to stress rests with business areas, and line managers within these areas are required to use risk assessment to adapt the culture of their business and reduce stress levels. We provide specific training on managing stress and recognising stress in others and have published a guide for line managers, which includes reference to work/life balance issues including long hours, taking work home and recognising and managing stress. The Guide includes Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development indicators for identifying stress. All of this promotes good management practices and actively encourages a positive approach to life at work and at home.</p>
	<p pid="c.910W.8/3">Confidential support for employees affected by stress caused by either work or external factors is also available through the MOD Occupational Welfare Service. This includes &quot;signposting&quot; to external agencies where appropriate. Special arrangements are in place to provide psychological support to any civilian employee affected by post-traumatic stress following deployment in support of operations with the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.910W.8/4">In cases of sickness absence for stress-related illnesses, MOD policy is to make an early referral to our occupational health providers. Outcomes include rehabilitation plans allowing a phased return to work so that employees can adjust gradually to their normal work pattern. We also actively encourage the use of return to work interviews and keeping in touch schemes for staff on long-term sickness absence.</p>

	<p pid="c.913W.5/2">The threshold for electricity consumption through half hourly meters was increased from 3,000 to 6,000 megawatt hours (MWh) per annum in order to help ensure that participants who are large energy consumers see net benefits from the scheme in reduced energy bills if they act to reduce their energy consumption.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.5/3">It is estimated that the 6,000 MWh threshold will include 95 per cent. of the emissions that would be covered by the 3,000 MWh threshold. It is difficult to assess accurately the number of organisations that this relates to because of the lack of accurate energy consumption data aggregated to organisation level (for example, organisations and their subsidiaries may have several electricity suppliers). The number of organisations at a 6,000 MWh threshold may not be substantially different from that at 3,000 MWh, and is thought to be at the high end of a wide range of 2,000-5,000. The analysis demonstrating the range of estimates made can be seen in the partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA), published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-06">6 July 2007</phrase>. This is available to view on DEFRA's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.5/4">All central Government Departments, irrespective of whether they meet the qualification threshold, will participate in the carbon reduction commitment (CRC).</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.5/5">In general, Government Departments and their statutory delivery bodies will participate in CRC as separate entities where they meet the qualifying threshold. However, those Government sponsored bodies that do not have separate legal status will participate under their parent Government Department&mdash;in practice this generally means executive agencies and possibly some smaller advisory/tribunal non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.5/6">We will not know exactly what proportion of executive agencies and NDPBs will be included in CRC until the formal registration process for the scheme is under way in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.914W.5/2">Bodies specified as subject to the Freedom of Information Act (in schedule 1 to the Act) are thereby also subject to the Environmental Information Regulations (EIRs). But, this apart, there is no definitive list of organisations covered by the EIRs. All bodies which carry out functions of public administration and bodies that are under the control of a public authority and have responsibilities, exercise functions or provide public services relating to the environment are covered by the EIRs organisations must therefore come to their own view as to whether they or some of the functions they exercise are covered, seeking individual advice from DEFRA as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.914W.5/3">The Carbon Trust is not included in schedule 1 of FOIA. Moreover the Carbon Trust and DEFRA's view is that the Carbon Trust is an independent private company limited by guarantee and not a public sector organisation. The Carbon Trust does not fall within the definition of a 'public authority' for the purposes of the Environmental Information Regulations. It is not a 'public authority' for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and it does not carry out statutory or administrative functions but uses its government funding in its own programmes to achieve its mission of accelerating the move to a low carbon economy; nor is it controlled by any body which is a public authority for the purpose of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.914W.5/4">However, the Carbon Trust has achieved ISO 14001 accreditation and publishes an annual environmental report on its own environmental impacts, together with information about its businesses and the impact of those businesses in terms of CO2 emission reductions, in its annual report and accounts. It has obtained independent assurance of the application of its impact assessment methodology. The Carbon Trust annual report and accounts for 2007-08 was published in September.</p>
	<p pid="c.914W.5/5">Any dispute about such coverage is subject to appeal under the enforcement provisions of the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="c.920W.0/2">The Environment Agency's Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) project is considering the creation of new inter-tidal habitat on West Canvey Marshes. This is in response to the need to replace the inter-tidal habitats (laid down in the EU habitats directive) that will be lost around Canvey Island as sea levels rise.</p>
	<p pid="c.920W.0/3">This habitat creation would involve a controlled breach of existing flood defences to create new inter-tidal areas. If consultation demonstrated support for such a scheme a new flood defence would need to be constructed to protect people and property. This defence would ensure flood risk is managed to keep pace with rising sea levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.920W.0/4">The TE2100 project is still in development and there will be opportunities for representations on the final recommendations when the draft plan goes to consultation in spring 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.920W.6/1">The 2008 harvest has been one of the wettest on record with rainfall around double normal levels. The main impact has been that the harvest has taken much longer than normal to complete, which is likely to have led to higher labour, fuel and machinery costs, particularly where grain has had to be dried. However, cereal yields are reported to be higher than normal. DEFRA will publish farm income figures by farm type at the end of January 2009 which will show the net impact of the weather and other factors on the incomes of cereal and other cropping farms.</p>

	<p pid="c.928W.6/1">There are a number of potential existing sources of financial support available to farmers which could help with implementation of the revised Action Programme for nitrate vulnerable zones. For example, the England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative is providing grants for farmers with land in a priority catchment for a range of capital items including roofs for slurry stores and improving yard drainage (clean and foul water separation). There have been two rounds of applications for these grants since April 2007. Subject to funding being available we expect there will be further rounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.6/2">Funding is also available for a range of activities under the Rural Development Programme for England 2007-13. The socio-economic elements of this programme are the responsibility of the regional development agencies (RDAs). Individual regional implementation plans set out objectives and priorities for these socio-economic elements and may include support to help farmers meet the requirements of the Nitrates Action Programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.6/3">As part of this funding we have also asked RDAs to use voluntary modulation receipts, amounting to &pound;98 million at current exchange rates over the lifetime of the programme, specifically to address priorities in the livestock industry including providing support for farmers in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of on-farm management of nutrients.</p>
	<p pid="c.928W.6/4">Furthermore, slurry storage facilities are eligible for plant and machinery allowances such as the new annual investment allowance, capped at &pound;50,000 per year, included in this year's Finance Bill. Slurry pits also qualify for allowances in their own right under the Capital Allowances Act 2001.</p>

	<p pid="c.931W.2/1">The Government's Waste Strategy Annual Progress Report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-10">10 July 2008</phrase>, presents an overview of progress made in the last year on the actions set out in the Waste Strategy for England 2007. The report shows how the Government are taking forward actions to reduce waste, including encouraging businesses to divert waste from landfill to recycling. Furthermore, since the Waste Strategy was published, we have been engaging with key waste stakeholders on priorities for commercial and industrial waste reduction. We aim to publish a further statement of our strategic aims in this area in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="c.931W.2/2">The Waste Strategy announced an increase in the landfill tax escalator to provide greater incentives to business to reduce, re-use and recycle waste. The scheduled &pound;8 per tonne landfill tax escalator came into effect from April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.931W.2/3">In order to help businesses reduce waste and disposal and other costs, the Government are funding a range of business support. The aim is to change behaviours amongst businesses by raising awareness and understanding of the value and importance of recycling and waste prevention, and to develop solutions. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP) and other delivery bodies aim to achieve significant amounts of business waste recycling and reduction. For example in 2008-09, NISP is looking to help divert 750 kilotons of waste from landfill, in addition to a number of other important environmental and business benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.931W.2/4">The Government are simplifying the regulatory system through waste protocols to clarify when waste ceases to be waste, and so is no longer subject to regulation. As a result, businesses are increasingly able to recycle materials that would previously have been sent to landfill. Early indications suggest that over the next 10 years, Waste Protocols could encourage the recovery and reuse of 17 million tonnes of materials, potentially adding close to &pound;700 million to the economy and reducing CO2 emissions by 1.5 million tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="c.931W.2/5">Additionally, the London Waste and Recycling Board is a new statutory Board which has been set up to bring together the Mayor, the boroughs and others involved in managing the capital's waste, with the key aims of boosting London's recycling rates and reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfill. The board is funded by &pound;60 million from DEFRA (for three years) and &pound;24 million from the LDA (for four years). The board is chaired by Boris Johnson and he has reiterated how he wants London's recycling rates, both in the business and domestic sector, to increase dramatically.</p>
	<p pid="c.931W.2/6">Finally, the Waste Strategy set out the vital role of local government and regional bodies in providing advice and services to businesses and developing partnership working. The Government are supporting the development of this wider role by funding pilot initiatives by local authorities and supporting the provision and dissemination of guidance and best practice. Furthermore, the Government are encouraging local authorities to consider non-municipal waste when planning facilities for municipal waste.</p>

	<p pid="c.932W.2/1">The Marine and Fisheries Agency is responsible for determining the application for shore works on the Lymington river under the Food and Environment Protection Act. However, its focus is the deposition of materials in the sea. The delays in determining the decision are as a result of ongoing discussions over the environmental impacts of the ferry operations. There are many regulators involved in this wider project, including Lymington Harbour Commissioners, New Forest district council, Natural England and the Environment Agency. DEFRA is one of the parties involved in the process of establishing who is responsible for regulating the ferry operations in this area, and is aware that a number of related environmental issues need to be considered, potentially with an environmental impact assessment. The Government office south-east will also be expected to play an independent role in resolving the situation.</p>

	<p pid="c.933W.15/2">Warm Front has an established history of working with energy suppliers who are looking to achieve their targets under the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and its predecessor, the energy efficiency commitment. Through these relationships the vast majority of households receiving first time loft or cavity wall insulations through Warm Front have their measures funded through CERT. This provides benefits to the householder by freeing up more of their Warm Front grant allowance for other measures and provides a more joined-up form of delivery.</p>

	<p pid="c.959W.3/1">In accordance with article 76 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-09">9 May 2008</phrase>, the UK submitted to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the coastline of Ascension Island.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/2">Under the Rules of Procedure of the Commission, the executive summary of the submission was made public and circulated to all UN member states (a copy can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_gbr.htm">http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_gbr.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/4">A period of at least three months then had to follow before the submission could be formally heard by the Commission, during which time any and all member states of the United Nations had the right to transmit Notes Verbale making observations on, or objecting to, the submission.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/5">No such observations or objections having been made, the UK formally presented its submission to the Commission in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-27">27 August 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/6">We expect that the Commission will now proceed to establish a sub-commission of seven members to examine the UK submission. The time scale for this will depend on the overall work load of the Commission. There is no deadline for a decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/7">Once satisfied, the Commission will make its recommendations to the UK regarding the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf around Ascension Island. In line with the provisions of the convention, the limits subsequently established shall be final and binding in international law.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/8">In 2006, the UK made another submission to the Commission&mdash;jointly with France, Ireland and Spain&mdash;in respect of the sea bed in the bay of Biscay. We await the Commission's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/9">UK officials and scientists are also in the process of examining two further areas of continental shelf where the geological conditions may exist to justify further submissions&mdash;in the 'Hatton Rockall Area' of the North East Atlantic, and around the Falkland Island islands and South Georgia. In both instances, the UK will take appropriate action before May 2009, as required by the convention.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/10">The UK has confirmed to the Commission that it is not submitting data for the continental shelf around the British Antarctic Territory, but that it reserves the right to do so in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.959W.3/11">The UK&mdash;and many other countries&mdash;is taking these actions in order to safeguard for the future its sovereign rights over its continental shelf, where the conditions laid down by the convention allow. It is an orderly process, entirely in line with international law, and recognised by the UN General Assembly.</p>

	<p pid="c.970W.5/30">The two sets of figures above will overlap because some homeless acceptances who are ex-service personnel will fall within both (that is, in priority need because they were vulnerable as a result of having served in HM Forces, and the reason for loss of their last settled home is due to leaving Forces accommodation).</p>
	<p pid="c.970W.5/31">It is also likely that some ex-service personnel will be hidden within other priority need categories (for example the presence of dependent children) or other reasons for loss of last settled home (for example, having to leave the family home), and so will not be identifiable in the above figures. It is therefore not possible to identify what proportion of all homeless acceptances are ex-service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="c.970W.5/32">Local authorities who conduct rough sleeper counts collect information on any individuals sleeping rough, and these are published annually on our website. Figures include those rough sleepers who have previously served in HM Forces, but these are not shown separately.</p>
	<p pid="c.970W.5/33">Rough sleeping among ex-armed forces personnel has dropped. There are no specific data for 1997 but studies at the time suggested between a quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the armed forces at some stage. There is specific information for London provided under the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN) recording system. In 2006-07, for those rough sleepers in London contacted by services, 5 per cent. had spent some time in the armed forces in the past. This has remained consistent over the last four years.</p>

Unlike submissions received relating to microgeneration on existing buildings, these representations have not focused on changes to planning legislation. Nor have they concentrated on particular renewable technologies, such as solar energy. Instead, their emphasis has been on ensuring a positive response from local authorities to proposals for low or zero carbon new buildings. In the light of these representations, our new planning policy on climate change underlines that developers with proposals which would secure high levels of resource and energy efficiency and reductions in emissions should expect their planning application to be handled expeditiously and sympathetically.</p>

	<p pid="c.979W.0/1">The NFI is a data matching exercise carried out by the Audit Commission to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud. Data matching involves comparing sets of data, such as the payroll or benefits records of a body, against other records held by the same or another body to see how far they match. A number of different data set types are collected for the NFI, including payroll data. The limited type of payroll data collected includes the bank account number and sort code details of the employee. Transactions relating to the bank account cannot be accessed or disclosed within NFI. NFI data matching is based on a combination of the data subject's surname, forename, date of birth, national insurance number or address depending on the data available for the match and/or the desired outcome from the data match. NFI does not collect the name in which the bank account is held, so has no way of linking the employee details back to a partner/spouse.</p>
	<p pid="c.979W.0/2">The intelligence that bank account details provides ensures that investigators prioritise their resources on cases where employment income has potentially been withheld (e.g. in an undeclared bank account) when benefits are claimed. For example, matches between payroll and housing benefit claimants can reveal whether the bank accounts declared to the employer or the housing benefit paying body are the same or different.</p>
	<p pid="c.979W.0/3">The effectiveness of such matches in identifying potential fraud would be reduced if joint accounts were excluded from the exercise as employees could use a joint account to escape detection.</p>

	<p pid="c.984W.5/2">The Government reformed the planning system in 2005 with the publication of a new planning policy statement 10. It is too early for the benefits of this reform to have been fully felt, but actions to support local authorities remain a high priority for DEFRA and CLG. For example, in August 2007, DEFRA's Waste Infrastructure Delivery Programme published guidance on improving the interaction of local authorities with waste planning. It underlines that the approach to community engagement, taken by those seeking to secure permissions for waste infrastructure projects, is critical to all stages of both the planning process and preparation of the municipal waste management strategies by local authorities. Furthermore, DEFRA requires local authorities, as part of the application process for PFI credits for residual waste treatment facilities, to set out their strategy relating to community engagement.</p>

This money has been used to provide assistance in a range of sectors and development projects across Iraq. In the education sector, the UN has now allocated from IRFFI $190 million and the World Bank $106 million on 29 projects which include the rehabilitation of schools, the provision of essential text books, and the training of Iraqi teachers.</p>

	<p pid="c.986W.6/1">We believe that the best way to develop employment opportunities in Iraq is to support the Iraqis to stimulate economic growth through the private sector. To achieve this, the UK is supporting two institutions&mdash;the Basra Development Commission (BDC) and Basra Investment Commission (BIC). The Department for International Development (DFID) is also looking at ways to improve the availability of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.6/2">Co-chaired by Michael Wareing, the CEO of KPMG International, the BDC is bringing international and regional private sector expertise to Southern Iraq, and working on a range of economic projects. Most recently, the BDC launched a youth employment scheme (YES) which aims to provide an initial 500 vocational training placements for unemployed youths to work with local businesses, after which the businesses will offer them permanent employment. This scheme is modelled on best practice adopted by Business in the Community in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.6/3">The BDC is also working with the Iraqi National Investment Commission (NIC) to facilitate visits to Iraq for the investors interested in commercial opportunities&mdash;11 such visits have now taken place. These investors are looking at taking forward projects with a potential value in excess of $4 billion and employing 1,200 to 1,500 people in the first year alone.</p>

The Foundation for the Future of Latin America (Fundacion Futuro Lationoamerica - FFLA) carried out the Latin America work. Both organisations were contracted by IDRC. We are currently considering the results of these studies.</p>

	<p pid="c.989W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) provides funding in South Asia to the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh to strengthen health services. This includes initiatives to increase the provision of skilled attendants at birth, and to reduce infant and child mortality. For details of DFID funded programmes you may refer to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June 2008</phrase> <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-18.1042"><i> Official Report, </i>column 1042W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.989W.5/2">Currently close to half of women in India and a third of women in Pakistan are being assisted by a skilled birth attendant at delivery. There has been substantial progress since the early 1990s, when only one third of women in India and one fifth of women in Pakistan were assisted by a skilled birth attendant. Bangladesh and Nepal have also recorded improvements in skilled birth attendance rates over the past five years. In 2006 one fifth of women in these countries was delivered by a skilled birth attendant.</p>
	<p pid="c.989W.5/3">DFID has been assessing progress in skilled birth attendants and reductions in infant and child mortality in partnership with country Governments, UN and other development organizations. DFID support for assessment includes the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and district health and facility surveys in India; in Pakistan, the Federal Bureau of Statistics, and in Bangladesh, the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR.B); in Nepal, maternal mortality and morbidity studies and vital registration systems. Progress on skilled birth attendance and child mortality rates for South Asia countries are set out in the following table.</p>
