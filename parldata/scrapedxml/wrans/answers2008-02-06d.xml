	<p pid="d.1137W.3/1">The Commission decided in June 2006 that the House should make payments to offset carbon emissions from air travel paid by the House or from Members' parliamentary allowances and booked using the parliamentary Travel Office. The House of Lords House Committee did likewise in July 2006. The House made its first carbon offset payment for 2006-07 in May 2007. The payment for 2006-07 was &pound;26,025.50 and resulted from the emission of an estimated 2,626 tonnes of carbon from parliamentary air travel during the year. The offset payment has been made to the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, which is overseen by DEFRA.</p>

	<p pid="d.1138W.0/2">The information requested about the number of allegations reported by maintained and independent schools to the police and social services is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.0/3">The Government issued comprehensive guidance for schools and other education institutions, &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot;, in November 2006 and this came into force in January 2007. This sets out the process for dealing with allegations that might indicate that someone is unsuitable to continue to work with children, because it is alleged that they have behaved in a way that has harmed a child, or may have harmed a child; possibly committed a criminal offence against or related to a child; or behaved towards a child or children in a way that indicates s/he is unsuitable to work with children. The guidance is clear that any allegations that fall within this definition must be taken seriously and should be examined objectively by someone independent of the school concerned: in the first instance this is typically the local authority designated officer who leads on dealing with allegations in that area. The guidance explains that the police must be consulted about any case in which a criminal offence may have been committed, and that a strategy discussion (which will involve children's social care) should take place when there is cause to suspect a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm. Sometimes allegations will be so serious as to require immediate intervention by children's social care or the police, prior to notifying the local authority designated officer.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.0/4">This guidance is directed at both maintained and independent schools. For maintained schools it is underpinned by the duty on governing bodies in section 175 of the Education Act 2002. For independent schools the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of pupils is underpinned by requirements in regulations made under section 157 of the Education Act 2002. The relevant regulations are the Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2003, as amended.</p>

	<p pid="d.1138W.3/2">This Government recognise that child care costs are a serious matter for some families, which is why we are doing more than ever before to make good quality child care and early education accessible and affordable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.3/3">We are investing &pound;3 billion per year to support free early education, so all three and four-year-olds, irrespective of the employment status of their parents, can benefit from 12.5 hours of free early years provision for 38 weeks per year. This increases to 15 hours by 2010 and will be delivered more flexibly to meet families' needs. In addition, we announced in the Children's Plan an additional &pound;100 million to pilot a free entitlement for 20,000 of our most disadvantaged two-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.3/4">We provide substantial help (totalling over &pound;3 million a day) through the tax credit system, in providing up to 80 per cent. of child care costs&mdash;helping nearly 430,000 families.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.3/5">We have enabled employers to support working parents with their child care costs by offering tax and national insurance exemptions through salary sacrifice and child care vouchers for good quality formal child care. In addition, beginning in September 2008, &pound;75 million has been made available over three years, so that 50,000 workless families can benefit from free child care, allowing parents to access training and move into work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.3/6">In London, additional support for child care is available to lower income parents, through the &pound;33 million London Childcare Affordability Programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138W.3/7">The recent DCSF &quot;affordable child care&quot; campaign aims to make parents much more aware of the range of provision in their areas and the support available to make child care more affordable.</p>

	<p pid="d.1142W.5/3" class="indent">Aiming High for Disabled Children will provide a total of &pound;430 million to local authorities in new investment in disabled children's services during 2008-11 and additional funds to PCTs, to underpin delivery of a radical reform in services for disabled children and families.

We plan to add further guidance, in the spring, on how to tackle the bullying of disabled children. We have asked the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to work with local authorities and schools to ensure the guidance is effectively influencing practice in schools. In the current year, we are spending &pound;1.7 million on a range of anti-bullying initiatives and all of our programmes specifically look at how schools can prevent and tackle all forms of prejudice-driven bullying;</p>
	<p pid="d.1142W.5/5" class="indent">We are fully committed to narrowing and ultimately closing the gap in progress and attainment between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers. We have introduced targeted initiatives aimed at addressing specific areas of minority ethnic underachievement and to enhance mainstream and specialist provision in schools. We are confident that the targeted programmes for specific groups which are already under way, together with the mainstream programme of personalised learning, will enable us to make substantial further progress to address underachievement. Raising the academic achievement of minority ethnic background pupils is a key priority for the Department;</p>
	<p pid="d.1142W.5/6" class="indent">We have provided &pound;2 million to help fund a Schools Linking Network. This enables schools in different contexts and locations work together to share practice on inclusive teaching and develop opportunities to promote understanding of the issues experienced by children in different parts of the country&mdash;urban, suburban and rural&mdash;so promoting social inclusion. This network has been developed in response to the findings of Sir Keith Ajegbo's review of Diversity and Citizenship in the Curriculum and the report from the Commission on Integration and Cohesion, chaired by Darra Singh; and</p>

Supported by an investment of &pound;679 million over the 2008-11 period, Aiming High focuses on helping all young people, but with extra support for those who need it most.</p>

The contribution of UK scientists, especially those at the British Antarctic Survey, a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council, not only helps increase our understanding of the complex natural systems that are vital to the health of the planet, but also underpins the UK's high profile within the Antarctic Treaty System. UK scientists are also playing a full and active role in the International Polar Year 2007-09. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, based at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, is responsible for coordinating international research programmes in Antarctica. Details of other states' research activities are communicated using a combination of reports from national Antarctic research programmes, science conferences and published scientific journals and publications.</p>

	<p pid="d.1160W.5/1">The Aral sea has been recognised as the world's worst artificial ecological and environmental disaster. From 1960 to 2000, it lost 75 per cent. of its volume and 50 per cent. of its surface area. Its degradation has been ruinous to the people, plant and animal life in the region, including Karakalpakstan. The degradation has been caused primarily by excessive use, dating back to Soviet times, of the waters of the two main rivers flowing into it, the Syr-Daria and Amu-Daria, to irrigate the cotton fields in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. None of the 20 species of fish once found in the Aral survived. However, a dam has now been built between the northern and southern part of the Aral sea with international assistance from the World Bank. Since completion in 2005, the World Bank reports that the water level in the northern part of the sea has gradually risen and, between 2003 and 2006, increased by 13 per cent. in surface area (from 2,850 km square to 3,250 km square).</p>
	<p pid="d.1160W.5/2">A spillway passing excess water from the northern to the southern part of the Aral sea has been operational since February 2006 and the water level in the southern part is also now likely to increase in the future, though probably only marginally. Salinity levels of both parts of the sea have been reduced over the last two years and several freshwater fish have been returned to the sea. As a result, fish harvests have considerably increased during the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1160W.5/3">According to the World Bank, the next step is to improve the irrigation efficiency of the land in the Kazakh part of the Aral sea basin. Additional waterworks are also planned to restore wetlands and fishing lakes in the delta region. A World Bank project to this end began in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.1160W.5/4">Details of the World Bank project can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1160W.5/6">The Aral sea is an international problem which will require an international solution. In its &quot;Strategy for Central Asia&quot;, which will be adopted at the European Council on 21-<phrase class="date" code="">22 June</phrase>, the EU commits itself, inter alia, to support the implementation of the EU Water Initiative for safe water supply and integrated water resources management; promotion of transboundary river basin management and regional co-operation and support the integrated management of surface and underground transboundary water resources, including the introduction of techniques for more efficient water use particularly in irrigation.</p>

Squid stocks are less stable due to their short life cycle (one-year) and dependence on favourable environmental conditions. After a period of decline, stocks of the main squid species now appear to have returned to normal levels. Apart from the noted volatility of squid stocks, we expect conservation action to generally maintain stock levels and catches at current levels.</p>

	<p pid="d.1163W.2/1">The Falkland Islands Government licenses commercial fishing in Falkland Islands waters in line with their legislation on conservation and management of fish stocks. The legal and regulatory framework in which the Falkland Islands' fishery operates has been modernised and re-stated recently with the enactment of the Fisheries (Conservation and Management) Ordinance 2005. These regulations are similar to those used in other fisheries around the world where international best practice is adhered to.</p>

	<p pid="d.1170W.0/2">Following the publication of the DCMS-led Tourism Strategy for 2012 last September, VisitBritain is currently leading a Strategic Review of the &pound;350 million spent by public bodies to support tourism.</p>
	<p pid="d.1170W.0/3">The Review will consider among other things the best mechanisms for promoting the UK between now and the 2012 Games. The Review includes full consultation with devolved, regional, and local governments and the tourism industry, and is designed to maximise the impact of public funding for 2012-related tourism work. It is also considering the role of the industry itself in funding the tourism promotion of the Games.</p>

	<p pid="d.1171W.2/4">Regarding children's play facilities specifically, the Children's Play Information Service produces a fact sheet on potential sources of funding, 'How to raise funds for children's play'. It is available through the National Children's Bureau website.</p>
	<p pid="d.1171W.2/5">There are many projects and organisations across the Cultural sectors which deserve support. As outlined, the Trust does in fact receive support from my Department and its partners through existing programmes. If the Trust were to write to me with an invitation, I would be happy to consider visiting Wicksteed Park should other commitments permit it.</p>

There has been some improvement in parts of India, China, Nepal and Bangladesh, but maternal death rates are increasing in some sub-Saharan African countries because of HIV infection, conflict and weak health systems.

During the conference, the UK Government announced that a further &pound;100 million over five years will be provided through the united nations population fund to improve access to family planning commodities and equipment.</p>

	<p pid="d.1175W.11/1">DFID has maintained a large development programme in India since 1997 (currently DFID's largest country programme). Over that period DFID has worked in close partnership with the Indian Government (and also with multilateral and civil society) to help improve India's progress against the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="d.1175W.11/2">In 1997, the programme was geographically dispersed and covered a wide range of sectors. Over the next decade, the programme budget rose steadily but the portfolio was honed so that DFID India was managing fewer, larger projects in those sectors where we knew we were having the most impact; particularly health, education, rural livelihoods and urban development. DFID now only works at the state level in the five states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal, as well as with central Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1175W.11/3">DFID India is soon to launch its new country plan for India, setting out its strategy to 2015. As well as continuing to work in those sectors where significant impact has been made, there will be an enhanced focus on the poorest sections of Indian society. There will also be a new element in which DFID collaborates with the Indian Government on poverty issues that affect the poor worldwide and not just in India, such as climate change.</p>

	<p pid="d.1177W.9/1">The Department places guidance about the operation of the scheme and the likely eligibility of costs on its website at the start of each year, so that authorities have a good understanding in advance about how the scheme works.</p>
	<p pid="d.1177W.9/2">In the aftermath of the floods in summer 2007, the Department contacted affected authorities to ensure that they were aware of the Bellwin scheme and the need to register an intention to claim within a month of the flooding. Officials held seminars in Leeds and London to provide specific information and advice, and to allow authorities to ask specific questions. This was accompanied by letters to authorities, describing the terms of the scheme (including the special terms for this scheme). Government offices reinforced the key messages in regular communications with authorities, including the availability of the Bellwin team within my Department to provide advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1177W.9/3">Since then, the Bellwin team has provided tailored advice to individual authorities, through meetings, e-mail correspondence, phone contact and, where appropriate, site visits.</p>
	<p pid="d.1177W.9/4">The Department has now paid &pound;8.8 million under the Bellwin scheme in respect of the 2007 floods; and expects to make further payments shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.1178W.5/1">Thanet and Dover districts have received a wide variety of funding for regeneration initiatives since the late 1990s. Some of this is specific to the Communities and Local Government Department, but with the growth of single 'pots' there has also been a merger of different funding streams from different Government Departments. While it is possible to state that Thanet received &pound;2,681,792.00 in neighbourhood element and cleaner, safer, greener funding for regeneration activities in the last two years, other funding streams&mdash;such as the European Objective 2 programme, the Coalfield Regeneration Trust, and Single Regeneration Budget&mdash;are divided across districts and wider areas. Thanet is also eligible for around &pound;4 million from the new working neighbourhoods fund, over the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1181W.5/1">The Housing Green Paper published in July 2007 detailed our proposals to tackle housing affordability and set a target to increase housing supply to 240,000 additional homes a year by 2016, delivering approximately 2 million new homes by 2016 and 3 million new homes by 2020. The detail of where additional housing will be located is a matter for regional and local planning processes and functions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1181W.5/2">We also announced an increase of new affordable housing to at least 70,000 per annum by 2010-11. Of these 45,000 homes will be for social rent, with a goal to go further to 50,000 new homes for social rent in the next spending review period. We will also be providing 25,000 homes for low cost home ownership each year. The majority of these new homes will be provided with funding from the Housing Corporation and the Homes and Communities Agency once it is established. We are considering their draft programme for 2008-11 and allocations will be announced shortly. The number of new affordable homes to be provided from 2011-12 will be the subject of further spending reviews.</p>

Most of these were prisoners released on licence at the end of their sentence who were deemed at high risk of re-offending or high risk of harm, including sex and violent offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.1192W.6/2">Tracking was based on global positioning system (GPS) technology, and subjects were required to wear a tracking unit, normally worn around the waist, and a radio frequency electronic ankle tag. The pilots were subject to an independent evaluation and the final report was published online on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-02">2 August 2007</phrase>. A copy was placed in the House of Commons Library. It is not proposed to undertake any further work on satellite tracking in the short to medium term.</p>

	<p pid="d.1193W.2/3">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively, approximately 2,500, 1,600 and 3,900 additional places are planned to be delivered.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193W.2/4">We have tabled amendments to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill to give effect to measures recommended by Lord Carter to reduce the demand for custody. These measures should start to have an impact in the second half of this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193W.2/5">The measures we are taking will ease the pressure on the prison estate. No prison is expected to operate at a level of crowding beyond that which the Prison Service area manager (or Regional Offender Manager in the case of a contracted prison) considers safe.</p>

	<p pid="d.1194W.2/18">The number of prisoner recalled to custody has increased over recent years. There are several reasons for this increase: nearly all prisoners on licence can now be recalled to prison executively by the Secretary of State. Prior to 1998, prisoners serving less than four years could be recalled only by the courts, a slow and bureaucratic process that was rarely used. The Probation Service has become far more effective in enforcing licence conditions. In 1997 appropriate enforcement action was taken in only a third of cases where the offender breached a sentence being served in the community. This figure was over 90 per cent. in 2007; and there is more robust supervision of high risk licensees and better information sharing between police and probation, through multi agency public protection arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="d.1195W.8/29">Criminal damage as legally defined can be the result of many things, including acts of violence and self-harm. The Prison Service has a number of strategies to reduce such incidences. The Violence Reduction Strategy is one such policy and is aimed at addressing all types of violent and disruptive behaviour. For those young offender institutions within the under-18 estate, the Prison Service is working with the Youth Justice Board on a behaviour management programme to support staff in developing a more effective approach to tackling all forms of challenging behaviour, not least violence to other people and damage to property.</p>

	<p pid="d.1207W.2/2">Planning obligations (under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) can be entered into by local planning authorities (LPAs) and those with an interest in the land ('developers'). Regional planning bodies do not currently have any powers to secure planning obligations and we are not proposing to give such powers to regional development agencies (RDAs).</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.2/3">Developer contributions raised through planning obligations are often passed by LPAs to infrastructure providers. RDAs can also fund infrastructure in certain circumstances, and could do so using monies raised through planning obligations where an LPA had passed the money on to them for that purpose.</p>

	<p pid="d.1207W.8/2">There are various tidal power technologies which divide into two main types: tidal stream and tidal range (barrages and lagoons). The Sustainable Development Commission's report &quot;Tidal Power in the UK&quot; of October 2007, estimated that tidal power resource has the potential to provide 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity resource.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.8/3">According to the SDC report, the top 10 tidal stream sites in the UK have a potential practical resource of 17.5 TWh/year. However, tidal stream technologies are at a very early stage of development and only a few commercial prototypes are in existence. Ernst and Young, in their study for the Renewables Obligation Consultation, <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39038.pdf">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file39038.pdf</a> suggested the maximum likely potential as 0.5 TWh in 2015 and 1.4 TWh in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.8/4">For tidal range, the SDC's report estimates the total practical resource as around 18.8 TWh/year, of which the Severn estuary accounts for 17 TWh/year and the Mersey 1.4 TWh/year, though estimates of total theoretical resource vary from 50-94 TWh/year. There are currently no tidal range technologies deployed in the UK, even for testing, though there are a few tidal barrages operating around the world (e.g. La Rance in Northern France) and similar technology has been used for hydroelectric dams.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.8/5">More detail on the variation throughout the UK of tidal range and tidal flow can be found in the Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources which can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1207W.8/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-22">22 January</phrase>, the Government launched a two-year Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study to assess the options for tidal power in the estuary. For more details see:</p>

	<p pid="d.1216W.0/2">No government has ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately and that remains the case. Information on the number of people who overstayed their visa and were subsequently removed could be obtained by the detailed examination of individual case records only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.1216W.0/3">Exit controls were phased out from 1994. As part of the Government's 10-point plan for delivery, by Christmas 2008 the majority of foreign nationals will be counted in and out of the country. This will build on the successes of our early testing of the e-Borders programme (Project Semaphore) which already covers over 30 million passenger movements and has led to 18,000 alerts and more than 1,500 arrests.</p>
	<p pid="d.1216W.0/4">This is part of a sweeping programme of border protection which also includes the global roll-out of fingerprint visas, compulsory watch-list checks for all travellers from high-risk countries before they land in Britain and ID cards for foreign nationals.</p>

	<p pid="d.1221W.8/1">The Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) produces an annual assessment of the threat posed to the UK by organised crime, including immigration crime. Co-operation between all UK law enforcement agencies has led to 836 UK prosecutions for facilitation offences between 2003 and 2006 and 735 guilty verdicts. Close co-operational with the national law enforcement agencies of other countries, such as Police aux Frontieres in France, has also led to numerous convictions abroad.</p>
	<p pid="d.1221W.8/2">The Government are introducing a tough new sanction of knowingly employing an illegal immigrant, punishable by up to two years in prison. In tackling the employment of illegal migrants, the Government also concluded that the introduction of civil penalties, of up to 10,000 per worker, was likely to provide a more effective alternative to the criminal justice system for dealing with the generality of employers who fail in their legal obligation to avoid illegal sources of labour. Prosecution is then reserved for those cases involving the deliberate or conscious use of illegal workers. This approach is in line with the recommendations of the Hampton and Macrory reports on better regulation Tough new measures to prevent illegal migrant working, provided by the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-29">29 February 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.1223W.3/1">For 2007-08 the Home Office will make funding available to Kent county council, Thanet district council and Dover district council from the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund (SSCF), the Young People Substance Misuse Partnership Grant (YPSMPG), the Drug Intervention programme (DIP) main grant, and the Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children Grant (UASC).</p>
	<p pid="d.1223W.3/2">The SSCF is a joint Communities and Local Government (CLG) and Home Office fund aimed at tackling crime, drugs, antisocial behaviour, empowering communities, improving the condition of streets and public spaces, prioritising the most deprived neighbourhoods. The Home Office contribution to the SSCF is paid to CLG who in turn make the payments to top tier local authorities. It is for these local authorities in two-tier areas (in this case Kent county council), to decide on subsequent allocations within the county to local partners and partnerships as set out in local area agreements. In 2007-08 the Home Office contribution to the SSCF in Kent is &pound;1,384,873 resource and &pound;439,002 capital.</p>
	<p pid="d.1223W.3/3">The YPSMPG is a pooled cross-departmental grant, managed by the Home Office. It facilitates better joined-up local planning and commissioning of young people's substance misuse services, in line with the principles in Every Child Matters and enables the delivery of services to be more responsive to local need, by giving greater flexibility in local commissioning decisions. The YPSMPG is paid to Kent county council as the top tier authority and then distributed across the county as per jointly agreed priorities and targets for the development and operation of responses to children and young people's drug use between drug action team chairs, directors of Children's Services and the Government office joint regional team. In 2007-08, Kent's YPSMPG allocation is &pound;1,088,044 resource.</p>
	<p pid="d.1223W.3/4">The DIP main grant is a Home Office grant aimed at getting adult drug-misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment and other support. The allocations to local areas are decided centrally, with input from the Government Offices in the regions, and, in Kent's case, are paid to Kent county council. Kent then transfers the funding to the Kent drug action team (DAT) and the Medway DAT. It is for the DATs to decide how best to use the funding to deliver the Drug Intervention programme across their areas, taking account of Home Office guidance. In 2007-08 Kent county council's DIP main grant allocation is &pound;1,385,981, of which &pound;1,151,373 is allocated to the Kent DAT and &pound;234,608 is allocated to the Medway DAT.</p>
	<p pid="d.1223W.3/5">The UASC grant is for children under the age of 18, who are separated from both parents and not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, has responsibility to do so, and who have applied for asylum in their own right. There is a fixed grant rate the authority can claim per child, and the total claim is dependent on the number of children supported. The maximum grant that Kent is estimated to be able to claim for in 2007-08 is calculated at &pound;4.4 million resource. Payments are made to Kent as they are responsible for managing the UASC grant in this region.</p>

Ultimately, if an employer fails to meet any element of their two ticks commitments, the symbol status is withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="d.1232W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Employment and Welfare Reform has asked me to reply to your question about what steps his Department may take in cases where people in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance are offered appropriate employment and do not take it. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.1232W.0/4" class="indent">Where it appears someone has not done enough to find work or is unreasonably restricting their availability for work, the case is referred to an independent decision maker to see if the customer is entitled to Jobseekers Allowance (JSA). A key part of the JSA labour market intervention process is making sure people are aware of, and making best use of, all vacancy sources, e.g. our telephony based service (Jobseeker Direct) and our on-line Internet Job Bank, both of which provide people with fast and easy access to jobs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1232W.0/5" class="indent">Where it is clear, from discussions with the customer that they are actively seeking work and making best use of appropriate vacancy sources, the issue of refusing employment does not tend to arise. However, where someone has been matched and submitted to a specific job, e.g. at one of the more in-depth interviews everyone has with a personal adviser at key stages or with providers of our mandatory contracted provision, and they refuse the offer, the case will be referred to a decision maker and, where good cause cannot be shown, a benefit sanction is applied.</p>

	<p pid="d.1240W.2/1">The monthly Labour Market Statistics published by the Office for National Statistics treat any claim to JSA after a period on one of the full-time new deal options as a new claim. This is in line with long standing practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1240W.2/2">We have been explicit, from the start of our welfare to work interventions in 1998, how we would measure the duration of JSA claims. The duration of a current JSA claim is determined by comparing the start date of that claim with the count date for the latest month's figures, which is the second Thursday of the month. Where duration is measured over more than one spell, the duration of previous spells is determined by using the start and end dates of each relevant claim.</p>
	<p pid="d.1240W.2/3">Since the introduction of the new deal, the number of people experiencing long periods on JSA has improved substantially, regardless of whether this is measured using the duration of continuous spells or by adding up the total time individuals spend in unemployment in more than one spell.</p>

	<p pid="d.1244W.9/2">The Whole System Long Term Conditions Demonstrators (WSDs) promised in the White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; will explore the effectiveness of telehealth and telecare in supporting integrated care for those with heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. As part of the WSDs, the vital signs (for example pulse rate, temperature and blood pressure) of several thousand individuals will be measured over a period of at least a year. To facilitate this, peripherals such as blood pressure monitors will be connected to a telehealth hub (a form of computer sited in the home) that is linked via a telephone line or broadband to systems that are securely monitored by clinicians. The benefits of undertaking these measurements in the home will be assessed by an independent evaluation and these results will help inform the wider uptake of self reported vital signs monitoring from the home.</p>
	<p pid="d.1244W.9/3">The reporting of medical information to health professionals via telephone is being pioneered in places across England. For example, the Birmingham OwnHealth Service offers people a personalised programme of health care support over the telephone from a dedicated Care Manager&mdash;a fully trained, experienced nurse&mdash;who will help people to get the best health outcomes from treatment programmes already agreed with their general practitioner and/or other health care professionals. Recent departmental documents such as &quot;Raising the profile of long term conditions care&mdash;a compendium of information&quot; have highlighted such models of care as examples of innovative, forward-thinking initiatives that make a real difference.</p>

	<p pid="d.1252W.8/1">The information requested is held at national health service trust level only.</p>
	<p pid="d.1252W.8/2">The following table shows the data held for Devon Primary Care Trust (PCT) and North Devon Healthcare NHS Trust which serve the North Devon area. 1997 data are only available for North Devon Healthcare NHS Trust. Latest available data are for 2006. Data are not available for Devon PCT prior to 2001 because this area was covered by North and East Devon Health Authority (HA) and South and West Devon HA. These figures are not comparable to the 2001 onwards structures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1252W.8/3">Over 1.33 million people were employed in the NHS in England as at September 2006. Between September 1997 and 2006 the total number of NHS staff increased by over 280,000 (27 per cent.); the number of doctors and hospital dentists employed in the NHS in England increased by 35,993 (40per cent.) to 125,612; the number of nurses employed in the NHS in England increased by 79,479 (25 per cent.) to 398,335; and the total number of qualified scientific, therapeutic and technical staff employed in the NHS in England increased by 38,200 (40 per cent.) to 134,498.</p>
	<p pid="d.1252W.8/4">We are now moving away from year-on-year growth in the NHS work force to more of a steady state where there is a closer match between demand and supply. The focus now is strengthening frontline capacity through increases in productivity and skill mix. In some cases, productivity gains may mean that fewer staff are needed to deliver the same service outcomes.</p>

In 2001 there was a large drop in community nursing staff in North Devon Healthcare NHS Trust, and a corresponding increase in the Devon PCT predecessor organisations.<br/> It is reasonable to assume that community services nurses migrated from North Devon Healthcare NHS Trust to these organisations.<br/> 4. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br/> <i> Sources:</i><br/> 1. The Information Centre for health and social care Non-Medical Workforce Census<br/> 2.

	<p pid="d.1256W.2/1">The definition of the type of incident that would be considered to be serious and, therefore, likely to be inconsistent with routine treatment, was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase> when the 7th edition of the &quot;Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) code of practice&quot; was published. The HFEA has advised me that, in accordance with its policy to encourage licensed clinics to reports incidents, including those occurrences that would be considered to be near misses, it does not disclose the names of clinics that have reported an adverse incident nor the number of incidents reported by a particular clinic.</p>
	<p pid="d.1256W.2/2">The HFEA introduced its incident alert reporting system in 2003, requiring licensed establishments to report any adverse incident relating to treatment services that is potentially harmful or actually causes harm to any person, embryos, gametes or staff. The number of incidents handled has been included each year in the HFEA's annual report:</p>

	<p pid="d.1256W.2/15">HFEA has worked with clinics to encourage greater reporting, including lower risk incidents and events that are categorised as near misses. This is to ensure that that lessons learned from such events can be circulated to other clinics, so avoiding a repeat elsewhere in the sector. The HFEA attributes the increase, from 97 incidents in 2005-06 to 224 in 2006-07, to more comprehensive reporting by clinics.</p>

	<p pid="d.1257W.0/1">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, set out important new arrangements for the involvement of patients and the public in health and social care, including local involvement networks (LINks). LINks will enable local people to monitor local services irrespective of who provides them.</p>
	<p pid="d.1257W.0/2">LINks will build on the work of voluntary and community sector groups; and, enable genuine involvement of a far greater number of people than is currently available, ensuring local communities have a stronger voice in the process of commissioning health and social care and enabling them to influence key decisions about the services they both use and pay for.</p>
	<p pid="d.1257W.0/3">In order to ensure that independent sector providers&mdash;be they from the private or third-sector&mdash;cooperate with LINks, we will make directions requiring primary care trusts and local authorities to ensure that their contracts with the independent and third sectors allow LINks entry to appropriate premises and access to appropriate information. This will ensure that LINks will have the same levels of access as they do in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.1257W.0/4">These changes are aimed at promoting open and transparent communication between communities and the health service, and will develop trust and confidence, increasing accountability to local people.</p>

It also says that every woman will be supported by a midwife that she knows and trusts throughout her pregnancy and afterwards. It highlights how commissioners, providers and maternity professionals can shape provision to meet the needs of women and their families and includes a self-assessment tool for commissioners to identify the needs of their population.

	<p pid="d.1267W.5/1">There is no legal definition of 'primary care', 'secondary care' and 'tertiary care'. In general terms, 'primary care' describes community based health services that are usually the first, and often the only, point of contact that patients make with the health service. It covers services provided by family doctors (general practitioners), community pharmacists, optometrists, dentists, community and practice nurses, community therapists (such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists) and midwives. NHS Direct and NHS walk-in centres are also primary care services, as are paramedical services provided by ambulance trusts. 'Secondary care' refers to the range of outpatient and inpatient services provided through acute and mental health hospitals, and 'tertiary care' covers more specialised hospital-based services that are provided in a limited number of centres across the country. These tertiary services are usually accessed by referral from secondary care.</p>

	<p pid="d.1268W.8/1">We have no information which links prescription items dispensed with either the sex or the age of the patient receiving them. However, in the case of anti-impotence preparations we can assume that all prescriptions issued are for males. Information gathered through the analysis of prescriptions issued free of charge allows some estimates to be made of prescriptions received by persons aged 60 and over.</p>
	<p pid="d.1268W.8/2">The main anti-impotence preparations are listed at paragraphs 7.4.5 (Drugs for erectile dysfunction) of the British National Formulary (BNF). Some of these drugs may have been prescribed for other conditions but it is not possible to determine how large a proportion. Similarly, drugs from other parts of the BNF or drugs not licensed for this condition, may have been prescribed. Again, it is not possible to determine the proportion of the use of these drugs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1271W.2/2">The Government's cancelled operations policy introduced in April 2002 provides an incentive for hospitals to avoid cancellations by giving patients the right to move to the hospital of their choice if they are not treated within 28 days. Since this came into force the number of patients cancelled at the last minute, has fallen from 1.5 per cent. to 0.8 per cent. of elective activity.</p>

	<p pid="d.1275W.0/1">A number of wine producing member states objected to the term cider brandy being included in the regulation. When the issue was originally raised by one of the cider brandy producers the European Parliament and Council had already agreed a first reading deal. The European Commission made it clear that it would not be possible to re-open the agreed text at such a late stage in the legislative process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1275W.0/2">At the December 2007 Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the Council adopted by qualified majority a regulation on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks. I voted in favour of this regulation but drew attention to the need to resolve the problem resulting from the omission of the term &quot;cider brandy&quot; from permitted product descriptions in the new regulation. We understand that the industry met with the European Commission at the end of last year and were informed that this issue may be resolved by applying for geographical indication status for cider brandy. We will be pursuing the workability of this solution with the Commission shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.1276W.2/2">No formal guidance has been issued. However, I fully recognise the importance of respecting different beliefs and points of view and working at accommodating these within the law.</p>
	<p pid="d.1276W.2/3">The Animal Welfare Act 2006 places a formal duty on animal keepers to care for their animals&mdash;they must not allow them to suffer unnecessary pain and distress. If an animal is suffering unnecessarily, the law allows for a veterinary surgeon to euthanize that animal in the best interests of its welfare.</p>
	<p pid="d.1276W.2/4">Animal health legislation also provides for certain actions to be taken for disease control purposes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1276W.2/5">Officials are careful to explain their actions when humane destruction or other action is proposed. Ultimately, however, the law must be enforced to control disease and/or prevent an animal from suffering. Where agreement cannot be reached through consultation, a court will usually be invited to approve enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="d.1276W.2/6">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for the Environment (Hilary Benn), will shortly be holding a meeting to discuss how we take into account the views of religious communities while upholding the requirements of animal health and welfare legislation.</p>

	<p pid="d.1277W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>, DEFRA announced that it is placing an order with the pharmaceutical company Intervet to supply 22.5 million doses of bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine, with 20 million doses reserved for England, and 2.5 million for potential use in Wales. The UK was the first member state in northern Europe affected by the current outbreak of BTV-8 to place an order for vaccine, and Intervet has indicated that vaccine is expected to become available for use from May.</p>
	<p pid="d.1277W.5/3">In keeping with the principles set out in the UK bluetongue control strategy, which was developed in partnership with the farming industry, livestock keepers in the protection zone will be able to purchase doses from the vaccine bank. It is expected that purchasing vaccine will make economic sense for livestock keepers as the cost of purchasing and delivering vaccine is significantly outweighed by the potential costs of the impact of disease.</p>
	<p pid="d.1277W.5/4">We are working urgently with Intervet and veterinary wholesalers to finalise the cost of vaccine to farmers. However, it is important to note that the vaccination process may also entail additional costs such as veterinary administration or supervision of vaccination, identification and, potentially, pre-movement testing. Individual livestock keepers, who will benefit directly from the vaccination of their stock, will be responsible for meeting these costs. The extent of these costs will be established through a vaccination plan being developed with the industry, and we will publish a paper detailing likely costs as soon as this information is available.</p>
	<p pid="d.1277W.5/5">The European Commission has announced that Community funds will be made available to reimburse certain costs associated with member states' emergency bluetongue vaccination programmes for 2008. The UK Government will start discussing with the Commission shortly what funding may be available, and on what terms, bearing in mind the undesirability of any conditions that may be inconsistent with our overarching objectives for control of the disease, or would increase the overall costs of vaccination to farmers themselves.</p>

There are many services and activities undertaken by local government, alone or in partnership, which are not directly reflected in the National Indicator Set but which will continue to be important to local areas and the people they serve. It is more appropriate that these are performance managed locally; with local authorities setting priorities, determining performance indicators and monitoring and reviewing performance. This is part of the devolution deal that local government has been seeking.</p>
	<p pid="d.1284W.5/2">A Place Survey run by Communities and Local Government (CLG) will be used to collect 20 of the citizen perspective indicators included in the National Indicator Set.

It is anticipated that the consultation document will be available in mid-December and will be available under the 'Consultation' section of the CLG website.</p>

	<p pid="d.1290W.6/1">Following the introduction of the EU Animal By-products Regulation in 2003, which introduced a ban on the on-farm burial of livestock, the UK National Fallen Stock Scheme (NFSS) began operating in November 2004. Initially, DEFRA and the devolved Administrations agreed jointly to provide funding of &pound;20 million to support the scheme on a reducing basis over three (later extended to four) years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/2">Set out in the following table is the amount of direct support the Government have provided for UK farmers to date.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/5"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/6"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>858,603</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/7"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>5,945,279</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/10"> <td colspan="2"><sup>(1)</sup> To end December.</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/13">The NFSS is run by the National Fallen Stock Company (NFSCo). Although NFSCo's running costs are mainly financed by the farmers who are members of the scheme, DEFRA and the devolved Administrations have also made contributions to its set-up costs, scheme administration and IT. These contributions are set out in the following table.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/16"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/17"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>1,458,930</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/18"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>601,056</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/19"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>538,885</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1290W.6/20"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>660,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/23">In addition, DEFRA has carried out a number of publicity campaigns to better articulate the need for the burial ban. These cost &pound;10,000 in 2006-07 and &pound;40,860 in 2007-08. This activity was the result of a recommendation set out by Bob Bansback in his independent review of the NFSS.</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/24">It is not possible to estimate the amount spent by the farming industry. Not all farmers are members of the scheme and many will have made their own arrangements to dispose of carcases in compliance with the rules. In addition, many farmers would have disposed of carcases as required by the EU regulation even had it not been agreed, given the strict controls on carcase disposal under previous domestic legislation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/25">With regard to the impact on water quality, no such assessment has been made. The Environment Agency is often involved with carcases found in or near to watercourses. The Agency has previously stated that it has no direct evidence to show that on-farm burial in the past has caused reportable pollution problems. However, EU scientific opinion which underpinned the Animal By-products Regulation expressed concern:</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/26" class="indent">about the location of burial sites and access of livestock to them;</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/27" class="indent">that the potential for transmission of TSEs from specified risk material buried near the surface was poorly characterised;</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/28" class="indent">about the extent to which infectivity would be reduced by burial;</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/29" class="indent">about the penetration of prions into leachates and groundwater; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/30" class="indent">the dangers arising from 're-engineering' in areas where previous burial of TSE contaminated material had occurred.</p>
	<p pid="d.1290W.6/31">Given these uncertainties, it was concluded that the burial of carcases continued to pose a significant risk.</p>

The Government's view is that a statutory right of access to inland waterways is not appropriate. The evidence indicates that the demand for access would more effectively be met by a targeted approach, which involves identifying where access is needed, and then creating access agreements with the landowner and other interested parties. Since 2001 &pound;399,000 has been spent researching such arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="d.1296W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.1296W.2/2">The request to discuss Japanese whaling activities in the Southern Ocean was made to the deputy ambassador of the Japanese embassy in London. The Japanese embassy responded by sending the deputy ambassador Wataru Nishigahiro to meet me on the <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-08">8 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1296W.2/3">The deputy ambassador was left in no doubt of the strength of feeling in this country and that the UK is outraged by Japan's whaling activities and considers Japan's lethal research wholly unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.1296W.2/4">To our knowledge, the UK and Australia are the only countries in the world to have had such a meeting with Japanese embassy staff over this season's whaling.</p>
	<p pid="d.1296W.2/5">A meeting at this level demonstrates to Japan the extent of our concern over the issue and I was left in no doubt that the deputy ambassador would convey the UK's position back to the Japanese Government. The UK Government will continue to make our opposition to whaling known to Japan at every appropriate opportunity</p>
