SEMTA have produced sector skills agreements (SSAs) for the aerospace, automotive, electronics and marine sectors in 2005-06. Each SSA identifies current workforce development and skills needs, sets out future skills needs and key skills requirements. SSAs are supported by an action plan which identifies the proposed ways in which the needs will be met. Government are working with the SSC and many other delivery partners to take these actions forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.1363W.9/1">UK policy is that UN Security Council Resolution 1747 does not apply to the provision of export credits. The UK has pressed, both at the UN and the EU, for constraints on the provision of new export credit support for Iran, since multilateral imposition would have the maximum impact. We were unable to secure an explicit reference to export credits in UN Security Council Resolution 1747 and, like other countries, have concluded that export credits are not therefore covered by the Resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1363W.9/2">We continue to press for multilateral constraints on new export credits to be among the sanctions options that may be included in a further UN Security Council Resolution and EU Common Position.

	<p pid="a.1365W.9/1">Improving the education of children in care is the highest priority for the Government. The Children Act 2004 placed local authorities under a specific duty to promote the educational achievement of all children in their care. In 2005, we issued statutory guidance on the duty on to promote the educational achievement of looked after children, which set out how local authorities should meet this duty. This included guidance on how they should ensure children's homes support the education of children in care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.9/2">The National Minimum Standards (NMS) for children's homes make it clear that measures must be in place within local authority and privately run children's homes to address bullying. In particular, there must be a policy on preventing and countering bullying which is known to staff and children. This includes bullying that may occur outside the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.9/3">We recognise that the education of children and young people in care is not good enough. &quot;Care Matters: Time for Change&quot;, published in June 2006, set out a range of measures to improve the attainment of those in care and, in particular, personalise their learning in order to narrow the gap between children in care and all children. This work is underpinned by a public service agreement to narrow the gap in educational achievement between children from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers, and the provisions in the Children and Young Persons Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365W.9/4">Following the passage of the Children and Young Persons Bill we are committed to revising the Children Act 1989 guidance and National Minimum Standards for Children's Homes. This will include guidance on how local authorities and children's homes should support the education of children and young people in care and ensure that those experiencing difficulty receive the support that they need.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366W.2/1">ContactPoint has been subject to scrutiny at key stages throughout its development. My Department's own Chief Security Officer&mdash;external to and independent from the project, has checked the Security Policy, the security architecture, and our risk assessment, and found them to be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.2/2">The news on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase> of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large scale personal data in other Government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the department conducted an assessment of how personal data is stored and protected in the Department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte.</p>

	<p pid="a.1367W.0/8">This new number will thus be based on, but entirely different to the child reference number, which underpins the child benefit system, such that the unique link between the two numbers will be securely and separately held. This is the strongest form of such encryption, and no pattern or link can be made between these two numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1369W.9/1">At January 2007, there were 789,720 children in primary and secondary schools with English as an additional language (EAL): that is 120,240 or some 18 per cent. higher than in 2004. EAL children comprise 12 per cent. of the whole population, up from 9 per cent. in 2004. Schools need to help such children acquire fluency in English as early as possible so that they can access the full curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1369W.9/2">The Government provide funding for new arrivals and EAL children in schools through two main routes. The first is an element within the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for primary schools which was some &pound;256 million in 2004-05, rising to &pound;299 million in 2007-08, with a further rise to over &pound;330 million in 2010-11&mdash;an 11 per cent. real terms increase on the 2004-05 level. The second is a substantial provision for EAL through the ring fenced Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG), which has risen from &pound;162 million in 2004-05 to &pound;179 million in 2007-08 and will rise to &pound;206 million by 2010-11&mdash;a 9 per cent. increase on the 2004-05 level. In addition an Exceptional Circumstances Grant (ECG) has been introduced to reflect changes in local authorities' pupil numbers which occur after the three year indicative allocations of DSG have been announced. It has three elements covering: an increase of more than 2.5 per cent. in overall pupil numbers; an increase of more than 2.5 per cent. in the proportion of children with EAL; and a one-off payment to authorities with EAL proportions below 10 per cent. which experience an increase in their EAL proportion of more than 2.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1369W.9/3">These increases in funding form part of the substantial overall increase in school funding: over the past 10 years since 1997, overall per pupil revenue funding for schools has increased by 67 per cent. in real terms. We expect local authorities to be able to manage new pressures from within these very substantial increases.</p>

	<p pid="a.1370W.2/2">The contribution of education and training to the Lisbon agenda is set out in the Education and Training 2010 Work Programme, and this Department plays an active role within the four main strands of the programme: setting priority areas for action; supporting peer learning and exchange of best practice; benchmarking progress; and developing common tools to support EU mobility and transparency of qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1370W.2/3">Furthermore, the UK's contribution to the EU Ministerial Education and Youth Councils and the official level working groups is rooted in the Lisbon Strategy, as this is where we see the EU as adding the most value. In particular, we are working to ensure that education and youth policy complements those policies being developed in other Lisbon spheres such as employment, social policy, and economic and financial affairs. This will help member states develop policies which will equip their citizens with the education and skills needed to thrive in a knowledge-based economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1371W.6/1">It is the responsibility of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) to regulate the public examinations system, and review standards. The QCA seeks views on the effect of modular examinations through consultations with stakeholders and by monitoring standards. However, it is difficult to disentangle the impact of modularisation from that of any other changes to GCSEs and A levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.6/2">QCA has worked to ensure that standards are consistent and results have improved. Anecdotally, at A level the introduction of AS has helped this by engaging more candidates from the outset and, by allowing them to take a wider range of subjects, candidates concentrate on the subjects they are best at for the full A level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1371W.6/3">QCA sought views on the effect of modular examinations as part of the consultation on GCSE criteria which was run earlier this year. The results of the consultation will be available on the QCA website, <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk">www.qca.org.uk</a>, in mid-December.</p>

	<p pid="a.1371W.9/1">We do not hold data on how many head teachers have moved to a second or subsequent headship post since 2004 and do not hold the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH), as there is no tracking of teacher movements across the system. It is compulsory for all new heads in maintained schools or non-maintained special schools to have, or be working towards, NPQH if they took up their first headship post in a local authority maintained school or a special school after April 2004. It will be mandatory to hold the qualification (rather than be working towards it) from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2009</phrase>. However, it is not a requirement for head teachers who took up their first headship post prior to April 2004 to hold NPQH in their existing post, or if appointed to a second or subsequent headship post.</p>

	<p pid="a.1373W.2/2">It is for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) as the qualifications regulator to oversee the awarding process to ensure that standards are comparable both between different qualifications and over time. The Chief Executive of QCA, Dr. Ken Boston, has written to the hon. Member on this issue and a copy of his reply and the report mentioned have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Ken Boston, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/4" class="italic"> GCSE and <i> A</i> level grades</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/5" class="indent">Thank you for your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-30">30 October</phrase> following the answer that Jim Knight MP provided in response to your Parliamentary Question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/6" class="indent">Although Jim Knight's response indicated that the QCA is responsible for maintaining standards across qualifications and over time, it also stated that the level of information on grade boundaries that you are asking for is not held centrally. I am afraid that this means that QCA does not hold the information either. It is the awarding bodies that offer GCSE and A level qualifications who are responsible for setting grade boundary marks in each subject for every examination series.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/7" class="indent">Although I am unable to provide the data you request, I think it would be helpful to explain how the number of marks required to achieve a grade in any particular examination series is determined and which conclusions can be drawn from variations in the number of raw marks required to achieve a particular grade boundary each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/8" class="indent">For each discrete unit within a qualification (for example, there are currently six units in most A level qualifications) the mark required to achieve a particular grade is determined by an awarding body's awarding committee according to a process that is set out in a code of practice issued by QCA. An awarding committee comprises the most senior examiners for a qualification. They are required to use professional judgment, supported by technical and statistical data, to ensure that standards are carried forward from year to year. In other words, the committee must ensure that the same level of performance will achieve the same grade across different years. However, as different question papers are used in each examination series it is possible that the demand of the question paper might not be identical year-on-year. To take into account unforeseen variances in the demand of question papers between years, the awarding committee may adjust the number of marks required to achieve a particular grade in any given year in order to ensure standards are maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/9" class="indent">The awarding bodies that offer GCSE and A levels are AQA, Edexcel and OCR in England, WJEC in Wales and CCEA in Northern Ireland: Between them, each of these awarding bodies offers up to 50 different subjects at GCSE and 40 different subjects at A level. Some awarding bodies offer more than one qualification in each subject per qualification type. In addition there are now opportunities to sit GCSE examinations in March, November and June and A level examinations in January and June.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/10" class="indent">Therefore, answering your question would require the collection of an extremely large amount of data in the form of a list of each grade A and grade C boundary mark for each of the hundreds of GCSE and A level specifications in each of the examination series in each of the 10 years since 1997. The only inference that could realistically be taken from such data would be that mark boundaries have varied and, indeed must vary, in order to maintain standards. Furthermore, raw mark grade boundary data could also be misleading as they would not necessarily indicate where there have been changes in the total number of marks available in a particular examination component.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/11" class="indent">On previous occasions, QCA has investigated the issue of changes in grade boundaries to look at whether a change in grade boundary marks indicated a change in standards. We looked at a number of grade boundaries in English, English Literature and Mathematics over a number of years. In addition, QCA collected data from a wide range of GCSE and A level examinations in a single year. We concluded that changes in grade boundaries did not indicate a change in standards and that it would not be necessary for us to expand our investigation or collect data from a wider sample. I attach a copy of the report on this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/12" class="indent">However, all of this is in relation to raw mark grade boundaries only. A levels and modular GCSEs allow candidates to sit component parts of the same qualification in different examination series and because papers in different years will be of slightly differing demand a method of scaling is required to ensure that the same level of achievement would receive the same grade across examination series. This scale is the Uniform Mark Scale (UMS) and it enables units for which different amounts of marks are available to be aggregated across or within an examination series to give an overall grade. The percentage of UMS marks required to achieve a given grade does not vary. At GCSE the following percentage of the maximum uniform marks available for a component is required to achieve a particular grade: A* - 90% of the available uniform marks; A - 80%; B - 70%; C - 60%; D - 50%; E - 40%; F - 30%; G - 20%. At A level to following percentage of maximum uniform marks are required to achieve a particular grade: A - 80%; B - 70; C - 60%; D - 50%; E - 40%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1373W.2/13" class="indent">Although QCA is unable to answer your question in the terms in which you asked it, I hope that I have been able to provide you with information that you find to be of use.</p>

	<p pid="a.1379W.2/1">We have accepted all of the Rose Review's recommendations and have paid particular attention to the recommendation that phonics should be taught as the prime approach to learning to read. We have renewed the primary framework for teaching literacy to reflect this. To further support teachers and practitioners in implementing this key change, and in line with the Review's recommendations, we have worked with Jim Rose to produce a high quality phonics teaching programme, Letters and Sounds. As an alternative for schools that instead wish to use a commercial phonics programme, we have published guidance on a set of criteria which define the key features of an effective phonics teaching programme and which build directly on the Review's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.2/2">We have taken steps to ensure that local authorities have the capacity and expertise to support schools in developing effective phonics teaching. The Communication, Language and Literacy Development (CLLD) programme, specifically developed to implement the Review's recommendations, builds greater quality and capacity in the teaching of early literacy through developing work on speaking and listening; strengthening leadership and management of early literacy; and supporting all schools with phonics and early reading. The CLLD programme has provided training in early reading for every local authority and has funded additional consultants to lead this work in 50 targeted authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1379W.2/3">We are also working with local authorities and the Training and Development Agency to ensure that newly qualified practitioners are equipped with the necessary skills to implement the Rose Review recommendations.</p>

A significant part of the statementing process is a thorough assessment of the child's needs, in order to determine the appropriate provision to meet those needs. The Government's response to the July 2006 Education and Skills Select Committee report on SEN announced that Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools will review progress in the current system in 2009-10.

	<p pid="a.1393W.12/1">The Government do not define or set criteria for an 'eco-home' as such. The Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code) sets standards for housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.12/2">The Code is a set of sustainable design principles covering performance of new homes in nine key areas, including energy and CO2 emissions, water, materials, surface water run-off, waste, pollution, health and well-being, management and ecology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.12/3">New homes that are assessed against the Code receive a 1-6 star rating. A 1 star home is built to higher sustainability standards that those set out in building regulations while a 6 star home is a truly sustainable&mdash;zero carbon&mdash;home. The criteria on how to achieve each star rating is set out in detail in &quot;Code for Sustainable Homes: Technical guide&quot;, available on the Communities and Local Government's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.12/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/thecode">www.communities.gov.uk/thecode</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.12/5">The Code is based on the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) for homes 'EcoHomes', which it replaced for new homes in England from April 2007. The Code is more robust than 'EcoHomes' as it sets minimum standards for Energy/CO2, water, materials, surface water run-off and waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.1405W.2/1">MOD is working with other Government Departments on the security implications of climate change. Underpinning this work is climate modelling by the Hadley Centre in the Met Office, a MOD Trading Fund, to predict future climates and assess their defence implications in strategically important regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.2/2">The implications of climate change will be factored into the Department's acquisition planning and future operating procedures to ensure that the armed forces can continue to perform effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.2/3">Climate change will also have consequences for the management of defence in the UK with some low lying sites vulnerable to rising sea levels and flooding. Adaptation to climate change has therefore been embedded in the appraisal methodology and tools used on all estate-related plans, programmes, projects and activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.2/4">The Department is not just preparing to adapt; we also recognise that we have an important role in mitigating climate change. Improvements in energy management and energy efficiency have delivered reductions in estate carbon dioxide emissions. We are on track to meet cross-Government targets for reducing these emissions by 12.5 per cent. by 2010-11 and by 30 per cent. by 2020 in line with our commitments under the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate.</p>

So far, the UK has contracted for the delivery of two tranches, comprising 144 aircraft. Decisions on tranche three will be taken in due course, in conjunction with our partner nations, once we have analysed and considered the relevant information. The estimated cost of the Eurofighter Typhoon programme is commercially sensitive information which is protected in order to maintain our negotiating position for future acquisitions on the Typhoon programme.

	<p pid="a.1411W.2/1">The out of service dates of the Swiftsure and Trafalgar class submarines were adjusted during the Department's 2004 planning round to reflect the planned in-service dates of the Astute class submarines and the decision, announced in the July 2004 White Paper Delivering Security in a Changing World-Future Capabilities (Cmd 6269), to reduce the size of the submarine fleet. As a consequence, some submarines had their service lives extended, and others had theirs reduced. No estimate has been made of whether any associated costs are specifically attributable to adjustments to the out of service date of the existing fleet to meet the in-service dates of the Astute class.</p>

	<p pid="a.1414W.6/1">The Climate Change Bill, which it is hoped will receive Royal Assent by mid 2008, will provide a strong sustainable framework for adapting to the impacts of climate change. It will require Government to report at least every five years on current and predicted impacts of climate change, and on its proposals and policy for adapting to these.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.6/2">DEFRA is also leading on the development of a cross-Government Adaptation Policy Framework to be published in the spring. The Framework aims to provide a consistent approach to building adaptation into policies, and a coherent way to identify cross-cutting risks and opportunities and to assist in prioritisation of action across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.6/3">In October 2008, the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP), will launch the DEFRA-funded UK 21<sup>(st)</sup> Century Climate Change Scenarios (UKCIP08) programme. This will provide accurate modelling and practical tools to help organisations (like local authorities and businesses) assess and address climate change impacts for the UK up to 2100 at a regional and local level. We will continue to develop the tools and actions to address climate change in the coming decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.6/4">DEFRA is also considering the impacts of climate change for priority sectors. With the prediction of wetter winters and drier summers, water is on the front line of climate change adaptation. We will be launching a new Water Strategy, early in 2008, which will put adaptation at the heart of policy-making and ensure that water management is fit for the future. The increased flood risk from climate change is also one focus of the separate cross-government long-term flood management strategy, 'Making Space for Water'. The strategy is encouraging a holistic approach to the management of flood risk, together with increasing awareness and emergency preparedness within communities to help them better cope with flood events when they occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1414W.6/5">In addition, my Department continues to take a strong lead internationally on climate change. For example, we are working to provide a detailed assessment of potential impacts of climate change in India, and to identify and develop adaptation strategies. The project will look to improve climate change scenarios for India up to 2050 and will assess the impact of climate change nationally on water resources, agriculture and forestry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1421W.2/1">Tackling fly-tipping and wider waste crime is a priority for the Government. Our Waste Strategy for England, published in May 2007, makes clear that initiatives to boost waste prevention and recycling should be supported by fly-tipping strategies aimed at tackling the illegal dumping of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/2">The Strategy includes the Government's Illegal Waste Activity Action Plan, which sets out what action is being taken and proposed in this area. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/3" class="indent">(i) Reviewing the controls in place to deal with the management and carriage of waste. The review aims to reduce levels of fly-tipping by making it easier for businesses to understand and comply with the regulations and make them easier for local authorities to use. This is planned for completion at the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) Developing legislation that will give local authorities and the Environment Agency the powers to stop, search and instantly seize vehicles being used to commit fly-tipping offences. This is planned for completion at the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Consulting on proposals to introduce mandatory Site Waste Management Plans for construction and demolition projects above a certain value. This is planned for completion in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) Funding the Environment Agency's targeted campaigns to disseminate good practice to businesses and raise awareness of good waste management practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/7" class="indent">(v) Delivering Flycapture Enforcement, a training programme aimed at local authority officers and their legal teams to increase knowledge of the relevant legislation and develop skills in effective enforcement and prosecution of fly-tippers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/8" class="indent">(vi) Work with stakeholders to consider how the Flycapture database can be enhanced or improved to help local authorities implement fly-tipping interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/9">DEFRA has also funded Environmental Campaigns (Encams) to deliver a programme of work on local environmental quality and fly-tipping issues in partnership with Government Offices. This work will support the poorest performing local authorities in each region through a combination of data analysis, best practice sharing and targeted seminars. It will also promote the introduction of fly-tipping targets within local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421W.2/10">In addition, DEFRA funded the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science to produce research on fly-tipping&mdash;&quot;Fly-tipping: Causes, Incentives and Solutions&quot;. This included good practice guidance on crime prevention techniques, including surveillance, and has been distributed to all local authorities in England.</p>

Last year, following agreement by the chairman of the Advisory Committee on pesticides, the HSE gave emergency approval for outdoor use of brodifacoum at one site in Winchester on the basis of an assessment that rats there appeared to be resistant to other treatments. Risks to wildlife (the reason outdoor use is not normally permitted) could be managed since it is a relatively enclosed site.</p>

	<p pid="a.1422W.9/1">The opening quota for the 10 m and under fleet is boosted by Fisheries Administrations acquiring additional quota in-year for their use. Information on the 10 m and under fleet's share of quota at <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-31">31 December 2006</phrase> is set out in the table. However, focusing on such an analysis can be misleading, as some of the quota stocks included are of little interest to inshore vessels. In addition, many of these vessels catch types of fish, such as crabs and scallops, which are not subject to the constraints on their activity that may be seen when targeting quota species. Figures for landings of quota stocks and non-quota stocks are also included in the table and show that 80 per cent. of all landings by the UK 10 m and under fleet in 2006 were of non-quota stocks.</p>

	<p pid="a.1425W.3/1">The UK is working closely with International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) allies to ensure a fully integrated approach to counter-narcotics that best supports the Afghan Government's National Drugs Control Strategy. ISAF is providing increasing support to the Afghan counter-narcotics effort, which we are encouraging. In the past few months, ISAF has provided support to a number of Afghan law enforcement operations to disrupt drug trafficking and to the Afghan Government's public information campaign to persuade farmers not to plant poppy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425W.3/2">The UN does not have a policy of paying poppy growers to diversify or to cease poppy production because they judge it would not work, in part due to the risk of encouraging farmers currently farming licit crops to start cultivating poppy. The Department for International Development and the World Bank have been conducting research into possible economic incentives to reduce opium production in Afghanistan. The final report will be released shortly; initial recommendations do not include subsidies or payments to farmers.</p>

There are very few exemptions or exceptions to this and, of necessity, these are very tightly drawn.

We had hoped to collect fingerprints from these children in a separate visa application centre close to their homes thereby avoiding them having to travel to our embassy in Minsk. Unfortunately, despite lengthy negotiations we were unable to secure agreement from the Belarussian authorities. I am however pleased to confirm that we will be introducing a pilot initiative next year to enable our embassy in Minsk to collect the children's biometric data through mobile fingerprinting machines. The embassy will be working with the charities to confirm arrangements for this pilot.</p>

	<p pid="a.1426W.3/1">Delivering for the Government's objectives, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has used its overseas network of posts to lobby for an ambitious post-2012 framework under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This includes pressing for ambitious efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid dangerous climate change as well as adapting to the effects of climate change which are already unavoidable. Posts will continue to play an active role in building momentum for comprehensive negotiations due to be launched at the UN climate change conference in Bali from 3 to <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase> before a global agreement in Copenhagen by 2009. Posts have also undertaken some activity to help build local capacity on adapting to climate change. The Department for International Development and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs take the lead for adaptation policy and negotiations under the UNFCCC and both will continue providing support to developing countries for adaptation activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426W.3/2">The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports show that the impacts of climate change are already being felt. There is a need to act now and over the coming decades, both to deal with the obvious impacts (from reduced water availability to weather-related disasters) and adjust development decisions to deal with the long-term risks (from making low cost policy adjustments to planning for large scale investments in the future). If we do not act now, and over the coming decades, we are likely to see unprecedented reversals in progress on poverty reduction. Making development resilient to climate risk will incur additional costs. Current estimates suggest this may be around US$40 billion a year by 2030&mdash;more work is needed to improve our understanding of these costs.</p>

We believe that the most effective means of improving such situations is through a co-operative relationship between the UN human rights machinery and the Government of the relevant country. However, where the situation is of serious concern and where the Government in question refuses to co-operate or to make use of the support offered to them by the UN human rights mechanisms, it is entirely appropriate for the UNGA or the UN Human Rights Council to express concern over the situation through a resolution, if necessary without the support of the country concerned. The Government worked very actively with European Union and other partners to secure the recent adoption of resolutions by the UNGA Third Committee on the situations in Iran, Burma, Belarus and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>

	<p pid="a.1430W.5/1">We remain deeply concerned by the growing use of capital punishment in Iran, particularly with regard to juvenile executions. Although Iran has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&mdash;both of which prohibit the use of the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18&mdash;Iran continues to execute more juvenile offenders than any other country in the world. We deplore the fact that there have been at least three juvenile executions so far this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1430W.5/2">UK, and EU, policy on the death penalty is clear: we oppose it in all circumstances and are committed to taking action on individual cases that fall below international minimum standards, including juvenile cases. The EU presidency, with strong UK support, has raised concerns about juvenile execution cases with the Iranian authorities on at least thirteen occasions this year. We also make representations in bilateral meetings with the Iranians. Most recently, senior officials raised two juvenile execution cases (Soghra Nafj-Pour and Makwan Moloudzadeh) with the Iranian ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-26">26 October</phrase>&mdash;we have since heard that their cases are being reviewed&mdash;and, in a meeting with the Iranian embassy on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>, protested the recent execution of Mohammad Reza Tork.</p>

	<p pid="a.1434W.11/1">Our high commission in Nicosia recognises that there is a risk in relation to the acquisition of properties by UK nationals in the north of Cyprus. This is reflected in the travel advice for Cyprus given on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's website and the answers to &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; that are sent to inquirers on request. This advice is reproduced as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1434W.11/2" class="indent">Property issues are closely linked to the political situation. There are a number of potential practical, financial and legal implications, particularly for those considering buying property in the north. These relate to the non-recognition of the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;, the suspension of EU law in northern Cyprus, the possible consequences for property of a future settlement, and the many thousands of claims to ownership from people displaced in 1974. There is also a risk that, as a result of the disputed ownership of many of the properties, purchasers could face legal proceedings in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as attempts to enforce judgments from these courts elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1434W.11/3">The Government have undertaken no risk assessment in relation to the acquisition of properties by UK citizens in illegal Israeli settlements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1435W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has not kept a record of the number of occasions UK citizens have sought advice in relation to property disputes in northern Cyprus over the last five years. The FCO does, however, receive a significant number of inquiries from members of the public relating to property in northern Cyprus. The FCO is not able to directly intervene in private property disputes. However, we continue to warn potential purchasers of the risks of purchasing property in northern Cyprus, both through our online travel advice&mdash;available at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>&mdash;and in response to inquiries from the public. We also advise UK citizens in the travel advice section of our website to seek qualified legal advice from a source that is independent of the seller before purchasing property in Cyprus. Similarly, should a dispute occur as a result of a property transaction, we advise members of the public to seek qualified independent legal advice on their rights and methods of redress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1435W.2/2">We are not aware of any occasions in which UK citizens have sought advice from the FCO on property disputes in Israeli settlements in the last five years. The Government do not advise or encourage individuals, companies or organisations to market or sell property in the settlements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1435W.2/3">We regard all settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories as illegal under international law and have repeatedly raised our concerns about settlement activity with the Israeli Government.</p>

Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

	<p pid="a.1439W.5/11">It is not possible to estimate from the yellow card scheme the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs since the scheme is associated with an unknown level of under-reporting. In addition, it is important to note that the submission of a suspected ADR report does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.12/1">A number of NERC-funded research programmes and collaborations provide scientific evidence that informs the Government's climate change policy. The Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme is just one of these; others include the RAPID Climate Change programme, the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.12/2">NERC council has undertaken an independent mid-term evaluation of the QUEST programme, which will be published shortly. This evaluation concluded that the programme has made good links with stakeholders including central government, and that it is satisfactorily mobilising its preliminary science outputs to inform policy, and increasing the UK's capability to generate policy-relevant science.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.12/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) takes the lead within Government for climate change policy and commissions research on climate change in support of policy. It has not made an assessment of the effectiveness of the Natural Environment Research Council's (NERC) programme quantifying and understanding the earth system in informing the Government's climate change policy, although it does draw on its work programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1452W.6/1">The Government are firmly committed to ensuring that every young person with the ability and potential to benefit from higher education has the opportunity to do so. Recently published higher education indicators show that in England we are making progress in widening participation for students from state schools, including among some of the most selective institutions such as the Russell Group&mdash;overall the proportion of state school entrants has risen by a percentage point between 2004/05 and 2005/06. It is important that individuals are able to access a course and institution that best suits their needs, including stretching and challenging the most talented.</p>
	<p pid="a.1452W.6/2">We will continue to treat this as a priority through, among other things: continuing our support for the national Aimhigher Programme, which seeks to raise young people's aspirations and recognise higher education as a viable and valuable ambition; the role of the Office for Fair Access, which aims to promote and safeguard fair access to higher education for under-represented groups; and the new Gifted and Talented (G and T) Excellence Hubs, which seek to provide additional activities for G and T young people across the country, with particular emphasis on those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1452W.6/3">Even the most talented students must be sufficiently well prepared to study and succeed in higher education and that is why we are encouraging universities to extend and strengthen their existing links with schools so that they can help schools raise standards and attainment levels while identifying and nurturing the young students of the future.</p>

The total budget for Train to Gain was &pound;288 million of which &pound;25.4 million (8.8 per cent. of the total budget) was allocated to brokerage. This figure included one-off setup costs associated with the new service. London received &pound;4.66 million for brokerage (which equates to 18.3 per cent. of the overall brokerage budget).</p>

	<p pid="a.1457W.0/1">The 2007 Humanitarian Action Plan (HAP) for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is costed at US$687 million which includes both emergency and early recovery activities. Donors have contributed US$437 million to the HAP so far. Around US$100 million of these contributions have been made through the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund, which provides the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator complete flexibility in targeting funds to meet the most critical humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.0/2">The UK is one of the largest humanitarian donors to the DRC. In 2007 the UK has provided some &pound;35 million for humanitarian projects. This accounts for over 10 per cent. of the needs as expressed in the HAP. &pound;30 million of our 2007 funding has been channelled through the Pooled Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.0/3">The establishment of the Pooled Fund has made it easier for other donors to contribute to the HAP and the numbers of donors contributing to the fund increased from six in 2006 to eight in 2007. DFID played a key role in establishing the Pooled Fund and encourages other donors to contribute to it. This is therefore one important way in which DFID has co-operated with its international partners to address the shortfall in humanitarian funding for DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.0/4">In addition, as a member of the Good Humanitarian Donor group in the DRC, DFID participates actively with other donors in regularly assessing humanitarian assistance priorities and how shortfalls in funding can be addressed.</p>

If a sub-regional EPA is signed, other countries in the region should be able to join the EPA as soon as they are ready.

The Border and Immigration Agency does not operate a border control on passengers arriving from the Channel Islands as this falls within the arrangements set out for the common travel area. The objective of the common travel area (the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland) is that all the territories should be treated as a single unit for the purpose of travel within the area. Passengers arriving in the United Kingdom from the Channel Islands are, therefore, not normally subject to examination by an immigration officer.

A strategic joint steering group has been established to focus specifically on offender behavioural programmes for high risk offenders in relation to public protection and resettlement. In addition to existing expenditure in this area, we plan to invest a further &pound;4.7million over the next three financial years to implement the strategy. This will include investment in education and psychology services to recruit and train new staff to undertake risk assessments, provide programmes and work directly with dangerous offenders to reduce their risk, and to put the necessary structures in place to manage the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1476W.0/1">Biofuels are currently produced from a wide range of sources, including rapeseed oil, palm oil, soya oil, wheat, sugar beet, and sugar cane. In the longer term there is the potential that biofuels may be produced from other crops and other forms of biomass, including agricultural and forestry residues and the biodegradable fraction of municipal waste. The Department does not have a detailed breakdown of the percentage of UK biofuels that come from these different sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1476W.0/2">Once the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) comes into effect in April 2008, transport fuel suppliers will be required to report on matters such as the feedstock from which their biofuels were produced and its country of origin. The Renewable Fuels Agency will be required to report regularly to Parliament on these matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.1477W.2/2">The Climate Change Bill will set out a requirement for the Government to produce the first UK risk assessment on climate change within three years.

Network Rail is already designing increased resilience into its renewals work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1480W.3/2">The Government, in conjunction with the Welsh Assembly Government, put forward the Cardiff bid to host the EU GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) in 2005. At the end of 2007, the Finnish presidency reviewed the bids from 11 member states which had declared an interest, but no decision was proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1480W.3/3">After the negotiations for a public private partnership to take forward Galileo collapsed earlier this year, the Commission put forward proposals for changing the governance of the programme. These will require, among other things, amendments to the EU regulation which set up the GSA. The question of its location is not likely to be considered until the GSA and other regulations have been agreed, some time in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1480W.3/4">The Department for Transport, in partnership with the Welsh Assembly Government, the Wales Office, the FCO and other Departments, has taken the lead in promoting the Cardiff bid, mainly through lobbying of other member states. It would not be possible to separate out, or cost, the amount of time spent by officials in promoting Cardiff from the efforts in promoting the Government's objective for Galileo more generally.</p>

	<p pid="a.1481W.8/1">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), which will come into effect in April 2008, is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring transport fuel suppliers to ensure that an increasing percentage of their total road transport fuel sales is made up of biofuels. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions saved by different biofuels varies considerably and depends on a wide range of factors including the amount of energy used in the cultivation, processing and transportation of the crop. The RTFO will include a reporting mechanism to encourage transport fuel suppliers to source those biofuels which deliver high levels of carbon savings in a sustainable way, and to allow the policy's greenhouse gas savings to be accurately quantified. The Government estimate that by 2010 the RTFO could save between 2.6 and 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1481W.8/2">From April 2010 the Government aim to reward biofuels under the RTFO according to their carbon savings in order to provide greater certainty as to the precise carbon savings delivered by the scheme. Further details of how this might be done are set out in a policy paper which is available via the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1482W.2/1">The development of proposals to reduce the traffic generated by the school run does not fall into neat boxes that enable us to identify exactly how many officials are engaged on this. There are four officials who do work on reducing car use for journeys to and from school, mainly through the joint DfT/DCSF 'Travelling to School' project, in the Department's sustainable travel initiatives team. Additional work to promote and facilitate walking and cycling to school is done by the six officials working in the Department's walking and cycling team and by Cycling England, an independent body set up by the Department in 2005 to promote cycling. In addition, officials in several other teams across the Department work on the development of proposals that have a direct impact on parents' decisions as to whether or not to let their children travel to and from school by non-car modes. They include people engaged in road safety, traffic management, buses, and local and regional transport policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1482W.2/2">In addition, and as part of their joint 'Travelling to School' project, DfT and DCSF are providing sufficient funding for local authorities to employ around 250 school travel advisers who work with schools to help them develop and implement school travel plans, which are seen as the key strategies for reducing car use for journeys to and from school. The school travel advisers are supported by a network of 11 regional school travel advisers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1484W.8/1">Ownership of Waterloo International transfers to the Department at the end of March 2008 following Eurostar's de-commissioning of the facility as an international station. The Department is currently working closely with Network Rail and Stagecoach South West Trains (the train operating company) to finalise the design and costs associated with the partial conversion of Waterloo International to accommodate some domestic passenger services. The cost information should be finalised early next year. Works on site are expected to commence soon after the station transfers to the Department and will take several months to complete. Services could then operate into and out of Platform 20 of Waterloo International from the start of the timetable change date in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1484W.8/2">Options for the medium to long-term use of all five international platforms are being assessed by the Department and Network Rail as part of a wider strategy for the upgrade of Waterloo station. Costs will be determined as part of this process. The medium term proposals would require significant infrastructure alterations at Waterloo. Additionally, it would be linked to the procurement of additional rolling stock to lengthen trains. The timescale for implementation is likely to be around 2012-14.</p>

(169974)</p>

	<p pid="a.1497W.5/5" class="indent">The tables attached show the numbers of 16 to 24 year olds not in full-time education, employment or training, resident in the Uxbridge constituency, each London borough, and England. Estimates are provided from the local area LFS for the twelve months ending February, for 1999 to 2004, and from the APS for the twelve months ending March, for 2005 to 2007. The tables also show these numbers as the percentage of all 16 to 24 year olds in the areas, for each year, which allows changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers. Data for the twelve month period ending in February 1998 are not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1497W.5/6" class="indent">Estimates for a subset of the population in a small geographical area are based on very small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. Changes over time should be treated with particular caution.</p>

	<p pid="a.1500W.2/1">HMRC's approach on recovery of overpayments is set out in Code of Practice 26 'What happens if we have paid you too much tax credits'. In cases where recovery is made from an ongoing award, a customer's award notice will confirm the amount of the overpayment and how much the award will be reduced by to recover the sum. To prevent hardship, payments from ongoing award are restricted to 10 per cent. of the tax credit award for those on maximum tax credits awards (those families with the lowest incomes). For those on a tapered award (those families whose income is higher than the WTC or CTC income threshold) recovery is set at 25 per cent. If families face financial difficulties on the reduced payments, they are advised to contact HMRC and ask for their case to be reconsidered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1500W.2/2">If the customer is no longer entitled to tax credits, or their tax credits award has ended, as the household has changed, HMRC will write asking for a direct payment. The customer can pay back the amount over 12 months or, if where a family says this would cause them financial hardship, over a longer period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1500W.2/3">In exceptional circumstances, HMRC may write off all or part of an overpayment if it would cause hardship to pay it back.</p>
	<p pid="a.1500W.2/4">I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 944, that HMRC will replace the &quot;reasonable belief test&quot; with a clearer test that will set out customer's responsibilities for checking factual information, and what in turn they can expect from HMRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.1501W.2/1">Where a customer has died, HMRC make every effort to obtain a voluntary settlement of any outstanding overpayment from their personal representative or executor. If there are no funds in the estate, or if HMRC are unable to identify the personal representative or executor, the overpayment is written off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501W.2/2">In cases where a household has broken down and one of the couple has since died, both customers remain jointly and severally liable in law for any outstanding overpayment. If there are no funds in the deceased estate HMRC attempt to recover the full overpayment from the surviving partner taking account of their personal circumstances and our hardship provisions. But, HMRC would seek to do so sensitively and may, for example, recover the overpayment over an extended period or use our discretion to recover less than the full amount in some cases if appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1502W.10/6" class="indent">An alleged non-resident parent can seek to rebut such a presumption via the courts at any time if they so wish, but in the meantime the Agency will proceed with making and enforcing a maintenance assessment.

	<p pid="a.1502W.10/7" class="indent">In addition the Agency can offer alleged non-resident parents who dispute parentage access to DNA test. However parentage is assumed where the alleged non-resident parent refuses to take a DNA test or the test result shows that they are the parent of the child in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.1503W.2/1">The Climate Change Bill and the cross-Government Adaptation Policy Framework (due for publication in spring 2008) will set out the Government's overall strategy on climate change. As yet, there are no specific targets in place for adaptation&mdash;these will be set following the publication of the Adaptation Policy Framework. The Department continues to work towards the achievement of the carbon reduction and neutrality targets for Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/2">DWP recognises that the most vulnerable in society may be disproportionately affected by climate change. As such, it is important to take steps to adapt to the short, medium and long-term risks and impacts. At the beginning of this year, the Department commissioned the Hadley Centre for Climate Change to undertake a high level assessment, building on an internal review carried out in 2003, of the risks that climate change poses to its policies and operations. This was launched at the Department's Sustainable Development conference in March, which focused and engaged senior officials specifically on the theme of climate change adaptation. The review is expected to be completed by the end of 2007, and will form the basis for a future programme of adaptation work, based on the priorities identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.1507W.2/1">The details of the Government's proposals to raise the school leaving age are currently being developed. However we intend to continue to mirror child benefit provisions in the definition of a child for child maintenance purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1507W.2/2">If young people in England are required to stay at school or in training until they are 17 or 18, we anticipate that non-resident parents will still be liable for maintenance until the young person leaves school or training. Young people in other parts of the UK who can choose to leave education or training at 16 will cease to receive maintenance should they do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1507W.2/3">The Government's proposals on raising the school leaving age are due to take effect from 2013, by which time we anticipate that child maintenance cases will largely be subject to the new scheme's rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.1507W.2/4">With the increased focus on voluntary arrangements and the ending of the requirement that parents with care on benefit be treated as applying for child maintenance, not all of the current Child Support Agency caseload will choose to use the statutory maintenance service and be subject to the new scheme's rules. Since we do not know the precise composition of the resulting caseload, it is not possible to estimate the impact on those existing cases on moving to the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1512W.3/2">The information is in the following table. The winter fuel payment is intended to provide a contribution towards winter heating bills which account for around 60 per cent. of the total annual fuel bill. The payment provides a significant contribution to these higher winter costs. Winter fuel payments have increased from 20 in 1997-98 to the current value of &pound;200 for households with someone aged 60 to 79 years of age, and &pound;300 for households with someone aged 80 or over.</p>
