	<p pid="a.1309W.3/1">The UK climate impacts programme is conducting ongoing work to provide scenarios to show how our climate might change and co-ordinating research on dealing with our future climate. This includes work on climate change impacts on the agriculture sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.3/2">Research suggests that climate change impacts do not appear to threaten the viability of the agriculture industry as a whole in the UK due to the adaptability of UK systems., However, individual agricultural businesses and land managers will need to be alive to the need to adapt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.3/3">The UK national adaptation policy framework is currently being developed. It will help to provide a more strategic approach to adaptation, identifying key risks and opportunities common across a number of policy areas and to coordinate approaches where possible. The first phase of the framework will be structured on a sectoral basis, and these sectors will include agriculture, horticulture and forestry as well as water resources, biodiversity and nature conservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.3/4">The new UK climate change programme 2006 has also assessed the role of agriculture in addressing climate change and seeks to raise awareness of the issues across the sector and develop measures to allow the sector to play a full part in tackling climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.3/5">We have an ongoing programme of research to provide a robust evidence base to support our policy development on climate change impacts and adaptation in agriculture. A project of particular relevance is CC0366: Publication of outputs arising from Defra research on impacts and adaptation in the agricultural sector&quot;, which can be found at: <a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/More.asp?l=CC0366&amp;M=K">http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/More.asp?l=CC0366&amp;M=K</a> WS&amp;V=cc03&amp;SUBMIT1=Se arch&amp;SCOPE=0.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309W.3/6">Our report Climate change and agriculture in the United Kingdom&quot; also provides information on the new climatic and market conditions that may be experienced and enables farmers to consider strategies that will maintain or enhance their ability to anticipate climate change in their decision-making and take steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

	<p pid="a.1310W.2/1">Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives. The Mayor has responsibility for ensuring the local air quality management regime is undertaken appropriately by London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/2">Following the first round of reviews and assessments, the London borough of Bexley declared an air quality management area in respect of Particulate (PM10), in the Manor road area, in August 2001. In fulfilment of its obligations under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Act, Bexley carried out a further assessment of existing, and likely future, air quality within the AQMA in the borough, and submitted a report to my Department in May 2003 and the Mayor of London in March 2003. The report concluded that the air quality management area as declared was still justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/3">The council consulted my Department on its draft plan in July 2003, and the Mayor of London in June 2003. The Greater London Authority has asked Bexley to provide an update on its action plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/4">The last round of reviews and assessments started in 2003 and London boroughs had to submit their updating and screening assessments (USA) by December 2003. They were expected to submit either a detailed assessment, where further investigation was required, or a progress report by December 2004. The London borough of Bexley submitted its USA to my Department in September 2004, and the Mayor of London in October 2004. The conclusion was that further investigation (detailed assessment) was needed at Manor road in respect of the likely exceedences of nitrogen dioxide and PM10 objectives. The Department is still awaiting a report on its detailed assessment of air quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1310W.2/5">The next round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities are asked to submit a new updating and screening assessment by the end of April 2006, which will be considered by my officials. My Department will be assessing the London borough of Bexley's report as part of this exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.1311W.3/1">The Department is currently undertaking an assessment of the humaneness, efficacy and non-target risks of a body snare specifically designed to restrain badgers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.3/2">The trials are initially being undertaken in captivity&mdash;pen trials&mdash;under Home Office licence with continuous observation by researchers. This ensures that if any animal is injured during capture immediate assessment and, if necessary, intervention can occur. In the absence of such signs the animals are restrained for a maximum of eight hours. At the end of the restraint period the badgers are examined for injuries by a veterinary surgeon. They are then held for a further four days and re-examined by a veterinary surgeon for signs of any sub-dermal damage&mdash;necrosis&mdash;before release back to the wild. The available evidence is reviewed after each trial to determine whether further studies should proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.3/3">The aim is to release all animals back to the wild unharmed within a maximum period of 10 days following initial capture. Advice from veterinary surgeons and badger experts is that removing the badger from its home territory for this length of time should not affect the social structure of the family group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311W.3/4">If the humaneness of the body snare is found to be acceptable in these pen trials, then field trials will be conducted to confirm its humaneness and to assess effectiveness, utility and non-target risks. It is anticipated that body snares will be inspected approximately every four hours during such trials.</p>

	<p pid="a.1313W.2/1">The principal means of control to protect the water environment are the Environment Agency's powers and duties under the Water Resources Act 1991, the Environment Act 1995 and the Groundwater Regulations 1998. The Environment Agency's booklet Assessing the Groundwater Pollution Potential of Cemetery Development&quot; gives advice to operators on assessing the risk to groundwater from existing and planned cemeteries. The booklet also addresses such factors as the soil nature and type, and the depth to the water table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.2/2">In the case of a new cemetery, or a change of use of an existing cemetery, planning permission would be required from the Local Planning Authority under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Planning and Compensation Act 1991. The Local Planning Authority would consult with the Environment Agency before giving permission and would use refusal refuse permission, or impose conditions in a Decision Notice, to control a cemetery development and ensure that human health and the environment are protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.2/3">There are no statutory water quality guidelines relating to burial grounds. A site specific approach would apply based on any risks to human health or the environment at any particular location. Good practice requires that cemeteries are, where possible, located in well drained areas with a reasonable depth of unsaturated ground between the base of the grave and the water table so that flooding of the ground should not normally be an issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.2/4">Where redevelopment is taking place on any land which may be affected by contamination due to the presence of substances in, on, or under the land, decontamination may be required. This should be carried out in line with the guidance in the publication Contaminated Land Report 11: Model procedures for the management of land contamination&quot; (DEFRA and Environment Agency, 2004).</p>

	<p pid="a.1316W.5/1">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 amended section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to introduce artificial light emitted from premises so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance as capable of constituting a statutory nuisance. Local authorities have a statutory duty to check their areas periodically for existing and potential statutory nuisances from artificial light, and to take reasonably practicable steps to investigate complaints of nuisance from artificial light. If satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists or is about to occur or recur, the local authority must serve an abatement notice under section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requiring that the nuisance is ceased or abated within a specified timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316W.5/2">It is an offence to breach or fail to comply with an abatement notice, which upon summary conviction carries a fine of up to &pound;5,000 for domestic premises and &pound;20,000 for industrial, trade and business premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316W.5/3">The statutory nuisance regime offers a legislative framework to address cases of artificial light nuisance emitted from one premises and affecting another in specific ways. It is not an appropriate tool with which to address light pollution per se. A statutory nuisance from artificial light may also be a source of light pollution. It does not follow that all light pollution constitutes a statutory nuisance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1319W.3/1">DEFRA has issued detailed guidance on legislation dealing with litter and refuse in Part 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. This includes guidance on the extent to which railway stations, track and other areas of railway land are affected. The revised code of practice on litter and refuse provides practical guidance on the extent of the litter duty, and includes standards and practicability issues to assist rail undertakers and operators in managing litter and refuse on their land.

	<p pid="a.1319W.6/5">Waste collection authorities have a duty under Section 45(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to arrange for the collection of commercial waste where requested to do so. We are consulting on whether local authorities should have a wider role with regards to commercial waste, including strategic planning for all waste and the provision of recycling services for business waste. In light of this we will be considering whether there is a need to place further requirements on local authorities, including setting local authority targets aimed at improving the management of commercial waste.

	<p pid="a.1322W.5/1">Defra recognise the challenge that all local authorities in England face in meeting their statutory performance standards in recycling and composting and their obligations under the landfill allowance trading scheme. Accordingly, we are providing increased levels of support and funding to all types of authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1322W.5/2">Rural areas benefit, in common with all other local authorities, from the wide range of support available through the Waste Implementation Programme and the Waste Resources Action Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1322W.5/3">We recognise that different types of local authorities face different challenges in waste management. It is for this reason that Defra-funded pilot projects aim to cover as diverse a range of local authorities as possible, including those in rural areas. Examples include Defra's household incentives pilot scheme, aimed at encouraging recycling, and trials of kerbside collection of waste batteries, funded by the Waste and Resources Action Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1329W.2/1">In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, the UK held discussions with the United States, France, Germany and other donors about meeting the relief and reconstruction needs of the affected countries. According to United Nations' figures, the United States pledged some $351 million to the relief effort, of which it has committed over $134 million, France pledged $61 million of which $26 million has been committed and Germany pledged $129 million and has committed the whole pledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/2">The relief phase was very well funded, and many government pledges were made before the full extent of the world's generous and unprecedented response was known. Private commitments alone exceeded $4 billion. Funds that were not committed in the relief phase may have been made available for reconstruction support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.2/3">The UK has continued to discuss the ongoing response with other donors. Sufficient funds are, however, only one of the constraints to meeting the needs of those most affected by the tsunami.</p>

	<p pid="a.1329W.5/1">Tackling corruption is a priority for DFID. We are working closely with Transparency International and other development partners to gain a better understanding of the true scale and impact of corruption in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.5/2">Transparency International is an important advocate in the fight against corruption, having helped to raise public awareness and create pressure for action. The Transparency International Corruption Perception Index is widely credited for putting the issue of corruption on the international agenda and its global corruption barometer is a useful tool for assessing the perceptions of the public in the sixty countries where it has undertaken research. It also publishes valuable information in its annual global corruption report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.5/3">The comparative indices produced by Transparency International, which aggregate perception-based information, cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the level of corruption in particular countries. These indices are therefore only one element of the information gathered by DFID to analyse the nature and impact of corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1329W.5/4">DFID supports Transparency International's work and since 2001 has contributed over &pound;1 million to its International Secretariat and to 11 of its national chapters (in country offices).</p>

	<p pid="a.1334W.3/1">In April 2005, DFID funded the NGO Forest Trends, in co-operation with the World Agroforestry Centre (formerly ICRAF), to produce a report: 'Navigating the Border: An Analysis of the China-Myanmar Timber Trade'. In addition, Her Majesty's Government officials were consulted on the October 2005 Global Witness Report: A Choice for China: Ending the destruction of Burma's frontier forests&quot;. We believe that the analysis of the trade and its impact contained in these reports is broadly accurate. They report that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.3/2">China imported 1.3 million m <sup>3</sup> of timber from Burma in 2003, almost 60 per cent. of total world imports of Burmese timber. In financial terms this equates to illegal timber exports worth $250 million to $300 million annually across the border from northern Burma to China's Yunnan province. Global Witness estimate that two-thirds of Burma's total revenue from timber exports came from illegal trade, mostly with China, and that more than 100 Chinese timber companies and 20,000 Chinese loggers are involved in the trade inside Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.3/3">In Burma, logging is having an adverse effect on both the local population and the environment. Deforestation has caused localised flooding, drought and resulting crop failure, the disappearance of wild animals and birdlife associated with the forests. Local people in Burma derive little direct financial benefit from the logging industry and are frequently worse off as a result of the presence of Chinese logging companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.3/4">In China, the increased concentration of logging firms and workers along the Yunnan-Burma border has meant that the timber buyers on China's eastern seaboard largely bypass inland Yunnan and procure materials directly on the border. The recent wave of migration to the Yunnan-Burma border has, in some areas, led to a visible increase in gambling, drugs and commercial sex work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.3/5">In March 2006, in response to these reports, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry took the unusual step of admitting that some of its companies and individual citizens are involved in illegal logging in Burma, and said the Government were paying high attention&quot; to the problem and requests the Chinese companies and individuals to abide by local laws and regulations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1334W.3/6">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have funded follow-up work by Global Witness to identify 'Opportunities for Action' with recommendations for the Burmese Government, Burmese civil society and international community, which should also be considered in the framework of the EU's commitment to fight against illegal logging worldwide as part of the FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade) process. The Commission have made a proposal for 'voluntary partnerships' with producer countries to identify legal logs for import into the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.1336W.5/1">The UK recognises the severity of the current humanitarian situation in Somalia and the risks of further deterioration. The most pessimistic predictions, however, including famine, are only likely if the 2006 long rains fail. Fortunately these have now started and are continuing well. So far we see malnutrition and mortality rates that are high but not yet catastrophic, and some of the predicted drought enforced migrations that had been envisaged have not taken place. This is likely to be, at least in part, due to the efforts of the relief agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336W.5/2">The UK is one of the leading donors to humanitarian response in Somalia and provided one of the first contributions to the World Food Programme (WFP) food aid operation in December 2005. Since then, we have contributed over &pound;12 million to the WFP, the International Committee of the Red Cross, to other UN agencies and non- governmental organisations to deal with the humanitarian crisis there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336W.5/3">We continue to follow developments closely. It will be some time, however, before the rains result in better conditions and prospects for people in the worst effected areas. Indeed, the immediate effect on weakened human and livestock populations may be increased risks for example from water-borne disease and flooding, and interruptions to the supply of relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338W.4/1">The Code for Crown Prosecutors gives guidance on the general principles to be applied when making decisions about prosecutions. In addition, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has a code of conduct, job descriptions and person specifications so that managers and staff know what is expected of them. The CPS is also in the process of rolling-out a professional skills and valued behaviour framework, which will further underline and specify the performance standards required of staff. In the event of an apparent failure to deliver to the necessary standard, it is for line management to identify the causes and to take action, whether on grounds of capability or conduct, using the appropriate employment procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1343W.2/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is making good progress in improving public awareness and public confidence in its work. A communication strategy has been developed to improve public awareness of the CPS's role in prosecuting crime. The strategy includes proactively engaging with the media; working with other criminal justice system agencies on communication initiatives; improving stakeholder engagement; and promoting the CPS's vision of becoming a world-class prosecution authority. Greater awareness is important in raising public confidence in the CPS. The latest British Crime Survey report on policing and confidence, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>, suggests that public satisfaction with the CPS's work has increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.1343W.2/2">Chief Crown Prosecutors (CCPs), in charge of each of the CPS's 42 areas, are locally responsible for improving public awareness and confidence in the CPS. CCPs report to the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the Chief Executive. Progress is also assessed by the independent CPS Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1343W.2/3">At a national level the Director of Business Development has responsibility for improving public awareness of the CPS and the Director of Finance, has responsibility for improving public confidence in the Service. Both report to the Chief Executive.</p>

	<p pid="a.1350W.2/1">Between January 2003 and December 2005 inclusive, 1,551 UK service personnel who had served in Iraq on Operation Telic were subsequently assessed by the Defence medical services as suffering from a mental health disorder. This represents around 1.5 per cent. of total UK service personnel deployed to the region during the same period. Of those 1,551 personnel, 208 were assessed as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. A further 696 personnel were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder, which will include some who have post traumatic symptoms not amounting to full PTSD but with some symptoms of post traumatic stress. Other personnel were diagnosed with a range of other mental health conditions, including mood and neurotic disorders, and psychoactive substance misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.2/2">Figures on the total number of personnel treated following service in Iraq for physical injuries sustained in theatre are not collated centrally. Nor is it possible, for example, to break down the medical evacuation figure given in my previous answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-02-02.704W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 704&ndash;05W</phrase>, because the database which records the data does not contain information on treatment received after evacuation. Complete information on medical treatment could only be compiled from personal medical records which are held by individual unit commands. These can only be viewed for non-clinical reasons with the express consent of the individual concerned, to protect patient confidentiality. I cannot therefore give a figure for the total number of personnel treated following service in Iraq for physical injuries sustained in theatre.</p>

	<p pid="a.1355W.0/1">Under the Communications Act 2003, Ofcom is responsible for the licensing of television licensable content services and section 235(3) of the Act sets out the criteria for doing so. Section 18 of the Broadcasting Act 1996 (as amended by paragraph 90 of Part 2 of Schedule 15 to the 2003 Act), sets out the criteria for Ofcom's licensing of digital programme services. Essentially, Ofcom can refuse the application only if precluded from granting it because they consider that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to hold a licence; by the rules on media ownership; or (in the case of a television licensable content service) if they are satisfied that the service would involve a breach of the programme standards or fairness and privacy codes under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/2">Having obtained a licence for the service, the licence holder then has to enter into a contractual agreement with a platform operator. Current platform operators are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/3" class="indent">Digital Terrestrial Television Multiplexes: Digital 3 and 4 Ltd; SDN Ltd; BBC Free to View Ltd.; and National Grid Wireless plc</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/4" class="indent">Cable Television: Telewest; ntl; and Wight Cable</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/5" class="indent">Satellite Television: BSkyB plc</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/6">The price and conditions for carriage on a digital platform are based on contractual negotiations and subject to Ofcom regulation on certain aspects of the terms on which platform operators give access to programme service providers (in particular, to prevent discrimination). Further details are available from Ofcom. There is no right of appeal under broadcasting legislation if an application for a licence is refused, but there is the possibility of judicial review. Ofcom can consider a complaint if an operator refuses to carry channels on a platform if, for example, that is a breach of the operator's licence in the case of a multiplex, or if it raises an issue under competition law or the EU laws regulating access to platforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.0/7">The Government does not have a role to play in the licensing of broadcast services. Nor does it have a role in relation to the contractual agreements between service providers and platform operators, except in the limited case of must-carry&quot; arrangements on cable TV services under section 64 of the Communications Act 2003, but no must-carry obligations are currently in force.</p>

	<p pid="a.1355W.3/1">There are no DCMS set targets for public libraries in these areas. However, by their very nature, public libraries are institutions that are safe, neutral and welcoming to all and most of the services they provide are free. Provisional DCMS adult participation data showed, for example, that adults from black and ethnic minority backgrounds had higher rates of attendance at public libraries than those from white ethnic backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1355W.3/2">In addition, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), one of DCMS's sponsored bodies, is leading on work to develop impact measures to encourage improved provision to whole communities including, for example, those who rely on home library services. This is in addition to the MLA's advice to library staff on matters such as addressing access and equal opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1359W.2/1">During 2005&ndash;06 one full peer review was undertaken, of Arts Council England (ACE), plus a one-day follow-up review of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA). The purpose of peer review is to take an independent, strategic view of an organisation's effectiveness and capacity, in order to help that organisation improve its performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.2/2">The terms of reference and the report of the ACE peer review can be found on the ACE website <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/peerreview">www.artscouncil.org.uk/peerreview</a>. The conclusions of the review will be taken into account in drawing up the funding agreement between DCMS and Arts Council England for the 2006&ndash;08 period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.2/3">The MLA follow-up review concluded that the MLA had made considerable progress towards implementing the recommendations of the original peer review, but that MLA and DCMS would have to work together closely to deliver the full, challenging agenda. The peer review conclusions underpin the current funding agreement between DCMS and MLA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1360W.5/1">UK Sport's total allocation of &pound;4.817 million to the sport of shooting between 2006&ndash;9, announced in April, is based on its investment model which calculates how many athletes should be supported at each stage of the performance pathway in order to deliver a potential number of medals in that sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.5/2">The allocation per athlete is calculated according to a number of criteria, including the cost of training in the UK and the cost of training and competing abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.5/3">These costs have been averaged across all the sports, which means that each national governing body has some flexibility about how it allocates the funding to its athletes, while being required to deliver against a set of agreed milestones.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.5/4">Great Britain Target Shooting Federation, the national governing body, in discussion with UK Sport, is in the process of planning precisely how it will spend its allocation across the world class talent, development and podium programmes.

	<p pid="a.1360W.5/5">However, for those high performance athletes on UK sport's world class performance programme over the course of the Athens cycle (2001&ndash;05), we understand that target shooting spent approximately &pound;375,000 on funding the cost of training and competing abroad. UK Sport estimate that the cost of overseas training alone was in the region of &pound;155,000.</p>

The TPS scheme provides protection to consumers from cold calling if they have previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or have been registered with the TPS for at least 28 days. Those making cold calls from within the UK or on behalf of UK companies from outside the European Union are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS list. However, cold calls from non-UK companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the TSP scheme, as the companies and products have no link with the UK.

	<p pid="a.1364W.2/2">New powers will be introduced to allow the commission greater flexibility in the enforcement of public duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1364W.2/3">The Equality Act (S.10) confers a duty on the CEHR to encourage good practice and promote understanding of the importance of good relations between members of different groups and between members of groups and others. The CEHR will have a responsibility to work towards the elimination of prejudice against, hatred of and hostility towards members of groups, enabling all individuals to participate in society.

	<p pid="a.1364W.2/5">Extremism while not directly within the remit of the CEHR may be a by-product of poor relations between communities and associated with hate crime. Consequently work to strengthen the bonds between different groups will contribute to our efforts in combating it.</p>

This reflects the historical origins of the good relations&quot; duty, which the Commission for Racial Equality is required to promote. The CEHR is uniquely placed to build bridges between different communities&mdash;this work will build on the CRE's local race equality work, undertaken through the network of race equality councils and others.</p>

	<p pid="a.1365W.0/2">Section 121<i>(c)</i> of the Companies Act 1985 permits a company to convert any or all of its paid up shares into stock, and reconvert that stock into paid-up shares of any denomination. There are no available figures on the number of existing registered companies that have used this procedure. However, the ability to convert shares into stock is believed to be obsolete.</p>

	<p pid="a.1365W.3/2">The information requested is not available. The only authoritative source we would have for information of this sort is through the number of filings of accounts made by medium-sized companies with the Registrar of Companies. A medium-sized company is defined for the purposes of special accounting provisions of the Companies Act 1985 as a company that satisfies at least two of three requirements: turnover of not more than &pound;22.8 million, balance sheet total of not more than &pound;11.4 million, and number of employees totalling not more than 250. Such companies can take advantage of certain accounting and reporting exemptions in the accounts and reports they prepare for members and file with the Registrar of Companies. However, public (including public listed) companies are excluded from these special provisions, and, so, cannot qualify to file as medium-sized. Since no public companies can file medium-sized accounts with the Registrar, it is not possible to estimate the proportion of medium-sized companies that are public companies.</p>

Within the current work stream the NCC has three projects relating specifically to financial inclusion&mdash;improvements to basic bank accounts; increasing choice and appropriateness in payment methods for essential services; and extending access to affordable credit.

The cost of the decommissioning and clean up of the NDA's sites is calculated by means of Life Cycle Baselines&mdash;which are long-term plans providing a detailed assessment of the scope, methodology, and time scale of proposed site activities, including the cost of its commercial operations. Based on the 2005&ndash;06 Life Cycle Baselines the NDA has estimated the undiscounted cost of delivering its mission at &pound;62.7 billion at current prices. This is the figure given in its strategy. But the NDA has also identified a potential further &pound;7.5 billion of costs that will need to be included in future Life Cycle Baselines. Information on Life Cycle Baselines and the long-term funding of the NDA's mission is available on its website <a href="http://www.nda.gov.uk">www.nda.gov.uk</a></p>

In general, the price a retailer sets for a product or service is a matter for its own commercial judgment. The OFT has an enforcement role under the Competition Act 1998, if it has reasonable grounds to suspect that prices are arrived at by an arrangement contrary to chapter I, or reflect an abuse of a dominant position within a market contrary to chapter II.</p>

	<p pid="a.1380W.2/1">The Government are committed to encouraging the exercise of share ownership rights. That is why we have already required all quoted companies to seek shareholder approval for the directors' remuneration report, and continue to support the work of the Shareholder Voting Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.2/2">The Company Law Reform Bill builds on this by including provisions to ensure that voting processes are more transparent and that companies can enable indirect investors to enjoy or exercise various governance rights. In addition, the registered shareholder will have the right to appoint more than one proxy, thus enabling indirect investors acting as proxies to exercise all the meeting participation rights of the registered shareholder.</p>

	<p pid="a.1380W.8/1">The Technology and Engineering in Schools Strategy (TESS) was initiated by Lord Sainsbury in 2005 and is a programme through which the engineering community has agreed to work together to provide better coordinated support for the promotion of engineering and technology in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/2">It is led by the Royal Academy of Engineering and involves the engineering institutions and other bodies active in promoting engineering and technology to schools at a national level. Membership currently comprises: The Royal Academy of Engineering, the Office of Science and Innovation, the G15 of Engineering Institutions, the ETB (and, through ETB, its Business and Industry Panel), SETNET, the BA, The Institute of Physics, The Association of Science Educators, The Learning Grid.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/3">The TESS mission is to give every primary and secondary school in the UK, regardless of geography or local circumstances, equal access to a good number of quality-approved, high impact, coordinated schemes in engineering and technology related education. This will be achieved by the coordination of existing national-scale engineering and technology education schemes that deliver curriculum enrichment and/or teacher CPD. It will cover the promotion of engineering, the provision of information and the delivery of educational enrichment activities in engineering and technology to young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/4">The TESS strategy was agreed in late November 2005 and the TESS project was initiated early in 2006. There has been no formal assessment of its achievements to date. The project has included wide consultation with the engineering community and with the science institutions has been followed by the development of an implementation plan to deliver the first phase of TESS by September 2006. This will be a directory of approved schemes in engineering and technology and a methodology for colleagues in science to customise and build upon. The approval process for schemes will be transparent, draw on existing best practice, be based on a set of criteria agreed by the TESS Steering Group, and any national engineering and technology scheme will be free to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/5">The Engineering Education Alliance (EEA) was formed in March 2002 following consultation with the engineering institutions and related organisations to provide a forum for coordinating information on education and skills initiatives related to engineering and technology. As of February 2006 membership of the EEA consisted of the following organisations:</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/6">Association of Cost Engineers, British Computer Society, The British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing, Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, Engineering Council (UK), Energy Institute, Engineering Professors' Council, Engineering and Technology Board, Institution of Agricultural Engineers, Institution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Chemical Engineers, The Institute of Cast Metals Engineers, Institution of Engineering Designers, Institution of Engineering and Technology, Institution of Fire Engineers, Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers, The Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estate Management, Institute of Highway Incorporated Engineers, Institution of Lighting Engineers, Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications, Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Institute of Measurement and Control, The Institution of Nuclear Engineers, Institute of Acoustics, The Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining, Institute of Physics, Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, The Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering, Institution of Structural Engineers, Institution of Water Officers, Royal Academy of Engineering, Royal Aeronautical Society, The Royal Institution of Naval Architects, Science Engineering Technology Mathematics Network, Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, The Welding Institute.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/7">The aims of the EEA are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/8" class="indent">Provide a regular forum where the engineering institutions and professional affiliates can meet to exchange views and knowledge with the aim of developing common cause in promoting engineering and technology in schools, colleges and universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/9" class="indent">Seek to influence the simplification of the engineering 'message' such that it becomes more effective in schools, FE and HE.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/10" class="indent">Support and endorse effective activities that communicate a consistent and clear message to young people about engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/11" class="indent">Help to make engineering and technology initiatives in schools, colleges and universities fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/12" class="indent">Support and endorse key activities that enhance the perception of engineering and technology among parents, teachers and careers advisors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/13" class="indent">Work closely with other bodies that already play a directional, influential and valuable role in the education sector (e.g. DfES and QCA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/14" class="indent">Liaise, advise and provide effective support for teachers thus enabling them to improve the engineering, scientific, mathematical, design and technology skills of young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/15" class="indent">Provide opportunities for ad-hoc groups to be established as part of the Alliance, which might focus on specific activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/16" class="indent">Seek to influence and support existing bodies and networks rather than create a 'rival' body.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/17" class="indent">Provide and develop an EEA publicly accessible website that enables the engineering and technology and education communities to communicate with each other and promulgate their collective activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/18">There has been no formal assessment of the EEA's achievements to date. It has completed two projects. The first (March to October 2003) was to research and publish a set of criteria to be used in assessing the many initiatives and externally initiated projects involving the promotion of 'engineering' in schools. These published guidelines were particularly aimed at those within the Science, Design and Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) community who are considering developing, or assessing for continuation, any STEM activity which seeks to involve schools, teachers or pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.8/19">The second EEA project completed its first phase in late 2005 and is about simplifying the engineering message and making entry into the profession more user- friendly. EEA members produced recommendations on how to increase the number of well-qualified and motivated entrants to engineering and identified key barriers to entry and how these should be tackled. This was published the EEA report Entry to the world of engineering&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1384W.3/1">The Department of Trade and Industry was actively involved in the European Commission's consideration of provisional anti-dumping measures on footwear with leather uppers from China and Vietnam. Given the likelihood that measures would be implemented, Ministers and officials sought to ensure that the Commission took account of the concerns of the full range of stakeholders, not just those EU producers who had filed the initial complaint. In so doing, the UK successfully agreed for the exclusion of children's footwear and special technology athletic footwear from the measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.3/2">The Government have made no representations on imports of furniture from Asia, nor is it aware of any discussions between the Commission and member states on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384W.3/3">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State has met Peter Mandelson, the European Trade Commissioner, on several occasions over the last 12 months, to discuss the current Doha Development Agenda, including ways to secure an ambitious pro-development outcome to which the UK is fully committed.</p>

The NDA is considering the scope for extending the life of Wylfa beyond 2010&mdash;which is the planned closure date given in its approved strategy. The NDA has advised me that in light of factors such as the age of the plant, related safety concerns, and the closure of associated fuel processing facilities at Sellafield such an extension is highly unlikely.</p>

This will help dispel the myth about the link between sorcery&quot; and HIV, and will contribute to longer-term improvement of children's rights. To address the issue of HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UK has funded behaviour change communications campaigns and the distribution of millions of condoms.

Reports suggest that Baha'is have been subjected to harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrest and a hostile campaign in the media.

The Iranian constitution recognises the Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian communities, but not others such as the Baha'is. We receive many reports of discrimination against those wishing to practise these faiths. The position of people who have converted from Islam appears to be especially difficult. We have made clear to the Iranian authorities that we believe that persecution of individuals on the grounds of their religious beliefs is unacceptable.

With France and Germany we have been at the forefront of efforts to encourage Iran to take steps that would create confidence that the intentions of its nuclear programme are solely peaceful.

We strongly supported the statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase> by the President of the Security Council, calling on Iran to take the steps the IAEA Board has deemed essential. We will now be consulting other Security Council members on what further action the Council should take, following the IAEA Director-General's <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase> report on Iranian compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1397W.5/1">Respect for democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law are principles which form the foundation for UK and EU co-operation with Moldova. They are also principles to which Moldova is committed through its participation in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and other international organisations. Moldova has made some progress towards becoming a functioning democracy, with active opposition parties represented in Parliament. However, the OSCE's Office for Democracy and Institution for Human Rights identified a number of shortcomings in the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections, including obstruction of the opposition's campaign. Recent reports have also raised concerns about interference by the Moldovan authorities in the work of opposition political parties. Through the EU troika, we have raised our concerns about these issues, most recently with the Moldovan Foreign Minister at the EU-Moldova Co-operation Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>. We will continue to monitor Moldova's progress towards meeting its democratic commitments, including through the European Neighbourhood Policy, which offers Moldova the opportunity to achieve its ambition of closer relations with the EU, subject to progress on internal reform.</p>

The figure of 36 was based on a preliminary list compiled by officials that had not yet been checked with the lead departments responsible for the legislation in question. That checking process revealed the lower final figure given in the follow-up reply to the hon.

The initial list identified two cases which should have been included in the previous report for January to June and one that had been included in error which had already been covered in the previous report. Other adjustments were needed, for example, to remove items which had in fact received clearance before agreement. The details of the overrides for the period July to December 2005 have now been sent to the European Scrutiny Committee. A copy of that letter has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1403W.2/1">At major airports, Border Control has staff deployed to meet all services requiring immigration control. At smaller airports, resources are deployed on an intelligence led risk basis to deal with passengers who require leave to enter. The IAN Act 2006 provides additional powers to deal more effectively with people posing a threat to border security, including the capture of data on passengers and fingerprinting of those detained. The Border Management Programme ensures that the three border agencies (HMRC, UKIS and the Police) work more closely together to maximise border security while minimising the impact on legitimate traffic. MATRA groups (Multi Agency Threat and Risk Assessment Group) at airports bring together border agencies, operators and carriers to identify and assess risks to general security and put in place action plans in order to counter any potential threats. e-Borders is a multi agency programme to harness passenger information and use new technology to provide more effective border controls. Project Semaphore, as part of the e-Borders programme, is further strengthening the border through the use of an advance passenger information processing system and the adoption of a proactive intelligence led approach.</p>

However, cases where an individual claims to be at risk of persecution due to a faith conversion can raise sensitive issues where there are doubts about the genuineness of the conversion.

Guidance such as Your business: Keep crime out of it&quot; and Putting Crime Out Of Business&quot; give practical information to help businesses identify security risks and take measures to reduce crime. They are available on the crime reduction website (<a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/businesscrimeminisite01.htm">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/businesscrimeminisite01.htm</a>) and include advice on the safe storage of building materials and security of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1406W.2/2">General crime prevention advice is also available from the police on individual force websites and more detailed crime prevention advice can be obtained by visiting local police stations.</p>

A dedicated team deals with the allocation of family accommodation and every effort is made to accommodate families in one location throughout their stay, usually at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre.</p>

In many cases such jurisdiction is adopted where there is a consensus that action needs to be taken at the international level. Such offending includes terrorism, genocide, war crimes, hijacking, serious corruption, sex tourism and trafficking in human beings. Where extra-territorial jurisdiction is assumed it is often restricted to offences committed by UK nationals abroad.</p>

After the transitional period (which is expected to be for two years) the expectation would be that most police authorities would have no more than 23 members, although a higher number may be appropriate in the case of a new Yorkshire-wide police authority given to need to ensure that all upper tier local authorities in the region have at least one seat on the police authority.

De-activated firearms have been excluded from the definition of realistic firearm, as have imitations of firearms designed before 1870.

	<p pid="a.1439W.2/1">The global nature of the causes and effects of climate change means that international action is crucial. The measures in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech to the UN ambassadors highlight how co-ordinated international action can bring significant emissions reductions. These proposals aim to drive forward effective multilateral action. In particular, the Multilateral Development Banks' Energy Investment Framework, and an extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Clean Development Mechanism will have significant impacts in reducing global emissions, encouraging the development of a deeper and more liquid global carbon market. However, details of these proposals have not yet been finalised with international partners and institutions, so an assessment of their impact would be premature. Action is also needed to tackle greenhouse gas emissions from consumers, and the 1 Watt initiative which the Chancellor proposed has significant potential to reduce global emissions and should be accelerated.</p>

(67043)</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.2/4" class="indent">The table attached provides the information you have requested. The most recent population estimates for wards are for mid-2002. The ward population estimates have been published with the status of experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore the estimates should be treated with some care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.2/5" class="indent">The latest available ward electorate counts are for December 2005. The ward electorate counts are for parliamentary electors, including attainers. Local government electorate counts are not available at ward level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.2/6" class="indent">It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.2/7" class="indent">The latest available ward patient register counts are for July 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1440W.2/8" class="indent">It should be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons. Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

	<p pid="a.1441W.2/1">During the period in question, the Treasury has not paid any grants directly to voluntary organisations or local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1441W.2/2">However, the Treasury oversees the allocation of resources from the Invest to Save Budget (ISB), which was established in 1998. The Treasury transfers resources to the relevant central Government sponsoring Department, who then allocate it directly to the delivery organisations. There have been eight rounds of resource allocation since this time. The first round was restricted to central Government Departments and their agencies; each subsequent round has been open to local authorities and the voluntary sector. In 2004, the ISB was re-branded as the 'ISB: Inclusive Communities Fund', with priority given to community level, voluntary sector-led initiatives. In total, some &pound;97 million has been allocated to voluntary sector-led community projects since 1998. The Budget announced that a 9th resource allocation round would take place next year, with a focus on the third sector's role in building fairer communities and delivering public services. Further information about the ISB is available from <a href="http://www.isb.gov.uk">www.isb.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1447W.5/1">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed at the United Nations Millennium summit in September 2000. The goals range from halving global income poverty and protecting the environment, to human development objectives like improving health and sanitation, achieving universal primary education and tackling discrimination against women. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been placed at the centre of Britain's international development effort. DFID's key aims and objectives, as set out in its public service agreement, are the attainment of the MDGs by 2015.</p>

The international community committed to raise an additional $50 billion of aid by 2010, to cancel 100 per cent. of the multilateral debts of the world's poorest countries, and to launch the international finance facility for immunisation. G8 leaders also agreed to achieve universal access to AIDS treatment for all those who need it by 2010, and work on advance market commitments for vaccines against malaria, HIV/AIDS and other priority diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/5">These are the sorts of measures needed to get progress towards the MDGs back on track. The key challenge now is for donors to fully implement their commitments and for developing countries to develop 10-year plans to meet the MDGs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.8/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-02">2 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question to ask what the average earnings of full-time employees in a) Cleethorpes, b) Great Grimsby, c) Scunthorpe and d) Brigg and Goole constituencies was in each year since 2000. (67053)</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/4" class="indent">Average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for full time employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/5" class="indent">I attach tables showing Average Gross Weekly Earnings by parliamentary constituency for the years 2000 to 2005 for Full Time Employees on Adult Rates. These statistics are already published on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=13101">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=13101</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1454W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is currently working in partnership with four Local Authorities (LAs) to investigate whether there are local data sources that could be used to assist the compilation of the nationally produced population estimates. The four LAs are Barnet, Derby, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham and Welwyn Hatfield. These authorities were selected from four groupings of LAs which each scored highly on different characteristics associated with difficulties in estimating population accurately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1454W.2/5" class="indent">Initial meetings were held with the four selected LAs in December 2005 and January 2006. At these meetings each of the LAs agreed to work with ONS to gain a better understanding of how they use the population estimates, what other local information and data sources they use, what particular issues affect population estimates within their LA and what methods and local data sources they use to overcome these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1454W.2/6" class="indent">A further round of meetings is currently under way to review progress and a final round of meetings will be held at the end of the studies in summer 2006. ONS will review the findings to see if any improvements can be applied to the mid-year population estimates processes or quality assurance procedures, either for all LAs or for groups of LAs. ONS will publish the outcome of the studies and evaluate their success, including a review of the criteria and approach for selecting LAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1454W.2/7" class="indent">ONS has been reporting progress to LAs more generally, and providing them with the opportunity to feed into the IMPS project, primarily through meetings of the Central and Local Government Information Partnership (CLIP).</p>

	<p pid="a.1455W.8/1">Estimates of the level of missing trader intra-community (MTIC) VAT fraud for the years 2000&ndash;01 to 2004&ndash;05 were published at PBR 2005 in Measuring Indirect Tax Losses&mdash;2005, a copy of which is available from the House of Commons Library. Estimates for 2005&ndash;06 will be published at PBR 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/2">The Government remain determined to tackle MTIC VAT fraud, and the criminals perpetrating it, and a comprehensive strategy involving both operational and legislative measures has been developed. As announced at PBR 2005, this strategy has been strengthened further to counter changes in the fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/3">The operational strategy is designed to identify, disrupt and prevent the fraud and involves targeting the key players involved. It includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/4" class="indent">risk-based controls designed to identify and prevent bogus businesses from registering for VAT;</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/5" class="indent">a fast-track deregistration process for those who enter the VAT system and trade fraudulently;</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/6" class="indent">international co-operation, including sharing intelligence, investigating cases and developing strategic approaches;</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/7" class="indent">frontier activity, including the use of scanning technology to better identify goods involved in the fraud;</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/8" class="indent">a litigation strategy, including criminal prosecutions, designed to increase the risks for the fraudsters, and civil litigation designed to increase the financial risks for others who choose to be involved with the fraud; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/9" class="indent">refusing repayment claims where the business has knowledge of VAT fraud in the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/10">Three legislative measures have also been introduced in the Finance Bill to further strengthen the tools available to HMRC to tackle the fraud:</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/11" class="indent">As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>, the Government have applied to the European Commission for a derogation to introduce a different VAT accounting procedure (known as a reverse charge) for certain goods most commonly subject to MTIC fraud. An enabling provision in the Finance Bill will allow this to be implemented as soon as the approval is granted. This will significantly limit the scope for the fraud to be perpetrated in those goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/12" class="indent">The second measure clarifies that the existing right of HMRC officers to inspect goods for VAT purposes includes the right to record the details of any goods inspected, and evidence of that inspection, by, for example, scanning the barcode.</p>
	<p pid="a.1455W.8/13" class="indent">The third measure will allow HMRC to direct individual businesses to keep specified additional records where there is an identified risk of fraud. HMRC will apply these requirements in a closely targeted manner.</p>
