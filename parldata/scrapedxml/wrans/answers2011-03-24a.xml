	<p pid="a.1211W.12/2">The Cabinet Office acquired responsibility for policy on the conduct of certain statutory elections in June 2010. Prior to that policy sat with the Ministry of Justice and its predecessor Department, the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA): policy on UK-wide elections moved to the DCA in June 2003 with the policy for local elections following in 2005. Prior to June 2003 elections policy sat with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (now the Department for Communities and Local Government). From 2001 the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions had this responsibility. Before 2000, it rested with the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.1213W.2/2">I have today placed details of allocations made so far to individual authorities in the Library of the House. These reflect our success in un-ringfencing and simplifying funding streams-the Government are rolling around &#163;4 billion of grants in 2010-11 into the unhypothecated formula grant by 2014-15, and the number of separate core grants for local government reduces from over 90 to fewer than 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.1213W.2/3">The total of grant funding allocated directly from this Department to all local and fire authorities in 2010-11 so far is &#163;28.3 billion revenue and &#163;0.639 billion capital. The total allocated so far in 2011-12 is &#163;25.2 billion revenue and &#163;0.248 billion capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.1213W.2/4">These figures do not provide the basis for a like-for-like comparison of the change in funding between the two years because (a) we do not yet have the full picture of funding for 2011-12, with more announcements to be made; and (b) there have been changes in methodology between the two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1213W.2/5">For example, the 2010-11 private finance initiative revenue funding includes allocations made by this Department on behalf of other Government Departments. From 2011-12, each Department will provide revenue funding from its own Departmental Expenditure Limit to support private finance initiative schemes relating to services for which it has policy responsibility. Therefore, the figures for private finance initiative funding 2011-12 only cover the allocations in respect of schemes for which this Department has responsibility. As a result, the figures imply there has been a &#163;766 million reduction, when there has actually been an increase in private finance initiative revenue funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1213W.2/6">A better measure of the impact on local authorities is changes to revenue spending power published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-31">31 January 2011</phrase>. We have made sure that no local authority will see a reduction in spending power of more than 8.8% in either 2011-12 or 2012-13. This information is available on our website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1222W.11/1">I do not consider that there is merit in a change from the current arrangements in favour of stricter liability. The general principle in considering negligence is that the victim needs to prove that the defendant's actions caused the accident. It would be an anomaly if this was changed for collisions with pedestrians and cyclists. Also, it could lead to unfair results in cases where the motorist is driving entirely responsibly and the accident is caused by the irresponsible or negligent behaviour of a cyclist or pedestrian.</p>

	<p pid="a.1227W.11/2">The National Crime Recording Standards and Home Office Counting Rules require Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) to record all crimes committed or alleged to have been committed on the Ministry of Defence (MOD) estate. On receipt of these allegations MDP will assess them on their merit and will either investigate the allegation themselves, or pass them to the appropriate law enforcement agency to undertake any further investigation they deem necessary in accordance with the relevant policing protocol.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.11/3">The MDP has actively promoted a number of crime reduction initiatives throughout the MOD. One such initiative is the &quot;office watch&quot; scheme, which encourages the safeguarding of MOD offices and MOD property by raising awareness of staff, in relation to their own and others' personal property, as well as property of the MOD. The MDP also have 81 Defence Community Police Officers (DCPOs), who are trained crime reduction officers working in MOD establishments across the country. These officers provide an effective deterrent to potential criminals, by raising the awareness of staff, service personnel, service families and contractors. At sites where there are no trained MDP crime reduction personnel present, all staff, and also contractors and visitors, are encouraged to work together to make their places of employment and homes safer and more secure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1231W.6/1">It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Most parents prefer to take their children with them abroad, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.6/2">So it is longstanding practice that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet their potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK where staff choose this, or are obliged to do so given local conditions in the country to which they are posted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.6/3">FCO staff who are required to work at our diplomatic missions overseas may claim financial assistance towards UK boarding school costs for their children, provided that they meet specific eligibility criteria. The FCO refunds standard term fees up to a ceiling which is reviewed annually and determined by an independent survey conducted by ECA International, which is used by public and private sector employers whose staff work across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.6/4">During the academic year 2009-10, 339 officers received Continuity of Education Allowance for 521 children. This represents about 6% of staff employed in the FCO and FCO Services (a trading fund for which the FCO is responsible). The average sum paid by the FCO per child in FY 2009-10 was &#163;17,342. The median figure was &#163;17,008. Three-quarters of the recipients are below the senior management grade in the FCO (equivalent to the SCS), including junior support staff and single parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1231W.6/5">More than half the children for whom Continuity of Education Allowance is paid are of secondary school age, when continuity is particularly important in the key two year GCSE and A-level course periods. The figures include the cost of low to moderate special needs support where required. This provision is benchmarked against the provision at School Action and School Action Plus in the state school sector. The figures do not include the cost of the education provided by the FCO for one child with severe learning difficulties.</p>

The west bank's economy grew at 7.2% in 2009; however, much of this growth was derived from higher Government spending and international aid rather than from exports, which fell in that period.

	<p pid="a.1239W.8/1">The June 2010 Budget announced the requirement for lone parents to prepare for and seek work as a condition of receiving benefits would be extended from those with a youngest child aged seven or over, to those with a youngest child aged five or over. We estimated in the recent impact assessment 'Conditionality Measures in the 2011 Welfare Reform Bill' that the change will help 20,000 to 25,000 extra lone parents into work in steady state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.8/2">There are a number of flexibilities in the job search requirements for lone parents, to cater for different needs and personal circumstances. For example, lone parents may limit the hours they are available for work to a minimum of 16 hours a week based on their caring responsibilities. In addition, those with children aged 12 or under have the right to restrict their availability for work to their children's normal school hours. Evidence suggests that lone parents use a range of, and a mixture of formal and informal child care, some of which are state-funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.8/3">Given these factors, we are not able to precisely estimate the additional child care that lone parents will use as a result of the policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.8/4">However, we estimate that the policy will increase expenditure on tax credits and in-work credit by &#163;240 million over the spending review period to March 2015, of which around 80% can be attributed to tax credits. This includes the child care element of the working tax credit, based on an assumed child care expenditure across all lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1239W.8/5">This does not take account of any changes introduced as a result of universal credit, in 2013-14, although we have committed to overall expenditure on child care at least equivalent to that in the present system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1240W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many parents called the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission Options Service in 2009-10; how many went on to make or change a private maintenance arrangement; how many went on to make Child Support Agency (CSA) arrangements; and how many made neither a private arrangement nor a CSA arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.2/5" class="indent">In the 12 months to March 2010, the Child Maintenance Options service answered 142,601 inbound calls from 73,769 unique clients. It also made 143,889 successful outbound calls to 135,188 unique clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.2/6" class="indent">The Child Maintenance Options Service does not have published information on outcomes by individual caller or on a year by year basis, as some arrangements made one year may break down in the following year. An estimated 60,000 children were benefiting from a family-based arrangement which was effective following one or other parent contacting the Child Maintenance Options service between July 2008 and March 2010. From internal surveys, it is estimated that the number of children benefiting from a family-based arrangement has increased to 91,000 for parents contacting the Child Maintenance Options service up to October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.2/7" class="indent">This figure will be updated by a further internal survey at the end of March 2011 which will include an estimate of children benefiting from an effective CSA arrangement and those who have not yet made an arrangement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1242W.5/1">The Government propose to replace disability living allowance with personal independence payment in 2013-14. We are still considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken, including how it will apply to existing DLA recipients. However, we believe that advice from a suitably trained and approved individual, for example a healthcare professional, will be an important part of ensuring that the assessment is more objective and consistent. In most cases, we expect this to involve a face-to-face consultation to enable an in-depth look at an individual's circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.5/2">We know it is essential that the assessment accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering. For example, they believe that the new assessment should explicitly take account of the impact of a health condition or impairment, including autistic spectrum disorders, on an individual's ability to communicate. This would set it apart from the current DLA assessment. We also recognise the importance of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

This difference in treatment acknowledges the disadvantages people have when they are severely disabled early or relatively early in life, and therefore have more limited opportunities to work, earn and save.</p>

	<p pid="a.1244W.0/1">The coalition agreement includes a commitment to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;...simplify the rules and regulations relating to pensions to help reinvigorate occupational pensions, encouraging companies to offer high-quality pensions to all employees and we will work with business and the industry to support auto-enrolment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.0/3">The key programme to reinvigorate private pension saving is the workplace pension reforms-automatic enrolment into a workplace pension, compulsory employer contributions and establishment of the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). From October 2012 all employers will be required to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying pension scheme. We estimate that the reforms should lead to 5-8 million people newly saving or saving more for their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.0/4">To help ensure that existing pension law remains appropriate following automatic enrolment, we have issued a call for evidence on the different regulatory regimes in place for trust-based occupational pension schemes and contract-based schemes. This will look at, among other things, the likely increase in the number of small pension pots post-automatic enrolment and possible solutions for helping schemes better manage the challenges they present-including looking at the rules around transfers. The call for evidence closes on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-18">18 April</phrase> and we will bring forward any proposals for change in due course. We are also engaging with the Pensions Regulator which has issued a discussion document (for response by <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-22">22 April</phrase>) on defined contribution pensions<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.0/5">A range of other measures has been put in place or is in train to support good pension provision. For example, simplified disclosure of information regulations enabling greater use of electronic communications came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December 2010</phrase><sup>(2)</sup>. The rules on employer debt to pension schemes are being reviewed to make it easier for companies to restructure while protecting members' pensions. The aim is to introduce these changes in October 2011, following public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.0/6">We are ending contracting out for defined contribution pension schemes<sup>(3)</sup>. This will simplify pension choices for individuals and administration for schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.0/7">The Government are exploring how pension saving might be made more attractive to individuals. For example, we are removing the requirement to annuitise at age 75 as part of the Finance Bill 2011, and we are continuing to consider options for improving take-up of the open market option for annuities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1245W.2/1">We recognise the importance of passporting entitlement to disability living allowance to additional forms of help and support such as the Blue Badge scheme and exemption from vehicle excise duty. Therefore we are considering carefully how passporting arrangements will operate as we develop the assessment criteria for personal independence payment. We are working across Government and with the devolved Administrations to ensure that measures can be taken to maintain passports where appropriate. Where applicable we have also taken the legislative measures in the Welfare Reform Bill to enable continuing passporting arrangements.</p>

Every effort is made to ensure that lone parents who move from income support to jobseeker's allowance, as their youngest child reaches the relevant age, continue to receive their payments without interruption. The change does require the customer to make a claim with HMRC to child tax credits for their children if they are claiming child dependency addition, as this is not available under jobseeker's allowance. However, this is completed on the customer's behalf to ensure that the lone parent's level of benefit is maintained, albeit from two separate sources, during the transition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.3/1">The information requested is detailed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/2">The Treasury Solicitors Department (TSol) has a Health and Well Being strategy designed to help prevent people from becoming ill and to help reduce levels of stress. This includes providing Health Screening every two years, offering regular GP appointments, improving working conditions through engaging staff and offering flexible working opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/3">If a member of staff is diagnosed with work-related stress TSol's HR Division will consider a referral to an Occupational Health adviser to obtain guidance on what adjustments they may need to put in place to help the individual cope. These could range from more flexible working arrangements to a change in role, and the particular circumstances of each case are taken into account. They may also advise the individual to contact Care First, an employee advice, information and counselling service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/4">The Attorney-General's Office and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate are both covered by the TSol Health and Well Being strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/5">The Crown Prosecution Service has developed a comprehensive strategy designed to reduce levels of work related stress, and supports staff diagnosed with work related stress through a range of internally and externally delivered interventions. This strategy includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/6" class="indent">Delivery of a programme of training to Human Resource Advisors (HRA) and line managers to raise understanding of work related stress factors and how to carry out personal risk assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/7" class="indent">Provision of online guidance for staff and line managers on understanding pressures in the workplace and recognising the signs of stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/8" class="indent">Revision of the Department's Grievance Policy to better support informal and more timely resolution of workplace conflict, a known major contributor to work related stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/9" class="indent">Free employee access to Care First who provide a free and confidential counselling and support service, accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/10">The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has a sick absence management action plan. Where stress is identified line managers actively support individuals and encourage them to make use of the support mechanisms provided by the SFO. These include an employee assistance programme, HR support and access to an Occupational Health adviser. The employee assistance programme provides counselling and support on a wide range of issues including work related stress, and the Occupational Health provider offers advice to support individuals in making reasonable adjustments to the workplace in order to alleviate the causes of stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.3/11">The National Fraud Authority (NFA) under its duty of care as an employer provides a good working environment with plenty of opportunity for employees to feedback on their work and workplace arrangements, including an annual staff survey. This enables the NFA to monitor and manage individual and office-wide conditions, adjusting arrangements as needed to reduce causes of work related stress. The NFA also subscribes to Care First, a professional people support services scheme to provide additional support for its employees.</p>

The exception would be where there is an element of competition for set funding, for example, the Higher Level Stewardship scheme.

	<p pid="a.1251W.5/1">Skills development is an important element contributing to both competitiveness and innovation in agriculture. Development of a highly skilled farming industry and the training delivery landscape which enables that is chiefly for the industry, working with Lantra (the land based industries' sector skills council) and training providers, such as land based colleges, to ensure training provision meets the needs of individual farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1251W.5/2">DEFRA is working with the industry-led Agri-Skills Forum which is leading on improving skills development in agriculture. Activities include raising the profile of the importance and relevance of training and skills, particularly business skills, with individual farmers, developing continuing professional development schemes and improving the professionalism of the industry. In addition, we are working with both the industry and BIS to help increase the uptake of apprenticeships by farmers to encourage young people into farming careers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1254W.7/1">The Prime Minister set up the Childhood and Families Task Force to ensure policies across different departments come together to tackle some of the major obstacles to a happy childhood and a successful family life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254W.7/2">As a result the Chancellor announced in the spending review that we will extend 15 hours a week of free early education and care to all disadvantaged two-year-old children from 2012-13, building on the existing universal provision for three and four-year-olds, we have ensured there is enough funding within the Early Intervention Grant to retain a national network of Sure Start Children's Centres and enable local authorities to meet their statutory duties. The network of children's centres provides the foundation for stronger, early joined-up working, offering universal services for all families and targeted services focused on families in greatest need. The spending review also announced a national campaign to support families with multiple problems. In July, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and I launched a review on early intervention (led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40461" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen)</phrase>) and more recently the Prime Minister announced a review of the commercialisation and premature sexualisation of childhood (led by Reg Bailey). The Prime Minister also used this occasion to commit to long-term funding to put relationship support services on a secure footing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1260W.9/1">The non-statutory programmes of study for Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education in England currently provide a context within which schools teach pupils about the importance of parenting. In particular, the personal well-being programme of study sets out how young people should learn about the roles and responsibilities of parents, carers, children and other family members, as well as the skills and qualities needed in parenting, and their importance to family life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.9/2">Our aim for the national curriculum is to reduce unnecessary prescription, bureaucracy and central control and to give schools and teachers greater control over what is taught. We do not therefore propose to ask schools to report on the content of their lessons, especially those that are non-statutory.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.9/3">The recent report from the Centre for Education and Inclusion Research showed that between 63% and 70% of secondary schools (dependent on year group) were teaching all PSHE education elements at KS3 and KS4. Ofsted's report on the teaching of PSHE found that overall provision was good or outstanding in three quarters of the schools visited, but sex and relationship education, drugs and alcohol teaching and mental health issues were dealt with superficially.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.9/4">We have said we want all pupils to benefit from high quality PSHE education and in the Schools White Paper 2010, &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot;, we announced our intention to hold an internal review of PSHE. As part of that review we expect to visit Manchester Academy to understand the work they have undertaken on incorporating parenting classes into the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.9/5">Notwithstanding the work in Manchester Academy, evidence shows that the most valuable parenting skills are best taught through a mix of practical application and teaching, which is likely to be more effective the closer it is to the age at which people have children-the average age for people to have their first child in England is in their late 20s.</p>

	<p pid="a.1261W.2/2">A decision was taken to transfer some of the functions currently being carried out by the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) in preparation for its planned closure by March 2012.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.1261W.2/21">Alongside the decisions on transferring functions, the Department is working closely with the management team in QCDA to ensure that staff are consulted and provided with all the support and information they need before functions are transferred. In taking these decisions, consideration is given to staff rights under the Cabinet Office's COSOP arrangements (Cabinet Office Statement of Practice) and the Transfer of Undertaking (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE).</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.2/22">In 2009-10, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) employed 683 members of staff. 535 of these members of staff remained in QCDA when QCA split into QCDA and Ofqual. In 2010-11, QCDA employed 416 members of staff. It is expected that there will be no staff employed by QCDA by the end of financial year 2011-12 as it is due to close in March 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.2/23">Ministers and the Department have discussed the implications of QCDA's closure with a wide range of bodies including awarding bodies and their representatives, as well as other interested governmental bodies such as Ofqual. Decisions about which functions are to continue and which are to be transferred are set out clearly in the Secretary of State's letters to QCDA's chair.</p>

	<p pid="a.1264W.14/1">Future support to schools to offer GCSE triple science is dependent on the more detailed outcome of the spending review which has yet to be announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.14/2">We are investigating a number of proposals that will improve the training of teachers so that standards of teaching are raised in schools. It is the Government's ambition to improve the prestige of the profession so that it attracts the highest quality entrants and to base more initial teacher training in schools so that trainees spend as much time in the classroom, learning from the best teachers. For example, we have already announced plans to expand the successful scheme Teach First so that more schools (including for the first time primary schools) may benefit from the talents of the country's best graduates. Three quarters of Teach First participants teach the most demanding shortage subjects, including science. Expanding the scheme should therefore help boost the supply of science teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1264W.14/3">The Schools White Paper 2010, &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot;, also sets out the Government's commitment to attract more of the best graduates of shortage subjects, including science, into teaching. We are reviewing the routes into teaching and the incentives offered to well qualified people who want to teach priority subjects; and will shortly publish a strategy document for discussion setting out our plans for funding initial teacher training from academic year 2012/13.</p>

	<p pid="a.1269W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated March 2011:</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent questions to the Minister for the Cabinet Office asking (1) what mechanism has been put in place to ensure the confidentiality of data during the 2011 Census process (46951) and (2) whether his Department takes into account ethical consideration when tendering contracts for (a) the Census and (b) other UK social statistical tasks (47079).</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/4" class="indent">(1) Security has been a fundamental aspect and is built into the whole of the census design. The broad principles and strategic approach covering the privacy, security and confidentiality aspects of census information were set out in Chapter 6 of the White Paper &quot;Helping to shape tomorrow&quot; (CM 7513), laid before Parliament in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/5" class="indent">Following the appointment of Lockheed Martin UK as the supplier of the main data processing services ONS put in place additional contractual and operational arrangements to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/6" class="indent">all data processing will be carried out in the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/7" class="indent">ONS retains ownership of the data;</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/8" class="indent">the only people who have access to the full census dataset in the operational data centre will be ONS staff;</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/9" class="indent">no staff from either Lockheed Martin (the US parent) or Lockheed Martin UK have access to any personal census data;</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/10" class="indent">ONS controls system access rights to all data systems; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/11" class="indent">everyone working with census data signs declarations of confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/12" class="indent">A joint ONS/supplier security team has been overseeing the security of the census data capture operations, including the online census.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/13" class="indent">The online census was built with data security as a primary requirement and meets government-information assurance and data security standards, as well as ISO 27001, the industry standard for information security management. The online system has been subject to rigorous security tests, and underwent a formal accreditation process before it went live. The system has been subject to security testing by Logica and, in addition, ONS commissioned its own independent security testing, which has been carried out by SOPRA, a CESG approved CHECK service provider. Any vulnerabilities identified have been rectified in line with the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/14" class="indent">An independent review of security has also been carried out and the report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-11">11 February</phrase>. The report &quot;2011 Census: Independent Information Assurance Review&quot; can be found on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1269W.0/16" class="indent">(2) a) and b) In tendering for all contracts, including for the main outsourced operations for the 2011 Census, ONS carries out fully compliant procurements in accordance with the requirements of European law and the European Union Procurement Directives, which have been incorporated into English law. The foundations of the rules are fairness and transparency. Any organisation with the correct technical capability, financial stability and relevant experience therefore has the opportunity to compete openly for Government business throughout the European Union without discrimination. The tendering process for support services for the 2011 Census covered the technical ability to provide the services, the cost and the assessment of risks associated with such services. There were six main overarching evaluation criteria that were applied to determine the chosen suppliers. These were:</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/17" class="indent">compliance with requirements listed in the statement of requirements as mandatory</p>
	<p pid="a.1269W.0/18" class="indent">value for money</p>

Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five, and they pay UK tax wherever they work. Most parents prefer to take their children with them, but in some countries they are not permitted to do so, either for health or security reasons. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>

Before placing a medical device on the market, the manufacturer must meet the relevant safety, quality and performance requirements set out in the regulations and apply the CE marking of conformity. Any assessment required under the regulations is carried out by a third party independent certification organisation known as a Notified Body. The Agency is not part of this certification process but does designate and audit UK Notified Bodies as being competent to undertake this task and also assesses pre-market clinical investigation protocols. The Agency has a mainly post market surveillance role which includes assessment of adverse incidents brought to its attention and enforcement where breaches of the regulations have been identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.1285W.2/1">At the time decisions on the court estate were announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December 2010</phrase>, the estimated gross annual resource savings from the closure of Bishop Auckland magistrates and county court were &#163;123,000 (excluding maintenance, staff costs and non-cash). Work is currently under way to determine the final savings and costs of closure (including transition costs).</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.2/2">It is not yet possible to confirm the impact on the overall number of posts following the closure of Bishop Auckland county court and other courts in the HMCS area of Cleveland, Durham and Northumbria. However, all staff at the Bishop Auckland courthouse will be relocated to other nearby courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.2/3">Following the decisions announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-14">14 December</phrase>, HMCS commenced an internal consultation using the Management of Organisational Change Framework (MOCF) to look at staff impacts across the Court Estate Reform Programme. HMCS is conducting discussions with the Department trade union side and with staff (on a one-to-one basis) to consider how the changes will effect them. Only after this process is completed will the final impact on the number of staff posts be known.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.2/4">After the MOCF consultation has concluded, HMCS will implement a phased approach to closures from April 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1285W.5/1">The register became open to the public in 1990 when the Land Registration Act 1988 came into force. This allowed public inspection and copying of the register and, with the exception of leases and charges, the deeds or documents referred to in the register. The inspection and copying rights were extended in 2003, with the coming into force of the Land Registration Act 2002, allowing leases and charges to be freely available, subject to a transitional period-and exempt information provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.5/2">This widening in the availability of Land Registry information was made in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> giving anyone the right to request information from public organisations. The general principle is that a person is entitled to see information held by public organisations unless there is a good reason why it should not be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.5/3">The opening up of register information was the subject of parliamentary debate and consultation. It was also set in the context of the Government drive for all public authorities to make all citizen services available online, and in light of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.5/4">Registered professional users of Land Registry services have been able to access selected property deeds online since 1994. This has helped facilitate conveyancing and related property transactions and the move towards the electronic delivery of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.5/5">Citizen access to property information was made available in 2005 through the launch of a website aimed at the general public. In 2007 Land Registry reviewed the online availability of deeds and documents provided by this service. The review led to the removal of those documents from online viewing. Copies of deeds, which are available as of right under land registration legislation, may still be purchased, but only after completing a registration process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.5/6">Land Registry produces a public leaflet entitled &quot;Protect your Property&quot; and stresses the importance of keeping contact addresses up to date as a way of helping to prevent property fraud. Land Registry has a dedicated team dealing with applications from home owners to check their contact addresses and update them as necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.1296W.8/1">The Government recognise the importance of keeping transmission losses to a minimum. Minimising losses reduces the amount of electricity that needs to be produced, in turn, resulting in lower carbon emissions and other costs. National Grid is incentivised to minimise transmission losses as part of its annual System Operator incentive scheme set by Ofgem. In addition, Ofgem is considering whether further incentives should be placed on Transmission Owners in the next Transmission Price Control Review (2013-21) to help reduce losses and how these would operate.

	<p pid="a.1299W.0/2">Research Council Pathways to Impact are not a system for allocating separate funding. The first Research Excellence Framework assessment will be in 2014. Higher Education Innovation Funding is allocated to higher education institutions to support their interactions with business and other users. Higher Education Business and Community Innovation Survey data on the number of university contracts with businesses are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1299W.0/4">Collaborations between business and academe are enabled through a range of activities by the Technology Strategy Board, not all of which involve funding partnership with the research councils. Overall, through its support for Collaborative Research and Development (R and D) projects, the Technology Strategy Board has provided support to approximately 1,500 unique businesses and about 2/3 of projects have at least one academic partner (more may have academic sub-contractors). Furthermore, there are currently over 1,000 live Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, and each of these is a partnership between business and the knowledge base, a majority of which will be higher education institutes. Such partnerships are likely to continue going forward, but it would not be possible to specify numbers as projects as individual collaborative R and D projects can range from &#163;10,000 to &#163;100 million, and are funded on the basis of their technical and economic merit with no pre-set targets for the number of partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.1299W.3/1">Ministers receive a significant number of representations from further education providers, many of whom deliver English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses and have taken the opportunity to discuss changes to fee remission including ESOL.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.3/2">From August 2011, full Government funding will be provided for ESOL to unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or in the Employment and Support Allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will also continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.3/3">The equality impact assessment published alongside &quot;Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; (November 2010) found that, at the aggregate level, there are unlikely to be disproportionate impacts on protected groups. A separate assessment of how the changes may affect ESOL learners is currently being carried out by this Department, and I expect to be able to publish the assessment in due course.</p>

We also encourage our staff to participate in volunteering by offering guidance and special paid time off. As the lead Minister for Every Business Commits in the Government, I am talking to business and our stakeholders about how we can do more to support communities and encourage social action such as volunteering.</p>

This definition varies slightly to that used in the annual SIR report so staff numbers may vary slightly between these sources.</p>
