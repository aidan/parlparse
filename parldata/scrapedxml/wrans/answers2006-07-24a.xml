	<p pid="a.710W.0/1">The Government recognises that the Aarhus Convention is an important statement, at international level, of the rights of the public to be involved in decisions which have significant environmental effects. The UK's ratification of the convention, in February 2005, demonstrates our commitment to the importance of these principles. A comprehensive guide can be found on the DEFRA website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.710W.0/2">In addition, DEFRA's environmental information unit (EIU) provides advice on the convention and the Environmental Information Regulations. The EIU has produced leaflets and posters publicising peoples' rights to access environmental information and provides detailed guidance on the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index. htm</a> This also links to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs), the code of practice and the Aarhus Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.0/3">The code of practice, (which was laid in Parliament in February 2005) and guidance have been revised to take responses to a public consultation into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.0/4">Additionally, the unit offers support to Government Departments and public authorities on EIRs. This support includes workshops to discuss how they can raise awareness within their authorities and provides an opportunity to share good practice. In 2003-04, the Government's sustainable development unit worked with the Department for Constitutional Affairs supporting the freedom of information (FOI) road shows programme and gave talks to public authorities around the country explaining how to handle FOI and EIR requests.</p>

These measures include a capital grant scheme for biomass boilers, the establishment of a new Biomass Energy Centre to provide expert information and advice, further grant support for biomass supply chains, and a commitment to consider using biomass in the Government estate.

	<p pid="a.712W.8/2">The Agency also takes account of guidance set out in the DEFRA Charging Handbook, which states that policy makers should be sensitive to the burden upon payers (and particular segments) and that this should be done though developing a Regulatory Impact Assessment on the proposed change in charge if it imposes a real increase in burden. In accordance with good Government practice the Agency routinely seeks the views of stakeholders, customer groups and individual charge payers on proposals for changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.2/1">The Government are committed to conserving and enhancing the countryside and biodiversity and recognise the key role played by farmers and other land managers. The introduction of Environmental Stewardship (ES) in 2005 was recognition of the benefits that can be delivered by farming and provides funding to farmers ad other land managers in England who deliver effective environmental management on their land. Together with the introduction of cross-compliance conditions under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), this will ensure that the English landscape continues to be protected and enhanced. It will also encourage the retention, if not expansion, of countryside management skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/2">Past research has considered implications of CAP Reform on land management, including the take-up of agri-environment schemes. A new research programme was set up last year to monitor the impacts of the introduction of the SPS on farm level change and the environment under the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory Programme, details of which are at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/observatory/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/observatory/index.htm</a>. The results of that programme will help inform the UK negotiating position in future EU discussions on both the SPS rules and wider CAP reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/3">Environmental Stewardship has also an evaluation strategy, available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/es/ES-EvaluationPlan-Feb06.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/es/ES-EvaluationPlan-Feb06.pdf</a>, and is supported by research and monitoring programmes. The projects under these ES programmes tend to focus on issues such as 'effectiveness', 'efficiency' and 'improvements' relating to the management options of the scheme. The 'capability of farmers' is not investigated independently but is a factor that can influence the outputs of these projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.5/1">UK methane emissions between 1990 and 2004 fell by an estimated 50 per cent., mainly as a consequence of reductions in sectors such as waste, agriculture, coal mining and natural gas distribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.5/2">More recycling, helped by the introduction of the landfill tax, and an increase in the capture of landfill gas for energy recovery, has led to an estimated 63 per cent. fall in landfill emissions since 1990. There has been a 40 per cent. decrease in landfill emissions since 1999, when the Government increased the landfill tax to &pound;10 per tonne of waste. Agriculture accounts for around 41 per cent. of UK methane emissions, and emissions from this sector have fallen by an estimated 13 per cent. since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.5/3">We are currently reviewing our approach to anaerobic digestion, which can help to capture and utilise emissions from manures and slurries, as part of the Government's response to the Biomass Taskforce Report. Additionally we are continuing to fund research on options to reduce direct emissions from ruminants.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.5/4">Methane emissions from coal mining fell by more than 70 per cent. between 1990 and 2004 due to the closure of coal mines as a consequence of fuel switching in the energy supply industry and UK Coal participation in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Methane gas extracted from mines and used as fuel has been exempt from the climate change levy since 2003. This exemption encourages the owners of mining facilities and decommissioned mines to invest in systems that capture methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.5/5">Fugitive emissions from natural gas have fallen by about 39 per cent. between 1990 and 2004. National Grid Gas, which owns and maintains the UK gas distribution network, is continuing to improve the UK gas network. Internationally, the UK is taking an active role in the international Methane to Markets Partnership, and will co-chair a new Agriculture Sub-Committee with Argentina. This will examine the scope for capturing methane from animal wastes in a cost-effective way.</p>

	<p pid="a.721W.2/1">From a review the Department has undertaken and has published on the DEFRA website, I am assured that much of our current legislation addresses risks from materials regardless of their size. DEFRA has responsibility for the possible environmental risks from nanomaterials. If there are environmental risks which need controlling, irrespective of whether the cause of the risk is already marketed or not, they will be appropriately controlled and emergency powers are available if needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.2/2">I am aware that very small materials may pose new risks and it is with that in mind that the UK are moving towards a framework of appropriate control. We are therefore currently gathering evidence to see if these types of products represent a hazard or risk to the environment that would require additional control. Our evidence-gathering phase, working across the UK Government, are scheduled to cover the next two years, at which point it is intended that there will be a fundamental review of the need for control. Given this, there are no plans for the mandatory regulation of nanotechnology products and hence no plans for publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.2/3">DEFRA recently consulted on this approach. The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">23 June</phrase> but information is still available on the DEFRA website: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/nanotech-vrs/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/nanotech-vrs/index.htm</a></p>

We took the opportunity in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act to consolidate and simplify the way in which the roles of these bodies have been described in legislation since the 1940's. However the statutory purpose of Natural England is deliberately drawn widely to encompass everything which the predecessor bodies were able to do. It will, of course, be a matter for the Board of Natural England, in consultation with Ministers, to decide how to distribute its resources between its various functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.723W.11/1">The Government are very conscious that increasing consumption of goods and services in the UK can have environmental and social consequences overseas. Defra is commissioning research on the environmental impacts of internationally sourced commodity production, and palm oil is one of the commodities being investigated. The results of the research will inform future policy development in the UK and abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.11/2">We are also working hard in a number of areas to tackle the important issue of natural habitat loss that might affect the orang-utan.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.11/3">For example, the UK Government have been the major financial supporter of the Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP) run by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). More information is available at: <a href="http://www.unep.org/grasp">http://www.unep.org/grasp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.11/4">In October 2005, EU Agriculture Ministers finalised new legislation on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) that will allow the EU to enter into agreements with developing countries to provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.11/5">The Government are also seeking to address concerns regarding the use of palm oil for transport bio-fuel production. We are proposing to develop a carbon and sustainability assurance scheme to ensure that the best transport bio-fuels are used in the UK. The Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership is looking to define the principal environmental criteria required to protect sensitive eco-systems and will prepare a draft environmental standard to apply to all fuels, including imports.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.2/1">No recycling targets have been specifically set by the Government for schools. However, Defra does provide financial support for the operation of Eco-Schools, an international programme developed by the Foundation of Environmental Education (FEE) and managed in England by Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS). Eco-Schools promotes environmental awareness around nine main themes, one of which is waste minimisation and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/2">Eco-Schools involve the whole school (pupils, teachers, non-teaching employees and governors) together with members of the local community (parents, the local authority, the media and local businesses). The scheme enables schools to enter for an internationally recognised award, the highest level of which is the Green Flag, with intermediary awards of bronze and silver. Over 3,000 schools are currently registered, including 500 schools that have achieved Green Flag status.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/3">Defra will be providing &pound;40,000 of funding for Eco-Schools in 2006-07. &pound;100,000 is also provided from non-grant sources, mainly from other sponsorship.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.2/4">In addition, from April 2006 the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) will be carrying out work with schools, including continuation of the Cycler assemblies, as part of their waste awareness programme. Many local authorities are involved with waste education work, both independently and with WRAP. The Environment Action Fund also funds some projects that work with young people on issues around sustainable consumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.727W.3/1">Under DEFRA's regional food strategy we have, since 2003, been providing an additional one million per year to support the quality regional food sector in England. Food from Britain (FFB) take the lead in the delivery of a national programme of activity that supports producers in the sector. In taking forward this programme of activities, which focuses on trade development, consumer awareness and business competitiveness, FFB work together with a range of organisations, including Slow Food UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.727W.3/2">A good example of this is ensuring a strong British presence at Slow Food's biennial Salone del Gusto food show held in Turin. Both organisations have worked well together for the last two shows in recruiting quality regional food producers for the event and in providing the necessary logistical support at the show. This close cooperation is continuing this year in preparation for the 2006 Salone del Gusto taking place in October.</p>

The eligibility criteria have stayed broadly the same since 2000, with major changes only occurring because of changes to the benefits or tax credit system, for example the replacement of income support for those of pension age with pension credit, and the replacement of working families and disabled persons tax credit with working and child tax credits.

A study of fatal accident victims during the period 1996-2000 showed that in a sample of 779 drivers and riders killed, 17 per cent. had traces of illegal drugs.

	<p pid="a.748W.8/1">A new, directly applicable, EU regulation on drivers' hours has recently been adopted by the EU institutions&mdash;it was published in the Official Journal in April 2006 and will, for the most part, come into force in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.8/2">We will consult later this year on the amendments that will need to be made to domestic legislation to facilitate compliance with the new EU regulation. These amendments will adopt all of the national derogations available in the new EU regulation (without any additional restrictions), apart from the newly available derogation for specialised vehicles transporting money and/or valuables&mdash;in Article 13.1.(m). We do not intend to adopt this derogation because there is no obvious case to exempt these operations which currently take place within the scope of the existing drivers' hours rules without any apparent difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.8/3">The working time of mobile workers (basically drivers, crew and other travelling staff) operating on vehicles subject to the EU regulation on drivers' hours is governed by the European Road Transport Working Time Directive 2002/15/EC. A review of the UK's implementing regulations is due to commence later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.755W.6/1">Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to those members of the armed forces, and their partners and families, who have contributed in any way to the evacuation of UK and other nationals from Lebanon over recent days. The evacuation was conducted with the utmost professionalism, under difficult conditions, with the safety of evacuees paramount at all times. I should also like to convey my thanks to those members of the FCO and the MOD who have been involved in the evacuation. I offer all those involved my personal congratulations on a job well done.</p>
	<p pid="a.755W.6/2">Secondly, on the subject of international support for Lebanon, I can tell the hon. Member that plans are under development, both in terms of a peacekeeping deployment, and in terms of the humanitarian response. Specifically, discussions have been held with international partners including France and the United States, on the subject of an international force. Crucially, whatever is proposed will need the support of both the Lebanese Government and Israel. If an international force is to be deployed, HMG will consider how best it can support the international community in that effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.759W.2/1">The four provinces covered by Multi-National Division (South East) remain relatively quiet compared to other areas of Iraq, accounting for around 4 per cent. of all attacks. The security situation in Basra, however, continues to cause concern. To address the problems in the province, the Iraqi Government, has announced a security plan for Basra. I discussed the plan with Prime Minister Maliki this morning. The plan is in its early stages but has already resulted in increased presence of Iraqi security forces&mdash;with more to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.2/2">Elsewhere in MND(South East) the security situation is more positive. Our progress with security and training of the Iraqi security forces was a factor in making Al Muthanna province the first where responsibility for security was handed over to Iraqi control. I expect Maysan and Dhi Qar provinces to follow suit before the end of this year, once the conditions on the ground are right.</p>

	<p pid="a.779W.5/1">All nuclear test veterans are eligible to claim, under the terms of the war pension scheme, for any disablement causally linked to service rather than for specific conditions or diseases. A war pension is also paid whenever the claimant can raise reasonable doubt, by providing reliable evidence, that the claimed disablement is causally linked to service. The War Pensions Scheme considers disablement from radiation linked disease, to include such conditions as certain thyroid and parathyroid diseases, cataracts and malignant disease and cancer. Cancers due to ionising radiation are clinically indistinguishable from those due to any other cause which are common in a population increasing with age. Based on the findings of National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) reports it is war pensions policy that entitlement is given to any type of leukaemia, other than chronic lymphatic with onset, within 25 years of participation at a nuclear test.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.5/2">Therefore no estimate has been made of the cost of awarding war pensions to all veterans who might be suffering from a radiation linked disease that has arisen some time after service in nuclear test areas as it might not be linked to that service The value of a disablement award is determined by the assessed level of all service related disablement, which can be re-assessed if there is subsequent deterioration.</p>

	<p pid="a.797W.3/1">The Public Prosecution Service conducts all cases it prosecutes, including those on behalf of the Environment and Heritage Service, in accordance with the Test for Prosecution. That test is whether there is sufficient available evidence to afford a reasonable prospect of conviction and, if so, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. If the evidential aspect of the test is met, there is a strong presumption that prosecution is in the public interest; the more serious the offence, or its consequences, the stronger the presumption. The cost of bringing a prosecution does not weigh in that consideration. The PPS may take into account, in assessing the public interest, of whether the offence is of such a nature that it is likely that the court will impose only a very small or nominal penalty.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.3/2">The cost-effectiveness of prosecutions is based on the overall efficiency of the PPS. It is not connected in any way with the fines imposed following conviction. Such fines are not payable to the PPS. Following conviction, the PPS will usually ask for its costs to be paid by the defendant but whether such an order is made, and to what extent, is a matter for judicial determination.</p>
	<p pid="a.797W.3/3">The cost effectiveness of the PPS and what is being done to maintain and improve efficiency is the subject of the PPS annual report and business plan, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.3/1">At the time that this question was asked there were 18 parliamentary questions awaiting an answer. There were two that had been waiting for two weeks and four that had been waiting for three weeks for a substantive answer. All six of these questions have now been answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.3/2">The Attorney-General's office endeavours to provide a substantive answer on time, although there are occasions when some parliamentary questions can take slightly longer than others to draft because of the nature of the information required.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.13/1">The Government plan to introduce regulations later this year under part 3 of the Equality Act 2006 to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities, services, education and public functions. These measures will empower individuals to challenge unacceptable prejudice in their every day lives and will reinforce and support the work already being done in many communities by police forces and other bodies to confront and tackle homophobic bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.13/2">The regulations will be promoted to raise awareness of people's new rights and responsibilities under the regulations and will be accompanied by detailed guidance for service providers. The new Commission for Equality and Human Rights will play an important role in promoting and supporting the regulations when it opens its doors in October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.798W.13/3">We take the issue of homophobic bullying in schools very seriously and the Government gave an undertaking in the White Paper, &quot;Higher Standards, Better Education for All&quot;, published last year to issue guidance on bullying motivated by prejudice, including homophobia, providing school staff with valuable support in an area they often find challenging. The Department for Education and Skills is currently developing a programme to tackle homophobic bullying and has accepted a tender from Stonewall for the provision of guidance on homophobic bullying. The Department expects to issue that guidance early in 2007, and to follow this with a series of dissemination workshops.</p>
