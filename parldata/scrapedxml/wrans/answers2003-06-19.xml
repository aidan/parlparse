	<p pid=".338W.5/1">The full amount of end-year flexibility (EYF) that Northern Ireland is entitled to carry forward from 2001&ndash;02 is being retained under the normal arrangements. Underspends to be carried forward into 2002&ndash;03 in respect of 2001&ndash;02 were originally based on an estimate of departmental spend made in the early summer of 2002. This has subsequently been revised to take account of actual departmental spend in 2001&ndash;02 and will be drawn down in 2003&ndash;04, subject to agreement by the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.5/2">Of the actual underspend by Northern Ireland Departments for 2001&ndash;02, some amounts were outside the EYF arrangements: resources of &pound;3.6 million in respect of the Interconnector scheme were not carried forward into future years. This was a specific ring-fenced and time-bounded scheme where the original allocation was not required in full. In addition, resources of &pound;9.9 million in respect of the EU Peace and Reconciliation Programme I (EUPRP I) were not carried forward into future years. Due to changes in the Sterling/Euro exchange rates and other technicalities during the life of the Programme, these resources were not required to secure the full draw-down of eligible funding from Brussels.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.5/3">Under Treasury rules, some Reserve claims have to be deducted from the following year's end-year flexibility (EYF): in respect of 2001&ndash;02, amounts of &pound;1.9 million had to be treated in that way. Also, as had been agreed following the 2000 Spending Review (SR 2000), the EYF claim was abated by an amount of &pound;22.1 million to correct an over-allocation which arose in SR 2000. These had been allowed for in the planning of budgets and did not affect departmental budgets.</p>

However, during 2002, 71 projects with a total value of &pound;8 million were allocated funding under the Peace II Programme in the North Belfast area and 12 projects with funding of &pound;1.5m have been approved in 2003 to date. The information relates to projects that have been allocated funding with a postal address in the North Belfast Parliamentary Constituency. Where the project address is incomplete, further analysis has been carried out on the applicant address. The figures, therefore, have been produced by first including those projects with a project address in Belfast North and then adding those where the project address is incomplete but the applicant address is in Belfast North. However, where it is apparent that the benefit of the project clearly falls outside North Belfast, these amounts have been excluded.

	<p pid=".341W.2/1">The Reinvestment and Reform Initiative (RRI) is about tackling Northern Ireland's infrastructure deficit and improving and reforming public services. As part of the RRI, there is the power to access borrowing from the National Loans Fund (NLF). The Public Works Loans Board (PWLB) is the statutory body that facilitates all lending from the NLF and they publish the interest rates through their website on a daily basis (<a href="http://www.pwlb.gov.uk">www.pwlb.gov.uk</a>). The interest rate on any loan will be dictated by the prevailing rate at the time it is drawn down.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.2/2">It is not appropriate to consider PPP projects as borrowing by the public sector. Rather, the PPP approach allows additional resources to be levered in from the private sector sooner than is possible under conventional procurement, with additional benefits in terms of value for money and efficiency. While the cost of capital for the private sector may be higher than borrowing from Treasury, this is mitigated by other cost, risk and service advantages inherent in the approach. Value for money over the lifetime of the contract is the key concept.</p>

	<p pid=".344W.3/1">The death-in-service gratuity paid under the armed forces pension scheme varies according to whether or not the death is considered attributable to, or aggravated by, service. If the death is considered non-attributable, a tax-free basic death-in-service lump sum is payable, this is approximately equivalent to the individual's representative annual rate of pay. If the death is considered attributable to service, in addition to the basic death-in-service lump sum, a tax-free attributable gratuity is also payable; this increases the overall rate of death-in-service benefit to between one and 1&frac12; times the individual's representative annual rate of pay.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.3/2">The pension and gratuity arrangements for Gurkha soldiers, which are different to those of the armed forces pension scheme, stem from the 1947 Tri-partite Agreement and are linked to Indian Army rates. An examination of these arrangements in 1999 resulted in substantially increased pension payments for all British Gurkha pensioners and enhanced gratuity provision in the event of death in service.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.3/3">Similar to the wider Army, the death-in-service gratuity payable to a Gurkha varies according to whether or not the death is considered attributable to, or aggravated by, service. If death-in-service is attributable then the Death-in-Service Gratuity payable to a Gurkha is the same as that paid to the equivalent rank in the wider British Army. If a death in service is not attributable, the normal provisions of the Gurkha pension and gratuities scheme apply, and the death element of the Death Cum-Retirement Gratuity is payable.</p>

	<p pid=".355W.11/1">This Department and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have a shared interest in promoting sustainable tourism in rural areas. Accordingly, we work closely to shape policy and develop initiatives for action. In creating VisitBritain, my Department took over the former English Tourism Council's responsibilities for promoting rural and sustainable tourism policy.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.11/2">As part of the Government's programme of tourism reform, the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are, from April 2003, playing a stronger part in the strategic leadership of tourism, with the Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs) as their natural delivery partners. Guidance has been issued to the RDAs on how tourism should be covered in their Corporate Plans and Regional Economic Strategies, including the development of Regional Sustainable Tourism Strategies in partnership with RTBs, and sub-regional and local tourism organisations. Advantage West Midlands (RDA) will lead this process in the West Midlands, taking into account the tourism potential of rural areas, and in 2003&ndash;04, will receive &pound;252,000 to pass on to the Visit Heart of England Tourist Board, subject to agreed targets and objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.11/3">VisitBritain's current domestic marketing campaign, &quot;Enjoy England&quot;, will benefit rural tourism businesses that depend largely on domestic tourism.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.11/4">The Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), part of Defra's England Rural Development Programme, provides project-based support for diversifying the rural economy. The total RES budget is &pound;152 million (50 per cent. co-financed by EU CAP Pillar 2 money) from 2000 to 2006. Tourism and leisure projects fall under</p>
	<p pid=".355W.11/5" class="indent">'encouragement for tourist and craft activities' and 'farm diversification'. Currently these measures have &pound;55 million allocated, of which &pound;12 million has been spent so far.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.11/6">Defra is promoting countryside recreation through the new statutory right of access to open countryside. The Countryside Agency is taking forward several relevant projects, such as: integrated quality management of rural tourist destinations; retaining visitor expenditure in rural areas; promoting environmentally responsible tourism businesses; promoting local produce with the Youth Hostels Association.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.11/7">Government support is not limited to direct funding for tourism. This Department alone spends some &pound;1 billion per year, for example, on the arts, the historic environment, museums and galleries, much of which directly benefits rural tourism across the country.</p>

	<p pid=".362W.6/1">Bullying is a serious problem that affects pupils' educational achievement and emotional well-being. All schools in England must treat the problem seriously, and are required to draw up written measures, which must be fully implemented, to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.6/2">We have made available to schools a free information pack and video entitled &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, which provides examples of good practice in preventing bullying. There is also a dedicated website at <a href="http://www.dfes.qov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.qov.uk/bullying</a>, which offers help to pupils, parents and teachers and contains links to other websites. Anti-bullying work is part of our Behaviour and Attendance strategy and from this September it will feature within the new behaviour and attendance audits and training, which are being introduced into secondary schools as part of the Key Stage 3 strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".362W.6/3">Schools need to have a range of measures in place to protect their pupils&mdash;including pupils who have been bullied previously&mdash;from bullying. These are likely to include proper supervision during the school day and encouraging a culture of openness so that bullying cannot flourish unseen. Schools should do all they can to ensure that pupils do not feel they need to change school because of bullying. As far as the bullies are concerned, we have made it clear that, where necessary, those responsible for serious or prolonged bullying&mdash;including cases of violence, sexual assault or inciting racial harassment&mdash;can be permanently excluded.</p>

We encourage all schools to have effective links with the local police. The Safer School Partnerships established within our wider Behaviour and Attendance strategy, whereby police officers are based in some schools, will also help to prevent and deal with bullying.</p>

A copy of the report will be placed in the Library of the House, when discussions with Cabinet Office are concluded. Non-departmental public bodies were not required to submit an equal pay report to Cabinet Office, although many have conducted a similar audit, as best practice. It has not been possible to provide the requested information for my Department's non-departmental public bodies without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

Each juvenile establishment has a Special Needs Co-ordinator who is responsible for the assessment of learners, drawing up specialist learning programmes, supervising Learning Support Assistants and supporting all staff on special educational needs issues. We have also appointed Heads of Learning and Skills in all juvenile facilities to co-ordinate learning and skills provision, and will be appointing a further 110 in adult prisons this year.

	<p pid=".368W.2/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) distributes a portion of its block grant to higher education institutions according to the quality of their research as measured by the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), and the volume of research they carry out. This provides equitable funding to institutions of all sizes. The White Paper, &quot;The future of higher education&quot;, set out plans to strengthen higher education research by increasing substantially the funding available, providing further support to the best research departments and institutions, promoting collaboration and encouraging and supporting promising departments and emerging subject areas. HEFCE is considering how best to implement the White Paper plans. Some institutions have seen reductions in their research funding for the coming year, typically where most of their research falls below international standards of excellence. However, the Government do not intend to restrict research funding to a particular group of universities. In the longer term funding may be affected by Sir Gareth Roberts' review of research assessment, commissioned by the higher education funding bodies. The report of that review was published for consultation last month (<a href="http://www.ra-review.ac.uk/">http://www.ra-review.ac.uk/</a>). It recommends a more flexible system of research assessment, including different types of assessment for institutions and departments with different levels of research. As now, HEFCE would decide how to use the assessment results in funding institutions.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.5/1">The Code for Crown Prosecutors makes clear that no prosecution may be commenced unless it is believed that there is a realistic prospect of a conviction, that is that it is more likely than not that there will be a conviction. However, once a prosecution has begun, it is the duty of the prosecution to keep the prospect of conviction under constant review. If there comes a time when it is believed that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, it is the duty of the prosecution to say so and to take steps accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.5/2">The Crown Prosecution Service, undertaking that process of constant review, recently received information which meant that it could no longer put forward the principal prosecution witness, Florim Gashi, as a witness of truth.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.5/3">In May 2003 the section of the CPS dealing with the kidnap received information showing that Mr. Gashi may have entrapped a Wandsworth parking attendant into criminal behaviour. The attendant also made allegations against Mr. Gashi that he had access to guns, an allegation that had also been made by one of the defendants in this case. Further, it was apparent that Mr. Gashi had lied to the police.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.5/4">This information prompted a re-review of the whole case.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.5/5">The Crown Prosecution Service was not told until three months after the arrests that Mr. Gashi had been paid for his information. Mr. Gashi had previously denied receiving more than expenses.

	<p pid=".375W.5/6">In the light of these developments the CPS requested advice of experienced senior counsel, who advised that there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction. As a result the CPS took the decision not to proceed with the case.</p>

The changes under way will need to be completed in order that these improvements can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.8/6">In 2003&ndash;04, the Department has two cost measures that serve to control expenditure:</p>
	<p pid=".376W.8/7" class="indent">1. To recover from clients the full operating costs for chargeable services.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.8/8" class="indent">2. To maintain corporate staff overhead at no more than 15 per cent. of total staff costs.</p>

	<p pid=".380W.3/2" class="italic">Crown Prosecution Service</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/3">The Crown Prosecution Service included its Public Service Agreement targets in its Target Delivery Report, published in February 2003, and in its Strategic and Business Plans for 2003 and 2006, published in March 2003. Public Service Agreement targets are also included in the annual Departmental Report which will be published very shortly. These documents are available on the Crown Prosecution website.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/4">The inclusion of Public Service Agreement targets in these documents is at no additional cost to public funds.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/5" class="italic">Serious Fraud Office</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/6">The Serious Fraud Office does not have Public Service Agreement targets but is finalising appropriate targets to cover the Survey 2002 period from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Once agreed they will be published on the official website. The cost to public funds is likely to be under &pound;500.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/7" class="italic">Treasury Solicitor's Department and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/8">The Treasury Solicitor's Department is not a main Department and is not, therefore, covered by a Public Service Agreement. However, the Department was required to produce and agree with the Attorney General and HM Treasury a Corporate Plan covering the Spending Review 2002 period. This included new performance targets and for accounting purposes covers the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers and the HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid=".380W.3/9">The Department's Corporate Plan was placed in the House of Commons and House of Lords Libraries and on the Department's website. Copies were also made available to all staff through the Department's Intranet. The presentational copies for these purposes were produced in-house at opportunity cost. The only direct cost incurred was &pound;650 for colour photocopying for an additional 60 copies for senior management, other key staff and clients.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June 2003</phrase> the Crown Prosecution Service will be launching a new law scholarship programme, which will sponsor administration and clerical employees to become qualified lawyers.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.3/2">The programme will start with &pound;4.78 million over three years and will sponsor 216 law scholars (rising to 338 in 2005&ndash;06) who will get their fees paid and will be supported at work.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.3/3">As well as widening access to the legal profession the programme will extend the availability of Higher education to those with no post-school qualifications, and will assist in the recruitment and retention of CPS employees.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.3/4">The Treasury Solicitor's Department and Serious Fraud Office offer vacation placements under a scheme operated on behalf of the Government Legal Service by the Government Legal Service Secretariat. Through such placements students get an insight into the unique perspective of the law within Government while having the opportunity to sample the attractions of Government legal work as a career choice. The scheme has operated successfully for several years, though we keep it under constant review to see how it could be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.3/5">Seventy six places were offered in 2002 by 12 Government Legal Service Departments. Of these Treasury Solicitor's Department offered 20 places and the Serious Fraud Office offered two places. The scheme is targeted at second year law students and final year non-law students. Departments pay a modest allowance to cover travelling and other expenses but there is no specific contribution to university fees.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.3/6">The Treasury Solicitor's Department, along with a number of other Government Departments, also provides six-month work placements on an annual basis to students from Brunel University who are undertaking a four-year sandwich law degree course. In 2002 there were seven such students. They are paid during their work placement, but there is no specific contribution to university fees.</p>
	<p pid=".381W.3/7">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers are both very small departments and do not have work placement schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".386W.2/2">DFID has so far committed &pound;115 million towards humanitarian assistance in Iraq. This finance is channelled though the organisations best placed to deliver assistance on the ground: United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and NGOs. We have set aside a further &pound;95 million for additional needs as they emerge.</p>
	<p pid=".386W.2/3">In addition, HM Treasury has earmarked an extra &pound;60 million from the Central Reserve to meet humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Iraq. &pound;5 million of this has been allocated to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to fund UK secondees to the Coalition Provisional Authority. The remaining &pound;55 million remains available as required.</p>
	<p pid=".386W.2/4">The World Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations are undertaking social and economic needs assessments for Iraq. Decisions on future DFID assistance for reconstruction will reflect the needs identified in these assessments as well as the inputs proposed by other donors. We expect a donor conference on Iraq to be convened in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".391W.2/1">The Home Office is committed to promoting equality and diversity for the communities we serve and also for our staff. This accords with the Department's purpose of working with individuals and communities to build a safe, just and tolerant society and our aim to support strong and active communities in which people of all races and backgrounds are valued and participate on equal terms. The Home Office published its Race Equality Scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-25">25 April 2002</phrase>, in line with the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. We have identified a number of areas of our work as having a high potential impact on race equality and race relations, including policies on reducing crime and disorder, on police leadership, powers and relations with the public, on victims of crime, on drugs and on active communities, community cohesion and race relations. Our scheme commits us to assessing and consulting on new policies, and monitoring policies generally, for their impact on race equality and race relations.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.2/2">The Police Complaints Authority, National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service and Commission for Racial Equality have all published race equality schemes in line with the requirements of the Act. Although not required to do so, the Central Police Development and Training Agency (Centrex) has also published such a scheme; and the Parole Board, which has already produced an action plan against racial discrimination, on which it has consulted the Commission, is preparing a scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.2/3">Mr right hon. Friend the Home Secretary appointed Mary Coussey as Independent Race Monitor for ministerial authorisations to discriminate on grounds of nationality, and of national and ethnic origin, in immigration and nationality functions. Her first interim report was published in November 2002. The Prison Service is in the process of revising its Race Equality Action Plan to take account of issues raised by the Commission for Racial Equality following the Commission's formal investigation of the Service.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.2/4">The Home Office has published a number of reports setting out the results of monitoring of the position of minority ethnic people in relation to our policies and employment practices, for example the Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2002 report, published in March 2003; and the milestone report on the Home Secretary's Race Equality Employment Targets (covering staff targets for the Home Office and Prison, Police, Fire and Probation Services), published in January 2003. We are currently collating and analysing data from monitoring of the Home Office's own employment processes relating to the first year of operation of the Department's Race Equality Scheme and expect to be in a position to publish the results in September 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.3/1">An Afghanistan Health Resources Assessment was carried out on behalf of the Ministry of Health by Management Sciences for Health in 2002. This national survey gathered information about the location and facilities of hospitals and health centres, services provided, human resources and rehabilitation needs.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.3/2">The survey identified 21 regional/national hospitals, 41 provincial hospitals and 114 district hospitals. 87 per cent. of the 1,038 hospitals and health facilities identified are presently operating.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.3/3">The survey identified 8,445 beds in 210 health facilities (approximately 1 bed for every 2,500 people). Most of these beds are located in urban areas&mdash;Kabul in particular. On average, developing countries have 2.7 hospital beds per 1,000 population. The survey suggests that Afghanistan has 0.4 of a bed per 1,000 population.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.3/4">There are approximately 2,300 doctors (approximately 0.1 per 1,000 population), (average rate in developing countries 1.1). There are massive shortages of nurses and qualified birth attendants: doctors make up over a quarter of all health workers. 40 per cent. of facilities providing basic health care have no female health provider. This is extremely important in this largely conservative Muslim country with strong taboos against female patients being treated by male health providers.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.3/5">Over 80 per cent. of health facilities currently receive external support for drugs and supplies. The availability of five of the most important primary care level drugs was good, at 90 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.5/1">The Government are committed to biomass and have launched a number of programmes to support and promote bioenergy in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/2">The Bioenergy Capital Grants Scheme (BCGS), joint-funded by DTI and the New Opportunities Fund and worth &pound;66 million, will support the early deployment of biomass-fired technology and builds on support made available under the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). The BCGS, launched in February 2002, has proven very popular and has become over-subscribed with funds now fully allocated. In total, 21 projects across the UK will be supported by the Scheme, covering heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation from biomass.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/3">DEFRA, as part of its England Rural Development Programme, has made available &pound;29 million for the establishment of energy crops including short rotation coppice (SRC) and miscanthus under the Energy Crops Scheme. A further &pound;3.5 million is to be made available for the establishment of infrastructure to facilitate the harvest and supply of energy crops to the power generator.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/4">The Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, co-ordinated by the Forestry Commission in mainland UK and Forest Services in Northern Ireland, provides grants to create and manage woodland, which can help in the production of wood fuel. The Woodland Grant Scheme also supports the establishment of SRC in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/5">The Clear Skies Initiative, a &pound;10 million grants programme launched by DTI in February 2003, supports eligible community and domestic wood fired heating projects.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/6">Biomass is also supported through the Renewables Obligation, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, and electricity supplied by dedicated biomass plant or through co-firing will qualify for Renewable Obligation Certificates and be exempt from the Climate Change Levy (CCL).</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/7">Finally, grants are available for research, development and demonstration projects through the DTI's &pound;19 million New and Renewable Energy Programme. There are two calls for proposals to the Programme each year. Work on improving the yield and pest resistance of energy crops and developing advanced conversion technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis has progressed through the Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/8">The Government will continue to review the level of support given to biomass and explore new ideas and opportunities to further promote this renewable energy resource in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.2/1">At least two major new settlements have been established within the expanded municipal boundaries of East Jerusalem. Two new settlements have been established in the West Bank. We have concerns about another four settlements in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip. In addition, we estimate that around 108 settlement outposts have been established in the period 1993&ndash;2003, some as far as 2 km from existing buildings. The combination of expanding settlements, the Eastern Ring Road and Route 80 will effectively isolate Jerusalem from the West Bank. Other settler roads (Routes 55, 57 and 505) divide the West Bank in an east-west direction. Settlers control 42 per cent. of the West Bank and 15 per cent. of the Gaza Strip.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.2/2">These figures are the most authoritative available, as it is difficult to get accurate statistics about settlement activity. In particular, the number of settlement outposts is fluid. The Israel Defence Forces began dismantling a number of outposts on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-09">9 June 2003</phrase>; most of which are uninhabited. Settlers have vowed to establish more. We are monitoring the situation closely.</p>

Friend to the report, &quot;Israeli Settlements in the West Bank and Gaza&quot;, which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary presented to the Foreign Affairs Committee early this year.

There has been ongoing correspondence between the Departments officials and their counterparts in the US. This is because the US pensions system, and their corporate structure more generally, is most similar to the UK position.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.5/3">As a result of research into schemes in other countries, discussions with US counterparts, and the strong support expressed by respondents for this option in the Pensions Green Paper &quot;Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement&quot; (Cm 5677), we decided to introduce a compulsory compensation scheme for the protection of employees of insolvent firms.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.5/4">On June 11 2003 the Secretary of State announced our decision in the House, and we published an Action plan: &quot;Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement&mdash;Action on occupational pensions&quot; (Cm 5835) setting out a package of measures to strengthen protection for pension scheme members and ease the burden on companies running schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.5/5">We plan to establish a new independent organisation called the &quot;Pensions Protection Fund&quot; (PPF) in order to protect members of defined benefit pension schemes whose sponsoring employer has become insolvent. Where the pension scheme has insufficient assets to meet the PPF guarantee, the compensation scheme will pay the guaranteed level of benefits to scheme members as they fall due.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.5/6">The PPF will be funded by a levy on all defined benefit pension schemes. The levy will contain both a flat rate and a risk-based component, based on an assessment of the degree of underfunding in the particular scheme. Those schemes that are most underfunded will therefore have to pay a higher rate.</p>
	<p pid=".412W.5/7">Pensioners will be guaranteed to receive 100 per cent. of their pension, and non-pensioners will be guaranteed to receive 90 per cent. of the pension they have accrued.</p>

	<p pid=".413W.5/1">On average, older pensioners receive less income from all sources than younger pensioners. This is illustrated in the following table. There are two main reasons for the difference in occupational pension income. First, the rapid rise in occupational pension coverage in the late 1950s and 1960s has been more beneficial for the younger of today's pensioners. Secondly, before retirement the value of occupational pensions is broadly linked with earnings growth over time. After retirement the value of pensions in payment is broadly linked to prices. Other things being equal, an older pensioner who has been retired for longer will, therefore, have a lower occupational pension than the equivalent younger pensioner.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.5/2">Information showing how incomes change over time at the individual or household level requires data on the same individuals over time. The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing is following a sample of people aged 50 and over for a number of years. The survey collects detailed information about income and assets and, in due course, will provide up-to-date information on how incomes from different sources, including, occupational and personal pensions, change overtime at the individual level. A report from the first wave of the study is due in December 2003 but information about changes over time will only be available after the second wave.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.3/1">The married women who opted to pay reduced rate contributions made an informed choice. They were required to give written notice of their decision on a form attached to a leaflet. The leaflet went to great lengths to describe the consequences of that decision and required them to sign a declaration that they had read and understood the leaflet. Employers could not make this decision on behalf of their employees. Women who chose to pay reduced rate national insurance contributions were given a certificate to give to their employer. An employer was not allowed to deduct reduced rate national insurance contributions without this certificate. It would be unfair to those married women who chose to pay the full rate contribution to retrospectively put married women who paid the reduced rate contribution in the same position.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.3/2">All married women are able to get a basic state pension based on their husband's contributions of 60 per cent. of his entitlement once both have reached state pension age and have claimed their state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.3/3">In the recent pensions Green Paper: 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement' we have proposed looking at how best to ensure that women are aware of their pension position and the choices they make.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.3/4">We recognise that the majority of pensioners are women and are committed to ensuring that our pension reforms improve women's pension rights. We have already done much to help. The introduction of stakeholder pensions, State Second Pension, winter fuel payments, improvements to the minimum income guarantee and, from this October, pension credit are, or will be, of particular help to women. We are also extending home responsibilities protection to foster carers to help protect their basic state pension entitlement whilst they are doing this valuable job. This will particularly benefit women since they form the majority of foster carers.</p>

It has improved accessibility for partially sighted and blind people through the use of the access key system throughout the site on the most commonly used links.

	<p pid=".420W.8/1">Under the homelessness legislation local authorities have a duty to provide advice and assistance about homelessness and the prevention of homelessness. This service must be available free of charge to anyone in their district, including young people in housing need. Last year, the Government extended the groups who have a priority need for accommodation under the legislation. The new groups include a number of young homeless people, including 16 and 17-year-olds, care leavers aged 18 to 20 and people over 20 who are vulnerable as a result of having been in care (except those for whom local social services authorities have responsibility).</p>
	<p pid=".420W.8/2">Through the July 2002 Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister issued guidance to housing authorities about discharging their duties under the homelessness legislation. The guidance emphasises that, in dealing with 16 and 17-year-olds who may have left home because of a temporary breakdown in their relationship with their family, local authorities should consider reconciliation with the family as a first response. It also highlights the fact that many young homeless applicants, particularly 16 and 17-year olds who are homeless and estranged from their family, will be vulnerable and in need of support. The guidelines also make it clear that housing authorities will need to recognise that accommodation solutions for this client group are likely to be unsuccessful if the necessary support is not provided and close liaison with social services and the Supporting People team will be essential.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.8/3">Advice on specialist services for homeless young people is also included in &quot;Homelessness Strategies&mdash;A good practice handbook&quot; issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.8/4">Specialist Personal Advisers in the Connexions Service also play a key role in ensuring that those under 20 in housing need are linked into housing advice services. They should also advise other Personal Advisers working with young people in housing need. The former Rough Sleepers Unit worked closely with the Connexions Service to develop the &quot;Working together&quot; guidance highlighting the strategic links that the Connexions Service should make with local authority homelessness strategies and voluntary agencies working with young people in providing effective housing advice.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.8/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funds Shelter's National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS). NHAS is a secondary advice and support service provided by Shelter in partnership with the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and has been supported by Government since it was established in 1990. In addition, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funds agencies such as Alone in London and Centrepoint who work with young people, to promote family mediation, re-establish contact and negotiate a return home or respite care.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.3/1">Buprenorphine is already included in the treatment protocols developed in conjunction with national health service services at eight prison service establishments. The prison service's standard for clinical services for substance misusers requires every establishment which receives prisoners from court to have detoxification guidelines in place for at least one of methadone, lofexidine, and dihydrocodeine. It also states that, as new evidence becomes available on the chemical management of detoxification or abstinence, establishments should develop further treatment guidelines which are in line with those available in the NHS. Prison health keeps the question of a formal trial of buprenorphine in prisons in England under review, but expects its use to develop at a similar pace to the growth in its use in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/2">More generally, the National Treatment Agency (NTA) has a responsibility to maintain the research base and to prioritise and disseminate findings to enhance quality of care. Consideration of the use of buprenorphine forms part of the NTA's activity, including receiving advice from experts on prescribing issues. The NTA advocates a range of treatment options following adequate assessment of need and works with local drug action teams (DATs) to ensure an appropriate range of provision is developed locally.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/3">There is already a body of evidence for the efficacy of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid dependence. The level of evidence does not suggest that buprenorphine should replace methadone as a substitution treatment, but rather that buprenorphine should now be considered an evidence-based addition to the range of pharmacological maintenance treatments. Information from specialists indicates that there has been an increase in the use of buprenorphine in the United Kingdom as an alternative to methadone.</p>

	<p pid=".433W.5/2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued its full guidance on the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for diabetes in February 2003. The guidance states that insulin pump therapy is an option for some people with type 1 diabetes. Health professionals are expected to take full account of this guidance when exercising their clinical judgment. Hospital consultants may prescribe equipment such as insulin pumps as part of national health service treatment. It is for the NHS locally to make decisions about the best use of its resources on the basis of its priorities and needs.</p>

	<p pid=".433W.8/1">The Department of Health has not commissioned research into enuresis and its effect on long term mental health. However, there is a well documented association between enuresis and psychiatric disorder in community samples of children, though the causal relationships between the two may vary from child to child. A survey of the mental health of children and adolescents in Great Britain (commissioned by the Department of Health and conducted by the Office for National Statistics in 1999) found that 23 per cent. of children who wet their beds had a mental disorder compared with a prevalence of mental disorder of 10 per cent. for all children assessed in the survey. No single specific disorder nor psychiatric symptom is associated with enuresis and the majority of children cease to wet their beds by adolescence. Persistence of enuresis, particularly beyond adolescence and into adulthood, can cause significant distress, affect self-esteem and may interfere with the confidence required to establish close relationships.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.2/3">The MRC spent an estimated &pound;11.9 million in 2001&ndash;02 on its respiratory disorders portfolio. Although this does not include any specific research into hayfever, it does include work on allergies.</p>
	<p pid=".435W.2/4">There is no ongoing research in the Department of Health into hayfever but the Department commissioned a study on air pollution and general practitioner consultations for allergic rhinitis (hayfever) from St. George's Hospital, London, as part of its last air pollution and health research programme. The study (by Hajal <i>et al</i>) was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology (volume 153, page 704) in 2001.</p>

It will set national standards and provide a national direction for renal services that will need to be achieved over 10 years. The renal standards will sit alongside a programme for reform and sustained investment in the national health service.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.5/1">The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended the use of anti-TNF therapy in March 2002. We have issued directions obliging strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to provide appropriate funding for treatments recommended by NICE. This is in line with our manifesto commitment to ensure that patients receive drugs and treatments recommended by NICE on the national health service if considered appropriate by their clinicians. The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) and NICE have agreed a methodology for CHI to incorporate the monitoring of NICE guidance in its clinical governance reviews. Specifically CHI now looks to see if NHS trusts have mechanisms in place to implement and comply with NICE guidance. CHI will also support and facilitate clinicians to discuss when NICE guidance is and is not followed on an individual patient basis.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.5/2">There are no specific national targets relating to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, maximum waiting times have already been reduced to 21 weeks for a first out-patient appointment from general practitioner referral, and national targets have been set for further reductions. Rheumatoid arthritis patients waiting for first out-patient appointments stand to benefit from these improvements.</p>
