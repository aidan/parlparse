	<p pid="a.752W.6/2">All PRUs are very different, and as a result the average running cost will vary widely depending on the individual characteristics of the PRU. However dividing the total planned expenditure on the provision of education at PRUs in England in 2004&ndash;05 (as recorded on local authorities 2004&ndash;05 section 52 budget statement) by the total number of PRUs in England as at January 2004 gives an estimated average planned running cost of around &pound;466,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.752W.9/1">Government support for capital investment in schools has risen to &pound;4.9 billion this year, will be &pound;5.5 billion next year, &pound;5.8 billion in 2006&ndash;07 and will reach &pound;6.3 billion by 2007&ndash;08. All schools and local authorities will benefit from this programme, which includes flexibility for local authorities and schools to prioritise expenditure on the areas they consider most important, including playgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.9/2">The Big Lottery Fund (BLF) is providing around &pound;81 million, through the New Opportunities for Physical Education and Sport programme, towards playground improvements in England. This includes playground markings, improvements to drainage and refurbishing existing facilities. We are also working with the BLF to ensure that these facilities will fully complement the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. This programme aims to renew the secondary school estate (including playgrounds) in 15 waves starting from 2005&ndash;06. Schools, local authorities and their partners are encouraged to look as widely as possible at all educational needs, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.9/3">Furthermore, the Sporting Playgrounds programme is supporting &pound;10 million of capital investment between April 2003 and March 2005. This will enhance around 600 primary school playgrounds to increase physical/sporting activities and improve behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.752W.9/4">For the past three years the Department has also provided &pound;250,000 a year to Learning through Landscape, which has encouraged schools to improve and develop their grounds for curriculum-related use.</p>

Unauthorised absence includes absence due to lateness or family holidays taken during term time without the school's permission, as well as truancy. Recent research in to pupil absence suggests that around 2 per cent. of secondary school pupils are persistent truants, responsible for almost half of all unauthorised absence in secondary schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.754W.3/1">Democracy building is a strategic priority of the UK's support to Iraq, as set out in DFID's Iraq Country Assistance Plan (February 2004). DFID works closely with the FCO to support and encourage a stable, united and law abiding state that provides effective and representative government, sustainable economic growth and rising living standards for all Iraqi citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.3/2">DFID has funded a number of initiatives to support democracy-building activities in Iraq. These have included $10 million in support of the Independent Elections Commission of Iraq (IECI) for the recent elections; and funding for two advisers to the UN team supporting the IECI. DFID's &pound;5 million Political Participation Fund (PPF) supports initiatives which aim to increase opportunities for political representation and participation in the political process. Projects funded so far include voter education and media and monitors' training for the recent elections. There is no specific allocation to support for women, but the project has a particular focus on supporting women's participation in the political process. So far nine projects amounting to over &pound;300,000 have been specifically targeted at women.</p>

	<p pid="a.757W.10/4">However, many countries are still having to choose between servicing their debt and investing in health, education, infrastructure and other areas necessary to allow them to attain the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the UK is proposing that we match bilateral debt relief of up to 100 per cent. with multilateral debt relief of up to 100 per cent. The UK will provide its share, approximately 10 per cent., of multilateral debt owed by eligible countries to the International Development Association and African Development Bank, and will continue to call on others to join us in this initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.3/1">The negotiations on the rural development regulation are continuing and throughout discussions the UK has been pushing for the necessary flexibility for member states to implement rural development programmes which reflect each countries priorities and circumstances and deliver the maximum public benefits.

Devolved officials generally deal direct with the Commission on issues relating to devolved rural development programmes.

	<p pid="a.768W.8/1">The England Rural Delivery Programme (ERDP) contributes to the delivery of the Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food by helping farmers and foresters to respond better to consumer requirements and become more competitive, diverse, flexible and environmentally responsible. It also provides help to rural businesses and communities which need to adapt and develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.8/2">The ERDP provides a framework for the operation of 10 separate but integrated schemes which provide new opportunities to protect and improve the countryside, to develop sustainable enterprises and to help rural communities to thrive. A total of &pound;1.6 billion of EU and Government money is being made available under these schemes in England during the seven years (2000&ndash;06) of the Programme. Within Lancashire there a re nine ERPD funded schemes available of which the Rural Development Service administers seven. These are, Countryside Stewardship Scheme, Rural Enterprise Scheme, Process and Marketing Scheme, Vocational Training Scheme, Energy Crop Scheme, Organic Farm Scheme and Farm Woodland Premium Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.8/3">The Rural Payments Agency and Forestry Commission administer the Hill Farm Allowance and Woodland Grant Scheme respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.8/4">To date, within Lancashire, the ERDP has funded (through RDS administered schemes) &pound;3 million of projects and training as well as annual payments of &pound;2.5 million to CSS agreement holders.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.8/5">The Forestry Commission as yet does not currently make specific allocations to counties, but it is moving towards regional allocations through the Regional Forestry Framework and it is envisaged that this will in turn lead to county allocations. During 2004 the Woodland Grant Scheme paid out &pound;300,000 towards new planting and woodland management plans. Within the constituency of Chorley, the total ERDP payments for 2004 were &pound;152,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.8/6">Defra will shortly launch a new scheme called Environmental Stewardship (ES). ES will be launched in England early 2005 to replace the existing agri-environment schemes (Environmentally Sensitive Areas, Countryside Stewardship and Organic Farming Schemes). ES has been developed with a high level of public consultation and a significant and much appreciated contribution from stakeholder organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.771W.5/1">Since announcing the Rural Strategy in July 2004 we have made excellent progress. Our reforms are aimed at delivering services more efficiently, through a smaller number of organisations with clearer and more accountable roles. We are devolving delivery to give a better deal for the environment and the taxpayer and the overarching principle is sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/2">Work is now under way to identify clear priorities and simple processes in each region of England. In order to explore better ways of supporting rural communities we have identified a local &quot;rural pathfinder&quot; for each region. We are working with these rural pathfinders to test innovative ways of improving local delivery and they are currently developing their plans. From this April, rural socio-economic funding will be mainstreamed through Rural Development Agencies with an increase of &pound;27 million in their single pot allocation to &pound;72 million from Defra. Rural community councils will be funded directly by Defra and some further social and community funds will be channelled through Government Offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/3">Everyone will benefit from our radical simplification of funding streams. Rural businesses are being helped by an additional &pound;2 million that Defra has provided to Business Links this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/4">We are establishing a smaller, more focused body to act as a strong voice for rural people and communities, especially those facing disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/5">Dr. Stuart Burgess has been appointed as the Chair of the Countryside Agency and Rural Advocate. By April 2005 the new organisation&mdash;the Commission for Rural Communities&mdash;will have been established as a distinct body, initially within the existing legal framework. It will use its statutory independent voice to hold to account those who deliver to the countryside and rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/6">In order to conserve and enhance the resource of nature and realise the economic benefits of so doing, we are establishing an Integrated Agency consisting of English Nature, most of the Rural Development Service and parts of the Countryside Agency. We have already initiated closer working at the regional level between these three organisations, as part of preparing for the establishment of the new Agency. We are moving the Rural Development Service out of the policy core of Defra and providing it with greater autonomy and devolved authority for decision-making and delivery, and, in order to pave the way for the Service to move into being part of the new Integrated Agency, we have appointed Poul Christensen to chair a small non executive board. From April 2005 the bodies that will make up the Integrated Agency will have begun working as a confederation of partners as a precursor to the full establishment of the Integrated Agency by legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-10">Thursday 10 February</phrase>, we published (in draft) a Bill to implement those elements of the Rural Strategy that require primary legislation&mdash;including full establishment of the Integrated Agency and the Commission for Rural Communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.5/8">By April we will also have begun delivering benefits to taxpayers through beginning the process of delivering around &pound;21 million of efficiency gains per year by 2009&ndash;10.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/2">The key elements of the proposed transfer arrangements, which have been the subject of consultation with members of the Royal Parks Constabulary (RPC) and their union representatives, are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/3">RPC pay rates are pegged at 85.5 per cent. of MPS rates; officers transferring to the MPS as constables will therefore immediately benefit from a higher rate of pay, as well as the much improved career prospects which the MPS is able to offer. Their length of service and rank will be recognised, and they will have the opportunity to remain in the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit for a maximum of 10 years. If an officer is ineligible, or chooses not to transfer as a constable but wishes to transfer as a Community Support Officer or member of police staff, then the MPS have agreed to maintain their rate of pay on a mark time basis for three years. If officers are ineligible to become MPS officers they will also have the option of redundancy, though we hope that few will be in this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/4">As civil servants, RPC officers are currently in the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS), whereas MPS officers are in the Police Pension Scheme (PPS). Officers transferring have the option of freezing their benefits in the PCSPS or transferring them to the PPS. We have worked very closely with the Government Actuary's Department on the arrangements for pensions transfers from the one to the other which are designed with the aim of providing at the time of retirement from the MPS a retirement package which will be at least as good as if they had remained in the PCSPS and retired at the same age.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/5">The current retirement age for RPC officers is 60, subject to continuing satisfactory health, conduct and performance. For MPS officers the retirement age is 55, but the maximum retirement age is also 60, subject to application for, and annual approval of, extension of service. Annual extensions take into account health, conduct and efficiency, and the continuing requirement for the role. So RPC officers transferring will, subject to these requirements, have the opportunity to continue until 60.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/6">The Police Act 1996 allows any person who was a member of a trade union immediately before joining a force to retain membership of that union with the consent of the Chief Officer. I understand that all requests from officers to retain union membership after their transfer to the MPS have been approved, and I see no reason why future requests should not also be approved.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.3/2">Tables 1A and 1B show full-time appointments for the calendar years 1975&ndash;97. The figures include appointments of Judicial officers to full time Tribunal posts for Tribunals administered by DCA (formerly Lord Chancellor's Department) but exclude those administered by other Government Departments (such as the Employment Tribunal and The Appeal Service and its pre 1999 predecessor The Independent Tribunal Service). These tables also include lay magistrates appointments from 1990 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.3/3">Figures for the appointment and the gender split of part time judicial officers between 1975 and 1997, and for lay magistrates prior to 1990 is not given, as DCA does not hold complete figures on the appointment and gender of these judicial officers who were appointed during these periods, and those that exist could only be determined at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.3/4">The gender split for full-time and part-time judicial officer appointments for each year between 1998&ndash;2004 is set out in tables 2A-D. These figures are obtained from the Judicial Appointments Annual Reports to Parliament for each of the financial years from 1998&ndash;2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.3/5">It is also necessary to mention that while every care has been taken, the figures supplied for the years 1975&ndash;98 may not be wholly complete as they are drawn from very old records. For some of the very early appointments, the DCA have only a surname and initials thus it is not absolutely certain what the gender was, and in these cases, on the basis that there were very few women in the judiciary that long ago, it has been assumed that they are men.</p>

	<p pid="a.799W.9/2">The original contract price for the design and construction cost of the two Swan Hunter Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) ships, Largs Bay and Lyme Bay, was &pound;148 million and the anticipated cost is now &pound;235 million. The Ministry of Defence has made a provision of &pound;40 million in the 2003&ndash;04 Accounts for delay and dislocation costs in respect to the two LSD(A)s that BAE Systems are building and has already paid &pound;16 million as an initial payment. Negotiations continue on the final settlement figure with the company. As further disclosure could prejudice these negotiations I am withholding further information under the commercial interests exemption of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The MOD will not be pursuing a claim from Swan Hunter in respect of providing information to BAE Systems as this would seriously jeopardise company's ability to delivery the Landing Ship Dock Auxiliary capability. The Swan Hunter undertook the engineering risk in delivering against the original contract. However, in September 2003, when the company announced that it could not absorb the risk and complete the contract at the agreed price and timescale, both financial and timescale risks were in effect transferred to the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.9/3">This new Landing Ship Dock Auxiliary class will provide a significantly enhanced capability that will enable the faster deployment of troops, vehicles and stores into operational and front line areas, at a safer distance and in worse sea conditions than the Landing Ships they will replace. The construction of Largs Bay and Lyme Bay is virtually complete and the retention of Swan Hunter as the lead yard offers MOD and the taxpayer the best value for money solution for delivering this new capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.806W.5/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Counter Terrorism Policy Department (CTPD) receives electronically an average of around 270 intelligence reports a week. As Sir Michael Jay, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the FCO, foreshadowed to the Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2003, the number of officers dealing with these reports has been increased&mdash;from two to five. These officers immediately alert all other FCO colleagues who need to be aware of particular reports, and ensure that any necessary action is set in hand&mdash;for example, prompt revision of FCO Travel Advice. CTPD is supported by a team of three FCO officers located within the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC)&mdash;a multi-agency body which brings together those involved across government in assessing and reporting of terrorist threat intelligence. This arrangement ensures that CTPD has advance notice of JTAC threat reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.814W.4/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the benefit offices earmarked for closure in Scotland. This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.4/4" class="indent">I have attached, at Annex A, a list of sites in Scotland that have either been closed, merged or are planned for closure as part of the Jobcentre Plus rollout programme and activity to centralise benefit processing. This list includes Social Security Offices, Jobcentres, Jobcentre Plus and Caller Offices in Scotland. Some of the site closures are dependent on the construction of new buildings or the acquisition of new premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.4/5" class="indent">It may be helpful if I explain that we are shaping the future Jobcentre Plus network in response to changing business needs. The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by new business processes and the use of information technology. For example, nationally, over the last 12 months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch website. Encouraging our customers to use these new channels enables us to focus on those customers who need greatest help. We are also working with local partners to establish a Flexible Service Delivery, which will provide our customers with access to our services on third party premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.4/6" class="indent">I can assure you that we are committed to providing a high standard of customer service in Scotland and we will retain a significant network of offices through which customers can access our services.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.4/7" class="indent">I hope you find this helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.822W.0/1">Reducing the numbers of people on incapacity benefits by one million is a long term aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.0/2">This long-term aspiration is challenging. It will require continued macroeconomic stability and further radical welfare reform to build on the success that has already been achieved. New claims are already down by 30 per cent. since 1997. The caseload has peaked after decades when the numbers increased&mdash;particularly in the 1990s when the caseload trebled. And in the latest two quarters there have been the first signs of a fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.0/3">It is not possible to put a firm timetable on this. Not only does it require legislative changes we also need to review the evidence from the successful Pathways to Work pilots and successfully roll-out the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.0/4">We are already making progress. The significant improvement in off-flow rates registered in the pathways to work pilots, with 5,500 job entries up to last August, also shows for the first time how significant additional numbers of people on incapacity benefits can be helped back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.0/5">Realisation of our aspiration will depend on further evidence from pathways (for example on the impact of work-focused interviews for existing claimants, starting this month) and other initiatives. It will also depend on when we can start to understand the additional impact of the new arrangements set out in the five year strategy. Outside of DWP it will also depend on the scale of progress on, for example, fitness for work issues and progress on employers' sickness absence management policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.0/6">Progress towards our aspiration should come, in part, from improving support so people do not need to come onto IB, that is, reducing inflows and improving off-flows by helping more people to leave the benefit for work.</p>

	<p pid="a.822W.3/2">Taxation is a matter for the Chancellor, but it is proposed to tax the lump sum at the marginal rate (currently 10 per cent., 22 per cent., 40 per cent. or if not liable to tax&mdash;no deduction) applicable to the person's other income, either in the tax year in which the person starts drawing his State Pension or, if the person so chooses, the tax year following. Payment of a lump sum will not count as income for the age-related personal allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.823W.3/1">During the five-year period for which figures are readily available (<phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>) funding from Northern Ireland central Government sources has been made available to the Andersonstown News Group (ANG) from a number of Northern Ireland Departments. The state aids approval position in respect of this funding is detailed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/2" class="italic">Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI)</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/3">DETI offered &pound;92,248 under the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation's (Peace I) Interest Relief Subsidy Scheme (a scheme offered through local banks, subject to scrutiny by DETI and the European Investment Bank). This was notified to the European Commission and clearance received.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/4">DETI offered &pound;270,000 under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (Peace II) for workspace units (not related to the ANG's printing and publishing of newspapers.) This was assessed against state aid rules and was deemed not to be state aid as the support was not considered to have the potential to distort competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/5">The Local Enterprise Development Unit (a predecessor body of Invest NI) provided funding for marketing, employment and management salary grants. This funding was issued under a notified scheme approved by the European Union Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/6">Support of &pound;37,056 for training and development was provided under the Company Development Programme (CDP)(now managed by Invest NI). In 1993 the Commission formally acknowledged CDP as a regional aid scheme. In 1998 the Commission required all training support to be compliant with a new framework on training aid. At that stage action to re-notify was started but not followed through. To address this the block exemption report on CDP issued to the Commissioners on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-27">27 July 2004</phrase> and the Commission acknowledgement was dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-30">30 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/7">DETI are providing funding of &pound;4,000 via InterTradeIreland <sup>1</sup> through the Acumen programme. This programme is designed to stimulate cross-border trade by assisting individual SME's with tailored consultancy and sales salary support mechanisms. The programme is a partnership funded by Invest NI, Enterprise Ireland (in the Republic of Ireland) and InterTradelreland. The programme was treated as exempt under the SME Block Exemption. This has been registered with the European Commission</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/8" class="italic">Office of First Minister Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM)</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/9">Funding of &pound;33,500 provided by OFMDFM was for the Irish language newspaper <i>L&aacute;</i>. As it was the only Irish language newspaper in existence OFMDFM took the view that there was no distortion or potential distortion of competition and consequently the state aid rules would not be applicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/10" class="italic">Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP)</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/11">Peace I funding of &pound;5,095 was provided by DFP under the District Partnerships Sub Programme for which Department of the Environment had oversight. This funding was for accommodation and administration costs. The amount involved did not exceed &euro;100,000 and accordingly was within the Commission's established relevant de-minimis arrangements for small amounts of aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/12">DFP in Northern Ireland and the Department of Finance in the Republic of Ireland, have approved funding of &pound;199,150 in respect of a joint application from Preas an Phobail and Comharchumann Forbartha. Funding is for the expansion of <i>L&aacute;</i> in selected border areas. The funding complies with state aid regulations on the basis that it is the only existing Irish language newspaper and does not have the potential to distort competition between EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/13" class="italic">Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL)</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/14">The Arts Council for Northern Ireland (a non-departmental public body of DCAL) provided &pound;54,400 funding towards the production of La. The amount involved did not exceed &euro;100,000 and accordingly was within the Commission's established relevant de-minimis arrangements for small amounts of aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/15">DCAL, through Foras na Gaeilge <sup>2</sup> the Irish Language Agency, has provided funding of &pound;148,439 for the publication of La. DCAL has been advised by Foras that the aid is compatible with European Union law on state aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/16" class="italic">Department of Social Development (PSD)</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/17">DSD provided &pound;277,375 under the Department's Urban Development Grant (UDG) scheme (<phrase class="date" code="1999-11-23">23 November 1999</phrase>) to assist the construction of new purpose built printworks and offices. The UDG scheme has been notified to the European Commission who consider it to be compatible with the EC Treaty. Consequently, UDG funding to the <i>Andersonstown News</i> is compatible with state aid rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/18">DSD also provided &pound;70,000 via Making Belfast Work (MBW) (March 2000). MBW is designed to augment mainstream spend by Departments in the most deprived areas of Belfast across a range of community interventions. At the time of funding, the <i>Andersonstown News</i> was a local community newspaper which did not trade across boundaries, and the content of which meant that it was not considered to have the potential to be tested across national boundaries. Following an internal economic appraisal the grant was not considered to support a tradable activity because the paper was unique and covered only local community issues. This funding was therefore not considered to be a notifiable state aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/19" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> InterTradeIreland (the Trade and Business Development Body) is funded jointly by DETI in Northern Ireland and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) in the Republic of Ireland. DETI contributes 33.3 per cent. and DETE 66.6 per cent. of the funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/20" class="indent"><sup>2</sup> Foras na Gaeilge (the Irish Language Agency of the North/South Language Implementation Body) is funded jointly by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) in Northern Ireland and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DCGRA) in the Republic of Ireland. DCAL contributes 25 per cent. and DCGRA contributes 75 per cent. of the funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.825W.5/1">The Criminal Justice Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 provides the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with a power to prescribe categories of offences which are 'of the same type' for use as an indicator that a defendant has a propensity to commit offences of a certain type. The draft proposed Criminal Justice (Evidence) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 (Categories of Offences) Order 2005 proposes two such categories of offences: Part I deals with offences of theft; Part II deals with sexual offences against persons aged under the age of 17.</p>

Both Part I and Part II categories are intended as a guide to the judiciary. Nor does the absence of categories for other types of offences prevent previous convictions from being admitted if they demonstrate a propensity to commit a certain type of offence. Further categories may be introduced at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="a.831W.2/4" class="indent">The unscreened combined sewer overflow to which you refer is situated on the main sewer in Whiterock to the northwest of the boat park. Its purpose is to prevent out of sewer flooding during periods of heavy rain, when the flow in the main sewer can exceed its capacity, by discharging the excess flow into Whiterock Bay. Combined sewer overflows are a common feature on many sewerage systems in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.831W.2/5" class="indent">Water Service has no record of complaints about this particular combined sewer overflow or about sewage spillages in the Bay. However, if you can provide me with specific details of sewage spillages, I will have the matter investigated as a matter or urgency.</p>
