	<p pid="a.165W.3/7">The Government also announced that from 2011, they aim to reward biofuels under the RTFO only if the feedstocks from which they are produced meet appropriate sustainability standards, again subject to the provisos set out above. The RTFO draft Order provides for an 'Administrator' of the scheme, which will be a new non-departmental public body. They will have the power to require information from suppliers about the biofuel supplied and feedstocks used. The Government will ask the Administrator to report regularly on the impact on other sectors, and will consider carefully, in the light of these reports, whether any corrective action is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.167W.3/1">Recycling is strongly promoted by a range of Government policies. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is working to maximise the amount and quality of recyclate used in UK manufacturing operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.167W.3/2">The demand for recycled plastic is very strong, both from UK manufacturers and overseas markets. The UK currently recycles or recovers approximately 19 per cent. of all plastic consumed, and this is set to increase to over 25 per cent. by 2010. WRAP has a number of projects over the next two years which aim to switch manufacturing processes from virgin to recycled materials, including a target to support the recycling of an additional 16 kilo tonnes of plastic bottles&mdash;an increase of 30 per cent. from current levels. The use of recycled content in packaging is expanding rapidly, partly due to WRAP's work to stimulate this market.</p>
	<p pid="a.167W.3/3">The Waste Strategy for England 2007, which we published in May, focuses action on key waste materials for greater scope for improving environmental and economic outcomes, one of which is plastic. The strategy recognises that recycling plastics shows significant potential for carbon and energy savings through displacing virgin materials. Actions set out in the strategy include developing proposals (subject to further analysis) for higher packaging recycling targets beyond the 2008 EC Packaging Directive targets, and supporting WRAP in its work to increase recycling of plastics and the recycled content of certain plastic containers.</p>
	<p pid="a.167W.3/4">We have set demanding targets, both nationally and locally, for household waste recycling and composting and the Waste Strategy 2007 sets even higher national targets, to reach at least 40 per cent. by 2010, 45 per cent. by 2015 and 50 per cent. by 2020. These targets are not material-specific, but we expect the range of materials collected by local authorities, including plastics, to increase further as targets become more demanding and as collection and treatment capacity increases.</p>

	<p pid="a.168W.0/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has carried out some work on the plastic processing capacity/supply relationship; the indication is that the UK, along with most of Europe, does have some excess capacity to process plastic waste. The exception to this is for plastic bottles, and to some extent waste electrical and electronic equipment plastics, where growth in collection has supported a substantial growth in reprocessing capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.0/2">However, this is a complex area, and much of the existing capacity is too old, too small or targeting the wrong end products. Many plants are therefore investing in new capacity or updating and consolidating existing plants, some with support from WRAP. WRAP has a number of projects designed to maximise the amount and quality of recyclate, including plastic, used in UK manufacturing operations.</p>

The illegal trade in CITES species is one of the top UK wildlife crime priorities for 2007-08, with a particular focus on five species, including tortoises, that are threatened by illegal trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.168W.6/1">Since 2000 Defra, in partnership with WWF-UK, has been running a 'Souvenir Alert' campaign to help tackle the problem of holidaymakers unknowingly bringing back illegal wildlife souvenirs. The campaign advises travellers to be careful when buying souvenirs made from endangered wildlife, so that they do not contribute towards the devastating effect of illegal and unsustainable trade. It warns that bringing home souvenirs containing products derived from animals or plants protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) may require a permit or may even be prohibited.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.6/2">Defra takes its responsibilities under CITES seriously and continues to look for opportunities to raise awareness of CITES controls to ensure effective implementation.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.5/1">The rules of the Mercantile Marine scheme are currently contained in the War Pensions (Mercantile Marine) Scheme 1964. The scheme dates from the second world war and was intended to reflect the additional dangers of war over and above those normally found on board ship. The scheme therefore provides for awards to be made to members of the mercantile marine only in respect of &quot;war injuries&quot; (injuries caused by enemy action or in combating such action) and &quot;war risk injuries&quot; (injuries resulting from conditions on ship which would not be normal in peace time, such as measures to avoid or prevent enemy action). The scheme does not cover injuries or illnesses arising in peace time.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.5/2">Due to the historical nature of the scheme information on the total number of war pensions is not held. However I refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-17">17 October</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1125W, for the number of those currently in receipt of a pension.</p>

	<p pid="a.178W.6/1">The following table sets out the details of each drug seizure in which the Royal Navy was involved, for the financial year 2006-07. All the drug seizures detailed in the table involved cocaine. It is difficult to put an accurate value on the amount of illegal drugs seized or destroyed in these operations. The price of illegal drugs varies greatly depending on supply and demand, as well as the purity of the drugs themselves when they reach the UK market. Therefore quoted MOD figures for the &quot;street value&quot; of successful seizures are always estimates. It should be noted that it is likely that not all of the cocaine seized would have reached the UK market.</p>

The Carbon Challenge is a competition being delivered by English Partnerships on behalf of the Department of Communities and Local Government and is aimed at accelerating the house building industry's response to climate change. Hanham Hall is owned by English Partnerships and is the first Carbon Challenge site to be developed. All the homes will be required to meet Level 6, which is the highest level, of the Code for Sustainable Homes. The energy standard for code level 6 requires net zero carbon emissions for each new home. This means that, over the course of a year, the amount of energy taken from the grid to facilitate the running of the home will be less than or equal to the amount of energy returned using renewable technologies.</p>

TDP has been promoted to students on campuses, in student bars and public areas and supported by advertising via ATM machines and on student accommodation websites.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.5/2">Direct marketing to students at 30 universities in England and Wales started in September 2007 led by students themselves. This encompasses distributing leaflets and posters, information on student blogging websites, web forums and direct information to letting agents offering student accommodation. It is intended that this activity will raise awareness with newly arrived students. This activity is ongoing and will be prominently repeated in January 2008, the peak time when students start searching for private rented property for the autumn term. Such awareness will equip students to know when to tackle their landlords if they believe they have failed to protect their deposit.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.5/3">National and regional landlord organisations, as well as landlord forums and accreditation schemes run by local authorities, have an active role to play in ensuring the message is disseminated to landlords.

Posts are aware of the need to watch for indicators that countries may join the International Whaling Commission and adopt a pro-whaling stance. Countries are lobbied and are in no doubt as to the importance that the UK attaches to whale conservation.</p>

	<p pid="a.193W.0/4">Marlay Grange was purchased for Irish Punt 8 million in 2000 (&pound;6.258 million). An initial survey of the property, carried out in October 1999, showed that a comprehensive refurbishment would be required. However, this was not an invasive survey as the owners were still living in the property and would not permit one. The extent of asbestos only became known after the property was purchased; when the full survey was carried out in preparation for refurbishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.193W.0/5">Up until mid-2004, we had spent &pound;700,000 on works to Marlay Grange, which included asbestos removal, fees and security works. No refurbishment works have been carried out. Since mid-2004 we have incurred security and minor maintenance costs of &pound;507,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.212W.3/1">Stoke on Trent is one of 77 areas that has benefited from a close working relationship with the Respect task force. Complementing its broad range of approaches to tackle antisocial behaviour and its causes, Stoke has appointed a Parenting Practitioner to work with parents of young people that are involved in or at risk of becoming involved in antisocial behaviour and has also developed a Family Intervention Project in the Meir neighbourhood. The Local Government User Satisfaction Survey shows that the proportion of the public who perceive a high level of antisocial behaviour in Stoke-on-Trent fell from 50 per cent. in 2003-04 to 31 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="a.213W.2/1">Citizenship is a statutory part of the national curriculum for all pupils aged 11-16 and part of a joint non-statutory framework in primary schools alongside personal, social and health education (PSHE). The recent review of the secondary school curriculum undertaken by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) gave new impetus to the citizenship curriculum by adding a new strand entitled &quot;Identity and diversity: living together in the UK&quot;, following the recommendation in Sir Keith Ajegbo's review of diversity and citizenship. The DCSF, in partnership with CfBT and the Association of Citizenship Teaching (ACT), is running a national support programme to help schools implement these changes. From January to April 2008, there will be one day regional training events targeted at subject leaders. A national subject lead for citizenship has been appointed, who will work with 27 new regional advisers to support local networking.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.2/2">We are also working with the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) to raise the status of citizenship with head teachers, providing a fully subsidised CPD course for citizenship teachers to improve their skills, and developing a new, full GCSE and A level in citizenship studies, in response to demand. In addition, guidance on the new duty on schools to promote community cohesion, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>, makes clear that good citizenship education can make a significant contribution to this area and demonstrate schools' compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.2/3">We will continue to work with the NfER and use the findings of the Citizenship Education Longitudal Study to inform future policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.0/2">The excluded pupils' policy, in the achievement and attainment tables, was put in place to ensure schools that admitted pupils excluded from a maintained school were not penalised for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.217W.0/3">Under this policy, the admitting school can request to have excluded pupils removed from the school's number on roll. Results for the excluded pupil will still count in the school's performance figures provided the pupil was permanently excluded from another maintained school. This ensures that the admitting school's performance results are not adversely affected by taking on an excluded pupil.</p>
	<p pid="a.217W.0/4">Managed moves can be a good way of dealing with pupils who are at risk of exclusion, and offering them a fresh start, without going through the formal exclusion process. As these pupils have not been formally excluded there is no special consideration given to the counting of these pupils in a school's results. Pupils who move schools as a result of managed moves are attributed to the school where they were on roll at the time of the January School Census.</p>

	<p pid="a.222W.8/1">The recently completed &quot;Women and Children Park&quot; in Lashkar Gah was funded through the Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) fund, administered by the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Helmand. QIPs in Helmand are funded through the joint DFID, MOD, and FCO Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). The GCPP QIPs fund has an overall budget of &pound;9 million this financial year, including &pound;3 million from DFID. The overall cost of the park was approximately &pound;420,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.8/2">The park is providing much needed recreational space and facilities to the people of Lashkar Gah and the surrounding area, in particular women and children. It was built in response to identified local needs, and agreed by the Governor of Helmand and relevant Government of Afghanistan line departments. Construction of the park was implemented by the Afghan NGO, Helping Afghan Farmers Organisation (HAFO). Much of the work was carried out using local labour. One of the first major events hosted at the park was a US-funded agricultural fair to promote legal livelihoods attended by 1,700 Afghans.</p>

As in the 2004 Spending Review, the methodology for assessing gains achieved by more poverty-focused allocation is based on econometric studies by Paul Collier and David Dollar showing that the impact of aid varies with countries' per capita income and policy environment. Gains are also generated by improved performance of DFID's portfolio, as measured by the scores awarded to projects in annual monitoring reviews.</p>

We are also consulting on research priorities for climate change and poverty reduction in Latin America and the Caribbean. On environmental management, DFID has recently concluded a research programme on forests and poverty reduction, the results of which are now being integrated into our policy making. We have supported additional research work on forests and poverty reduction through the World Bank and the Centre for International Forestry Research. We are in the design phase for a research programme on water resources management and energy, and we are scoping a project which will look at how ecosystems support poor people, from the household to national level.

	<p pid="a.226W.0/1">The methodology used to estimate the impact of DFID spending on poverty is based on the econometric studies of Paul Collier and David Dollar showing that the impact of aid on growth varies with countries' per capita income and policy environment. The impact of growth on poverty reduction is estimated using an average poverty elasticity of growth. This enables us to estimate the number of people removed from poverty by our aid spending in a particular country. From this we can calculate the total numbers of people lifted from poverty by the UK's aid expenditure as currently allocated between countries; and the implications for poverty reduction of allocating our aid differently.</p>

	<p pid="a.240W.5/1">An assessment of the likely impact of landlords providing accommodation to those on local housing allowance was made for the Regulatory Impact Assessment that was carried out prior to the introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill 2006. This assessment recognised that a potential risk of the policy was that some landlords might choose not to supply accommodation to those on local housing allowance. However, evidence gathered from the local housing allowance pathfinder areas shows that, overall, the supply of accommodation to local housing allowance recipients increased by around 7 per cent. during the evaluation period.</p>

	<p pid="a.248W.9/1">The best estimate of how many non-domiciled individuals are resident in the UK is based on the number of people who indicate non-domicile tax status on their self assessment tax returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.9/2">As at September 2007, self assessment records show that approximately 23,000 individuals had indicated non-domicile status through their self assessment returns in more than seven years in the period 1996-97 to 2005-06. This amounts to approximately 8 per cent. of the total number of individuals indicating non-domicile status over this period.</p>

	<p pid="a.248W.12/1">The Government's decision to withdraw industrial buildings allowances, including the extension for qualifying hotels, was based on an assessment of a number of issues, common across industry sectors. The Government have not sought to target the hotel and hospitality industry or any other industry with this change.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.12/2">Industrial buildings allowances (IBAs) were extended to qualifying hotels in 1978. Capital allowances are not normally available on commercial buildings, so IBAs have long been recognised as a significant distortion in commercial property investment. They have become a poorly focused subsidy, selectively available on a disparate range of assets, including some that typically appreciate in value. These issues are compounded by the compliance burden imposed by their complicated rules. The withdrawal of IBAs was not an isolated measure. The 2007 Budget also announced cuts in both the basic rate of income tax and the main rate of corporation tax and crucially for hospitality, as a key sector making ongoing capital investment, the package of reforms also includes a brand new investment incentive in the form of a new Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) from 2008. The AIA gives 100 per cent. tax relief for capital investment up to &pound;50,000 per year. For many small hoteliers&mdash;regardless of their corporate or unincorporated status&mdash;this will represent a significant incentive for new capital investment. Our analysis has shown us that the new allowance will be sufficient to allow over 95 per cent. of UK businesses to simply 'write-off'' their investment in plant and machinery (excluding cars) for tax purposes each year. Taken as a whole these reforms to the business and personal tax systems are designed to deliver increases in investment and growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.252W.5/1">Successive Governments have provided generous tax relief on pensions saving to support individuals to make provision for a secure income in retirement, not to build assets or wealth. Self invested personal pensions (SIPPs) allow individuals who want to manage their tax relieved pension investments to do so. But buy-to-let properties are precluded from tax relief on pensions, if held by member-directed schemes, because of the potential for abuse by using the generous tax-reliefs for purposes other than to provide an income in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.5/2">The Government remain committed to encouraging investment in a range of assets as part of pensions saving and therefore allows SIPPs to invest in residential property as long as it is done via a genuinely diverse commercial vehicle in which they have a less than 10 per cent. interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.254W.6/1">The value of goods that can be imported into EU countries (including the UK) from outside the EU, without paying tax is stated in the directive on the harmonisation of provisions set out by law, regulation or administrative action relating to exemption from turnover tax and excise duty on imports in international travel (directive 69/169/EEC).</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.6/2">When directive 69/169/EEC was first agreed in 1969, the allowance was set at &euro;45 (&pound;36). In 1994, the directive was amended to increase the allowance to &euro;175 (&pound;136). The sterling conversion was then revalorised from &pound;136 to &pound;145 in 1995 to reflect exchange rate fluctuations. Since then the allowance has not been revised.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.6/3">Following the announcement at Budget 2005 that the Government would be seeking increases in travellers' allowances, the European Commission issued a proposal to increase the duty-free limit on goods other than alcohol and tobacco. EU Finance Ministers reached agreement in November 2006 to increase this limit to &euro;430 (&pound;290) for air and sea travellers and &euro;300 (&pound;200) for travellers by land. It was also agreed that this limit would be reviewed every four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.6/4">The new allowances will be introduced in the UK once the relevant European legislation has been formally amended. The Government are pressing the European Commission to bring forward the finalised legislation, so that travellers will be able to benefit from the higher limits.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.5/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) receive over 285,000 VAT registration applications each year and have a target of clearing complete and low risk applications within 14 days following receipt. The Government recognise that, over recent months, HMRC have fallen short of this target.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/2">Several factors have contributed to the increased processing times. VAT registration is the entry point to serious frauds such as Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) fraud, which reduced VAT receipts by an estimated &pound;2 billion to &pound;3 billion in 2005-06 and represents a very serious and sustained attack by organised criminal networks on the UK's VAT system. HMRC has taken steps to prevent such abuse of the VAT system, including a range of pre-registration checks, which last year weeded out over 7,000 fraudulent applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/3">Earlier this year HMRC also saw a peak in the number of VAT registration applications as some businesses tried to circumvent certain anti-avoidance measures introduced in Budget 2007. As a consequence the operational pressures on HMRC have intensified and work continues to manage the response to this pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/4">HMRC have a 14-day target for clearing complete and low risk applications rather than an eight-week target period. For 2007-08 the performance against that target is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.256W.5/7"> <td><i> Month (2007)</i></td> <td><i> Number within 14 days</i></td> <td><i> Proportion (percentage) within 14 days</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.256W.5/8"> <td>April</td> <td>1,493</td> <td>7</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.256W.5/9"> <td>May</td> <td>1,883</td> <td>7.5</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.256W.5/10"> <td>June</td> <td>3,174</td> <td>17</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.256W.5/13"> <td>September</td> <td>5,686</td> <td>19.75</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/16">HMRC has put in place a number of specific measures designed to improve registration processing times. It has made immediate improvements to speed up the initial vetting of applications, and is targeting its risk checks more closely on the highest risk applications, so as to minimise disruption to legitimate applications. Additional processing staff have been recruited, more of the existing staff are now dealing with VAT registration work and IT challenges have been addressed with improvements planned over coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/17">HMRC anticipate that these steps will provide significant additional processing capacity. However the lead-time for some changes, including training of new staff, means that significant improvement is not expected until later in the year. HMRC recognises that performance needs to continue to improve and will continue to work hard to reduce VAT registration delay.</p>

The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

	<p pid="a.260W.5/1">The Department does not monitor the possible health implications of the emission of PM2.5 particles from incinerators or industrial processes directly on an ongoing basis. This is not possible as any health effects of PM2.5 particles cannot be diagnosed as specific to PM2.5.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.5/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) currently monitors ambient concentrations of PM2.5 in a small number of locations around the United Kingdom.

	<p pid="a.261W.3/1">We take the issue of anorexia and other eating disorders, especially among young people, very seriously. This is why the Department asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce a clinical guideline on the core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders. NICE published the guideline in 2004 and is due to review it in January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/2">In the four years to the end of March 2007, we invested over &pound;400 million of additional money into the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provided by the national health service and local authorities. These funds will assist in meeting and maintaining the Department's public service agreement standard of a comprehensive CAMHS, including services for young people with an eating disorder. Further funds totalling &pound;130 million have been made available to the NHS and local authorities for the development of CAMHS in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/3">The Department funds NHS research and development through the National Institute for Health Research. The Institute's research programmes support high quality research of relevance and in areas of high priority to patients and the NHS. This research currently includes a centrally funded trial evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of three treatments for young people with anorexia nervosa, and a project on the translation of experimental neuroscience into clinical practice in the treatment of the condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/4">Over the last 10 years, the main part of the Department's total expenditure on health research has been devolved to and managed by NHS organisations. Details of individual NHS supported research projects including more than 200 projects concerned with anorexia are available on the national research register at <a href="http://www.nrr.nhs.uk">www.nrr.nhs.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/5">The Department awarded &pound;1.9 million to Professor Ulrike Schmidt, Professor of Eating Disorders at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) in February 2007. The grant to SLaM, in partnership with the eating disorders charity beat and the Institute of Psychiatry is designed to conduct research into the identification and treatment of anorexia.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.8/1">The Government believe that care homes are only one of a range of options that should be available for supporting people with long-term care needs. The Government recognise that most people want to live in their own home for as long as possible. However, there will always be some people for who care in a care home will best suit their needs and wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.8/2">All care homes in England are regulated, registered and inspected by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI). CSCI regulates homes according to statutory regulations and national minimum standard, which apply equally to all, from small, family-run homes to large facilities operated by corporate providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.8/3">We appreciate that some residents will prefer the family atmosphere of a small home, while others will be more comfortable in a larger establishment. It is for service users to choose the type of home they would prefer to live in.</p>

	<p pid="a.266W.2/1">The 2006-08 revenue allocations represent &pound;135 billion investment in the national health service&mdash;&pound;64 billion to primary care trusts (PCTs) in 2006-07 and &pound;70 billion in 2007-08. Over the two years covered by this allocation, PCTs will receive an average increase of 19.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.2/2">The revenue allocations are made to PCTs based on a weighted-capitation formula. The formula has three elements, one of which is an age adjustment. The age adjustment is one of the three elements of the formula. This adjustment recognises that a principal cause of variation in the level of demand for health services is the age structure of the population. The very young and the elderly, whose populations are not evenly distributed throughout the country, tend to make more use of health services than the rest of the population. The purpose of the age weighting within the formula is to allow for varying elements of health need associated with the age structure of local populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.2/3">The development of the weighted-capitation formula, including the age adjustment, is continually assessed and overseen by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA). ACRA is an independent body comprising NHS management, general practitioner and academic membership. ACRA's current work programme is looking again at all elements of the formula, including the age adjustment.</p>

	<p pid="a.266W.5/1">In 2006, the Health Services Management Centre at Birmingham University was commissioned to undertake a survey of prison health partnerships in order to inform both an assessment of their progress and the process of transferring commissioning responsibility for prison healthcare services in public sector prisons to the national health service. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.5/2">This year, the Department will introduce a set of newly designed performance indicators to assess the quality of prison healthcare services. These bring together a number of existing systems to support a mainstream approach to performance monitoring at a local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.5/3">It is planned that the indicators will contribute to measuring the effectiveness of the transfer and corresponding significant increased investment in prison health.

	<p pid="a.266W.5/4">HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) and the Healthcare Commission have worked in partnership by virtue of a memorandum of understanding since April 2006 to monitor healthcare standards in prisons.

	<p pid="a.268W.0/1">There has been no change to the position in relation to audiology services and the 18 week target.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/2">The most complex audiology cases, those properly referred to Ear Nose and Throat Departments for surgical or medical consultant-led care, will be covered by the target of treatment within 18 weeks of referral by December 2008. The remaining routine adult hearing loss cases are not included in the 18 weeks target and should be assessed within six weeks by March 2008. This is in line with the diagnostic waiting time milestone on which local commissioning plans are based.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/3">No assessment has been made of changes to the funding mechanism for national health service hearing aid services. Funding of &pound;125 million over the five years of the Modernising Hearing Aid Services programme was made available to enable services to modernise the way that they operated and routinely fit digital hearing aids.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/4">Current funding for audiology services, along with the majority of other services, is provided through the general allocations to national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs). It is the responsibility of local health organisations to allocate resources to audiology services based on their knowledge of the needs of their local populations and the resources available.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/5">The Department developed the national framework for audiology &quot;Improving Access to Audiology Services in England&quot;, published in March 2007 using views and evidence from a wide range of stakeholders. A copy is available in the Library. Nine development sites were also used to develop good practice aimed at improving access to audiology services through commissioning, service redesign, choice, information and incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/6">As set out in &quot;Improving Access to Audiology in England&quot;, additional capacity is needed to address long waiting times for some audiology services. PCTs are responsible for commissioning the full range of health services for their local populations including audiology and for ensuring that they meet their capacity needs through improving existing NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.269W.6/14">Data on in-patient deaths which are due to suicide, homicide and sudden, unexpected causes is published by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness (NCISH) based at the University of Manchester. NCISH is funded by the National Patient Safety Agency and published its report, 'Avoidable Deaths', in December 2006. It covers data on homicides in England and Wales from April 1999 to December 2003 and on suicides from April 2000 to December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.6/15">The data on homicides is collected from the Home Office Homicide Index (HI). Where available, psychiatric reports prepared for the trial are obtained. Information on previous offences is collected from the National Crime Operations Faculty. Case details are submitted to mental health services in each individual's district of residence and adjacent districts to identify those with a history of using mental health services, including those with a lifetime contact. These individuals become inquiry cases and those cases with recent service contact (within 12 months of the offence) are analysed as the main sample.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.6/16">Information on inquiry cases is obtained from a questionnaire sent to the consultant psychiatrist within the applicable clinical team. For all homicide convictions, data are collected on methods and victims from the HI, including data on diminished responsibility and hospital orders. Data on mental illness at the time of offence comes from psychiatric reports prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service, including details of mental health, drug and alcohol use at the time of the offence. The questionnaire also provides data covering demographic details, clinical history, details of the homicide, details of in-patient/community care received, details of final contact with services, events leading to the homicide and respondents' views on prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.6/17">The Mental Health Act Commission (MHAC) collects data on all detained patient deaths and publishes data on those from non-natural causes in its biennial report. MHAC, under its general remit to keep under review the operation of the Mental Health Act 1983, asks providers to notify it of all deaths of detained patients within three working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.269W.6/18">MHAC reviews the deaths of patients who have died from non-natural causes to establish whether good practice, as defined in the 'Mental Health Act 1983 Code of Practice', has been followed and whether lessons for future practice and policy need to be learned. This review may include sending a Commissioner to the inquest, which considers the circumstances of the death or arranging a visit to the hospital to consider the issues arising.</p>

	<p pid="a.278W.0/1">There are 62 primary care trusts (PCTs) in spearhead areas, each of which provides a National Health Service Stop Smoking Service for its local population. NHS Stop Smoking Services provide support in a variety of settings, including pharmacies, in primary care and in other settings such as prisons. Within all PCT areas in England, there will usually be a choice of support options and a number of delivery venues, thus improving choice and access for smokers wanting support to quit.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/2">The Government do not have specific targets to increase the number of particular stop smoking clinics over the next two years, but encourages the NHS to extend the support offered and promote access to more smokers wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.0/3">The Government continue to work to promote the support provided by NHS Stop Smoking Services via national campaigns. Smokers who quit with the support of the NHS are up to four times more likely to succeed compared with will-power alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.5/1">No specific, formal assessment has been made of the contribution that volunteering can make to restorative justice but we encourage partnership working in this area and many restorative justice schemes engage the services of the voluntary sector. For example, Youth Offending Panels are made up of trained volunteers from the local community and design intervention programmes for juveniles referred from youth courts. A number of voluntary sector providers are partners in schemes delivering adult restorative justice and there are local initiatives such as the Chard and Ilminster Community Justice Panel, which is made up of local, trained volunteers and uses restorative justice processes to deliver Acceptable Behaviour Contracts for cases involving minor offences that do not go to court.</p>
