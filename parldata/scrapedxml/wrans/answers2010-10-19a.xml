To date, the ECC has received over 4,000 complaints in connection with the recent parliamentary elections. Allegations of electoral fraud in Helmand have been limited to 57: six have been classed as category 'A' complaints (based on credible evidence and likely to affect the outcome); 15 were classed as category 'B' (credible, but not likely to impact the overall outcome); 36 were classed as category 'C' (low credibility, poorly evidenced, unlikely to affect the final outcome).</p>

	<p pid="a.620W.7/2">Although the figures are low, our aim is to reduce them further, and work continues on analysing the ex-service prison population in terms of demographic and service in order to allow us to make informed policy decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.7/3">The principal contribution the Ministry of Defence (MOD) can make in reducing the potential to offend is by making personnel aware of the opportunities available to them on leaving service, in the form of resettlement programmes as part of their general preparation for transition. Furthermore, all service leavers, including those who leave early, are entitled to lifetime support from the Regular Forces Employment Association and Officers' Association charities, both of which are specifically focused on getting veterans into the right job.</p>
	<p pid="a.620W.7/4">Where former service personnel have entered the prison system, the Ex-Service Offenders Working Group (formerly known as the Veterans Prison In-Reach Working Group) which officials in the MOD chair, brings together charitable and voluntary sector organisations, the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency of the MOD, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) of the Ministry of Justice, prison frontline staff, representatives from the devolved Administrations and a representative from the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health. Together, this group aims to provide a common and collaborative approach to the issue of ex-service personnel in the criminal justice system, and works to raise awareness amongst the ex-service prison population of the help and support available to them and their families while they serve their sentence and as they prepare for release. This is to ensure a common and collaborative approach to former personnel in prison in order to minimise the risk of reoffending amongst this community.</p>

	<p pid="a.623W.6/1">There are five schemes being undertaken on the M18 between junctions 2 and 5 which will continue until the end of March 2011. This includes four schemes to replace steel central reserve barrier, which are approaching the end of their design life, with new concrete central reserve barrier. The fifth scheme comprises works to improve the interchange between the M18 and A1 (M) through the provision of traffic signals.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.6/2">The programmes for the five schemes have been carefully co-ordinated to minimise the overall duration of the work. Lane restrictions are limited to night time only in order to minimise disruption to the road user. However, a 50 mph speed restriction remains in place at all times for the safety of the travelling public.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.6/3">The benefits of the barrier work are improved safety as a result of the reduced likelihood of crossover type accidents, fewer repairs arising from collision damage and reduced future maintenance requirements. The improvements at the junction of the M18 and A1 (M) will improve reliability and safety by reducing delays at the junction.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.12/1">Colony collapse disorder is the term given to the abnormally high colony losses occurring in the USA, usually characterized by sudden disappearance of bees. This characteristic has not been observed in the UK, although there have been some significant bee losses. The Food and Environment Research Agency's (Fera's) National Bee Unit has investigated the causes of colony losses in England and Wales and the key results are available on its BeeBase website.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.12/2">The results have shown that the most important risk factor in the mortality or weakening of colonies is deformed wing virus, a virus transmitted by the parasitic varroa mite, clearly indicating failed or unsuccessful treatments of mite infestations. This highlights the importance of improving bee husbandry standards, which is a key objective of the Healthy Bees Plan, currently being delivered in partnership by Fera, the Welsh Assembly Government and others such as the Bee Farmers' Association, NFU, British Beekeepers' Association and the Welsh Beekeepers' Association.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.8/1">All dairy cattle, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation. In England, the welfare of cattle is protected by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals, this means that anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to make sure the animal's needs are met. These general requirements are supplemented by more detailed ones in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 for calves and cattle, covering areas such as accommodation, tethering, inspection, feed and water.</p>

Other areas of the Home Office and other Government Departments are also involved in contributing to what is fundamentally a cross-departmental strategy.

	<p pid="a.636W.11/2">There is currently no national database which records the number of female genital mutilation (FGM) cases reported in the UK. However, Project Azure, a specialist unit within the Metropolitan Police, has been flagging FGM incidents since 2006, during which time they have recorded 166 possible cases of FGM.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.11/3">Research suggests a number of barriers to reporting incidents of FGM including the age and understanding of the victim and pressure from the family or wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.11/4">No estimate has been made of the number of girls taken overseas to undergo FGM. In summer 2010, Project Azure ran a campaign to raise awareness of FGM with families travelling back to practicing countries. Officers operated in Terminal 4, Heathrow airport, in plain clothes with a view to identifying proactively those girls who may have been at risk of being taken out of the UK for FGM. The initiative also sought to raise awareness with those communities about the implications of FGM. Findings from this initiative are currently being assessed and will determine any follow-up enquiries with girls identified as being at risk of FGM.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.5/2">We have no plans to introduce such a right. Section 59 enables the police to seize a vehicle they reasonably believe is being driven both carelessly or inconsiderately on-road or off-road without authority and in a way that causes or is likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. This power of seizure can only be used in carefully restricted circumstances and following a warning. A vehicle that has been seized must be released immediately on payment of a prescribed sum intended only to cover police costs and this payment is waived if the owner is not personally at fault. When introducing the legislation the then Minister formally declared it compatible with the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1988.</p>
	<p pid="a.640W.5/3">The remedy for any person who wishes to challenge the police's decision to seize their vehicle is an action in the county court for trespass to goods. It is also open to them, if they believe the police acted in any way improperly, to make a formal complaint against the police.</p>

We are satisfied that the risk of leakage of fluorocarbons during or at the end of operation of hermetically sealed heat pumps is very small. Typically residual amounts, 1% or 2% of the system volume, might remain after refrigerant removal. This can increase to around 5% to 10% for very large, non-hermetically sealed, industrial heat pumps, where there is more scope of leakage through mechanical joints. Further information on heat pumps will be made available shortly when DEFRA publish a report on HFC consumption and emissions forecasting.</p>

	<p pid="a.648W.8/1">The installation cost of an air source heat pump (ASHP) in the domestic sector depends on the size and characteristics of the property in which the heat pump is installed. Our most recent analysis shows that total ASHP installation costs are usually in the range of &#163;7,000 to &#163;12,000. The costs for large homes could be significantly higher if the heat demand exceeds the capacity of the electrical supply and system reinforcement is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/2">The payback period for ASHPs depends on the fuel which they displace (that is, the counterfactual), usage and the operating efficiency of the equipment. There could be significant differences between installations. Assuming an operating efficiency of 250% to 275% and an installation cost of around &#163;9,000 to &#163;10,000, payback periods could range from eight to 16 years<sup>(1)</sup> when replacing electric heating. Payback periods are longer when the counterfactual is a less expensive off-grid fuel, such as heating oil and coal. In the case of natural gas, the cheapest heating fuel, the payback may be longer than the expected life of the heat pump. The industry believe the life of a heat pump is at least 20 years but this has yet to be independently verified.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/3" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Payback periods are calculated using illustrative data on costs and heat pump performance and are calculated by dividing the full capital costs of the renewable equipment by the relevant fuel savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.649W.2/11">However, in my answer given to question 17765, I explained that we are satisfied the risk of any significant refrigerant leakage from heat pumps is negligible. Their contribution to global warming is therefore proportionately small. The energy and carbon benefits from a well designed heat pump will almost entirely outweigh any impact from small releases of F gas. Nonetheless, given the global warming potential of R404A, we would expect heat pump manufacturers to avoid using this particular gas wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.649W.5/2">The Department estimated that allowing all<sup>(1)</sup> existing generators to claim FITs at full rate, without repaying grants would represent a discounted cost in the order of &#163;55.9 million to 2020 and an annual cost in 2020 of &#163;4.25 million<sup>(2)</sup>. In addition to these costs there would be additional administrative costs to DECC, Ofgem and suppliers. In practice, these administrative costs would have increased, had such a policy also included a requirement to repay some or all of any grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.5/3">Extending FITs to existing installations would increase the costs of the scheme, without encouraging additional installations, which is the primary objective of the FITs scheme. We do not think that this represents value for money and cannot therefore justify the additional cost to consumers, who ultimately pay for the scheme. Therefore, after careful consideration, we decided that the scheme as it relates to early adopters should remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.5/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> These figures are based on estimated numbers of sub-50kW installations prior to <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July 2009</phrase> that received grants from the following programmes: Clear Skies, LCBP1, LCBP2 and the Major PV Demo Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.5/5" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> Costs are presented in 2009 prices, discounted. Costs are net FITs subsidy costs, i.e. net of the value of exports to suppliers. Admin costs of administering a higher number of FIT installations have not been included here. Costs assume that existing generators would be paid FITs for the full installation lifetime. Cost estimations should be caveated, as we do not know the precise number of existing generators and which technologies/scales they have invested in.</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.3/3">Implementing this Order would result in Ofcom taking action to implement the EU's revised GSM Directive and Radio Spectrum Committee decision that liberalises the 900 and 1800 MHz spectrum to enable 3G services to be rolled out in that spectrum. The action to convert existing 3G licences to an indefinite period will also provide certainty to the current mobile operators to enable them to invest further in developing their 3G networks. Finally, the release of new spectrum through a combined auction of 800 MHz and 2600 MHz will further assist the transition to next generation superfast broadband. All of these actions will be important steps in our objective of developing the UK's broadband networks.</p>

	<p pid="a.652W.11/1">The majority of costs that are necessary to host the teams competing in the London 2012 games, for example, construction of an Olympic Village where teams will stay during the games, a park and venues for them to compete in, and games-time security costs, are provided for within the &#163;9.3 billion public sector funding package.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.11/2">DCMS publishes quarterly economic reports setting out how the public sector funding package is being used. Other costs, for example, for running the Village during games-time, fall to the London Organising Committee of the 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games (LOCOG), which is a private company.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.11/3">There are potentially costs falling to those local authorities and other public bodies that are hosting pre-games training camps. Costs outside the public sector funding package will lie where they fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.3/2">The majority of respondents to Question 86 felt that circulator pumps should have a minimum band C rating. However, from 2013 there will be a mandatory EU-wide requirement under the energy using products directive for all circulator pumps placed on the market to be band A. The main trade association for the UK pump market argued that it would be unreasonable to expect pump manufacturers to modify designs twice in just over a two-year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.3/3">It was therefore decided that the Part L guidance from October 2010 should be that circulator pumps should have an A to G energy label, as this would be an effective way of encouraging consumers to choose energy efficient products without imposing an undue burden on manufacturers already preparing for 2013.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.6/1">Helping to care for a family member is something that many young people are happy and proud to do. These young people do play an absolutely vital role both for their families and society as a whole and they deserve our recognition and support. The Department for Education with the Department of Health is absolutely committed to supporting local services including many voluntary organisations which have been set up to support these young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/2">However in some cases these young people need protection from excessive or inappropriate caring that puts their education and/or health at risk. I attended the Young Carers Festival this summer as I have done for a number of years and have heard directly about their concerns. They told me that services supporting their parents or other family members all too often do not consider their views or identify and respond to their support needs, even though these might be critical to the care they are providing.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-28">28 July</phrase> the Government initiated a call for evidence with a view to refreshing the Carers Strategy-the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-20">20 September</phrase>. The responses are currently being considered and will help establish the key priorities that will be the focus of a refreshed Carers Strategy to be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/4">The strategy will build on the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) and the Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 'working together to better support young carers' which encourages services such as schools, substance misuse and mental health services and the voluntary sector to identify and respond to young carers support needs as well as those of their parent/family. The MoU is unequivocal in saying that any package of support for those requiring care should not rely on a young person taking on inappropriate of excessive levels of care. I have urged all local authorities to sign up to the MoU.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/5">The Princess Royal Trust for Carers, supported by Government, is currently managing a &#163;1 million Innovation Fund on behalf of the National Young Carers Coalition. This has led to 20 voluntary sector young carer projects being funded until March 2011 to extend the support they provide to young carers to include the whole family. The trust is looking at ways to showcase the learning to other voluntary sector young carer projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/6">Young carers have also said that they want their schools and teaching staff to be more responsive to their needs. In response to this the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the Children's Society has produced a schools pack to help schools develop their systems and policies and increasing numbers of schools have included young carers as a key theme within their own 'Healthy Schools' programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/7">Later in the year the Department plans to publish a report on local projects that have helped to ensure that young people do not have to take on harmful caring roles.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.6/8">The Children's Society, supported by DFE, recently completed a series of five training events for practitioners in adult mental health and substance misuse services to help them better identify, assess, support or refer young carers to the appropriate help.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.2/1">Government are currently having to make difficult choices in order to tackle the budget deficit. The coalition inherited unrealistic spending commitments for 2010-11, where funding was reliant on under-spends or additional funding being taken from reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.2/2">Play, while important for children and families, has to make its contribution. We are currently looking at how we can make savings to the play capital budget in the most equitable way possible, while taking account of contractual commitments that may be in place locally and allowing projects to progress where affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.2/3">Once local authorities are notified of revised playbuilder allocations it will continue to be for them to make their own decisions about where playbuilder investment should be made locally, based on identified need and following consultation with children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.2/1">We believe that it is vital that all children receive high-quality sex and relationships education (SRE), to ensure that they have the knowledge and skills they need to make the right decisions about relationships and sexual health later in life. We are currently considering how best to facilitate that, within the context of a slimmed down National Curriculum. We will be announcing our proposals for the curriculum as a whole later in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.2/2">The national Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme was developed to test the effectiveness of evidence-based mental health support in schools for those children, young people and their families who need it. Schools delivering TaMHS commission a range of services procured from voluntary and charitable (as well as statutory) organisations to meet the particular needs of their pupils, including counselling support for children struggling to cope following family breakdown or bereavement. The learning from TaMHS on effective commissioning of emotional well-being and mental health support and joint working with CAMHS is being shared across schools this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.678W.5/1">The exact percentage of incorrect coding notices issued is not known. In any year a small percentage of codes are always incorrect as they do not reflect changes in an individual's circumstances. That is why HMRC send out coding notices well in advance of the start of the new tax year so that customers can review them and report any changes to HMRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.678W.5/2">The overwhelming majority of PAYE cases (more than 40 million) are correct, so most people have paid the right amount of tax. HMRC estimates that 4.3 million taxpayers will receive repayments for the years 2008-09 and 2009-10, while an estimated 1.4 million will be sent calculations advising that they have underpaid. HMRC estimates the total underpayments for tax years 2008-09 and 2009-10 at &#163;2 billion while the overpayments are worth about &#163;1.8 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.679W.3/1">Pay As You Earn (PAYE) calculations (P800s) issued to individuals are based on information held by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). P800s set out HMRC's information about income received and tax paid for the relevant period, together with a calculation of any further tax or repayment due. They are not assessments and do not create a legal debt: they tell customers what HMRC thinks is the correct tax position. Individuals who think the calculation is incorrect in any way should contact HMRC in the first instance. The notes which accompany the P800 explain how to get in touch with HMRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.679W.3/2">If they are not able to reach agreement and think HMRC's calculations are wrong, customers have a right to appeal against any subsequent assessment or other legal action taken by HMRC. They also have a statutory right to ask for an internal review of that decision. Internal review offers customers the opportunity to have disputed tax decisions considered by a person who was not involved in the original decision, with a view to resolving the case without the need to go to a tribunal. Customers who have a review retain their right to take their appeal to an independent tribunal if they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.679W.3/3">The notes accompanying the P800 also explain what people should do in cases where they do not challenge the figures or the legal basis of HMRC's calculation, but think that HMRC should not collect the tax from them. If customers think they should not pay they should make a claim to HMRC in the first instance. If they remain unsatisfied they have the option of making a complaint about the service they have received from HMRC. If they are not satisfied with HMRC's response to the complaint they can take their case to the independent Adjudicator's Office or the Parliamentary Ombudsman.</p>

And, to make it easier for social enterprises to work with the state and connect with existing social enterprise networks, the Office for Civil Society Strategic Partner's programme provides social enterprise support organisations with the resources they need to support their membership and to represent their voice to government.</p>

	<p pid="a.701W.5/2">The evidence indicates that the exercise of these powers has been particularly successful in achieving the objectives of the legislation, compliance with the regulations and the protection of people from the harm done by second-hand tobacco smoke, with minimal burden on businesses.

The training carried out by the CIEH was widely recognised at the time as making a significant contribution to the successful implementation of the smokefree law.</p>

	<p pid="a.703W.0/2">The national Stroke Strategy, launched in 2007, set out a comprehensive approach to the provision of stroke care with quality markers covering all aspects of stroke care from prevention and awareness through to long-term care in the community.

Over the same period there was an annual increase in primary care trust allocations, among other things, to reflect the cost of implementing the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.703W.3/1">The national stroke strategy launched in December 2007, sets out 20 'quality markers' which outline features of high quality stroke care across the pathway from prevention and awareness to life-long support in the community. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library. Chapter 3, 'Life after stroke', sets out the wide range of support someone may need after a stroke. The range of support can include speech therapy, psychological support, physiotherapy, access to leisure, education, activities and work, accessible and aphasia-friendly information and support groups and help-lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.703W.3/2">A recent National Audit Office report on stroke services noted that more improvement was needed on the post acute and longer term care part of the pathway. The Accelerating Stroke Improvement programme is therefore encouraging local areas to focus on improving arrangements for joint care plans, for six month and subsequent reviews and for access to psychological support. These measures offer opportunities for assessing the needs of stroke survivors and their carers. Meeting those needs more effectively will, over time, improve outcomes for people post-stroke.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.2/1">Like other public bodies, London Probation Trust must seek to use public funds in as effective a way as possible. As part of that, they must apply rigorous financial controls and undertake financial planning against a range of factors. These include, not only their overall budget, but also changes to the number of offenders requiring supervision, the effectiveness of interventions, and offending patterns. The Director of Offender Management for London, who commissions the services provided by London Probation Trust, will finalise the negotiations with them in the light of the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. These discussions will stress the need to ensure that front line activities are delivered as efficiently as possible and that HQ and support costs are minimised.</p>

	<p pid="a.712W.3/1">One of the Ministry of Justice's principal aims is to increase the overall value for money and cost-effectiveness of the system through a range of reform and efficiency measures. For example, the Ministry's 'Transforming Justice' programme has focussed heavily on greater system efficiency, which will remain a priority over the coming Parliament and through the deficit reduction plan. Criminal justice agencies have analytical tools to enable the analysis of impacts across the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.3/2">There is good evidence for some of the approaches taken to reduce crime. However, most of the evidence addresses effectiveness in reducing offending rather than cost-effectiveness. The use of payment by results mechanisms to reduce re-offending will ensure that resources are allocated in a more cost-effective way.</p>

To identify relevant expenditure would require examination of thousands of individual invoices, many held locally within the courts, prison and probation systems, and would incur disproportionate cost. It has, however, been possible to identify expenditure on bottled water within the Ministry's headquarters function. The amount for the 2009-10 financial year being &#163;1,407.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.6/2">The expenditure relates to bottled water used for water coolers and dispensers. The cost includes sanitisation and maintenance of these devices. Water dispensers are gradually being replaced by mains-fed water filtration systems across the Ministry's estate.

	<p pid="a.717W.8/5">The Department for Education is responsible for funding 16 to 18 education; a lot of which is delivered by the further education sector.
