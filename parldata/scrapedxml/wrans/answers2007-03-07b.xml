	<p pid="b.1966W.2/1">The welfare and community support of service personnel and their families is core MOD business. This includes family liaison, which has always been exercised by personnel who have command responsibility as an integral part of their duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1966W.2/2">Each of the three services has robust structures in place to support and liaise with families and service individuals; the support offered is wide-ranging and tailored to the requirements of the individual concerned. Examples of this include the support provided to families when the service spouse is deployed on operations. In such circumstances, units organise families' briefing sessions, coffee mornings, cr&egrave;ches and community social events. Assistance is also provided to enable families to keep in touch with their loved ones through the provision of publicly funded internet and email terminals at local community and education centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1966W.2/3">Specialist charitable organisations such as the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmans' Families Association and the Army Welfare Service are also available to offer assistance. Services offered overseas include the running of the confidential helpline and the provision of contracted community support, some medical care and social work elements. In the UK, they may come into contact with families for a whole host of reasons. The issues dealt with span the full spectrum of service and private life issues that may affect individuals or families from time to time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1969W.11/2">The Ministry of Defence has a unified philosophy towards equality and diversity. In support of this approach the MOD Diversity Panel, co-chaired by the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), and the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and which includes a mix of internal and external members who have a range of experience in diversity issues, have endorsed a Unified Diversity Strategy. This strategy provides the strategic framework and incorporates our Diversity Vision; Diversity Mission; Objectives; Working in Partnership; Taking Responsibility; Complying with the Legislation; communicating and Building Commitment; Measuring Progress and the Business Case for Diversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1969W.11/3">In April 2006, we published our first overarching MOD Equality and Diversity Scheme 2006-2009, together with a set of Action Plans for 2006-07. The Scheme encompasses the armed forces, civilians, the Ministry of Defence police and our executive agencies. This Scheme reflects not only the Department's statutory duties in respect of race, disability and gender but also those diversity strands not yet covered by specific public sector duties (age, sexual orientation and religion and belief).</p>
	<p pid="b.1969W.11/4">Our first annual Action Plan included our gender equality priorities. We will be publishing a report against the targets that we set for 2006-07 later in the year as well as issuing a new Action Plan for 2007-08. The Defence Analytical Services Agency will be collecting statistical data on the recruitment, retention and progression of women. The aim of all this work is to achieve real improvement in outcomes for the various diversity groups.</p>

Our current community-based mental health provision is occupationally orientated and aims to manage patients in their work/home environment.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase> at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva last month. With regards to 'Step 9', we have undertaken several unilateral steps towards nuclear disarmament including reductions in warhead numbers, increased transparency by publishing historical accounting records of our defence fissile material holdings and significant reductions of the operational status of our nuclear weapons system. We have also pursued a widely welcomed programme to develop UK expertise in methods and technologies that could be used to verify nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="b.1974W.14/2">Finally, we have pressed consistently for early entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the commencement of negotiations, without preconditions, of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament.</p>

	<p pid="b.1975W.2/1">The planned reduction in the maximum number of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160, announced in December last year represents a 20 per cent. decrease from the previously declared maximum number. I intend that this reduction will take place this year. This reduction is pertinent to the UK's obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty and means that, since coming to power in 1997, the Government will have reduced the overall explosive power of the UK's nuclear arsenal by around 75 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1977W.9/26">A similar regional analysis based on electricity meter points is not possible because, where electricity is supplied through two-rate and three-rate meters (mainly those meters using dynamic teleswitching), there are two meter recordings per address. It is estimated that there are some 1,060,000 domestic customers with two meter point numbers in Great Britain. For Great Britain as a whole, it is estimated that 99.6 per cent. of households have mains access to electricity so fewer than 100,000 households do not.

	<p pid="b.1987W.6/1">The successful elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2006 were a major step forward in securing lasting peace in the DRC. The people of the DRC have a democratically elected President, parliament and provincial assemblies for the first time since 1960. However, the elections are only the first step towards peace and the DRC Government, with co-ordinated support from international partners, will need to tackle several priority issues to maintain the political settlement achieved through the elections and consolidate peace and security:</p>
	<p pid="b.1987W.6/2" class="indent">Reform of the army, police and justice system, to ensure they provide security for DRC's citizens and legal and peaceful means of addressing grievances and resolving disputes;</p>
	<p pid="b.1987W.6/3" class="indent">Ensuring the new democratic system is as inclusive as possible so that all groups feel their voices are heard and that the Government are accountable; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1987W.6/4" class="indent">Ensuring that the Government delivers early and tangible benefits to DRC's population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1987W.6/5">I believe that now is a time for cautious optimism for the DRC. Success or failure at sustaining peace ultimately depends on the choice of DRC's politicians, however, the international community can continue to provide vital political, technical and financial support to help increase the chances of success. DFID has rapidly increased its support to the DRC, from &pound;5.56 million in 2001-02 to &pound;67 million available this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1989W.0/1">The Global Yaws Control programme was launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1948, in collaboration with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). DFID's unearmarked core contributions of &pound;12.5 million to the WHO and &pound;19 million to UNICEF for the financial year of 2005-06, support the organisation's efforts to tackle Yaws disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.1989W.0/2">DFID has not provided any specific funding or resources to tackle Yaws disease but is increasingly funding the broader health sector plans of developing countries through poverty reduction budget support and sector- wide programming. Such sector programmes will build capacity in health services to diagnose and treat all major causes of illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1989W.0/3">Currently DFID funds two programmes on neglected diseases-The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) who will receive &pound;2.5 million through to 2010 and The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) commonly known as river blindness, which has received &pound;7.6 million to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.1989W.0/4">DFID also supports research and development of drugs for neglected diseases through its &pound;6.5 million support to Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDI) and &pound;4.5 million to the Tropical Disease Research (TDR) special programme in the WHO for research into neglected tropical diseases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1989W.6/1">DFID no longer has a bilateral programme in Namibia and so is not bilaterally supporting education programmes there. We are, however, doing so through the European Commission (EC) which has allocated &euro;21 million during the period 2003-07 to support education through the 'Namibia Education Sector Programme' under the 9th European Development Fund (EDF9). &euro;18 million of this is provided directly to the Government of Namibia as earmarked budget support. The remaining &euro;3 million are allocated to building capacity and providing of technical assistance in the education sector. The UK share of EDF9 is 12.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1989W.6/2">As the EC's 'Namibia Education Sector programme' provides direct funding to the education budget in Namibia, it is the Government of Namibia's education policies that determine the language of instruction in schools. This recommends the use of mother tongues as the medium of instruction from grades 1 to 3, with grade 4 as a transitional grade. English is used as the medium of instruction from grades 5 to 12.</p>

	<p pid="b.1990W.3/1">As an international and EU reference laboratory for avian influenza, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) has responsibility for verifying other countries' test results. The VLA takes a leading role in developing and defining standards and keeps abreast of the latest information. It has frequent discussions with its counterparts overseas and, as a result, is internationally recognised as a centre of excellence in veterinary research.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/2">Since the H5N1 strain of the virus emerged in South East Asia four years ago, I have had discussions on a regular basis with ministerial counterparts in the EU. Ministers and officials have been actively involved in discussions and the provision of assistance, at an international level, on avian influenza. Examples of this include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/3" class="indent">i. At the pledging conference in Bamako, Mali, on 6 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase>, the fourth global bird flu summit since late last year, the UK Government committed to assist countries at risk or affected by avian influenza. The Department for International Development will provide &pound;30 million over the next three years to support country, regional or global activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/4" class="indent">ii. The UK presidency of the EU in 2005 provided technical support (central research laboratories (CRL) and veterinary assistance) to many countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/5" class="indent">iii. Under the UK presidency, Commission funds were provided to enable OIE and the International Animal Health Organisation to hold technical programmes on Al in Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/6" class="indent">iv. During our presidency, the UK delegation represented the EU at the international partnership on avian and pandemic influenza on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-07">7 October 2006</phrase>; and the Geneva partners' meeting on avian and human pandemic influenza on 7 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-09">9 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/7" class="indent">v. The Government have significantly enhanced the arrangements for surveillance of wild birds, including the investigation of die-offs and sampling at shoots and wetlands. The arrangements have been agreed as part of co-ordinated efforts across the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.1990W.3/8" class="indent">vi. UK research bodies are also keen to collaborate with affected and at-risk countries. The Medical Research Council has a &pound;10 million collaborative programme which can support such partnerships as required.</p>

	<p pid="b.1991W.5/1">I am not aware of a recent upsurge in tuberculosis (TB) cases among the badger population. However, bovine TB is the most serious animal disease in this country at the moment and the main reservoir for the disease in wildlife is in badgers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1991W.5/2">We continue to make progress with our research on vaccine development.

	<p pid="b.1991W.5/3">Nothing has been ruled in or out on the question of badger culling. We need to examine scientific and organisational questions about how the reservoir of the disease in the badger population can be addressed in a way which contains the disease rather than spreading it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1992W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file32014.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/files/file32014.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1992W.6/4">The results of the modelling assume the cost of new nuclear power generation to be around &pound;38/MWh, as a central case. The modelling also considered a high case of &pound;44/MWh and a low case of &pound;30/MWh.</p>
	<p pid="b.1992W.6/5">The purpose of the modelling was to provide estimates of the relative cost of electricity generation technologies under different scenarios and assumptions to inform policy analysis. The estimates therefore do not represent the government view on the relative costs of the technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1992W.6/6">The modelling carried out for the Energy Review did not consider the costs of emerging wave and tidal technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1992W.6/7">However, the results of the Carbon Trust's &quot;Marine Energy Challenge&quot; research programme show the lowest-cost offshore wave energy converters to be in a range from &pound;120/MWh to &pound;440/MWh, with central estimates in the sub-range of &pound;220/MWh to &pound;250/MWh.</p>
	<p pid="b.1992W.6/8">Energy from initial tidal-stream farms was predicted to cost between &pound;90/MWh and &pound;180/MWh, with central estimates in the sub-range &pound;120/MWh to &pound;150/MWh.</p>
	<p pid="b.1992W.6/9">The full Marine Energy Challenge report can be seen at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1992W.6/11">The other form of tidal power is tidal impoundment that is the application of mature and well understood technology. This type of scheme was previously studied during the 1980's at a number of potential sites, the largest being in the Severn Estuary. The results of the Severn study were reported in Energy Paper 57 HMSO 1989 (ISBN 0 11 412952 5). The unit cost of generation for the Severn scheme was estimated to be &pound;75/MWh based upon 1994 prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.2005W.6/1">The Government welcome the fact that the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor's investigation has got to the point at which he is able to ask for the issuing of summonses. It is now for the judges to decide whether to approve this request. The UK has not discussed the individuals under investigation with the UN given the ICC's independent status. However, UK officials are in regular contact with officials of the ICC about a range of issues and the court continues to have the Government's full support for its activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.2007W.5/1">Some progress is being made on the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). A Government of National Unity have been established in Khartoum. The Sudanese armed forces are redeploying from the south ahead of schedule and integrated northern/southern military units have been created. The administration in the south is starting to develop and roads are starting to be built there. A new currency has been launched in southern Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="b.2007W.5/2">But progress remains too slow. The establishment of key peace-building bodies and the passage of legislation required by the agreement are behind schedule. Of particular concern is the lack of preparation for national elections, which are due to take place by 2009. An urgent resolution is also needed of the Abyei and north/south border disputes. And oil revenues need to be allocated transparently between the central and southern Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.2007W.5/3">The UK continues to press for more progress through its membership of the CPA implementation oversight body. We are also supporting CPA implementation directly through development and humanitarian assistance (&pound;110 million in 2006-07). We have drawn the attention of all parts of the Sudanese Government and the international community to the risks posed to the CPA by continued violence in Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="b.2013W.2/1">There are now very few political prisoners in Zimbabwe, in the sense of those serving prison sentences for holding or advocating dissenting political views. However, arrests and detentions on political grounds are commonplace, for example for participating in demonstrations or attending public meetings. In 2006 human rights organisations registered more than 2,500 of these cases, but without a single conviction. We are concerned that the recent ban on political rallies may well lead to an increase in such incidents. We oppose the ban as well as the arrest and detention of any persons in Zimbabwe on political grounds.</p>

	<p pid="b.2018W.5/1">Zimbabwe has been in arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank since February 2001 and October 2000 (respectively). Following a series of payments, Zimbabwe cleared its arrears to the IMF's General Reserve Account on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>. However, it remains in arrears to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility&mdash;Exogenous Shocks Facility (PRGF-ESF) Trust at the IMF, the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the Paris Club.</p>
	<p pid="b.2018W.5/2">As result, Zimbabwe is unable to access any new financing from these institutions and is also unable to vote in the IMF Board. The IMF has urged a comprehensive and sequenced programme of economic reform to tackle the economic crisis and address the desperate situation faced by the ordinary people of Zimbabwe. The UK fully supports that advice.</p>

Performance levels are continuing to improve, prompted by CPA and supported by the joint capacity building programme we have established with the LGA. The White Paper 'Strong and Prosperous Communities' set out our proposals for a new performance framework for local government, which will support continued improvement for all. In addition, we are working with local government to develop a national improvement strategy which will help to focus improvement and capacity building support where it is most needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.2029W.6/2">A Home Office study carried out in 2004 revealed that the average cost of obtaining an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) was &pound;2,500.

	<p pid="b.2029W.6/3">Costs have fallen as a result of increased efficiency as practitioners become more familiar with ASBOs, and the introduction of orders on conviction which removes the need for separate hearings.</p>

	<p pid="b.2031W.3/1">At the Prime Minister's summit on guns and gangs on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>, a three-point plan was announced focusing on policing, powers and prevention. This work-plan includes a review of legislation relating to gangs, which will look at sentencing of juveniles, and gang membership as an aggravating factor in sentencing and other issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/2">We are working closely with ACPO on the related issues of gangs, guns and drugs supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/3">We are also working with the Metropolitan police on the development of an operational toolkit on gangs; developing a community-focused toolkit to provide advice to parents and young people; and working in conjunction with the Department for Education and Skills on a toolkit on gangs aimed as schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/4">There are a number of wide-ranging national and local programmes that tackle gang-related issues:</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/5" class="indent">The Youth Inclusion Programme established in 2000 provides tailor-made programmes for 13 to 16-year-olds identified locally (by police, schools, social services etc.) as engaged in crime, or being at most risk of offending, truancy, or social exclusion. In first three years of programme, arrest rates for the 50 young people considered to be most at risk of crime had been reduced by 65 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/6" class="indent">Safer Schools Partnerships were launched in 2002. With 370 police officers in selected schools in areas with high levels of street crime, the partnerships aim to reduce victimisation, and criminal and antisocial behaviour within the school and its community.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/7" class="indent">The Positive Futures scheme provides lifestyle, educational and employment opportunities for young people living in deprived areas. Between 2003 and 2006 &pound;15 million of funding from the Home Office and &pound;3 million from Football Foundation, plus individual funding from local supporters, was provided. Since 2000 over 26,000 children have been involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/8" class="indent">The Manchester Multi-Agency Gangs strategy is a partnership which helps young people exit gangs, working intensively with young people and their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/9" class="indent">The West Midlands Mediation and Transformation Service provides conflict resolution and support services, which have defused tension and aim to help young people exit gangs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/10" class="indent">Other programmes such as the From Boyhood to Manhood Foundation focus on helping young men develop self-esteem. Boys are referred to the FBMF by local education authorities, special needs departments, youth-offending teams and social services departments. The FBMF helps them to get back on track through its day-programme of education and self-development.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/11" class="indent">Other local programmes include the &quot;Defending Da Hood&quot; programme in Waltham Forest to engage with hard-to-reach young people in order to discuss issues which are relevant to them, and raise awareness of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/12">We also support local initiatives through the Connected Fund, which was established in 2004. The sixth round was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> and will accept applications from small community organisations working on gangs issues for grants up to &pound;5,000. The closing date for bids is <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-12">12 April</phrase>. We have also provided project funding via the Government offices for the regions and directly to projects such as the Urban Concepts &quot;Don't Trigger&quot; anti-gun crime campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.2031W.3/13">Long-term prevention work includes parenting support to ensure that young people are given guidance in their developing years, volunteering programmes to help young people and provide alternative activities, and mentoring services to support young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.2032W.5/2">Disclosures are primarily designed to be used by an employer at the point of recruitment for a particular position. Ultimately it is for each employer and not the CRB to decide whether a fresh disclosure should be applied for, bearing in mind their legal and other responsibilities and subject to any statutory requirements. There are a number of reasons why an employer may not wish to accept a disclosure that has been processed for a previous employment position, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.5/3" class="indent">The disclosure may not be at the right level (there are two different levels of CRB check; standard and enhanced);</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.5/4" class="indent">The older a disclosure is the less reliable the information is, because the information it contains may not be up to date;</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.5/5" class="indent">Information revealed through a CRB check reflects the information that was available at the time of its issue&mdash;a person may have committed a crime in the intervening period;</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.5/6" class="indent">An organisation or employer may be required by law to carry out a fresh check against the Protection of Children Act list (PoCA) and/or the Protection of Vulnerable Adults Act list (POVA), thereby limiting the use of portability.</p>

	<p pid="b.2033W.0/1">Since April 2006 every probation area in England and Wales has delivered an accredited Domestic Violence Programme and demand for them is high. Normally offenders are expected to start a domestic violence programme within four weeks of the start of the order. In some areas offenders are waiting longer than this. Every offender waiting to start a programme is under the supervision of an offender manager who is responsible for monitoring and managing the risk posed by the offender and instituting public protection measures if necessary. There is a national target of 1,200 for the number of offenders in the community who successfully complete a domestic violence programme. This target will be exceeded by the end of the financial year&mdash;by the end of December there had already been 1,199 completions.</p>

The UK is currently examining how we implement the convention and cannot give a specific date for signature. However, having signalled our intention to sign we are now committed to implementing the convention and putting in place a framework which will provide real protection and support to all victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.2034W.5/3">Unlike the approach adopted by some of our Council of Europe colleagues the UK will not ratify the convention until all the changes to domestic legislation, processes and guidance are in place to ensure that we comply fully with its terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.2035W.2/2">The Home Office provided guidance to police forces and authorities on the receipt and disposal of firearms and ammunition handed in during the amnesty in 2003. The guidance advised forces that all firearms and ammunition should be destroyed in accordance with force policy, other than those items considered to be of exceptional historic or forensic significance (as advised by the Forensic Science Service (FSS)), or items believed to have been used in crime and, after examination by the FSS, retained as part of an on-going investigation.</p>

People should not think they can get away with passing off their gun to someone else. Unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm means five years in jail, and this will now also apply to people who use others to look after their weapons for them.

After consultation with the private sector we issued detailed guidance to the police, other law enforcement agencies, and prosecution agencies on the importance of confidentiality in the handling of SARs. Adherence to this guidance is a condition of access to the SARs database maintained by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. This issue was also addressed in Sir Stephen Lander's review of the SARs regime which was published in April 2006. SOCA has subsequently set up a dedicated telephone line to enable any breaches of the guidelines to be reported. We will keep the guidance under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.2040W.3/2">The passport interview network will provide an office within 15 minutes travelling time for just over half of the population of the UK and over 95 per cent. of the population will live within one hour's travelling of an office.</p>
	<p pid="b.2040W.3/3">A small number of potential applicants, estimated to be less than 0.7 per cent. of first-time passport applicants (4,000 out of 600,000 per annum), live more than an hour's journey from an interview office. For this group we are putting in place secure video-conferencing links with the customer visiting a partner organisation, for example, local council premises. We currently plan to have remote interview facilities in 25 locations; however we are still consulting with regional stakeholders and are considering additional locations.</p>

	<p pid="b.2040W.3/5">To provide an analysis of the population within a 20-mile radius of each of the 69 interview offices would incur a disproportionate cost. The interview office closest to Grimsby will be in Kingston-upon-Hull, a distance of approximately 33 miles.</p>

Under this Act, it is a criminal offence to publish any article which is considered to be obscene; that is, an article, which, in the view of the court, tends to 'deprave and corrupt' a person who is likely to see, hear or read it. This is a flexible test which has been shown to apply to material at a lower threshold where children are likely to access it. The OPA applies equally to material published over the internet, including material made available through file-sharing programmes.</p>

There is also to be new Safety Software Sub-Group of the Taskforce to encourage internet and software services to seek accreditation, encourage take-up of the software by parents, and to ensure a process for review and updating the standard if it proves effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.2046W.2/2">Under part III of the Public Order Act 1986 it is a criminal offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent or likelihood to stir up racial hatred. This offence covers inflammatory comments made in public or in the media as well as the distribution of printed material.</p>
	<p pid="b.2046W.2/3">Parliament has also passed the Racial and Religious Hatred Act, though it is not yet in force. This legislation was intended to close the loophole whereby racial groups (which the courts have deemed to include Jews and Sikhs) are afforded protection against incited hatred while religious groups (Christians and Muslims for example) are not. The Act contains specific protection for freedom of speech. The Government are working towards identifying a date for implementation of the Act in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="b.2046W.2/4">Nine racially-aggravated offences were introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which include assaults, criminal damage and harassment, which make available to the courts higher maximum penalties where there is evidence of racist motivation or racial hostility in connection with offence. The Government extended these offences in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 by creating new religiously-aggravated offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.2046W.2/5">For other offences, there is a requirement for courts to take account of racial or religious motivation in sentencing (Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000).</p>
	<p pid="b.2046W.2/6">Incitement is an anticipatory common law offence so that incitement to commit violent or other criminal offences is itself an offence in religious or any other communities.</p>

The National Offender Management Service is developing an evaluation strategy for the sex offender treatment programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.2048W.5/2">Although the proportion of number plate thefts is low, we understand from anecdotal evidence that it is an emerging problem. In order to help address it, following consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency published in February 2006 a voluntary standard for vehicle registration plates which were resistant to theft.

	<p pid="b.2053W.0/4" class="indent">PQ 123378&mdash;To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, what steps he is taking to improve front-line services provided by the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.2053W.0/5" class="indent">CAFCASS is currently consulting on a major strategy for the next 3 years, set out in its recent consultation paper &quot;Organising for Quality&quot;. A final consultation on new National Standards for CAFCASS is part of that consultation.

CAFCASS publishes its accounts at the end of each financial year and year on year changes can be seen.</p>

	<p pid="b.2053W.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Organising for Quality&quot; makes several recommendations about how CAFCASS's services can be improved within its annual budget allocation. These proposals are currently out to consultation. Priorities for each year will be set once the annual budget is know. Overarching priorities for the next three years will be set out in CAFCASS's new business plan, which will be a plan for 2007-10.</p>

	<p pid="b.2054W.6/1">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) adopts a number of measures to ensure that its new large-scale computer systems meet performance targets and do not exceed allocated budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.2054W.6/2">Routinely, DfES projects that are enabled by information and communications technology (ICT) adopt the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) PRINCE2 project management methodology. PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments Version 2) is an ICT-enabled project management standard used extensively by UK Government Departments and widely recognised and used in other sectors. It provides a flexible and adaptable project management framework that aims to ensure that system delivery risks are identified and managed appropriately, and that objectives and benefits are achieved within budget, within time and to the required quality and performance standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.2054W.6/3">Furthermore, within DfES, ICT projects are routinely subjected to OGC Gateway&trade; Reviews. The Gateway process examines a project at critical stages in its lifecycle to provide assurance that it can progress successfully to the next stage. The process is based on techniques that aim to achieve more effective delivery of benefits and more predictable costs and outcomes. More information on PRINCE2 and Gateway can be found on the OGC website <a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk">http://www.ogc.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.2054W.6/4">To complement the methodology and process, DfES and its ICT system development partners adopt a variety of tools and methods to ensure new IT system performance targets are met which include benchmarking, performance testing, iterative development techniques and user acceptance testing.</p>
	<p pid="b.2054W.6/5">In addition, DfES has dedicated in-house teams which provide an assurance and support role for departmental ICT-enabled projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.2061W.2/1">Local authorities have an existing duty to carry out an annual assessment of child care provision in their area, including out-of-school provision for 11-year-olds. From April 2007, the Childcare Act 2006 places a new duty on local authorities to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the sufficiency of child care in their area, taking into account for all age groups the demand for child care, supply of child are, and any gaps between the two. Jobcentre Plus are designated 'partners' of local authorities in the fulfilment of this duty. Recently published statutory guidance highlights the importance of considering the child care needs of lone parents and their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.2/2">Local authorities must complete their first sufficiency assessment within one year in order to prepare for their new duty, coming into force in April 2008, to secure sufficient child care provision to enable parents to enter or remain in work, or to make the transition to work. Statutory guidance will make it clear that local authorities will need to ensure that there is sufficient provision available to meet the needs of families at risk of social exclusion, including lone parent families. The greater availability of child care should make it easier for lone parents to return to work.</p>

We estimate the cost to local authorities of provision for pupils that have been permanently excluded is &pound;3.5 million in 2007-08 (for September 2007 to March 2008), which local authorities will need to meet from within the 5 per cent. increase in the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) per pupil that all authorities have received for 2007-08. Subject to the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, funding will be included in authorities' DSG allocations for 2008-09 and beyond to cover the whole year cost.

	<p pid="b.2062W.5/1">The Government believe there is no place for homophobic bullying in schools and our general guidance on bullying and the Anti-Bullying Charter make this clear. In 2004 my Department and the Department of Health jointly published guidance on challenging homophobia in schools called &quot;Stand up for us&quot;. Recognising that homophobic bullying can be a particularly difficult issue for many teachers to deal with, my Department has more recently commissioned Stonewall and Educational Action Challenging Homophobia (EACH) to produce web-based guidance for schools which will look more specifically at how to prevent and tackle homophobic bullying.

	<p pid="b.2064W.0/19">Media coverage of the issue of student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt during the passage of the Enterprise Act 2002 may have contributed to the rise in bankruptcies in 2003 and 2004. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.0/20">Provisions were therefore included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on bankruptcy. This may explain the subsequent fall. While borrowers who have become bankrupt remain liable to repay their student loans, they continue to benefit from the same terms as other borrowers, with repayments linked to income and no obligation to repay if their annual income is below &pound;15,000.</p>

Further, as of December 2006 the number of uncleared new scheme applications stood as 186,000 and the total number of uncleared cases in the last three months has been the lowest since comparable records began in 1999.</p>

	<p pid="b.2066W.2/10" class="indent">59 per cent of new scheme cases with a liability made a payment or arranged Maintenance Direct (up from 54 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/11" class="indent">Uncleared new scheme applications were down by 13 per cent (across both schemes) since March 2006 and in the last three months have been at their lowest since comparable records began in May 1999</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/12" class="indent">55 per cent of applications were cleared within twelve weeks (up from 49 per cent and meeting target level for March 2007) and 74 per cent within six months (up from 64 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/13" class="indent">The Agency answered 97 per cent of queued calls over 12 months (up from 90 per cent)</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/14" class="indent">The Operational Improvement Plan included plans to contract out some of the outstanding debt owed to parents with care, to private debt collection agencies. By the end of January 2007 just under &pound;750,000 had been collected by these agencies. A letter sent by the Agency to inform clients that their debt is to be transferred to the external debt collection agencies had also resulted in an additional &pound;640,000 collected by the Agency by the end of January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/15" class="indent">During the year ending March 2006 a total amount of &pound;13.5 million was collected through specific legal enforcement work, an average monthly amount of &pound;1.1 million. This has increased to &pound;13.53 million between April and December 2006, giving a monthly average of &pound;1.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/16" class="indent">The Agency continues to improve the collection of child support maintenance arrears and during the year ending March 2006 a total amount of &pound;80.8 million was collected, an average monthly amount of &pound;6.7 million. This has increased to an average monthly amount of &pound;7.3 million between April and December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2066W.2/17" class="indent">The attached table states the average debt growth and the total debt outstanding at the end of each month since the implementation of the Operational Improvement Plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.2073W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.2073W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning incidents of violence towards Jobcentre Plus staff <i> (a)</i> from customers receiving a decision on Social Fund Crisis funds and <i> (b)</i> more generally in the delivery of our services. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.2073W.2/4" class="indent">The Agency has robust arrangements for collecting information following verbal, attempted, or actual assaults on our staff. As part of the incident reporting process, we ask our staff to categorise as near as they can the cause of an incident by selecting from a list. We do not have an exact match to the 'Social Fund Crisis funds' category in your question, but the second column of the table below shows where staff have selected the closest match&mdash;a category entitled 'Social Fund/Hardship claim dispute, e.g. eligibility, delays, demands'. The third column shows the total number of actual assaults against our staff during the period you state. Incidents relating to Social Fund/Hardship represent a small proportion of the total number of assaults.</p>

	<p pid="b.2073W.2/15" class="indent">We take the safety of our people very seriously. Customer-facing activity is thoroughly risk-assessed and control measures are in place to manage the risk in our offices. Whilst no assault is acceptable, our assault figures should be seen in the context not only of the millions of face to face contacts we have with customers each year, but also a more rigorous approach to reporting incidents being adopted. The likelihood of being subject to an actual assault in our offices is low: for example, in 2006, around one half of one percent of our staff reported such an incident.</p>
	<p pid="b.2073W.2/16" class="indent">Moreover, the vast majority of these assaults do not result in any physical injury: fewer than 20 assaults each year result in injuries reported as 'more than minor cuts and bruises' and the number of injuries per year, unlike the wider reported trend, has not increased since 2003.</p>

For the most recently available period (October to December 2006) published data show that of all patients treated 39.7 per cent. were referred urgently for suspected cancer by their GP, and 60.3 per cent. were referred from another source, or routinely referred (this will include referrals from NHS screening services).</p>

	<p pid="b.2080W.9/1">Women invited to participate in the national health service cervical screening programme need to understand the potential benefits and harms in doing so and to be able to make an informed choice about whether or not they wish to proceed. Information provided to women must be honest, comprehensive and understandable. That is why the NHS Cancer Plan stated that all eligible women will receive a national information leaflet on cervical screening, which is now sent out with each invitation for screening and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk">www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.2080W.9/2">To raise awareness about the availability of cervical screening, NHS cancer screening programmes have issued a regional communications pack to all local cervical screening services. The packs include advice on raising the awareness of screening, including posters and supplement local activity to promote the availability of cervical screening. We encourage all women to make an informed choice on whether to accept their invitations to be screened.</p>
	<p pid="b.2080W.9/3">We are aware of the concerns about the fall in the number of young women taking up their invitation to be screened. NHS cancer screening programmes are currently undertaking a piece of work exploring the reasons why these women do not attend. Preliminary results indicate that some women think screening will hurt or that the experience will be embarrassing. Another key factor may be that the programme is a victim of its own success, cervical cancer is now a relatively rare disease in this country thanks to the screening programme, and the public perception of risk may have diminished.</p>
	<p pid="b.2080W.9/4">These findings, and any others that come out of this piece of work, will be fed into the next Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening (ACCS) meeting in the spring and the ACCS will advise on future action.</p>

The first invitations were sent out in July 2006. The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is one of the first national bowel screening programmes in the world, and is the first cancer screening programme in England to invite men as well as women.</p>
	<p pid="b.2081W.2/2">Five hubs across England will invite men and women to participate in the screening programme, send out the faecal occult blood (FOB) testing kits, analyse the returned kits and send results out. Ninety to 100 local screening centres will provide endoscopy services for the 2 per cent. of men and women who have a positive FOB test result.</p>
	<p pid="b.2081W.2/3">The five programme hubs have been confirmed as Rugby (West Midlands and the North West), Guildford (Southern), St. Marks (London), Gateshead (North East) and Nottingham (Eastern). All five hubs will be operational by the end of March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.2081W.2/4">In addition, the first eight local screening centres have now begun operations. These are: Wolverhampton, Norwich, South Devon, Liverpool, St. Marks London, St. George's London, Gloucestershire and Bolton. The other six sites due to become local screening centres in wave 1 of the programme (2006-07) will be confirmed as soon as possible, when they have satisfied quality and capacity criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.2081W.2/5">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) were invited to bid for their local endoscopy units to become local screening centres as part of wave 2 of the programme in 2007-08 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January 2007</phrase>. It is up to SHAs to decide where local screening centres should be located for the benefit of their own populations.</p>

The table shows the number of testing kits sent out, the number of people who have completed the kits in their own homes and returned them to the laboratory, and the number of positive results. People with a positive result have received an appointment to discuss colonoscopy with a screening nurse at a local screening centre in a hospital-based setting, and have undergone their colonoscopies if appropriate. Further information, such as the number of cancers detected, will be made available as the programme progresses.</p>

A comprehensive strategy has been implemented detailing both preventative and re-active action to be taken to tackle this problem both nationally and locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.2087W.2/3">Guidance has been issued to every health body in England setting out the support that should be offered at a local level, including arranging for counselling services if required, to staff that have experienced violence and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.2087W.2/4">The NHS SMS have formed a legal protection unit (LPU) which advises health bodies on the appropriate action to take against alleged offenders. The LPU also considers private prosecutions on behalf of those who have been assaulted where the prosecuting authorities have declined to take action, and the circumstances are such that action is appropriate. This includes seeking redress.</p>

	<p pid="b.2087W.5/1">Most competence for action in the field of public health remains with the member states, but the European Union has the responsibility, set out in the treaty, to undertake certain actions which complement the work done by member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.2087W.5/2">Article 152 of the EC treaty covers public health. It states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all community policies and activities; and that community action should be directed towards improving public health, preventing human illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to human health and complement national policies. The article also encourages co-operation between the community and member states on public health.</p>
	<p pid="b.2087W.5/3">In practice, EU work on public health often focuses on facilitating the exchange of information, knowledge and best practice among member states and covers many issues, from the general (eg health inequalities) to the specific (eg, action on alcohol use). Article 152(4) also sets out specific areas, e.g. standards for quality and safety for blood, in which legislative measures can be adopted by the Commission in this field. EU legislation that has a beneficial effect on public health has also been adopted on the basis of other parts of the treaty (eg, tobacco packaging legislation, based on Article 95 which relates to the internal market).</p>

	<p pid="b.2088W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, the responsibility for health services in the publicly run prisons in England was transferred from HM Prison Service to the national health service. Funding was transferred to the NHS in stages, and this transfer process completed on schedule in April 2006. The responsibility for commissioning prison health services in the publicly-run prisons in England has therefore been fully devolved to national health service primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/2">Some &pound;118 million in funding for these services was transferred in 2003. During 2006-07 nearly &pound;200 million will be invested in prison healthcare.</p>

	<p pid="b.2095W.3/1">Returning the national health service to overall financial balance has been a key priority in 2006-07. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have taken responsibility for developing and implementing financial and operational strategies to both manage and improve the financial position within their overall area. As part of this strategy, SHAs have top sliced resource allocations made to their primary care trusts (PCTs), thereby creating SHA reserves.</p>
	<p pid="b.2095W.3/2">SHAs have agreed an appropriate level of contribution to these reserves with their PCTs thereby allowing the SHA to deliver the financial planning target for its economy. The level of any contributions is based on the financial and service circumstances of individual organisations, and is always underpinned by the principle of fairness.</p>
	<p pid="b.2095W.3/3">We expect SHAs to maintain the integrity of the allocations system, with contributing PCTs being entitled to repayment of their contributions over a reasonable period, not usually exceeding the three-year allocation cycle. However, SHAs will be asked to ensure that PCTs with the greatest health need are repaid first.</p>

In other cases strategic health authorities (SHA) have sought to generate brokerage to contribute to the overall national health service financial position.
