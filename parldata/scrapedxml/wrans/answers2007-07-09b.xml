	<p pid="b.1193W.5/1">Both Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation are effective methods for reducing Nitrogen Oxide (NOX) emissions from diesel vehicles. Exhaust Gas Recirculation is effective at low-medium engine load and can deliver moderate reductions in NOX emissions. Selective Catalytic Reduction is effective up to full engine load and can deliver substantial NOX reductions, but at higher cost than Exhaust Gas Recirculation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193W.5/2">Exhaust Gas Recirculation is already widely used on diesel cars and vans. Selective Catalytic Reduction is fitted to the majority of new Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and buses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193W.5/3">Selective Catalytic Reduction relies on the use of a consumable reagent to reduce NOX. From November 2007, new HGV and bus engines are required to monitor emission control systems and limit engine power in the event of their failing to operate. This is essential to encourage operators to keep the systems maintained and the SCR reagent topped up, and so ensure that NOX savings are actually delivered in operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193W.5/4">The Department for Transport takes into account the capabilities and costs of specific technologies when developing the United Kingdom's negotiating position on EU vehicle emission standards, but does not prescribe which technology industry should use to meet tighter emissions standards. Our Regulatory Impact Assessment on car and van Euro 5 emissions standards considered both of these technologies and can be found at</p>

	<p pid="b.1194W.2/1">Legislation to limit the emissions of pollutants from vehicles (including nitrogen oxide emissions) was first introduced in the 1970s. Particularly stringent standards, known colloquially as &quot;Euro 1&quot; were adopted in the early 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/2">Since then, successive standards have progressively tightened emissions limits with new vehicles currently having to meet Euro 4 standards. The Department for Transport has fully engaged with the European Commission, European Parliament, other member states and stakeholders in developing these standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/3">Between 1990 and 2004, these standards reduced the total quantity of oxides of nitrogen emitted from heavy duty vehicles by some 37 per cent. and from light duty vehicles (cars and vans) by 70 per cent.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Table 4.15&mdash;UK Emissions of Air Pollutants 1970 to 2004, AEA Energy and Environment December 2006</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/5">However despite these reductions nitrogen oxide emissions from road vehicles, in particular diesel vehicles, continue to be an air quality concern in the UK and throughout the EU. For this reason at the end of 2005 the European Commission published a proposal for tighter Euro 5 emissions standards for cars and vans. I am pleased to be able to state that, not only have these standards been recently adopted by the European Council and Parliament, but that the UK also successfully secured a further (Euro 6) round of standards which tighten diesel NOx limits by 68 per cent. compared to current Euro 4 standards. This will put the permitted levels for diesels close to the very low levels of petrol engined vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/6">We expect the European Commission to come forward with proposals to further tighten heavy duty vehicle emission standards late this year or early next. As usual the Department will fully engage in the negotiation of these standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/7">In order to bring forward further improvements in air quality the Government offer financial incentives to purchase vehicles built to more stringent emissions standards in advance of the standards becoming mandatory. The Government offer such incentives through the Reduced Pollution Certificate scheme. This will, from October 2007, offer heavy duty vehicle and bus operators a reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty of up to &pound;500 per annum for vehicles which are fully compliant with the next level of standards in advance of their mandatory application in 2009.</p>

Consideration is given to all contributory factors to determine the level of potential risk posed to both public and workers' safety should no action be taken. Any full or partial precautionary road closure deemed necessary would follow where the risk to safety is calculated to outweigh the effect of disruption.</p>

	<p pid="b.1200W.3/1">The UK continues to take very seriously the threat to elephant conservation posed by ivory poaching. In recent years the UK, along with EU partners, has supported the establishment of baseline data to monitor illegal killing and trade in elephants and their ivory by providing funds to support the MIKE and ETIS programmes under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). During the preparations for the 55<sup>(th)</sup> CITES Standing Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-02">2 June 2007</phrase>, where approval of the stockpile sale was agreed in line with previously set criteria, the UK played an active role in considering the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.3/2">At the subsequent 14<sup>(th)</sup> Convention of the Parties to CITES which took place in the Hague in June, a longer term agreement was reached among African range states on ivory trade. Following a one-off sale of an amount of stockpiled ivory increased to take account of the passage of time, the proceeds of which are to be used for conservation purposes, it is now agreed that there will be a nine year resting period on any further sales of ivory. This will allow the effects of the one-off stockpile sale to be properly assessed. The agreement also includes the establishment of an African elephant Trust Fund to address elephant conservation issues across the continent. The UK fully supported this proposal when it was presented to the CITES Parties, and will be looking to monitor the reported impacts of the stockpiled ivory sales, and broader elephant conservation measures, particularly in its newly elected position as a member of the CITES Standing Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.3/3">There have been no bi-lateral meetings at a Ministerial level with Chad, Kenya or India specifically on this issue although my predecessor spoke to Julius Kipng'etich (the Head of the Kenyan Wildlife Services) and Prof. Kivutha Kibwana (the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources) in the margins of the Ministerial event at the Conference in June to assure them of our support for elephant conservation and to agree to meet later in the year to discuss this further.</p>

	<p pid="b.1201W.0/1">In the UK, we have agreed an ambition with manufacturers and retailers to phase out the sale of inefficient light bulbs by 2011. The UK will be one of the first European countries to remove inefficient bulbs from stores; saving approximately 1.2 million tonnes of carbon by 2012, as well as saving consumers money on their energy bills. We also continue to support the European Commission in working towards regulating against inefficient bulbs by 2010, with a phase out over the following years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/2">There is no requirement for waste energy efficient light bulbs to be separately collected from households. However, since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July</phrase>, energy efficient light bulbs have been required to be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations. Householders will be able to take waste energy efficient light bulbs to designated collection facilities, in the main local authority civic amenity sites. From this point, producers will be financially responsible for their onward collection, treatment and recycling, where most of the mercury can be recovered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/3">Retailers have obligations under the WEEE Regulations to provide consumers with information on:</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/4" class="indent">(i) the collection and take-back systems available to them;</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/5" class="indent">(ii) their role in contributing to the reuse and recycling of WEEE;</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/6" class="indent">(iii) and the potential effects on the environment and human health as a result of the presence of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/7">Under the WEEE Permitting Regulations, mercury must be removed from energy efficient light-bulbs where they are collected separately. A minimum of 80 per cent. by weight of the materials must be recycled or recovered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201W.0/8">Energy efficient light bulbs contain a small amount of mercury (less than 5 milligrams per lamp) and should be disposed of responsibly. There is increasing evidence that the mercury in each energy efficient bulb is considerably outweighed by the mercury put into the atmosphere through the additional electricity generation required to operate a traditional bulb.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203W.2/1">England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will all have their specific mechanisms for monitoring and reporting on pollution in the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/2">The main joint working on the state of the Irish sea is carried out within the framework of the Oslo and Paris (OSPAR) Convention for the Protection of the North East Atlantic to which the UK and the Republic of Ireland are contracting parties, where regular assessments are done, information gathered by the various organisations is brought together and assessments are made and published in the OSPAR Quality Status Report (QSR). The last QSR was published in the year 2000, and included a regional report on the Celtic seas. The next QSR will be published in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/3">The UK has also recently published &quot;Charting Progress&quot; which provides the first integrated assessment of the state of the seas across the whole of the UK continental shelf. &quot;Charting Progress&quot; includes a feeder report on Marine Environment Quality which focuses on the impacts of human activities on the marine environment and its resources, and provides assessments of the status and trends based on current knowledge and information. Much of the information given below is derived from the OSPAR QSR and &quot;Charting Progress&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/4">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), together with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland and the Fisheries Research Services in Scotland have carried out studies on the effects of tributyl tin (TBT) on dogwhelks in the seas around the UK, including the Irish sea. The results, based on surveys between 1994 and 2003, show that effects on reproduction only appear to be significant within a few hundred metres from point source discharges of TBT.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/5">Regarding the impacts of nutrients, the UK completed an Assessment of the Eutrophication Status of UK Marine Waters in 2002 which found that the only eutrophication problem areas in the Irish sea were (a) the Inner Belfast Lough and tidal Lagan impoundment, and (b) Quoile Pondage in Strangford Lough. A further eutrophication assessment of UK marine waters, which is based on observations made between 2000 and 2005 and includes estuaries, is under way and will be published in 2008. The Environment Agency also monitors the eutrophication status of surface waters under the nitrates and urban wastewater treatment directives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/6">With regards to pollution incidents involving more than 0.01 tonnes of spillage which have occurred in the Irish sea, the Environment Agency's pollution incident database shows that there were 237 recorded incidents on or close to the Irish sea coast between 2004 and 2006. These cover a range of incident types and severities. Not all of these spillages or releases will have entered the waters of the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/7">The monitoring of pollution in the Irish sea is carried out by a number of organisations in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Funds are generally allocated on a national basis and it is not possible to distinguish the specific amount of money allocated to monitoring pollution levels in the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/8">The UK statutory bodies which monitor or fund the monitoring of pollution levels in UK marine waters are as follows: Defra, the Department of the Environment Northern Ireland, Welsh Assembly Government, Scottish Executive, the Fisheries Research Services in Scotland, the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, the Department for Transport, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Marine Coastguard Agency. Most of these will deal with some aspects of monitoring in the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/9">A number of non-statutory bodies will also monitor pollution levels in the Irish sea, including marine institutes, universities, industries, and non-governmental organisations, but Defra does not hold records on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/10">We are not aware of any recent assessments of specific direct effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (CBs) on the marine environment in the Irish sea. However, CB concentrations in sediments were measured at a number of sites around the UK between 1999 and 2002, with a number of samples in estuaries exceeding the ecotoxicological assessment criteria for CBs. Work is continuing on possible effects on marine mammals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/11">The UK Government cooperate with the Irish Government in the framework of the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the North East Atlantic through participation in its Joint Assessment and Monitoring Programme. Regular joint assessments of the status of the various regions of the North East Atlantic are made and, in the year 2000, a Quality Status Report (QSR) on the Celtic seas was published by OSPAR, which involved sustained contact between officials and scientists from all countries bordering the Celtic seas in providing the various assessments. Preparations are under way for the next QSR in 2010, and the cooperation continues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/12">The Joint Nutrient Study (Jonus) was a research programme carried out in the 1990s, which ended in 1999. The first phase of the programme established the extent of loss of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon) from the water that passes through estuaries from the land to the sea. The programme established some general rules that could be applied in nutrient budgeting and how this knowledge could be used in the management of marine eutrophication. The second phase of the programme compared two sea areas in terms of the impact on aspects of marine biology associated with land based nutrient input. The programme established a basis for further understanding the need to manage nutrient inputs and the criteria that could be used to distinguish any undesirable disturbance resulting from anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. This knowledge has been deployed in support of assessments under the relevant EC directives and for the OSPAR Convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/13">Information help by Defra on the funding for the JONUS programme (Joint Assessment of Nutrients Study) shows that between 1990 and 1995, for JONUS1, there were two main funding components with the Department of the Environment (DoE)/Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions (Detr) contributing approximately &pound;0.5 million a year and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) contributing about &pound;0.6 million a year. JONUS2 took place between 1996 and 1999. The broad levels of funding for each year were &pound;0.8 million, &pound;0.95 million and &pound;0.25 million respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/14">Information on UK loads of lindane, mercury, cadmium, lead, zinc, lindane and PCBs is held centrally only for the period 1990 to 2005 and is reported to the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the North East Atlantic. Defra does not hold information on loads of nickel and arsenic.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203W.2/15">Between 1990 and 2005, the estimated riverine and direct loads of cadmium, mercury, lead, zinc, lindane and PCB to the Irish sea (based on an average of the upper and lower values reported) reduced as shown in the following table. The figures include both naturally occurring sources of the metals and anthropogenic releases from point and diffuse sources.</p>

In some two-tier areas this is a statutory requirement. Local authorities can be exempt from this requirement where they have met their recycling targets and obligations under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS), or for achieving an excellent or four star rating in their Comprehensive Performance Assessment. The Government have published two guidance documents to assist local authorities, setting out what Government expect strategies to contain and providing advice on the production of a strategy. Both documents are available from the waste pages of the Defra website.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209W.7/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.7/2">The Learning and Skills Council has commissioned a review of the effect of the extension of education maintenance allowance to work-based learning programmes through the Association of Learning Providers. The objectives of the review were to liaise with learning providers and key partners in the regions to identify key issues, areas of good practice and how these can be expanded to national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.7/3">The review identified that although starts on the Entry to Employment (E2E) programme were down nationally at the beginning of the 2006-07 year in comparison to the same period in 2005-06, these have now recovered and recruitment is in line with 2006-07 projections,</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.7/4">A series of dissemination events took place to share good practice with the work-based learning provider network. The Learning and Skills Council will be undertaking an evaluation of the first year of extension of education maintenance allowance to young people in non-employed work-based learning and a full report is expected to be available in January 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1214W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase> the Government launched the Skills Pledge with commitments from 157 employers with more than 1.7 million employees. Since the launch, businesses have continued to register their interest in the Skills Pledge through the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) Train to Gain website and helpline. The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for the operational aspects of the Skills Pledge, including the size and location of every employer making a skills pledge. I have asked Mark Haysom to write to the hon. Member and a copy of his letter will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214W.2/2">Every employer that makes a skills pledge is given access to a skills broker who will work with them to ensure that they better understand the skills needs of their business and to help them source the highest quality provider to meet those needs. As part of our ongoing drive on quality the Government launched, in June, a new standard for employer responsiveness and vocational excellence in providers. The new standard will be an improvement tool for providers and will offer employers a single employer-verified badge to look for when sourcing workforce development provision. This will help employers to get best value for money from their investment in training by both reducing the time taken to source the highest quality provision and improving the quality of provision overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214W.2/3">The Government continue to develop new and innovative web based tools to support employers in all their business aspects. There is already a web based registration process for employers to register their details and the LSG are currently reviewing a range of diagnostic tools with a view to posting or referencing these on the Skills Pledge website. Skills Brokers, as part of their business analysis, will help employers find e-tools that will enable them to help themselves, including Investors in People interactive&mdash; a web based tool provided through our support for Investors in People which will be available from November 2007 and the Business Performance Diagnostic which is available through Business Link. In line with the Government's e-strategy we shall continue to develop further tools where employers tell us there is a real demand.</p>

The academies programme targets areas of inadequate educational attainment.

Academies will be established in areas where the need is greatest and we expect that this will produce a wide geographical distribution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218W.0/1">Together with any backlog maintenance, the asset management planning condition data supplied to the Department by local education authorities show future requirements over a five-year period. The backlog component is not specifically identified, but it is estimated that future requirements account for the majority of the costs shown in the data. All buildings suffer dilapidation and maintenance is regularly needed to counter this. It is not viable to eliminate future maintenance requirements, but the backlog is being tackled and the cost of urgent work has reduced by approximately 30 per cent. against the data received in 2001.</p>

The bulk of schools capital is allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including maintenance. While reducing maintenance requirements is a long-term aim, the primary objectives for funding are to raise educational standards and tackle local deprivation. A substantial proportion of capital funding is targeted at transformational programmes, such as Building Schools for the Future and the Primary Capital Programmes. Over time, these programmes will significantly reduce future maintenance requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.6/4" class="indent">Special analyses of deaths involving MRSA and <i> Clostridium difficile</i> are undertaken annually by ONS for England and Wales. These are published annually in Health Statistics Quarterly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.6/5" class="indent">The latest year for which such figures are available is 2005. These data were released in &quot;Health Statistics Quarterly 33&quot; which is available in the House of Commons library and on the National Statistics website.<sup>(1,2,3)</sup> These reports contain tables of the number of deaths where MRSA and <i> Clostridium difficile</i> were reported as the underlying cause of death or were mentioned anywhere on the death certificate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.6/6" class="indent">There are no routine statistics on deaths involving the gram negative bacterium acinetobacter. Doctors completing death certificates are asked to state the diseases, for example pneumonia, meningitis or septicaemia, which caused or contributed to death. They sometimes specify the micro-organism responsible for such infectious diseases, for example meningococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae etc, but are not required to do so. Indeed, they may not know the organism responsible when certifying the death, or there may be more than one. In addition, causes of death are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). As its name implies, this is a classification of diseases not micro-organisms.</p>

Its inclusion is dependent upon space available on the census questionnaire and the requirements from statistics users for competing questions. Consultation on the content of the 2011 Census has identified demand for about six pages worth of questions per person. However, cost constraints and the burden on respondents are likely to limit space to three pages of questions per person and so there are difficult choices to be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1227W.2/4" class="indent">The attached table gives the information requested. The figures in the table are estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), for the three month period ending in May of each year from 1992 to 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.2/5" class="indent">A household is defined as a single person, or a group of people living at the same address who have the address as their only main residence and either share one main meal a day or share the living accommodation (or both). A workless working-age couple household is one that is headed by a married/cohabiting couple and that includes at least one person of working age and in which no-one aged 16 or over is in employment. Couple households without dependent children may include non- dependent children, and/or members of other family units, whose economic status affects the combined economic status of the household (i.e. whether it is classified as workless or not).</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.2/6" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1228W.9/1">The consultation paper &quot;Confidence and confidentiality: Improving transparency and privacy in family courts&quot; was published in July 2006. 245 formal responses were received to the consultation, and over 200 children and young people contributed their views. There was a material difference of opinion in the responses: the media supported the Government's proposal to allow the media into family courts as of right, but children and young people and the groups who support and protect them disagreed. However, children and young people said that they trust the court to make the decision on whether the media should be allowed to attend on a case by case basis. An overview of responses is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1228W.9/3">The Government therefore have taken a new approach to openness in family courts. Instead of increasing access into such proceedings, they have decided to increase the amount of information coming out of the court. In certain cases, information will be given to the people involved, it will be retained for people who were involved in family proceedings as children to help them understand how decisions were made about them, and it will be made available in an anonymous format for public scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.9/4">A further public consultation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-20">20 June</phrase> which outlined this new approach, and also asked questions on changing the rules on disclosure of information and whether the identity of a child should be protected after the end of proceedings.

	<p pid="b.1240W.0/1">The following table presents key statistics on the progression of committal proceedings in the magistrates courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240W.0/2">No centrally-collated information is available on the reasons for, or the costs arising from, adjournments in committal proceedings. However, in the year ending March 2007, there were 3,057 magistrates courts trials that were ineffective because the prosecution was not ready (1.7 per cent. of all recorded trials in the period), and a further 4,218 ineffective because the defence was not ready (2.3 per cent. of recorded trials). Equivalent figures are not available for committal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240W.0/3">No information is available on the total number of committal hearings listed in the magistrates courts in England and Wales. However, the table shows that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1240W.0/4" class="indent">there were around 98,000 cases in the magistrates courts in 2005 which were disposed of through committal or sending to the Crown Court</p>
	<p pid="b.1240W.0/5" class="indent">there were an average of 2.6 listings per case in 2006 (covering the whole duration of these cases in the magistrates courts)</p>
	<p pid="b.1240W.0/6">On this basis, it can be estimated that cases committed or sent to the Crown Court account for an approximate total of 255,000 listings per year in the magistrates courts.</p>

			<tr pid="b.1240W.0/16"> <td colspan="8"><i> Notes:</i>  1. Data on the total number of cases is taken from the Home Office publication &quot;Criminal Statistics 2005&quot;. This is the most recent full year for which published data are available. All other date are taken from the Time Intervals Survey (TIS) in the magistrates courts. The TIS is a sample survey that produces estimates of the average time taken between stages of proceedings for defendants in completed criminal cases in magistrates' courts. More Information on TIS is available from the Ministry of Justice website.  2. All 'committals' statistics shown above include cases which were sent to the Crown Court for trial without committal proceedings, under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Ad 1998. The above figures relate to both adult and youth defendants, and include both summonsed and charged cases. This TIS data relates to indictable and triable either way cases only, and therefore excludes the small number of summary cases that are committed to the Crown Court However, these cases will be counted in the total number of cases per year.  3. &quot;First listing&quot; refers to the first listed hearing of the case in the magistrates courts Figures for adjournments relate to the whole duration of the case in the magistrates courts, and will therefore count adjournments to other hearings besides the committal hearing. Figures are not available on the number of adjournments by hearing type. The number of adjournments in any given case is defined as being one less than the number of times the case was listed. A listing refers to any occasion when the case was considered by the court. The average number of adjournments is the average across all cases, including those which were completed at first listing and where no adjournments occurred. The average length of adjournments is calculated by dividing the duration of a case (from first listing to completion) by the number of adjournments that occurred.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1245W.5/1">The Government have not made any estimation of election turnout rates among those eligible voters whose first language is not English. The Electoral Commission has the role of evaluating election turnout, and published its report 'Election 2005: Turnout. How many, who and why?' in October 2005, That report indicated, based on research polls, that the turnout rate of BME groups was 47 per cent. (lower than the overall turnout of 61 per cent.). However,, this figure does not include any consideration of English as a second language, and the Commission has not included any research into this issue within its report. Such research would undoubtedly prove difficult to undertake, since it would not be clear from any direct recorded source whether an eligible voter uses another language, other than English, as his first language.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.5/2">The Government, however, have taken steps to ensure that all eligible voters, including those with English as a second language, should have access to the electoral process. Sections 36 and 37 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 enable local electoral officers to provide certain documents and guidance to voters in alternative languages.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245W.5/3">Some authorities have taken advantage of these new powers to provide guidance in a number of languages. However, ballot papers are exempted from the documents that can be translated, as this would breach secrecy rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248W.3/2">Where other, more direct methods of enforcement have been tried but maintenance remains outstanding, we need adequate measures in place to encourage compliance from those who wilfully refuse or culpably neglect to pay child maintenance.

The 12 month rule works well, encouraging courts to record fair and consistent levels of child maintenance and ensuring that if circumstances change or agreements break down, parents have a quick route into the Child Support Agency and maintenance continues to flow to children.</p>

This should benefit 40,000 parents with care and 55,000 children. It is essential that children can benefit from maintenance that parents provide. The White Paper makes clear that, from 2010-11, the Government will significantly increase the amount of maintenance that all parents with care on benefit can keep before it affects the level of benefit they receive. This timescale enables further analysis to be undertaken on the potential impact of different levels of disregard on child poverty, compliance rates and work incentives.</p>

	<p pid="b.1252W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1252W.5/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252W.5/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps are being taken to ensure a greater proportion of non-compliant, non-resident parents face enforcement action. [PQ146719] and</p>

	<p pid="b.1252W.5/7" class="indent">The Agency is now in the second year of a three year Operational Improvement Plan. The first year of the Operational Improvement Plan focused on the organisational and operational restructuring of the Agency, and the training of our people to increase our capacity and capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252W.5/8" class="indent">Although we made no commitments in the first year of the Operational Improvement Plan, some early improvements are evident, and more money is already getting to more children. In the year to March 2007, the number of parents with care receiving maintenance saw an increase of 9% from 429,000 to 466,000, benefiting 635,000 children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252W.5/9" class="indent">The second year of the Operational Improvement Plan, focuses on resolving the remaining computer system difficulties, and improving rates of compliance and the collection of child maintenance. Improvements to the computer system will help to further boost productivity, aid debt and legal enforcement activities and contribute to an increase in levels of case compliance. Building on the increase of our people, including quadrupling those employed in enforcement work, there will be stronger focus on the collection of debt. We will continue to work with debt collection agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252W.5/10" class="indent">The Agency is also working to counter a culture of non-compliance among some non-resident parents. In March this year we launched the first phase of a sustained maintenance enforcement campaign, which highlighted the significantly increased enforcement action undertaken through the courts in the past year. The Agency has increased the use of liability orders, County Court Judgments and bailiff action, taking the total number of court actions to 34,000 in the year to January 2007 an increase of 36% from 25,000 in the previous year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1254W.2/1">Any shortfall between the housing benefit received and contractual rent at the time of national roll-out of the local housing allowance will depend on the trends in local rent levels, the accommodation choices made by tenants and the tenant's income. It is currently hard to predict each of these aspects up to the point of national roll-out of the local housing allowance. We will be monitoring shortfalls between the shared room rate and contractual rent as part of the two year review of the national roll-out of the local housing allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254W.2/2">The shared room rate under the national roll-out of the local housing allowance covers a broader definition of what can be counted as shared accommodation than the single room rent restriction. Additionally, as the shared room rate will be set at the median of local market rents, this ensures that 50 per cent. of the shared properties on the Rent Officers' database will be affordable at the shared room rate. Since the rates are published, tenants will also be aware of their maximum housing benefit entitlement in advance and be able to make an informed decision about what accommodation they can afford.</p>

	<p pid="b.1254W.5/1">The definition for broad rental market area (BRMA) is laid down in statute and it does not require rent officers to have any regard to rent levels. It relates primarily to access to facilities and services for health, education, recreation, personal banking and shopping. The BRMA must contain a mix of property types held on a variety of tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254W.5/2">When setting local housing allowance (LHA) rates rent officers must have regard to rents in the broad market rental area. Under the current pathfinder scheme the LHA is calculated by gathering evidence of rents for properties of the appropriate size and excluding those that are exceptionally high or low to determine a high rent and low rent. The high and low rents are then added together and divided by two to produce the LHA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254W.5/3">Under the Welfare Reform Act 2007, we are introducing a new way of calculating the LHA based on a median rent that does not require the rent officer to exclude any rents from the evidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255W.5/1">We are aware that people with severe or specific learning difficulties are one of the groups least likely to move off state benefits and into sustained work. We recognise that part-time work can be important to well-being, to developing self worth, and a stepping-stone to sustained work and a life independent of the benefit system. That is why we already have the permitted work rules in the current incapacity benefits system which enable a person on incapacity benefit to work up to 16 hours and earn up to &pound;86 per week, for an initial period of up to 52 weeks, to allow engagement with the labour market. For people on income support the earnings disregard is currently &pound;20 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255W.5/2">We are bringing these rules forward into the new employment and support allowance (ESA) However, within the new ESA we will be aligning the existing permitted work earnings limits. This means that anyone claiming ESA will be able to earn up to &pound;86 per week for up to 52 weeks without it affecting their benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255W.5/3">Linking rules are designed to give customers security when they leave benefit for work or training. If the job or training does not work out, they will receive the same cash level if they return to benefit within a specified period. We know that the security that linking rules provide is important to many people and we will continue to have linking rules in ESA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255W.5/4">We believe these rules are a valuable element of the current benefit system and, combined with the rules we have on unlimited voluntary work while on incapacity benefits, provide customers with a wide range of opportunities to try out work themselves. We will continue to look for other ways of helping people take up opportunities to work and increase their options without fear of their benefits being immediately affected.</p>

For example, those with parents lacking any qualifications. This was based on analysis using the Families and Children Study (FACS), which is representative of families with children in Britain. At the local council level, the number of families with five or more disadvantages in the FACS is very small, and it is therefore not possible to accurately estimate how many families are at risk in Blackpool, South or indeed in any other specific areas.</p>

At present, information available to the Government suggests that smart meters are not yet cost-effective. We expect this to change, and further activity in respect of smart metering is being undertaken by interested parties to improve understanding of the costs and benefits. In setting out their White Paper proposals on display devices, the Government indicated that they would consult on the implementation of these proposals in the context of its ambitions to see a roll-out of smart meters within 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261W.11/1">DFID is implementing a range of programmes to assist farmers who were once involved with cultivation of poppy. Our core approach is to improve access to credit, while improving the range and viability of alternative legal livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.11/2">Alternatives to poppy come not only in the form of different crops. They can often be non-farm activities such as clothes-making and shopkeeping, which is why DFID is supporting the Government of Afghanistan's Microfinance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA). This programme has provided over &pound;133 million worth of small loans to 364,786 Afghan families to help them invest in their own licit businesses. MISFA operates in 23 provinces, including Helmand. DFID has provided &pound;15 million to MISFA since March 2004. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.11/3">Overall, DFID has provided &pound;77 million from 2005-07 to support the development of legal rural livelihoods, much of which has been channelled through the Government of Afghanistan's own National Priority Programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.11/4">DFID has given &pound;18 million to the Government of Afghanistan's National Rural Access Programme (NRAP), which has built or repaired over 9,000 km of roads so far&mdash;essential for rural farmers to access markets. So far the programme has generated over 13 million days of labour for Afghans. NRAP operates in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.11/5">DFID has also provided &pound;42.6 million in total for the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and is providing &pound;10.6 million to roll out NSP in Helmand province (2006-09). NSP is helping elected Community Development Councils (CDCs), representing over 17,000 communities across Afghanistan, identify development priorities in their areas and then receive grants to undertake the work. NSP has funded over 28,000 projects in agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport, and water supply. NSP currently operates in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.11/6">Outside the Government of Afghanistan, DFID is funding two projects implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, which are supporting villages in Bamyan, Balkh and Herat to make a legal living. The activities they support include poultry and fish rearing, silk production, and carpet weaving. DFID has also provided &pound;3 million to support research into a range of legal livelihoods, including high value crops such as mint and saffron.</p>

All of these funds have been spent and accounted for. The ICRC has not requested further funding. In 2007 DFID is providing support to internally displaced people in Burma through a grant of &pound;400,000 to support community-based groups (mostly Christian and Buddhist networks) working inside Burma who are able to provide humanitarian assistance in the short term to IDPs who would otherwise receive no help. This complements the assistance to IDPs cross-border from Thailand which we also support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.0/1">225 members of staff in the Department for International Development (12 per cent. of the total number of staff employed by the Department) currently make additional voluntary pension contributions through deductions from their pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.0/2">DFID plans to issue annual benefit statements later in the year, the statements show the pension built up to date, and also a projection of pension on retirement if the member continues in service to scheme pension age. The benefit statement provides details of the Civil Service Pensions website where staff can obtain further information, including options for making additional voluntary contributions to boost their pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.0/3">In addition, DFID has a page dedicated to Civil Service Pensions on our intranet site, this contains information on the pension schemes and the aim is to increase awareness of pensions among our staff. As well as useful pension information, the page contains links to the Civil Service Pensions website and various information booklets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.3/1">In January 2007 almost all children in affected areas apart from the North East are attending school. Attendance in the North and East is now severely affected by the security situation. Almost all families previously in camps now have access to sturdier transitional shelter. Of the families whose homes were affected, 72 per cent. are now back in their own houses following reconstruction and repair work. Over 75 per cent. of people who lost their main source of income have regained some source of income.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.3/2">Permanent homes are under construction. Prior to the tsunami the public sector normally built only 5,000-6,000 new homes. Only with all public and private sector housing workers performing at full capacity would a 50,000 annual target be reached. According to Sri Lankan Government figures about 98 per cent. of the permanent housing requirement in the south has been fulfilled, although in the east of Sri Lanka there are still significant shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.3/3">The resurgence in the conflict has meant severe access restrictions for delivery partners in the North and East, which was the most affected region. Moving materials and skilled labour has become particularly problematic. Lack of humanitarian space has made it difficult to ensure that assistance is delivered equitably and in a timely manner to affected communities. UK officials will continue to work closely with the Sri Lankan authorities, NGOs and UN. We see progress towards peace and reconciliation as essential to enabling and sustaining post tsunami recovery and broader development in Sri Lanka. We hope that all parties will renew efforts to make progress in this direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.3/4">DFID has focussed its policy during the reconstruction phase on improving the capacity of partner governments to mobilise resources and undertake reconstruction efforts themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.3/5">In Sri Lanka we have provided &pound;2 million to improve the management of recovery and reconstruction, with a focus on building the capacity of the north and eastern councils in Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266W.0/2">Local councils have a vital role in the delivery of more social and affordable housing, working in partnership with developers and housing associations, using to the full their planning and other powers, and the use of their own land, to deliver the homes needed locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.0/3">We are encouraging innovative ideas from local authorities to increase the supply and improve the quality of social housing, including through more direct development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266W.0/4">We expect housing associations to continue to deliver the majority of new social homes, as they can bring in significant additional independent borrowing. But we also see the potential for local authorities to make a bigger contribution towards meeting the housing needs of current and future generations.</p>

It is for Fire and Rescue Authorities to decide whether these 'out of scope' tasks should continue to be performed under the new control arrangements, and how best to deliver them. The business case for the FiReControl project shows that the costs of delivering a control service under FiReControl should be substantially lower than at present. The business case takes into account the costs of continuing to deliver these 'out of scope' tasks.</p>

Local planning authorities should undertake a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment in line with PPS25 policy to identify the risks from all forms of flooding (including surface water run-off). Where there are particular surface water drainage problems they should use the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to inform the development of surface water management plans, as part of their Local Development Frameworks, to manage the risks through development opportunities and avoid inappropriate development in those areas. Some of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pilot studies on integrated urban drainage are examining the consequences of new development for surface water run-off and the options available for mitigating these effects.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.5/1">New planning policy (PPS25 Development and flood risk) published in December 2006 promotes the use of sustainable drainage systems and development of surface water management plans. Planning obligations (or 's106 planning agreements') are mechanisms to allow developers and local planning authorities to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. Where the need to improve drainage to reduce the risk of flooding is a material consideration, a planning obligation may be an appropriate mechanism to secure the agreement of the developer to undertake the necessary drainage improvements. The construction and maintenance costs of surface water drainage systems serving a development should be fully funded by the developer, and a planning obligation may be appropriate to secure this.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279W.5/1">Our planning policies on waste management are set out in Planning Policy Statement 10 (PPS10). These state that planning authorities should ensure new development makes sufficient provision for waste management and promote designs and layouts that secure integration of waste management facilities without adverse impact on the street scene or, in less developed areas, the local landscape. The standard application form for planning applications, which comes into use across England in October, will require developers to set out the arrangements made for the separate storage and collection of recyclable waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279W.5/2">PPS10 also highlights that good design and layout in new development can help secure opportunities for sustainable waste management, including matters relating to kerbside collection and community recycling. The Manual for Streets, a joint publication by the Department for Transport and Communities and Local Government, provides practical advice for designers.</p>

This draws out the lessons learnt from examining over 100 development plan documents, the majority of which have been core strategies. The Planning Inspectorate's document incorporates a note provided by Communities and Local Government on the waste content of core strategies. The note sits within the policy framework provided by extant planning policy statements (in particular, PPS10 Planning for Sustainable Waste Management and PPS12 Local Development Frameworks) and their supporting practice guidance. Government offices and inspectors who will undertake the examination of development plan documents have had the guidance document drawn to their attention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1295W.2/1">The EU's sanctions, as set out in the EU common position on Burma, are an expression of the EU's disapproval of the Burmese regime and its policies and are intended to apply pressure for change. The common position includes a visa ban and assets freeze aimed at the Burmese leaders, their families and associates who formulate, implement or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295W.2/2">The common position has two strengths: firstly, it delivers a message to the regime that the EU condemns the regime's actions towards the Burmese people; secondly, it is a unified position supported by all members of the EU and thus delivers a common and united EU message to the regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295W.2/3">We are disappointed that the Burmese Government has so far failed to respond to the pressure and encouragement of the international community to embrace substantive democratic change and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295W.2/4">While we do not believe that sanctions used in isolation will bring about political change in Burma, we take the view that targeted measures aimed at senior members of the regime and their associates, applied in combination with the engagement of the UN and our international partners in the region, provide a clear incentive for substantial political change.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.5/2">The Quartet's efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the Arab/Israeli conflict are vital not only for the region but for the wider international community. The middle east peace process is one of our top priorities. We will continue to support the Quartet and their new representative in their work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1302W.2/1">The Department takes the issues of maintaining the three year interval for breast screening and the demographic challenges facing the breast screening programme over the coming years very seriously. This is why Professor Mike Richards, National Cancer Director, wrote to the chief executives of all 10 strategic health authorities (SHAs) in England on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-09">9 February 2007</phrase> on behalf of the Department's Cancer Programme Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/2">The letter to the chief executive of South Central SHA (the SHA area covering Portsmouth), pointed out the demographic challenges facing local breast screening services to help local commissioners plan their service over the coming years. By 2008-09, South Central SHA will have to carry out 185,350 screenings per year (an additional 74 per cent. of its 2004-05 level, inclusive of women in the extended age range of 65-70) in order to achieve and/or maintain the three year screening interval. By 2015-16, 207,250 screenings per year will be needed, a 95 per cent. increase on 2004-05 activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/3">The letter also highlighted the importance of maintaining a three-year screening interval. Between January and March 2007, 99.1 per cent. of women served by the Portsmouth Breast Screening Unit were screened within 38 months of their previous screen. 51 per cent. of women had been screened within three years of their previous screen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.2/4">The Portsmouth Unit are working hard to ensure that all women are screened within three years of their previous screen.</p>

PCTs set contract values and service level requirements locally. Each contract specifies an annual contract value and the number of units of dental activity (which are a weighted measure of the courses of treatment given to national health service patients) to be provided over the courses of the year. This relationship between contract values and annual units of dental activity will vary because of a number of factors, including differences in treatment patterns and treatment needs in different areas, the contract values negotiated locally by PCTs and dental practices, and the degree to which PCTs and practices may have agreed service outputs that cannot be measured through patient courses of treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308W.0/10">Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former General Dental Service (GDS) arrangements. These were demand led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health services work they chose to undertake. PCTs were not given fixed GDS funding allocations. In a number of areas, Personal Dental Service (PDS) pilots were also established, where some former GDS dental practices and some directly managed dental services converted to locally commissioned arrangements to test new ways of working and new forms of contract remuneration. PDS pilots were introduced in 1998 and were funded by PCTs from supplementary allocations issued by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.0/11">The following table shows the available data on expenditure on the former GDS and PDS services for Stockport PCT for 1997-98 to 2005-06. The difference between gross and net expenditure is the contribution to costs from dental charges collected directly from patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.0/12">Note that reliable data on PDS expenditure are available only for the financial years 2004-05 and 2005-06. Therefore, the figures shown for gross GDS and PDS and net GDS and PDS before 2004-05 may be lower than the true total GDS and PDS spend. Changes from year to year may be affected by the shift from GDS to PDS in 2004-05.</p>

However, for those who have successfully completed the Modernising Medical Careers foundation training programme and who demonstrate their ability to progress, there will be new training programmes through one-year fixed term appointments. There will also be a range of educational grants available to enable doctors either to get an additional year's experience in their chosen specialty or to choose to gain experience in a different specialty, thus giving them all a better chance to apply and secure a training programme next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.0/2">Guidance on the management of patients with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections was drawn up by a joint working party of the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the Hospital Infection Society and the Infection Control Nurses Association. It was published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March 2006<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/3">The guidance makes clear that patient isolation for those infected or colonised with MRSA will be dependent on the facilities available and the associated level of risk. Isolation should be in a designated closed area that should be clearly defined; in most facilities, this will be either single-room accommodation or cohort areas/bays with clinical hand-washing facilities. The guidance also states that consideration should be given to the provision of isolation wards to contain MRSA spread.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/4">In addition to the guidance referred to above, the Health Act 2006, Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of Health Care Associated Infections, requires trusts to have policies on allocation of patients to isolation facilities based on local risk assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319W.11/1">Recorded acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug-related crime makes a significant contribution&mdash;has fallen by 20 per cent. since the onset of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) and DIP is now getting, on average, over 3x500 drug misusing offenders into drug treatment each month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.11/2">Completion rates for Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) and Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs) have risen significantly from 28 per cent. in 2003 to 44 per cent. in 2006-07. We know that offenders who complete these orders have significantly lower reconviction rates (53 per cent.) than those who do not (91 per cent.). Research findings also show a reduction of up to 10 per cent. in re-offending rates of those engaging in prison treatment, providing there is relevant aftercare provision.</p>

	<p pid="b.1328W.5/17" class="indent">Royal Canadian mounted police currently located in Ottawa. Joint plans are being made for training to be extended to manage the winter Olympics 2010, G8 Conference, Papal visit and other major events in the next few years with both agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/18" class="indent">Paramata, New South Wales, Australia. This was initially built and used to train police commanders and other agencies to prepare their officers to manage the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney. It is currently being used for leadership programmes, domestic and terrorist related hostage negotiation and counter terrorism preparedness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/19">The methodology has been grown over the last 20 years and has built on research findings through debriefing of such incidents as community confidence following the murder of Stephen Lawrence, outcomes from the foot and mouth epidemic, the international response to the tsunami, multi agency management of counter terrorism related to 9/11, the London bombings, Sharm el Sheikh and Bali bombings as well as the Olympic games in Sydney 2000, the Commonwealth games in Manchester and the G8 summit in Canada.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/20">The Association of Chief Police Officers Terrorism and Applied Matters Committee (ACPO TAM) has commissioned a number of reports on the effectiveness of Hydra, for example a report entitled a Review of Counter Terrorism Exercises in the UK has 13 references to hydra as examples of good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/21">An HMIC report into the UK state of readiness for counter terrorism states Hydra and its associated 10kv debriefing as the way forward for capacity building. There are various HMIC thematic inspections around critical incident management throughout the country that refer to the effectiveness of those forces who are using Hydra.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/22">The Hydra methodology prohibits the use of hydra to directly assess the performance of delegates; this allows the statement &quot;Safe Learning environment&quot; to have real integrity. However there are triangulated methods for assessments that are built into the programs that surround Hydra events that enable individual assessments to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/23">The National Policing Improvement Agency is planning a new suite at Harperley Hall, Durham; HMRC are building a Hydra suite and have appointed a suite manager; Ministry of Defence police are planning a suite at Wethersfield, Essex.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328W.5/24">With the regional spread of Hydra suites there is not a direct need for small forces to create their own establishments and with the NPIA plans for Harperley Hall in Durham, consideration should now be given to plugging any holes in the regional map.</p>

	<p pid="b.1331W.5/10">Other changes to the annual statistics publication will be considered later taking account of the recommendations of the Davidson Review of the transposition of European legislation in the United Kingdom and relevant issues raised by the proposed revision of European Directive 86/609/EEC, which the 1986 Act transposes into United Kingdom legislation. Some further information relevant to the cost benefit assessment will also be published when a current judicial review, the outcome of which may be relevant, has been completed.</p>

This is a pooled budget which consolidates a growing number of specific grants contributions from the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government, and forms a funding block to support the delivery of Local Area Agreements (LAAs). As a round three LAA, Newcastle city council and its partners are able to use this grant flexibly to deliver a wide range of outcomes, including reductions in crime, antisocial behaviour and the harms caused by drugs. The 2007-08 figures are not directly comparable with previous years because the pooled budget now includes a larger number of funding streams.</p>

	<p pid="b.1343W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-04">4 July 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.2/2">Data for the number of fatalities caused by knives and sharp instruments is not available at borough level. The following table gives figures for the Metropolitan and City of London police force areas. Figures for the number of serious injuries caused by knife attacks are not currently available. However, new data collection arrangements from April 2007 will provide more detailed statistics on knife related violence. The British Crime Survey reports that knife crime as a proportion of all violent crime is broadly stable at 6-7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.2/3">There is, of course, grave concern at the recent tragic incidents involving young people and knife crime. Work on tackling knife crime is being taken forward through the Home Secretary's round table on guns, knives and gangs, which has developed an action plan focussing on the themes of policing, powers and prevention. Legislation has recently been tightened in relation to knives, with the doubling of the maximum sentence for possession of a bladed instrument in a public place without good reason from two to four years. In April, a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon (including a knife) was introduced; and in May school staff were given powers to search pupils for knives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-26">26 June</phrase>, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers, we published guidance on tackling knife enabled crime, to provide police officers with a menu of options which they might use in their area. We also support police work to tackle knife crime such as Operation Blunt, run by the Metropolitan police, and Operation Shield, run by the British Transport Police, which uses search arches and other technology to search people travelling on the transport network with weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.2/5">We recognise that policing and legislation are only part of the picture, however, and are also supporting educational projects such as the Be Safe programme, which helps young people understand the risks and consequences of carrying knives, and the Damilola Taylor Trust's &quot;Respect Your Life, Not a Knife&quot; campaign, which is encouraging young people to pledge not to carry weapons. We are also supporting local community organisations working to tackle knife crime through our Connected Fund. The sixth round of the fund was recently completed, and funding is now being provided to more than 100 projects in England and Wales to support local work.</p>

To that end, we frequently discuss our perception of the current threats and our activity to counteract those threats with our Russian colleagues in international fora such as the United Nations and the G8, among others. The terrorist threat and strategies to counter the threat were key issues of discussion at the G8 JHA ministerial meeting in Munich in May, when the then Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith and I represented the UK. My right hon.

	<p pid="b.1350W.2/1">The United Kingdom entered an immigration reservation when it ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1986, in order to ensure that the Convention would not impede immigration policies and procedures in operation at the time. However, preparatory work for the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 subsequently ensured that all policies and practices operated by the then immigration and nationality directorate were non-discriminatory on the grounds of sex. An Interdepartmental Review of International Human Rights Instruments was carried out in 2004 and concluded that the reservation for immigration purposes was no longer appropriate and, therefore, the United Kingdom should withdraw its immigration reservation on this Convention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1350W.5/1">The UK supports the work that the United Nations is doing in improving standards of care for children in countries where care arrangements are non-existent or poor. In the UK our domestic laws honour the spirit of the Convention in relation to the standards of care and treatment available to children, including asylum-seeking children. The Government believe the reservation remains justified in order to maintain an effective immigration control. The Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges its signatories to put the 'best interests' of the child first in making decisions and there are a number of instances where this may prevent lawful immigration functions being carried out. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women obliges signatories to treat men and women equally which creates less of a concern for carrying out immigration functions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/2">We provide protection to children subject to immigration control via the Children Act and other domestic legislation that requires the authorities to fulfil duties in relation to children; and also through the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/3">In addition we are proposing to introduce a code of practice to ensure that in carrying out its functions in the UK the Border and Immigration Agency takes appropriate steps to keep children safe from harm while they are in the UK.</p>

The staff operating the switchboard during this period have been reminded of the importance of communication between detainees, their families and legal advisors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.2/3">The switchboard at Yarl's Wood is somewhat dated and Serco, the contractor responsible for operating the centre, is looking at various options to help speed up the time taken to answer incoming calls.</p>
