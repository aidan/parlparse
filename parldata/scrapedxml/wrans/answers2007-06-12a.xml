	<p pid="a.901W.6/1">The single substantive change to the delivery of the free early education entitlement, set out in the 2006 code of practice, was the extension of the minimum free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks. Following full public consultation, we made clear our recognition that not all providers would be able to extend their provision to 38 weeks and that, at each local authority's discretion, they could be funded for the provision they actually delivered. Furthermore, all local authorities received additional funding to support the extension to the free entitlement. We therefore concluded that there should not be a substantive regulatory impact and that a regulatory impact assessment was not required. We have no plans therefore for an independent impact assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.907W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/2">I should state at the outset that the Secretary of State has no powers to impede a company moving into administration as this process is commenced by way of a court order or as a result of a qualifying floating charge holder, company or its directors filing a Notice of Appointment at court.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/3">Administrators, as licensed insolvency practitioners, are regulated professionals and are obliged by law to perform their functions in the interests of the company's creditors as a whole. Accordingly, where there is a sale of assets to a connected party of the company in administration, the administrators will need to have satisfied themselves that they are not only achieving the best possible price in the circumstances but that it is an arm's length transaction. Such a sale is sometimes the best option for delivering value for creditors. The Secretary of State has no power to stop a sale and even if he did, such a power could harm the interests of creditors of the company, many of whom have already lost considerable sums as a result of the failure. It is only a creditor or member of a company in administration that can apply to the court if they consider the administrator is acting, has acted, or proposes to act so as unfairly to harm the interests of the applicant (whether alone or in common with some or all members or creditors).</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/4">I believe it is important to emphasise that in the specific case mentioned, the administrators agreed to the sale of assets on the condition that it would be approved by the body of creditors as part of a proposal to put the company into a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) and that this arrangement was approved on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase> by more than 75 per cent. of creditors in value.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/5">This Government want to promote an effective framework for corporate activity, to give confidence to investors, business and other stakeholders. Within that framework it is essential that we have an insolvency regime, which, while encouraging enterprise and reducing the stigma associated with failure, deals fairly and effectively with financial failure and at the same time deters fraud and misconduct. I can assure you that we are fully committed to tackling abuse and misconduct and that we have in place, and in use, mechanisms to deal with that abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/6">You may be interested to know under the Insolvency Act 1986 (before it was amended) the only option to floating charge holders would have been to have put the company into administrative receivership. Under this procedure the administrative receiver's main duty was to the appointing floating charge holder. Under the provisions of the Enterprise Act this was amended to give the option of administration so that now the interests of the creditors as a whole are taken into account. The Insolvency Service is undertaking an evaluation to assess to what extent the provisions introduced by the Enterprise Act meet the policy objectives. The final evaluation reports will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.2/7">I am therefore content that the existing regulatory framework is sufficiently robust to prevent abuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.2/1">The Bridlington Integrated Transport Scheme, which includes a park and ride element, was given an initial approval (Programme Entry) by this Department in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.2/2">The decision to fund the scheme was based on the Department's assessment of East Riding of Yorkshire Council's business case. This assessment looks, in particular, at the strategic case, value for money, deliverability, and financial and commercial aspects. The value for money assessment takes into account economy, safety, integration, environment and accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.2/3">All new major local authority schemes, for which project specific funding is sought, are assessed according to these criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.911W.3/18">The Government also support local transport authorities through the general revenue support and councils do spend some of this support on highways and transport services according to their own priorities. In addition, the Government are providing record levels of funding for railways infrastructure through the passenger franchises and by direct grant to Network Rail. This funding is not classified by local authority area, but all local authorities have benefited from work by Network Rail to address the rail infrastructure renewals backlog. Additional support for public transport over this period has seen East Sussex being awarded a total of &pound;3,671,920 for eight bus project schemes which include both rural and urban bus challenge schemes and for 2007-08 they received &pound;953,263 in rural bus subsidy grant. In addition East Sussex receives Bus Service Operator Grant (BSOG) and funding for concessionary fares (through the revenue support grant).</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.2/1">The Environment Agency (EA) incorrectly sent a letter about Floodline Warnings Direct to 50 households at moderate flood risk. This represents 0.1 per cent. of the recent Floodline Warnings Direct recruitment mailings that the EA has sent to households across England. The EA have confirmed this as an error isolated to Congresbury, North Somerset and has contacted the 50 householders concerned to apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/2">The EA takes into consideration the source, the risk and the impact of flooding on a community when evaluating where it provides a flood warning service and the method by which flood warnings are communicated to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/3">The EA offers Floodline Warnings Direct to those households and businesses with a high risk of flooding. We define high risk as flooding at, or greater than, the 1 in 100 year return period (1 per cent. probability of occurring in any year) for flooding from rivers and the 1 in 200 year return period (0.5 per cent. probability) for flooding from the sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/4">However, in some locations the EA has offered the Floodline Warnings Direct service to households and businesses up to the Extreme Flood Outline which represents the 1 in 1,000 year flood (0.1 per cent. probability) due to the predicted impacts of flooding on the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/5">The EA does not offer the flood warning service to properties outside the Extreme Flood Outline. Therefore, the EA has not excluded any households or businesses in error from Floodline Warnings Direct which are above the threshold level of risk from flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/6">In March 2007, the EA mailed 9,166 of the 195,000 properties registered with Floodline Warnings Direct in England who no longer require warnings as they are not within the Extreme Flood Outline. The EA has not included these 9,166 properties in Floodline Warnings Direct in error as since the properties were included their level of flood risk has been updated with more accurate information.</p>

	<p pid="a.917W.2/2">The market transformation programme (MTP) estimates that the number of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) patio heaters is around 630,000 in the domestic sector and between 3,000 and 12,500 in the hospitality sector (pubs, restaurants and hotels). This does not include electric outdoor heating appliances, however, which appear to be gaining market share.</p>

No information on other greenhouse gas emissions from outdoor patio heaters is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.917W.2/4">The MTP estimates are not derived from surveys or detailed research, and should not be interpreted as accurate data on energy consumption and carbon emissions. Information about emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is not available for future years.</p>

We intend to carry out more research into the feasibility of using data held across Government Departments in order to build up profiles of people likely to be entitled.

	<p pid="a.931W.3/1">The winter fuel payment is a significant contribution to winter fuel bills which account for around 60 per cent. of the year's total fuel bill. It has risen from &pound;20 to &pound;200 from winter 2000-01 and to 300 for people aged 80 or over from winter 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="a.931W.3/2">Fuel prices are volatile, and can fall as well as rise. Although fuel prices have risen since 2003 this follows a period of no change between 1997 and 2003, and following recent falls in wholesale gas prices, companies are now starting to announce reductions in retail prices. It would not be sensible for the rate of winter fuel payments to track the upward and downward movement of fuel prices.</p>

The process for the RAF is undertaken by RAF manpower planners who compare the forecast requirement for fast jet pilots against the forecast strength. Any anticipated gap is then adjusted by modifying the forecast number of fast jet pilots required to graduate from the operational conversion unit as necessary. The RN process is very similar. The process helps to predict manning trends such as premature voluntary release, medical discharge, promotion and normal retirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.934W.5/2">For the financial year 2007-08, the operational allowance for Iraq and Afghanistan will increase by 3.6 per cent. and this will be backdated to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The allowance is based on the tax and national insurance paid by a private soldier, lower band pay range, level 5, on his/her income and longer separation allowance, while deployed on operations. Therefore, backdated to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, the daily rate of operational allowance will increase from &pound;12.31 to &pound;12.75. Consequently during a six month tour of duty it will increase from &pound;2,240 to &pound;2,320. However, due to the improved security situation in the Balkans, personnel serving in this area will no longer qualify for the operational allowance from <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.935W.2/1">No specific estimate has been produced regarding the cost of backdating armed forces preserved pensions before 1975. However, in view of the fact that this issue is common to other public service schemes not just the armed forces, the cost, whether to the armed forces or more widely, would be considerable and could run into billions of pounds.</p>

The Labour Force Survey (LFS) asks about the adults living in a household, and they count an adult as being single if they do not declare another adult in the household as being their partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.940W.9/3">ONS estimates that there are 1.9 million lone parents in the UK, based on the 2006 Labour Force Survey data. The HMRC 2005-06 Finalised Award data show that on average 2.1 million families claimed child tax credit, or the equivalent via benefits, as a single adult.</p>

However, these general rules are supplemented by the co-ordinating rules in EC Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72, which the United Kingdom has applied since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973.

The Programme's implementation plan is constantly reviewed and updated by Land Registry to ensure that each new service and product is fully tested and that customer feedback is taken on board. This has led to some slippage in the overall programme with a consequent reduction in the running costs contained in the original costing.</p>

	<p pid="a.952W.5/1">The most robust evaluation of the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP) in England and Wales (Home Office, 2003) examined the impact of the prison-based programme. This compared two-year reconviction rates for prisoners who participated in the programme with those who did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.5/2">Findings indicated that the SOTP had an impact on reconvictions for sexual and/or violent offences (as a combined measure). An explanation for this effect could be that a proportion of violent reconvictions were sexually motivated offences. Sexual reconvictions were combined with those for violent offences because sexual offenders (in the absence of intervention) are reconvicted for sexual offences at a very low rate&mdash;less than 5 per cent. over two years. Any decrease in this rate as a result of treatment is therefore unlikely to be statistically significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.5/3">For combined sexual and violent reconviction, the treatment group showed a statistically significantly lower rate of reconviction overall than the comparison group (4.6 per cent. and 8.1 per cent. respectively, see Table 4 in Home Office Research Findings No. 205). Treatment participants in the medium-low and medium-high risk groups showed a statistically significantly lower rate of reconviction than respective risk groups in the comparison sample (see Table 4 in HORF 205).</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.5/4">For general and sexual reconviction rates, the treatment group showed lower rates of reconviction than the comparison group although differences were not statistically significant (see Tables 5 and 3 respectively in HORF 205). No statistically significant differences were found among risk groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.5/5">These findings relate to offenders who completed the SOTP between 1992 and 1994. A programme of research is planned to examine the impact of the prison-based SOTP delivered to offenders post-1994 in terms of both short-term change in relation to treatment targets (e.g. victim empathy) and longer-term change in terms of future re-offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.953W.5/1">We do not collect data on the number of prisoners released after the quashing of their convictions by the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/2">The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) an executive NDPB which was set up under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 and which became operational in January 1997 aims to review alleged and suspected miscarriages of justice, and to refer them to the Court of Appeal, whenever they consider that there is a real possibility that a conviction, verdict, finding or sentence would not be upheld.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/3">Support and after care is offered to victims of miscarriages of justice from the Miscarriages of Justice Support Service, operated by the Citizens Advice Bureau at the Royal Courts of Justice, by the Ministry of Justice. It is funded under a three year contract. It aims to ensure that victims of miscarriages of justice receive appropriate advice, guidance and support. Advice and support is offered at every stage of the process. This includes: finding accommodation; establishing income; applying for national insurance credits; registering with a GP and accessing appropriate healthcare and counselling; opening a bank account and budgeting; family/relationship issues; employment and training needs; finding a solicitor to deal with compensation claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/4">All clients of the Miscarriages of Justice Support Service are offered counselling as part of their initial assessment interview with an adviser. In the past 12 months, 25 new cases have been taken on by the service, and seven clients have received an assessment by a consultant forensic psychiatrist. Following assessment, the psychiatrist refers the client for appropriate ongoing counselling. Families are not part of this assessment, but the psychiatrist may recommend that they are involved in family therapy if appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.958W.6/1">Council of Europe Convention ETS 123 makes provision for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. The UK Government have signed and ratified the Convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.958W.6/2">In implementing the Convention, parties are required to have regard to the guidelines for the accommodation and care of protected animals set out in Appendix A to the Convention. A revised Appendix A, to which the UK Government made a significant contribution, was adopted in June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.958W.6/3">The Home Office has actively advised those seeking to commission, refurbish, operate and equip animal facilities to have regard to the revised Appendix A guidelines in their planning, policies and practices both as the new provisions emerged during the revision process and following their formal adoption. In addition, we have widely circulated a note for users, prepared by the Animal Procedures Committee, explaining the key features of the revised Appendix. Work has also begun on amending the current Home Office Codes of Practice to take account of its revised provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.958W.6/4">As a result of the actions we have taken so far, we are already seeing the revised guidelines reflected in United Kingdom practice. However, it is not possible to estimate by what precise date all animal research and breeding establishments will be fully compliant. Further information on the relevant transitional arrangements and timescales will be set out in the revised Codes of Practice which we aim to publish in 2008 after the requirements for consultation and Parliamentary scrutiny, set out in sections 21(3) and 21(5), respectively, of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, have been met.</p>

	<p pid="a.971W.5/1">Difficulties with drivers avoiding prosecution do not come primarily from their being untraceable to an address. In 97.5 per cent. of cases, it is possible to trace a vehicle from the database maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The DVLA has firm measures in place to guard against the inclusion of false details. Of those it is not possible to trace, not all will be deliberately seeking to avoid detection.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.5/2">Any problem is rather with the difficulty of identifying the person driving a vehicle at the time of an alleged offence. The Road Safety Act 2006 increases the penalty for a vehicle keeper's failure to identify the driver to six penalty points.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.5/3">The key to tackling offending driver behaviour is effective police enforcement, including targeting suspect vehicles, individuals and sites and the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition Technology to detect vehicles of interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.5/4">The police can then take immediate action using the existing powers we have given them. These include the power to seize vehicles being driven antisocially, or without appropriate licence or insurance and the powers to arrest for any offence if necessary to confirm name and address or to prevent hindrance of a prosecution by the disappearance of the suspected offender.</p>

	<p pid="a.972W.0/1">My reply of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase> referred to the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) Main Grant allocations for 2007-08. As the DIP has evolved, there have been changes to the funding mechanisms each year. These changes have reflected some short-term funding streams and also some integration of separate funding streams to make administration easier at local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.0/2">Similarly, unlike the constituency of the hon. member, not all the areas named in my reply have been part of the programme since 2003. It is accordingly not possible, except at disproportionate cost, to provide DIP budget allocations for each intensive area for <i> (a)</i> 2003-04, <i> (b)</i> 2004-05 and <i> (c)</i> 2005-06 comparable to that in my reply of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.0/3">But allocations to areas such as the constituency of the hon. member have been based on the same criteria and I shall be writing to her with a more detailed explanation of the processes and to see if my officials are able to assist her with the purpose of her inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.973W.0/1">Reflex, the multi-agency government taskforce on organised immigration crime was set up in March 2000 and has been successful at disrupting organised immigration crime gangs leading to a large number of arrests and seizure of criminal assets. The co-ordination of enforcement work on human trafficking has now moved on with the establishment of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the UK Human Trafficking Centre in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.0/2">Reflex under SOCA continues to result in the disruption of organised crime gangs involved in trafficking women for sexual exploitation and has a number of multi-agency programmes of activity in this area. These programmes build on the strategies developed under Reflex. Organised Immigration Crime is SOCA's second priority after drug trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="a.973W.0/4">The Government's strategy to prevent human trafficking has a number of different elements. These include research and intelligence gathering to improve our knowledge and understanding of the scale and nature of human trafficking in the UK; awareness raising and capacity building in source and transit countries; and measures designed to address the demand for trafficked persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.973W.0/5">The Government are also working with source countries to tackle the problem of trafficking at its root. We have provided funds for various anti-trafficking projects in the Western Balkans region, West Africa (including Benin, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Niger and Togo) and in the Greater Mekong region (parts of Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam).</p>

	<p pid="a.973W.3/1">The majority of our knowledge regarding the extent of human trafficking in the UK relates to trafficking for sexual exploitation. It remains difficult to make an accurate assessment of the extent of the problem although intelligence suggests there has been an increase in the trafficking problem over the last two or three years. The findings from a Home Office research paper suggests that at any one time in 2003 there were in the region of 4,000 victims of trafficking for prostitution in the UK. In 2006, a police led multi agency operation on trafficking for sexual exploitation led to the identification of 87 victims from 22 different countries, predominantly from Eastern Europe, China/South-East Asia, Africa or Brazil.</p>

In 2005, 23 employers were proceeded against under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (employing a person aged 16 or above subject to immigration control and who is not entitled to work in the UK or to undertake the employment in question) in the magistrates courts. No persons were tried for the same offence at the Crown court in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.0/3">We recognise that the number of prosecutions under section 8 is low, and that that is why we have committed to bring forward the introduction of measures contained in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 to tackle illegal migrant working, which will provide the Border and Immigration Agency with a range of tools with which to tackle non-compliance. The 2006 Act introduces a system of civil penalties for employers who through negligence employ illegal migrant workers, alongside a tough new offence for those knowingly employing illegal workers, which will carry a maximum two year prison sentence and/or an unlimited fine. These new measures will come into force in late 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.2/2">Violence in Iraq continues at appallingly high levels, affecting all Iraqis. We continue to do what we can to try to help those Iraqis who face a particular threat as a result of having worked for us. Any applications for assistance we receive from current or former staff are considered on a case-by-case basis, taking account of the particular circumstances of the individuals concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.2/3">Ultimately, only a reduction in the overall level of violence in Iraq will address this problem at source. This is what we are working hard with the Government of Iraq, our coalition allies and others to try to bring about.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.0/1">In the Government's &quot;Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy&quot;, published in 2004, binge drinkers were a key target audience for new messages to be targeted by Government in their communications.

	<p pid="a.988W.0/2">As a result, the Department launched &quot;Know Your Limits&quot;, the Government's first national campaign regarding alcohol. It focuses on young people who binge drink because research shows that 18 to 24-year-olds are most likely to drink irresponsibly and cause harm to themselves and others. Evaluation of the campaign demonstrated that it has been highly effective in raising awareness and has had a high level of recall among young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.0/4">To help deliver this commitment, the Government are committed to continuing its investment in the &quot;Know Your Limits&quot; campaign and will run activity before peak drinking times, such as Christmas and new year. We will also seek ways to broaden and widen the audience reach.</p>

	<p pid="a.991W.2/1">The Department has not made any assessment. It is for councils to decide on how to set charges for non-residential social services. The legal basis is that charges generally should be reasonable, and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/2">Until the guidance on home care charges, &quot;Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other non-residential Social Services&quot;, was implemented, councils with social services responsibilities operated under few constraints or guidelines on how to charge for home care and practice varied widely. &quot;Fairer Charging Policies&quot; is statutory guidance, issued under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970; councils must have regard to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/3">The guidance, which was issued in 2001 and amended in 2003 to reflect the introduction of pension credits, does not seek to change councils' power to charge, or not, for services. It seeks to ensure that, where councils do charge, this will be based on fairer, well designed charging policies. In particular, it aims to ensure that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of disability costs, to ensure their reasonableness.</p>
	<p pid="a.991W.2/4">Local authorities have discretion as to whether they charge people receiving benefits for domiciliary care or not. However, if they do decide to do so, the guidance states very clearly that service users should not have their incomes reduced below basic levels of income support or the guarantee credit of pension credit, plus a buffer of 25 per cent., as a result of charges.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.5/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published its updated Device Bulletin on the management of medical devices in November 2006. The MHRA does not have powers to enforce its advice, which is for guidance only; the Healthcare Commission does not have powers to enforce MHRA advice either. It is the responsibility of each NHS organisation to ensure that appropriate governance systems are in place to ensure that medical devices are managed and used correctly.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/2">The Healthcare Commission assesses the performance of the NHS against the standards set out in Standards for Better Health (Department of Health 2004). In carrying out its assessments, the Commission looks specifically at, among other aspects of safety, the management of risks associated with the acquisition, use, and proper decontamination of medical devices in accordance with guidance issued by the MHRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/3">If an organisation is found not to be complying with a core standard, it is the responsibility of the relevant strategic health authority (SHA) in the first instance to support it to achieve the necessary improvement. In exceptional individual cases where an organisation's failure to comply with a compulsory core standard is of significant and sufficient concern, and where the Department and the SHA agree that departmental engagement can add value, the Department would work with the SHA to ensure that improvement was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.5/4">The Healthcare Commission reports to the Secretary of State. The Commission publishes its assessment of NHS performance in its annual health check; performance ratings for 2005-06 were published in October 2006 and are publicly available on the Commission's website at <a href="http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk">www.healthcarecommission.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.997W.2/1">In collaboration with the European Commission and other European health administrations we are exploring ways in which citizens could, if they so choose, make key health data available when seeking treatment in other European states, subject to stringent confidentiality safeguards. This work is at a very early stage and complex technical and information governance issues have yet to be resolved. In particular, any transfer of patient information would need to be in line with the undertakings given in the NHS Care Record Guarantee, and subject to compliance with the European Union Data Protection Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/2">The consultation acknowledges work that is already under way in some member states in developing interoperability standards for electronic medical records. The Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency is in fact the global leader in healthcare interoperability. NHS Connecting for Health have developed the message implementation manual which uses the international standard HL7V3 to define a standards-based approach to clinical message interchange. These messages are used by the systems which have been through the NHS Connecting for Health national integration centre, to create the largest range of heterogeneous interoperable systems in healthcare globally, with in excess of a hundred certified systems. This interoperability framework is underpinned by a robust and resilient messaging infrastructure, known as the spine, which already supports the transfer of many millions of messages every week across the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.2/3">Another key aspect of healthcare system interoperability is the consistent use of a clinical terminology. NHS Connecting for Health have been instrumental in the establishment, and are a founding member of the Standards Development Organisation, which has acquired the intellectual property rights for SNOMED-CT, an international standard for codifying clinical data.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003W.2/1">Expenditure under the contracts let for the core components of the national programme for information technology in the national health service in England, as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, was &pound;1,001.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/2">Information about local NHS spending by primary care trusts (PCTs), NHS trusts and other NHS organisations on the national programme for information technology, to complement the investment from central funding, is not collected centrally. However, any such spending is very significantly outweighed by the savings accrued locally from participation in the programme. Most notably, some &pound;4.5 billion has been saved by central rather than local procurement, a figure confirmed by independent industry analysts. In addition, savings have been achieved in the prices paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, as well as in NHS staff time saved through using the programme's systems and services. For example, the National Audit Office have acknowledged savings of &pound;860 million achieved through centrally negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/3">In addition, PCTs have been specifically reimbursed for funds spent on upgrading existing general practitioner practice systems to make them choose and book compliant, and funding support has also been made available to support NHS trusts deploying a choose and book compliant patient administration system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/4">The successes of the national programme are visible every day of the week in hospitals, general practices and pharmacies across the NHS, and the benefits are being experienced by doctors, nurses and, most importantly, by patients. On any typical day the national programme currently enables some 120,000 prescriptions to be transmitted electronically, reducing errors and inefficiencies; 17,000 choose and book electronic bookings to be made, putting patients in charge of their care and reducing significantly the numbers not attending out-patient appointments; almost one-and-a-half million queries to be processed on the patient demographic system, ensuring receipt of around three-quarters of a million letters a year that would otherwise be posted to the wrong address and enabling patient information to be handled more efficiently; over a hundred thousand NHSMail users, each of whom has an e-mail address for life, to send one million secure e-mails, one-third of which contain confidential patient information; five new secure broadband connections to be installed; and some 30,000 general practitioners (GPs) to use the quality management analysis system (QMAS) to deliver better care to patients under the new GP contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004W.3/3" class="indent">A national programme catalogue has been created and made available to all NHS organisations and staff. The purpose of the catalogue is to demonstrate how the NHS Connecting for Health products currently available support wider NHS policies and initiatives by detailing their functionality and the benefits they can deliver to patients, clinicians and organisations. Regular updates will ensure its continuing relevance and value. Work is ongoing with suppliers and the NHS to agree engineering-based timetables for delivery and to ensure that these timetables take NHS requirements into account.

	<p pid="a.1004W.3/6" class="indent">The first annual benefits report, for 2006-07, will be produced in autumn 2007 to coincide with the publication of planning materials for NHS organisations. Future annual benefits reports will be produced in partnership with the strategic health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.3/7" class="indent">The annual survey of NHS information management and technology expenditure is being complemented by studies of the impact of national programme deployments on local NHS IT expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.3/8" class="indent">Post-implementation reviews are being carried out to identify and quantify the service and efficiency improvements of new IT systems. The Department and NHS Connecting for Health, in partnership with the SHAs, are supporting a series of benefits demonstrators at local sites that will evaluate experiences and compile evidence of benefits achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004W.3/9" class="indent">Analysis of current areas for improvement is taking place in order to produce evidence-based development plans to create sustainable capability in the NHS.

	<p pid="a.1004W.3/10" class="indent">Relevant and appropriate clinicians continue to contribute to the effective identification of requirements, design and testing of systems being delivered under the programme. NHS Connecting for Health has appointed a Chief Clinical Officer to lead the clinical engagement and clinical contribution the programme.

	<p pid="a.1005W.2/1">Patients registered with the national health service will not be able to prevent their basic demographic and contact details from being held within the NHS care records service (NHS CRS). The NHS has maintained registers of its service users from the earliest days of its existence to support the delivery of healthcare. A record is also kept of which general practice each patient is registered with, and reasons of efficiency and probity require this to be held centrally, for example to prevent multiple general practitioners from being paid for the same patient, and to ensure that the correct commissioning body meets the cost of care provided. A register is also needed to enable the Secretary of State to meet the obligation to provide healthcare, free at the point of contact, for those patients who are ordinarily resident in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.2/2">While for these reasons it is not practicable to give patients choice about whether their demographic details will be held in the system, safeguards have been built into the NHS CRS personal demographics service (PDS) which allow an individual's contact details to be hidden from NHS staff if patients request this level of protection. Access to the PDS is controlled by a member of staffs relationship with the patient, and by what they need to see to do their jobs, and is dependent on their having a current secure smartcard and a valid pass code.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005W.8/5" class="indent">The data item, stage, was introduced in 1993 when the cancer registration minimum data set was established by the Department of Health. There remains much variation between the eight regional cancer registries in England in the recording of stage that is likely to reflect differences in what is meant by &quot;stage&quot;, rather than real differences across England in what clinicians use to classify the patients. It is not therefore, possible to provide nationally comparable data on cancer incidence broken down by stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005W.8/6" class="indent">The United Kingdom Association of Cancer Registries (UKACR) is investigating what should be counted as a complete stage in an attempt to agree on an interpretation in future.

This includes support to reduce red tape, improve the business environment, support the mining sector and encourage foreign investment. Of this, &pound;1 million has been channelled through a Wold Bank-managed trust fund which provides risk guarantees to attract foreign investors. In the past year, this trust fund has supported three projects. These are expected to trigger over &pound;13 million of investment, stimulate the cotton and pharmaceuticals sector and expand access to credit. This will help to further enhance private sector opportunities and regenerate the Afghan economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009W.12/2">In 2003, the agriculture sector accounted for over half of Afghanistan's GDP and, since the majority of Afghans are based in rural areas, agricultural performance is central to economic growth. Rural development is one of DFID's top three priority areas for investment. We are contributing &pound;7 million to the Government of Afghanistan's national horticulture and livestock programme, which will improve incentives for private investment in these important sectors. We are also funding Government programmes to construct rural roads (&pound;18 million), and providing access to credit (&pound;20 million).</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.2/2">The plan will meet Burundi's immediate needs in rebuilding an education system severely affected by the more than 12 years of devastating civil war, and lay the foundations for the development of an education system that can deliver equitable, high-quality education and professional training, and meet the target of primary education for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.2/3">The plan is expected to be finalised by September, and once endorsed by donors, submitted along with the sector strategy to the fast-track initiative (FTI) for additional financing. If fully financed, it is anticipated that almost 10,000 extra primary school classrooms will be built, over 4,000 extra primary school teachers will be trained and recruited, and that total spending on education will be more than doubled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.2/4">The UK's funds will be pooled with those of other donors to minimise the administrative burden on the government, facilitate a strengthening of the government's capacity to deliver education services and encourage others to contribute to the reconstruction of Burundi's education system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1013W.0/1">Climate change is likely to have the greatest impact on the poor, with Africa being particularly vulnerable, even though it has not caused the problem. A high priority for DFID is to work with our international partners, including the World Bank, to help reduce man-made climate change as well as help developing countries adapt to some of the inevitable impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/2">At the Gleneagles summit in 2005, the UK secured G8 agreement that the World Bank should lead on establishing a new Clean Energy for Development Investment Framework (CEIF) that would operate across the international financing system. The aim of this framework is to accelerate and catalyse public and private sector investments in cleaner energy in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/3">The CEIF has three main parts: improving access to energy, especially in Africa; promoting transitions to low-carbon energy, especially in large emerging economies; and helping countries adapt to climate variability and change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/4">The first phase of this work is under way with the World Bank and regional development banks, like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Inter-American and Asian Development Banks. They are developing work programmes to help their borrowers tackle climate change. Each bank is tailoring its approaches and initiatives to the conditions and challenges of its region and its specific experience and comparative advantage. The World Bank is continuing to work on exploring financial options to support clean energy investments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/5">The second phase in implementing the World Bank Action Plan for the CEIF will be reported at the G8 Summit in 2008, to be hosted by Japan. The World Bank has already increased its commitments and resources for clean energy investments. A recent World Bank report shows that in 2006 the Bank increased the financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects by 45 per cent., to a total of $668 million, exceeding the 20 per cent. annual increase target set in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/6">We are also working with the World Bank on the adaptation part of the CEIF. For instance, future climate change may affect rainfall patterns, which in turn could directly affect electricity generation from hydropower schemes, so the work involves climate change risk screening. The aim is to make sure that investments, including those in the energy sector, take full account of the potential future impact of climate change and establish what it will cost to adapt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/7">We are looking for a range of G8 outcomes on energy and climate change this year. This includes an invitation to the World Bank to undertake pilot schemes to reduce emissions from deforestation in developing countries. On this, the World Bank is developing a proposal for a Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) to provide support for pilot schemes in developing countries. This follows on from pilot studies to determine low-carbon opportunities in middle-income countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/8">Both the 2005 Gleneagles Plan of Action and the 2006 St. Petersburg Summit endorsed the need to improve energy efficiency. We would like to see faster implementation of energy-efficiency options and are working towards agreement on this at the G8 in Germany this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1014W.2/1">The Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) is an international partnership currently supported by 15 contributing donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.2/2">The UK has been leading an FTI Fragile States Task Team to explore how the FTI might better support education in fragile states.

	<p pid="a.1014W.2/3">The issue of fragile states and fragility was also considered at meetings of the Expanded Catalytic Fund Strategy Committee, the Education Programme Development Fund (EPDF) Task Force and the Capacity Development Task Team. Donors acknowledged that countries with weak capacity but strong political will need support to access funds to deliver education services while developing their sector plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.2/4">The Technical Meeting agreed broad endorsement for extraordinary support for such countries and that an interim means of support is needed beyond the existing FTI architecture. The Fragile States Task Team is developing a framework that could be used by governments and donors to measure a country's progress towards FTI endorsement and whether interim financing could be used effectively. It will be piloted in Somalia by UNICEF Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.2/5">As there is no internationally agreed list of conflict and post-conflict countries, the FTI Fragile States Task Team has agreed to use the definition of fragile states from the World Bank's 2007 Global Monitoring Report.<sup>(1)</sup> The FTI Partnership is already providing direct support to a number of countries regarded as fragile states. The FTI has endorsed eight such countries (Cambodia, Djibouti, The Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste), of which six have benefited from the FTI's Catalytic Fund. 11 countries (Afghanistan, Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Haiti, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Timor-Leste) have benefitted from the EPDF. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase> the Catalytic Fund Strategy Committee approved an allocation of US $13.9 million for Sierra Leone for 2007-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1014W.2/6">Sixteen countries regarded as fragile states (Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Congo, Sao Tome and Principe, Solomon Islands, Togo, Vanuatu) are working towards FTI endorsement during 2007-08.</p>

Following the Week of Action many schools across the United Kingdom discussed the issues and subsequently raised their concerns with their local Members of Parliament or through direct correspondence. My Department received about 80 letters from schools. Most of the letters asked the Government to help provide more teachers for those children living in poorer parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015W.2/2">It is estimated that 18 million extra teachers will be needed globally to provide every child with a quality primary education.

	<p pid="a.1018W.5/1">While the UK has not made any direct assessment, we are kept informed by the regular assessments made by relief agencies on the ground. Fighting in and around Mogadishu in the first three months of 2007 resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries, and has led to the largest displacement of civilians in the world this year, with an estimated 390,000 people newly displaced since the beginning of February. Most of these are additional to the existing 400,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in Somalia. Without access to food, clean water and shelter these people need humanitarian assistance, as do many of those that were not displaced but lost access to services and livelihoods that were disrupted in the fighting. Prior to the fighting, the UN had estimated that 1 million people required humanitarian assistance, and had launched an appeal for $237 million to address these needs. In April this was revised upwards to $262 million in response to the newly emerging needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.5/2">The UK is committed to addressing urgent humanitarian needs in Somalia. In 2006 DFID allocated &pound;16 million and so far in 2007 we have committed &pound;3.5 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Medical Corps (IMC) and to Solidarities, who are establishing a rapid response mechanism to improve living conditions for IDPs in Southern Somalia. Together these programmes will contribute to delivering water and sanitation, nutrition, medical and other relief supplies to those people most in need. DFID is also considering further contributions to ICRC, United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.5/3">The EC Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has committed &euro;18 million for humanitarian operations in Somalia this year, including &euro;4 million approved on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase> in response to the additional needs that have emerged as a result of the fighting in Mogadishu at the beginning of 2007.</p>

This focused on how the international community could help restart the peace process. Real progress towards an end to the humanitarian crisis depends critically on progress being made towards a just and peaceful political solution in Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.2/1">Sri Lanka is a middle-income country and therefore does not receive UK bilateral development aid. As part of its commitment for reconstruction the UK has given &pound;500,000 of post-tsunami funding during 2007-08 to support good governance and small businesses in the North and East. DFID is supporting a programme to strengthen local capacity to plan, implement and monitor tsunami recovery in the north east of the country, to ensure that tsunami relief and development assistance is efficiently and equitably delivered. This programme is in partnership with the Governments of Germany and Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/2">Through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, the UK gives &pound;2 million to support a series of programmes aimed at tackling the underlying causes of conflict. Humanitarian assistance and access remains our top priority in Sri Lanka. In light of the recent displacements, UK will be giving &pound;1 million in humanitarian assistance for the estimated 300,000 currently internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sri Lanka made homeless as a result of the upsurge in violence in the last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/3">The ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka hampers the efforts of the humanitarian and development agencies to deliver aid effectively. Careful assessments of the political situation and its impact on our aid are regularly made by the joint DFID/FCO office in Sri Lanka. Part of this includes an assessment of humanitarian access, which is sometimes restricted in conflict areas. The UK has signed up with other key donors to the Guiding Principles for Humanitarian and Development Assistance in Sri Lanka. These principles are derived from the International Code of Conduct of Red Cross. One of the basic requirements is to ensure unrestricted access to all people in need of assistance.</p>
