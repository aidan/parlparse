	<p pid="b.366W.2/1">The Office of the Third Sector provides over &pound;515 million of funding for third sector programmes and has commissioned a number of evaluations of individual programmes including Capacitybuilders, Futurebuilders and Grassroots Grants. All of these independent evaluations consider the cost-effectiveness of Government funding and have been or will be published.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.2/2">One of the most significant developments in evidencing the cost-effectiveness of funding has been the establishment of the Economic and Social Research Council's &pound;10 million Third Sector Research Centre last year. The Office of the Third Sector is providing &pound;5million funding to this new centre, which will look at measuring the economic impact of the sector, including considerations of cost-effectiveness of statutory funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.2/3">The National Audit Office's recent value for money report, published in February 2009, considered cost effectiveness of Government funds for capacity building the sector. Other work by the NAO on Public Funding of Large Charities (August 2007) and Implementation of Full Cost Recovery (June 2007) also looked at issues of cost effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.366W.2/4">OTS has recently completed and published a guide to the value of Social Return on Investment (May 2009). Social Return on Investment is a way of measuring and accounting for a broader range of outcomes (such as social and environmental outcomes) rather than constraining cost effectiveness to the financial element alone. This work is of particular value when demonstrating the effectiveness of funding to the third sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.368W.8/1">In recent years, the Department has sponsored a number of research projects and in-house analytical projects in this area. In relation to the efficiency of the Department's spending on schools, the Consistent Financial Reporting data collection has been implemented since 2002-03. It is used at national and school level internally for modelling the impact of new policies and used externally at school level via the Financial Benchmarking website. This site enables users to prepare charts that compare their school's income and expenditure profile with that of similar schools so that they can make informed decisions on how to manage their resources effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.368W.8/2">In relation to the efficiency of funds spent by maintained schools the Department has constructed school level measures of efficiency derived from Data Envelopment Analysis models. These models generate a measure of efficiency for every secondary school, which express how effective they have been in delivering pupil outcomes given their resourcing levels and pupil context relative to the most efficient school in the sector that faces similar funding and contextual constraints. A similar project for measuring efficiency in primary schools is due to take place this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.368W.8/3">The details of the efficiency measures for secondary schools can be found in the following publication:</p>

	<p pid="b.373W.9/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>, all veterans have priority access to national health service secondary care for any conditions that are likely to be related to their service, subject to the clinical needs of all patients. Data on take-up of priority treatment and numbers of priority treatment received are not collected centrally. NHS chief executives were informed of the extension of provision of priority treatment to all veterans in December 2007 (Access to Health Services for Military Veterans) and subsequently in June 2008 in a letter to strategic health authorities (SHAs) (Health Services for the Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans - Guidance for SHAs). Copies of both documents have been placed in the Library. The NHS Operating Framework published in December 2008 makes it very clear that primary care trusts and providers should be delivering this for all relevant referrals.</p>

	<p pid="b.375W.2/1">The MOD does not contribute specifically towards hospitality expenses in respect of funerals. When a service person (including a member of the reserve forces when on duty) dies it is MOD policy to arrange a funeral at public expense or provide funding towards the cost of a private funeral dependant upon the wishes of the next of kin. If a family chooses to have a publicly funded service funeral, a grant of &pound;500 is paid to the next of kin or executor of the estate to help cover incidental expenses. When a family chooses to have a private funeral, a higher grant is paid towards the cost of funeral expenses. This can be up to a maximum of &pound;2,876.00 if the family have taken responsibility for all the arrangements themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.376W.6/34">In this same report Ofgem also estimated that as at the end of October 2008 there were over 800,000 customer accounts benefiting from a social or discounted tariff.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.6/35">In a report published by Ofgem in July 2008,</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.6/36" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/SocAction/Suppliers/CSR/Documents1/Monitoring_suppliers_10508.pdf">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Sustainability/SocAction/Suppliers/CSR/Documents1/Monitoring_suppliers_10508.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.376W.6/37">Ofgem set out its new criteria for what constitutes a social tariff. To qualify as a social tariff it has to be at least as good as the lowest tariff in a customer's area. Ofgem will report formally on the suppliers' social programmes later this summer. The report will include information on whether existing social tariffs and any other new versions that have been introduced by the suppliers since its last report are or continue to be consistent with the revised definition of a social tariff.</p>
	<p pid="b.376W.6/38">The Department does not hold any specific information on the average length of time a customer has to be with an energy supplier before being able to apply for a social or discounted tariff. However, in their December 2008 report on suppliers' social programmes, Ofgem supplied details of the qualifying criteria for the suppliers' social and discounted tariffs. This information shows that there is no minimum qualifying period for a customer to be eligible for suppliers' social and discounted tariffs with the exception of E.On's WarmAssist tariff, where a customer has to be with the company for at least a year before qualifying.</p>

	<p pid="b.384W.0/4">We welcome the huge growth in independent Afghan media since 2001, but, as the declaration states, we are concerned about evidence of a gradual deterioration of the situation regarding freedom of expression, including the growing intimidation and violence targeting Afghan journalists, and challenges to the independence of the media.</p>
	<p pid="b.384W.0/5">If the Afghan Government were to enact the new Media Law, already passed by the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament, it would do much to help ensure respect for freedom of expression, particularly in the run-up to the elections this August. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has raised this issue with President Karzai and we will continue to lobby the Afghan Government to pass the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.384W.0/6">Strengthening the rule of law is also essential to protecting individuals, including journalists, from violence and intimidation. But the challenges are long-term and significant. We continue to support the Afghan authorities in developing an effective police force, improving access to justice and strengthening the formal justice system's ability to prosecute offenders and tackle corruption. In 2008-09, the UK allocated &pound;29 million to strengthen Afghan interdiction and law enforcement capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.385W.8/3">The resolution also demanded the restoration of the Government, and called on states not to recognise any Government other than the constitutionally elected one. Demonstrations have been occurring in Honduras and the military are deployed on the streets of the capital Tegucigalpa. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and call for the peaceful resolution in accordance with the constitutional order of Honduras and the principles of rule of law and democracy.</p>

The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) is responsible for assessing the terrorist threat to this country and UK interests overseas, and Ministers play no part in that decision-making process.

It is helpful in assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different health interventions, helping to balance the twin imperatives of high quality and good value. High quality care and best value for taxpayers' money are principles set out in the national health service constitution.</p>

	<p pid="b.408W.0/1">The majority of UK development aid to Kenya goes through civil society organisations, international NGOs, UN agencies and other private implementing partners, who usually have robust project monitoring and financial accounting systems. Approximately 30 per cent. of our programme goes directly to the Government of Kenya through earmarked accounts, which are rigorously monitored and audited. Thorough fiduciary risk assessments are undertaken of individual ministries and projects before we provide funding to the Government of Kenya.</p>

This constitutes less than 0.02 per cent. of UK development aid to Kenya over a two-year period.</p>

	<p pid="b.413W.3/1">It is not possible to provide estimates of staffing figures for Derbyshire at this time. Resource allocations for 2010-11 and 2011-12 have not yet been set.</p>
	<p pid="b.413W.3/2">The Derbyshire Probation Board has been developing its financial and business plans for the next three years, as part of its application to become a Probation Trust. Unions are being consulted as these plans are being developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.413W.3/3">When the outcome of its trust application is known and the resource allocations for 2010-11 and 2011-12 have been set, Derbyshire will prepare its workforce plans to deliver the required service within available resources. I will write to the hon. Member when resource allocations have been set and the associated workforce plans have been agreed by Derbyshire Probation Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.413W.3/4">Responsibility for resourcing levels lies with each probation board or trust as they are the employers of probation staff. It is for them to take the action necessary at a local level, within available resources, to ensure they can deliver the required service.</p>

	<p pid="b.414W.2/1">During the period January to December 2008, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 17,164 cases where an immediate custodial sentence was the recommendation of a pre-sentence report. This information is available at the Ministry of Justice website at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/probationquarterly.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/probationquarterly.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.414W.2/3">The principal guidance provided to the Probation Service on sentencing proposals to make to the court is the Criminal Justice Act 2003: New Sentences and New Framework and the National Implementation Guide for the Criminal Justice Act 2003, both of which were issued in March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.2/4">Both documents make clear that the report writer should propose a sentence that is proportionate to the level of seriousness and purpose, or purposes, of sentencing that the court intended, including the use of custodial or suspended custodial sentences. Separate guidance issued in June 2005 describes how the report writer should address sentences for public protection, also introduced by CJA 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.2/5">Further guidance was issued in April 2009 for court officers, report writers and offender managers that emphasised that reports should offer the court a clear proposal and that custody should be proposed where no other sentence was suitable. The Government believe that prison is the right place for the most dangerous, serious and persistent offenders, and we are increasing prison capacity to ensure that we always have enough places for these offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.414W.2/6">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems which, as with any large scale recording system, are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.</p>

	<p pid="b.421W.5/2">The Department for Transport is conscious of, and sympathetic to, the special heritage nature of the current tram fleet in Blackpool; however, it also recognises that public transport services should be available to all members of society. Therefore, the 16 new trams that the operator is currently procuring for regular service will comply with modern accessibility standards. However, officials have proposed exempting Blackpool's existing fleet from accessibility requirements for use on heritage services on the route. The decision on whether to grant an exemption will ultimately be for Parliament to decide.</p>

	<p pid="b.423W.6/1">DWP commercial and procurement teams use the Sustainable Procurement Risk Assessment Methodology (SPRAM) as part of their activities and the use of small and medium-sized enterprises is covered within this procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.6/2">The Department benefits from a diverse market and choice of supply. The Department fully supports and follows procurement rules which are based on the concepts of transparency and non discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.6/3">DWP is committed to &quot;competitive neutrality&quot; among its suppliers and to public sector best practice and acts in accordance with OGC standards. Where contract opportunities are to be competed they are appropriately advertised to the market and fair competition is used to select the most suitable solution and value for money obtained for the tax payer.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.6/4">Where practical, requirements are packaged to make them more attractive to smaller suppliers. This can include dividing requirements into lots, allowing regional rather than national provision or, where this is not practical, by encouraging primary contractors to use smaller and medium-sized enterprises as sub contractors.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.6/5">In 2007-08 we had 31 SME suppliers in our top 200 (15.5 per cent.) who attracted a spend of &pound;158.5 million (4.7 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.6/6">In 2008-09 we had 72 SME suppliers in our top 200 (36.0 per cent.) who attracted a spend of &pound;251.5 million (7.0 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.6/7">Therefore in 2008-09 the number of SME suppliers in our top 200 increased by 41 (132 per cent.) and their spend increased by &pound;93 million (58.6 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid="b.425W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what recent estimate his Department has made of the average distance between the home of a jobseeker's allowance claimant and the nearest Jobcentre Plus office; and if he will make a statement. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.0/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a large network of offices with a wide and constantly changing customer base. These factors preclude an accurate assessment being made in relation to an average distance between the home of a jobseeker's allowance claimant and the nearest Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.0/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus Customer Service Directors constantly review their service delivery plans to ensure optimum provision of service for all customers, for every Jobcentre Plus District. This is especially important in the context of the current economic conditions and welfare reform changes planned for the next two to three years. In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners' premises. That is particularly important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically such services can be delivered in partnership with Children's Centres or on Local Authority premises or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.0/6" class="indent">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now also delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have more than half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.426W.2/2">Jobseekers can take part in part-time training at any point in their claim as long as it is for less than 16 hours per week, and may also undertake two weeks of full-time training within a 12-month period. In both cases, customers remain on jobseeker's allowance. This training could be with a range of learning providers, including further education colleges and provision arranged through the devolved Administrations' vocational training programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.426W.2/3">Jobseeker's allowance customers must be available for and actively seeking work as their main activity and must be prepared to take up the offer of a job at short notice. However, within certain parameters, customers can undertake full-time training if this is needed in order to gain the necessary skills to enter employment. Customers undertaking full-time training are transferred to a training allowance, to which the 16-hour study rule does not apply.</p>
