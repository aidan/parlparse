	<p pid="a.463W.3/2">Security staff at UK airports are vetted by the Department for Transport at Counter-Terrorist Check (CTC) Level. All other staff who need to work in the Restricted Zone at airports are required to undergo a check of their criminal record. Such staff need to provide a Basic Disclosure certificate to the pass issuing authority (Aerodrome Manager). At present the only source of such a certificate is Disclosure Scotland (part of the Scottish Criminal Records Office). The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), which provides the Disclosure service in England and Wales, is considering its approach to the introduction .of Basis Disclosures as part of a strategy review.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.5/4" class="indent">The most recently available information is for deaths in 2003. Relevant figures are only readily available for deaths where the underlying cause was either related to drug poisoning or directly related to alcohol (alcohol abuse, dependence and poisoning, and diseases directly related to alcohol use). It is not possible to identify from death certificates which substance was the primary cause when more than one was involved. Figures related to the number of deaths on which substances <i>(a)</i> to <i>(e)</i> were mentioned are shown in the table below, together with figures on alcohol-related deaths. Figures are for the calendar years 1999 to 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.5/5" class="indent">Figures on deaths due to volatile solvent abuse are collected separately by Department of Health. Figures on deaths involving prescription drugs are not available as it is not possible to readily identify deaths where an adverse reaction to a particular drug taken in therapeutic dosage was involved. Adverse reactions to drugs are reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the yellow card scheme. Figures on deaths from overdoses involving these drugs are available, however some substances are available in prescription and over-the-counter compounds and these cannot be distinguished.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.5/6" class="indent">It should be noted that the figures on drug-related poisoning are not directly comparable to the figures on alcohol for the following reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.5/7" class="indent">The figures on drugs do not include long-term effects of drug taking, whereas the figures on alcohol include cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.5/8" class="indent">Overdose deaths which involved both drugs and alcohol are coded as due to drug poisoning, in accordance with international rules for coding cause of death.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.5/9" class="indent">The figures on alcohol include only those where the underlying cause was alcohol-related. The figures on specific drugs include any mention of a substance on a death related to drug poisoning. This means a death could be included in more than one row of the table, for example if the deceased took both heroin and cocaine.</p>

	<p pid="a.480W.2/1">The impact on UK industry of the recent temporary rises in spot gas prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and/or forward prices and the duration of the high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. The impact on domestic consumers will depend on whether the energy supply companies decide to pass on the costs of what was a short-lived spike in spot prices.

	<p pid="a.480W.5/1">The forward wholesale price for gas for the first quarter of 2006 averaged around 48p/therm in February 2005, and for the first two weeks of March it has been around 54p/therm. However, the average actual price paid for delivery in the winter tends to be lower than the forward price, and the same may happen in 2006. Nevertheless, 54p/therm is above the forward price in respect of previous winters, driven by changing market views about the tightening winter supply situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.480W.5/4">This Government implemented the Manufacturing Strategy in 2002, the first from any government in over 30 years. In July 2004 we published a review of the Strategy setting out a framework for action to address many of the challenges currently facing manufacturers in the UK. It focuses on support for innovation and skills, and assisting industry to produce smarter, higher value-added products.

	<p pid="a.485W.0/1">The last census in the north of Cyprus carried out by the Turkish Cypriot authorities in 1996 found that there were 137,398 Turkish Cypriots and 54,626 people born in mainland Turkey. However, these figures are not universally accepted. The Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly adopted a resolution in 2003 stating that there were 115,000 persons of Turkish mainland origin in the north of Cyprus. The Assembly also noted that in 2001 there were 87,600 Turkish Cypriots in the north of Cyprus. The Assembly's figures too are disputed.</p>
	<p pid="a.485W.0/2">We believe that the population composition in the north of Cyprus will likely be an important factor in any new settlement negotiations. In that context, universally agreed figures on the demographics of the north would clearly be desirable. But it is for the two sides, in the context of renewed efforts towards achieving a settlement, and in conjunction with the United Nations, to discuss the most appropriate way to deal with demographic issues pertaining to the situation in Cyprus.</p>

	<p pid="a.485W.3/2">Turkey supported the UN Secretary-General's Comprehensive Settlement Plan for Cyprus, which provided for a staged reduction in troop numbers. If the island had reunited on the basis of the plan, Turkish troops would have been reduced by over 80 per cent. by the end of 2007, with a further 50 per cent. reduction within the following four years. Thereafter, the plan allowed for 650 troops to remain in the north of Cyprus, the same number of Turkish troops as set out in the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. This agreement would be subject to regular reviews with a view to eventual withdrawal by mutual consent.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.4/1">The Animal By-Products Regulation requires that all intermediate plants have a covered space to receive animal by-products. We consider that in general this will also mean that all handling of by-products must be done in that covered space. The Regulation also requires the plant to be constructed in such a way that it is easy to clean and disinfect, and that floors must be laid down in such a way as to facilitate the draining of liquids. The plant must also have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests, such as insects, rodents and birds. In our view, the combination of these requirements is such that it would be necessary for the plant to have a roof, walls and a floor before we can approve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.4/2">Slaughterhouse waste may contain high-risk material such as Specified Risk Material (SRM). It will usually have a high liquid content, and contain loose fragments of material, thereby increasing the risk of leakage or spillage during handling and the risk of spread by vermin such as rodents or birds. Such waste must therefore be handled in an enclosed space to provide adequate safeguards to protect public and animal health.</p>

	<p pid="a.495W.5/1">I have agreed with ministerial colleagues within UK Government and the devolved administrations that a review of policy for the long-term management of the UK's low level radioactive waste (LLW) should be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/2">LLW is generated by a wide range of activities involving the use of radioactive substances. They include the operation of nuclear reactors, the operation of other nuclear processing facilities, the decommissioning and clean up of nuclear sites, non-nuclear industrial activities, the medical use of radioactive materials, and research and educational activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/3">While relatively low, the level of radioactivity in LLW can span a very wide range (about five orders of magnitude). Not least because of this, it has been managed in a number of ways in the past: using the national disposal facility at Drigg in Cumbria, using various forms of disposal on the nuclear site on which the waste was generated, using controlled burial to landfill and, for small quantities of very low-level waste, through disposal with other ordinary refuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/4">What has now changed is that with many nuclear sites and facilities moving into their decommissioning phase, and with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) being set up to deal with this, it has been increasingly recognised that there will be a very large volume of LLW to be dealt with. Potentially this could fill the Drigg disposal facility a number of times over.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/5">The kinds of issue that are going to have to be addressed in the review are should we use up existing capacity in the Drigg facility&mdash;which is a relatively expensive management option&mdash;on very low activity wastes (i.e. how do we best use the Drigg facility as a national asset?). Does it make sense to dig up very large quantities of very low activity waste and transport it around the country to bury at some other site? Is controlled burial to landfill off-site appropriate for nuclear waste, or should we be looking to a greater use of on-site burial under suitably controlled and regulated conditions? For whatever approach is identified what is the likely timing of the existing Drigg facility becoming full, and what need for action does this imply?</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/6">The proposed policy review is intended to consider these kinds of issues. The aim is to identify a policy framework, which will update that set out in the 1995 White Paper &quot;Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions&quot; (Cm2919) to cover the future management of LLW, notably by the NDA. The aim of such a policy statement is not to address the detail of the individual LLW management decisions that have to be made, but rather to define the high level framework&mdash;requirements and principles&mdash;within which such decisions must be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/7">The initial stages are being overseen by a Steering Group drawn from the Government's Radioactive Waste Policy Group (RWPG). RWPG is made up of UK Government, devolved administrations and regulatory body representatives and meets regularly, several times a year, to discuss radioactive waste management policy and regulatory issues. The Steering Group is organising two national stakeholder workshops during the course of 2005 to support consideration of the issues and possible solutions. This work will contribute to the preparation and issue of a Government consultation on the revised policy proposals to be issued around the turn of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/8">The LLW long-term management policy review will be carried out in parallel with the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), which is assessing options for the long-term management of the UK's higher activity wastes. In contrast to CoRWM's work the issue for LLW is not that of identifying the best long-term management option itself, but rather how best to apply those forms of long-term management that already exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.5/9">Clearly there may be some interdependencies between the LLW management policy review and the work of CoRWM. These will be kept under review and managed by RWPG Committee as the work proceeds.</p>

For some stakeholders, more tailored strategic guidance and advice, drawing on &quot;Securing the future&quot;, will be produced and publicised. As reflected in the Strategy, schools, colleges and universities are already developing awareness of sustainable development issues in light of DfES' Sustainable Development Action Plan, and resources to help educators consider these issues will be examined in light of the new strategy.</p>

There will be no change in the fee concessions arrangements that help unemployed people, those on income based benefits, and retired people and working families on low incomes, to access further education. We will continue to make substantial levels of public funding available to all which covers the largest part of the cost of courses but we also expect adult learners, who can afford to do so, to make a contribution to the costs of their learning. Those people already qualified at level 2, or not in one of our priority groups, will on average pay a higher fee contribution in 2005&ndash;06 unless they qualify for fee concessions.</p>

	<p pid="a.507W.3/1">The focus of Invest NIs international sales and marketing effort is to aggressively promote all areas of Northern Ireland, including Newtownards, as an attractive and viable location for new inward investment opportunities, in what is a very competitive global marketplace. In recent years the shift in foreign direct investment flows towards service industries has increasingly witnessed new investment, mainly from the financial services and software sectors, wishing to locate within the larger labour pools available in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.3/2">Invest NI's local offices continue to work closely with key stakeholders to understand and ensure that detailed information on sub-regional sales propositions, including Newtownards, is available to potential investors.</p>

This support was offered through a wide range of programmes.</p>

Invest NI is committed to working closely with others engaged in economic development, and this includes regular attendance at Ards borough council's economic sub committee meetings, at which inward investment issues are discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.6/2">With the continuing movement in global foreign development investment trends from manufacturing to predominantly tradable service-based sectors, potential investors place an increasing emphasis on locations within larger labour pools providing good infrastructure or close proximity to University Centres of Excellence.</p>

This means that community hospitals will have an important role in both urban and rural areas. The exact nature of that role will be for local determination, as community hospitals must meet the needs of the local population. Therefore, they will vary in size and in the services they provide, depending on local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.516W.0/31" class="indent">asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.0/32">The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the dental practice board (DPB). An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA). Total expenditure on these items by the DPB and the PPA cannot be allocated to individual health bodies, therefore the total expenditure in the answer does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.0/33">The proportion of drugs expenditure accounted for by the DPB was larger in 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99, which is why the total expenditure figures for those years appear low compared to 1996&ndash;97, 1999&ndash;2000, and 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.0/34">For these reasons expenditure cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.</p>

Under section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, national health service bodies are under a duty to consult and involve patients, the public and their representatives in the planning of changes to services, and to involve them in decisions affecting the operation of services. Should a proposal to change services represent a substantial development or variation, NHS bodies are under a duty to consult relevant local authority overview and scrutiny committees.</p>
