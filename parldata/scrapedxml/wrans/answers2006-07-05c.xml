	<p pid="c.1069W.6/2">The current development phase is a joint project between the Directorate General for Transport and Energy in the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Supervisory Board of the Galileo Joint Undertaking is established to ensure an adequate information flow and political control by member states of the implementation of the development phase.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.6/3">The Government are aware of the sensitive nature of some parts of Galileo. We continue to monitor the project closely. We have been careful to ensure that any agreements with partners in the programme that are not member states of the EU or ESA specifically exclude them from participation in all sensitive aspects.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.6/4">Individual member states of the ESA and EU participating in Galileo are responsible, under their own national and/or any international export control regimes&mdash;such as MCTR (Missile Technology Control Regime) and Wassenaar&mdash;of which they are signatories, for the control of strategic exports and should apply these rules to Galileo as required. For example, all EU countries follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which prohibits export of military technology, including dual use technologies where a military end use is known or suspected, to non-EU states, including China, where this is inappropriate. An assessment of the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end use is a key criterion under the code. The UK Government assesses Galileo technology proposed for transfer to non-EU states against these criteria.</p>

This includes significant investment by the Highways Agency on the motorway and trunk road network in the Yorkshire and Humber region over the last five years.

These cover major (greater than &pound;5 million) local transport plan schemes and major Highways Agency schemes other than on those on roads of the greatest strategic national and international importance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.9/3">On rail investment, new services have been introduced between Sheffield and Leeds, and new rolling stock provided to increase capacity on routes in to Leeds and Bradford.

	<p pid="c.1076W.2/1">The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Wales Office was an early adopter of pre-legislative scrutiny and the national health service (Wales) Bill was scrutinised during the 2001-02 session. Since then, a further three Bills introduced by my Department were published in draft for consultation: the Public Audit (Wales) Bill; the Transport (Wales) Bill; and, the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill. A public consultation has always been conducted in parallel with the pre-legislative scrutiny process. My Department has also introduced two further Bills. My Department had conducted a public consultation jointly with the Welsh Assembly on the principles underlying the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Bill, and as there was general support for the proposals, further scrutiny was not considered necessary, and would only have further delayed the legislation. The Government of Wales Bill, which is currently before the House, was introduced without pre-legislative scrutiny, because the proposals need to be implemented for the May 2007 Assembly elections. Extensive consultation was however undertaken on the White Paper, which was published well in advance of this Bill being introduced. All of the Department's formal consultations also abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation.</p>

In contrast to the EUWI, the EUWF is a funding mechanism. The Water Facility has made &euro;500 million available for water and sanitation and aims to leverage additional funds from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.3/8">Progress to date has been slow, mainly because of lengthy procurement procedures, but approximately &euro;230 million is currently being committed to co-fund 97 projects, valued overall at &euro;412 million. An initial analysis of these selected proposals by the EUWF has found that by 2010 approximately 10 million people will benefit from access to drinking water and approximately 5 million people will benefit from access to basic sanitation. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &euro;500 million of the Water Facility will be committed by 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1079W.6/1">The UK strongly supports the Global Fund and wants it to be effective in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria. The Global Fund recently revised its resource needs to an estimated US$5.5 billion for 2006 and 2007. There is a current funding gap of US$2.1 billion for 2006 and 2007. Of this, US$1 billion is needed this year to fund a new round of grants which was launched by the board in April. The Mid-Term Review of the Global Fund (4-<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>) will review the fund's performance and mobilise extra resources for 2006-07 to fill the funding gap. The UK has committed &pound;359 million to the Global Fund (2002-08). We have doubled our pledge for 2006 and 2007 to &pound;100 million in each of those years. This means that our overall share of support for the Global Fund at around 5 per cent. is consistent with our support over the 2001-05 period. The UK is meeting its fair share&mdash;other donors need to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.6/2">The Global Fund is only one part of our contribution to tackling AIDS, TB and malaria. The UK is committed to spend at least &pound;1.5 billion on the global AIDS response over three years (2006-08), including our support to the Global Fund. We also provide support to the Roll Back Malaria (&pound;7 million pledged to 2008) and Stop TB initiatives (over &pound;49 million pledged from 1999 to 2007), as well as direct support to countries to help tackle diseases of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.6/3">The UK will continue to encourage other donors including the private sector to support the Global Fund. The Prime Minister has also recently made clear that we are committed to working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage the development of long term&mdash;10 year&mdash;health plans and to help ensure that predictable support is available from donors to support them. This will be key in helping countries strengthen their health systems and to be able to more effectively combat AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>

	<p pid="c.1080W.2/2">DFID does not track long-term health sector spending because we provide pooled financial support for basic health services. But, as the Prime Minister recently made clear, we are committed to making good on our G8 promises, and a key part of this is to support developing countries with long-term, sustainable financing for health. We are currently working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage development of long-term&mdash;10 year&mdash;health plans and to ensure that predictable support is available from donors for them. This long-term support will provide poor countries with the security to make long-term investments and meet the costs of salaries, drugs, infrastructure and training. We have also increased our funding to multilateral organisations supporting countries strengthen their health services, including to the Global Fund and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). We are spearheading innovative efforts to secure significant additional resources for essential health care through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, with the first bond issue due in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1081W.3/1">The main impact of recent military action has been to the loss of electrical power following damage to Gaza's only power plant. The closure of the Nahal Oz oil pipeline from <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-02">2 July</phrase> and greater difficulty in movement due to the destruction of three bridges providing north-south access have also had an effect. Hospitals in Gaza are maintaining services by using back up generators, although there are reports that supplies of some essential drugs and supplies are nearly finished. It is difficult for anyone from the south to access to the main referral hospital in Gaza city in the north.</p>
	<p pid="c.1081W.3/2">The Gaza economy has been severely constrained since March, when Hamas assumed power. Since then, the access point for exports from Gaza has been closed, trade with Israel has all but stopped and a very limited number of public sector salaries have been paid. Most of the water supply to Gaza is pumped from wells. Supplies are being continued by connecting pumps to generators, but there is concern that fuel for these generators is dependent on the Nahal Oz pipeline remaining open.</p>

The vouchers can be used to pay registered child minders, nurseries, playgroups, cr&egrave;ches, nannies, holiday play schemes for school age children, and close relatives who care for children, thus allowing staff a range of choices when making their child care arrangements.

	<p pid="c.1083W.8/1">The overall daily resource cost of running the House administration in 2003-04 and 2004-05 was &pound;487,000 and &pound;520,000 respectively. The difference in cost between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected. Major works and other contracts were negotiated on the basis of the revised sitting arrangements in both September 2003 and 2004. It is therefore impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that around &pound;90,000 of additional works expenditure was incurred directly by the House sitting in each September period.</p>

More generally, staffing levels are controlled by a budgetary mechanism rather than by limits on staff numbers. The IRS has recently completed the first stage of a review of staff grading. Subject to the views of the Administration Estimate Audit Committee, the second phase will be conducted later in the year.</p>

Sport England is providing &pound;8 million in exchequer funding over the period 2005-09 to support the strategic priorities contained in the LTA's Whole Sport plan.

	<p pid="c.1103W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence is guided on its programme of research into Gulf veterans' illnesses by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and has undertaken studies into: the anthropology of &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;, cancer, changing health, mortality/morbidity, neuromuscular symptoms, paraoxonase, reproductive health, testing for squalene in vaccines and vaccines interactions. I am aware of a concern on the part of the Gulf Veterans Association and National Gulf Veterans and Families Association that research should be undertaken on possible endocrine and/or genetics aspects of the illnesses experience by veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf Conflict, as well as on the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. We are awaiting detailed proposals which we will then refer to the MRC for their independent advice on the case for the Department commissioning such research, taking account of research already being undertaken elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="c.1105W.0/1">The United Kingdom's area of responsibility in multi national division (south east) remains relatively quiet compared to other parts of the country, accounting for around 4 per cent. of overall attacks in Iraq. There has been a rise in violence in Basra, and there have been a number of developments since March that seek to address this. The provincial council has re-engaged with UK forces, allowing the recommencement of the full programme of operational activity for our forces in MND(SE). Most recently, we have secured important undertakings from the Iraqi Government on delivering a new security plan for Basra.</p>

	<p pid="c.1106W.3/1">Pay 2000 is the generic term used to describe the incremental pay system for armed forces personnel. It arose as a consequence of the recommendations made in the independent review conducted by Sir Michael Bett in 1995, and was introduced in April 2001 for regular personnel, and November 2002 for reservists.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.3/2">Some 14,160 regular and reserve army personnel have been either under, or overpaid electronically at some time since, and as a result of the implementation of Pay 2000. The number of pay accounts in need of rectification was reduced to some 8,900 during 2004-05, and this figure has been reduced further to some 1,000 during 2006. I am confident that the remaining 1,000 pay accounts will be rectified prior to the roll out of joint personnel administration to the army.</p>

This collaboration is undertaken both bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as NATO and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/3">Our armed forces co-operate on operations in Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia. Other recent interaction includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/4" class="indent">Routine integration of Royal Navy and French Navy ships into respective Task Group deployments, most recently in the UK Naval Task Group Deployment AQUILA 2006 and the French Carrier Task Group</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/5" class="indent">AGAPANTHE 06, which deployed to the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and Gulf regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/6" class="indent">British Army staff officers attached to the French Rapid Reaction Corps Headquarters in Lille where they contribute to French work on achieving NATO Response Force readiness.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/7" class="indent">The Royal Air Force and French Air Force combining to provide a Joint Force Air Component Headquarters, and substantial force elements, for NATO Response Fortes 5and 6.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/8" class="indent">Agreement to co-operate in establishing a network of Peace Support' Training Centres in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.3/9">This close and highly valued military relationship is fostered through regular dialogue at all levels from the Chief of the Defence Staff downwards and underpinned by bilateral agreements and letters of intent. There is also a network of exchange and liaison officers across all three services. The continuation of our excellent military relationship with France will remain important as we work together to tackle the challenges ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.1111W.2/1">I have never been informed that &quot;wetting&quot; is official policy for dealing with looters in Basra. No witness statements saying that &quot;wetting&quot; is official policy for dealing with looters in Basra were disclosed to Crown counsel either prior to the trial of soldiers relating to the death of an Iraqi youth in the Shatt al Basra River or since the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/2">I am told that during the trial three witnesses gave evidence as to a practice of putting detained looters in water which appears to refer to &quot;wetting&quot;. Mr. Daniel O'Connell formerly a Lieutenant Platoon Commander said there was a practice of making looters wet which was discussed at the company &quot;O&quot; Group meetings; however it was not formal policy. He indicated that he had witnessed one such incident of looters being put into a dyke where they were waist high and in no real danger.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/3">Major Peter MacMullen the Company Commander said that the looting problem was discussed at Battle group meetings and that he was aware of a range of sanctions that were being deployed, which included people being put into water so that they would be left cold, wet and miserable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/4">Mr. Niall Brennan, formerly the Company Second in Command, said he knew of other companies throwing looters into the Shatt al Arab River. He did not consider they were in danger of drowning and claimed that he did not consider this dangerous because it involved the use of minimum force.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/5">Despite this evidence, coming from higher up the chain of command, the evidence given at trial made it clear that neither the commanders on the ground nor the individual soldiers were aware of such a policy or practice (officially sanctioned or otherwise). Not one of the accused raised this in their witness statements or interviews under caution. None of the members of their platoon or section who gave evidence knew of such a policy or had even heard of looters being put into water-knowledge of the policy, if one did indeed exist, was restricted to the middle echelons of the chain of command only.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/6">During the course of the trial a statement was obtained from the then Battle Group Commander, Brigadier Riddle-Webster, who said that the practice of &quot;wetting&quot; had never been discussed and had he heard of such a practice he would have put a stop to it immediately since he regarded it as illegal, dangerous and immoral. However due to legal reasons this was not put before the Board.</p>

	<p pid="c.1113W.5/1">There are no specific regulations that govern the sale, supply, or purchase of DNA sequences. The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended); if DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by Defra, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO. In all cases the relevant containment and operating requirements laid down by HSE/Defra would need to be met.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.5/2">Provisions in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 place an obligation on managers of laboratories and other premises holding specified pathogens or toxins to notify the authorities and to comply with the security requirements which the police may impose.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.5/3">There is a wide range of legitimate uses to which DNA sequences may be put and the imposition of onerous controls could discourage valuable scientific research and industry use. The Government do not believe that it is necessary to require suppliers of DNA sequences to be licensed or for them to screen customers or check the intended use of the sequences. But we will continue to monitor the situation as the relevant technologies develop.</p>

In respect of the numbers of those persons specified in the question who may be on the electoral register, I explained in my previous answer on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-06-12.1045"><i> Official Report</i>, column 1045W</phrase>, that this information is not collected. Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual. Currently, it is an offence to fail to supply information to the ERO and knowingly supply false information on the annual canvass form.</p>
	<p pid="c.1114W.2/3">The Electoral Administration Bill, strengthens the objection process and creates a new offence of supplying false information of any kind to an ERO, or failing to supply information, in connection with registration, at any time. The electoral register does not specify the immigration or asylum status of individuals entered on it; however, the addition of a &quot;nationality&quot; box in the registration form does provide an opportunity for EROs to determine the eligibility of an applicant for inclusion in the register on the basis of their stated nationality.</p>

	<p pid="c.1115W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.3/2">A key success criterion for Apprenticeships from the outset has been that the programme should be open to all young people regardless of gender, ethnic origin or disability and it should provide equal access particularly to those from potentially socially disadvantaged or marginalised groups. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has worked hard to establish and build on the Apprenticeship Frameworks and procedures required for successful equality. The Apprenticeships Approvals Group (independently chaired by the Skills for Business Network ie Sector Skills Council led) have a key role to play in ensuring that Apprenticeship Frameworks make all reasonable adjustments to maximise participation from diverse groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.3/3">The LSC maintain a website detailing starts, leavers and completions of individual frameworks <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/">http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/</a>. However, published figures for completions are not broken down by geographical area or sex. For this reason Mark Haysom, the council's Chief Executive, has written to my hon. Friend with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.3/4" class="italic"> Letter from Rob Wye, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-28">28 June 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.3/5" class="indent">I am responding on behalf of Mark Haysom, due to him currently being on annual leave, to your Parliamentary Question that asked the number of completed Heavy Vehicle Fitter Apprenticeships in England and Greater Merseyside, broken down by gender in each of the last 5 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.3/6" class="indent">The Vehicle Fitting Apprenticeship framework was implemented on 1st September 2005. This is in effect its first year for apprentices to enrol onto and as yet there is no usable framework completion data at any geographical level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1115W.3/7" class="indent">Prior to 1st September 2005 there were more generic Apprenticeship frameworks in operation for the Retail Motor Industry. An analysis of these framework completions where the NVQ within the framework is for &quot;Vehicle Fitting&quot; shows the following results,</p>

	<p pid="c.1120W.2/1">We are unable to provide this information as we do not collect these data centrally. However, individual schools may record incidents of bullying, including homophobic bullying, and some local authorities keep records for their own area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1120W.2/2">We take the issue of homophobic bullying in schools very seriously and we gave an undertaking in the White Paper, &quot;Higher Standards, Better Education for All&quot; to issue guidance on bullying motivated by prejudice, including homophobia.</p>
	<p pid="c.1120W.2/3">During Anti Bullying week in 2004 we published &quot;Homophobia, Sexual Orientation and Schools: a review and implications for action&quot;, by the Thomas Coram Research Unit, which looked at three areas: behaviour and bullying; teaching and learning about sexual orientation and relationships; and employment issues. It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area. It reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived. The report is available on the DfES website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a> and the findings will be used to inform future work in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.0/1">All public service schemes pay cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in respect of accrued rights in compliance with pensions law. Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there isa requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under Public Private Partnerships/Public Finance Initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The Club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.3/1">Responsibility for encouraging long-term unemployed people to return to education and training is shared between the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.3/2">Both Departments, along with their respective delivery agencies Jobcentre Plus (JCP) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), are working closely together to ensure that long term unemployed people have the skills they need to secure sustainable and productive jobs. There has already been significant progress in joint working between the LSC and JCP and a joint delivery plan is currently being developed which will cover the Yeovil area in order to meet local employment and skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.3/3">The Government's skills strategy sends out a strong signal about the priority we attach to helping adults with few or no qualifications to attain a platform of wider employability skills. All those on jobseeker's allowance or income related benefits and their dependents receive free tuition in further education, in addition to the support available through their local JCP office. Unemployed people also have access to in-depth advice about their education and training options through the Learndirect one-stop telephone and on-line advice service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.3/4">The Government do, however, recognise that more needs to be done to tackle long term unemployment and published a Green Paper in January 2006 'A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work' including measures to help low skilled adults secure employment through the 'New Deal for Skills'. These include piloting skills coaching in a number of JCP districts and our latest evidence shows that skills coaching is helping long-term unemployed people improve their employability skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.3/5">In addition, the Chancellor announced in his Budget Report that Lord Leitch's review of skills would be extended to include better alignment of measuresto tackle worklessness to support labour market flexibility, better employment outcomes and greater progression to productive and sustainable jobs for those with skill needs. We expect Lord Leitch's report this autumn and my Department looks forward to working with the Department of Work and Pensions to take forward Lord Leitch's proposals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1142W.2/1">In 2004, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) organised the testing of 301 samples of imported beef for trenbolone and zeranol (one sample was found to be of UK origin and one was unassailable on arrival at the laboratory).</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/2">Of the 299 assayable imported samples, 82 were from other EU member states and 217 were from other countries. No detectable residues of either trenbolone or zeranol were found in 2004, which was also the case in 2003. Trenbolone and zeranol were therefore removed from the imports surveillance programme for 2005 on the recommendation of the independent veterinary residues committee, which oversees the surveillance work of the VMD and advises the food standards agency on relevant surveys. They may be included again in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.1142W.2/11">Testing was not carried out for the other listed substances in 2004 and 2005 and imported beef has not been tested for residues of oestradiol. All of the results of the VMD's surveillance for residues of veterinary medicines and other substances are published in its quarterly magazine, (MAVIS) available from its website at: <a href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk">www.vmd.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/12">Oestradiol is a naturally occurring hormone. It will be present in beef at varying concentrations, dependant on the physiological state of the animal when it was slaughtered, and also its sex and age. Muscle, which is the matrix available for testing is not ideal. The EU's community reference laboratory recommends serum, which is not available in imported beef.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/13">Scientific advice from two of the UK's national reference laboratories for veterinary residues analysis is that any difference in concentrations between untreated animals and those treated with exogenous oestradiol is very small. So, distinguishing between them would be unlikely. Therefore no testing has been carried out on imported beef in the last 10 years. Responsibility for testing produce from non-EU member states rests with the country of entry into the EU. Once produce has entered the EU, it should have free circulation within all member states, as part of the single market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/14">EU legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements on non-EU countries before they export food to the EU. These are designed to ensure that imported animals and animal products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. The use of the listed substances as growth promoting hormones is banned in the EU, and therefore they should not be present in beef imported into the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/15">The European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office check on compliance with such legislation in EU and non-EU countries exporting to the EU.</p>

	<p pid="c.1149W.0/1">A number of measures are in place to protect woodlands in England including South Swindon and Great Western Community Forest. In particular the felling of woodland is controlled through the felling regulations. Additionally, many woodlands are subject to further controls where they lie within designated areas such as sites of special scientific interest or special areas of conservation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1152W.6/1">The UN peacekeeping operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), MONUC, is the largest and most complex mission that the UN has managed to date. Its key tasks are to facilitate political transition and power sharing arrangements, deal with armed groups outside the political process and to protect civilians.</p>
	<p pid="c.1152W.6/2">MONUC chairing aided the peace process since 2002 by brokering cease-fires and peace deals and the International Committee in Support of the Transition, which engages with the Congolese Government. Following MONUC's support for a successful referendum last December, the country is set to hold its first elections since the 1960s. UN expertise and MONUC's logistical support for this process have been crucial to making this possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1152W.6/3">MONUC operates in a dangerous and complex environment and has been mandated by the UN Security Council, under chapter VII of the UN charter, to support the Congolese Army to disarm those groups that are a threat to the peace process and to protect civilians from rebel attack. There has been considerable progress in dealing with armed groups, but attacks on civilians remain at an unacceptable level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1152W.6/4">In 2004 a number of cases of sexual abuse and exploitation by UN peacekeepers and staff in the DRC came to light, raising serious concerns about MONUC's management. After a thorough investigation by the Secretary-General's special representative on the issue, a series of measures were introduced to combat the problem of sexual abuse and exploitation by UN peacekeepers across all UN missions. MONUC has stringently imposed these measures on UN staff and peacekeepers. We continue to keep MONUC's performance under close review in all areas of its activity, through our Embassy in Kinshasa and through regular Security Council discussions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1155W.0/2">The possibility of extending qualified majority voting to police and judicial affairs was provided for in the Amsterdam and Nice treaties. Article 42 of the treaty on European Union (TEU)&mdash;the passerelle&mdash;allows for areas governed by title VI (third pillar) to be transferred to title IV (first pillar) by unanimous Council decision.

	<p pid="c.1171W.5/1">The amount of pension derived from the contracted out rebate for defined contribution schemes depends on investment returns and annuity rates at the point of retirement and it is not possible to predict the amount of that pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.1171W.5/2">Where people contract out under such schemes, they forego all or part of their State Second Pension and, in return, part of their National Insurance Contributions is rebated and invested to build up a funded pension. The value of these rebates, subject to an age cap, is actuarially neutral in relation to the State benefit foregone. If a person ceases to be contracted-out, they will start to build up rights to State Second Pension. Given the actuarial neutrality of the rebate, they should generally be no better or worse off in retirement as a result of not receiving the contracted out rebate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.2/1">Earnings-related accruals of state second pension would be tapered away by around 2030 by freezing the national insurance upper earnings limit, for the purpose of state second pension accruals, in cash terms from the point at which earnings uprating of the basic state pension as proposed in the White Paper is introduced. Earnings-related accruals built up under the state earnings-related pension scheme and/or the state second pension prior to 2030 would be fully protected and would continue to be revalued in line with earnings from that date. The combination of our proposals to 'flat-rate' accruals of the state second pension and earnings uprate the basic state pension would ensure that the state pension outcomes for people reaching state pension age after 2030 would not be reduced. The following table shows examples of the state pension outcomes for individuals under the proposed reforms.</p>

For example in medicine, numbers in training in the relevant specialty areas will accommodate an increase in specialist numbers in future years.</p>

The PCSPS(NI), in parity with GB public service schemes, pays cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in compliance with pension law. Members of public service schemes can transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The Club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights. There is also a requirement under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the public sector under Public Private Partnerships/Public Finance Initiatives or under Machinery of Government movements and subsequent transfers for former public servants.</p>

	<p pid="c.1184W.2/1">Northern Ireland Departments, Northern Ireland Office and the Police Service for Northern Ireland will spend at least &pound;7.5 million per annum (&pound;6 million in programme expenditure) in support of the key aims of the Racial Equality Strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/2">Some of the key actions from the Racial Equality Strategy Implementation Action Plan include:&pound;3.2 million towards supporting English as an additional language; almost &pound;1.1 million across all Departments to support Irish Travellers; and&pound;0.7 million per annum to encourage capacity building within minority ethnic communities and to assist integration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/3">This remaining costs figure includes where Departments have allocated staff resource to implementing the strategy. The staff estimate includes those staff processing migrant worker national insurance applications and where each Department has appointed a &quot;Racial Equality Champion&quot; from within their senior managers to direct the implementation of the strategy within their respective Departments including actions contained in the Racial Equality Implementation Action Plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.1185W.3/1">Statistically older people in Northern Ireland are still the least likely group of citizens to become a victim of crime. However over the past couple of years there has been a disproportional increase in domestic burglaries committed against those aged 65 years and over as a proportion of the population. It is also recognised that the fear of crime among older people is significant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.3/2">The Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office has developed and funds the Lock Out Crime Scheme (LOCs) which supplies and installs free of charge additional home security in the form of door and window locks, door chains and viewers and external front and rear door lighting to the homes of all those aged 65 and over who are in receipt of housing benefit or a rate rebate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1185W.3/4">In addition on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase> I launched a mobile pilot handy van service in the Greater Belfast area. This service which is being managed by Help the Aged fits free additional home security measures for those older people who don't qualify for the LOG Scheme. There is also the Unknown Callers TV Advertising campaign aimed at providing information to older people about answering the door to bogus callers. This advert was screened for a total of six weeks during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.3/5">The police offer free advice about home security and personal attack alarms to older people and several of the Community Safety Partnerships (there is a partnership in each district council area) have included the safety of older people as a priority issue in their action plans for tackling crime. These plans have now been agreed with the Community Safety Unit and the Partnerships are currently in the process of setting up their projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.3/6">Finally, the police have established a special team to co-ordinate the investigations of attacks upon older people across the Downpatrick, Newry and Mourne, Craigavon, Banbridge, Armagh, Dungannon and South Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cookstown, Omagh, Strabane and Magherafelt districts. I understand that this initiative has identified a number of persons who have been were charged with and are remanded in custody awaiting trail in relation to burglary offences against older people.</p>

It is also recognised that the fear of crime among older people is significant. To address these issues the Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office is currently leading on the development of a strategy for the safety of older people. It is planned to publish the draft strategy document for consultation in the autumn of 2006.</p>

This project deals with the problem of travelling criminals who commit burglary offences, including those that involve violence, predominantly against persons over 65 years in these districts by co-ordinating their intelligence, investigations of crimes and delivery of preventative measures.

	<p pid="c.1192W.0/1">For the purpose of answering this question, it has been assumed that the information requested relates to the level of sickness absence in each of the 11 Departments of the Northern Ireland administration, the Northern Ireland Office, departmental executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).</p>
	<p pid="c.1192W.0/2">The table at Annex A reflects both the position for 2004-05 in respect non-industrial staff and industrial staff in NI Departments and their executive agencies. It should be noted that there are differing methods in place across Departments for recording industrial sickness absence and information such as the average days lost per staff year is not available in all cases. The information on sickness absence levels for 2005-06 is not yet available but will be published in September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1192W.0/3">Information relating to all NDPBs is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, where the information is available, this is reflected in the tables at Annex B.</p>

	<p pid="c.1196W.2/3">The Treasury keeps EU labour market developments under review, and continues to argue the case for reform in Europe. In a recent joint paper with the Swedish Ministry of Finance&mdash;Social Bridges&mdash;Meeting the Challenges of Globalisation (<a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk</a>./documents/international_issues/European_economic_reform/social_bridges_paper_cfm) the Government again made the case for reforming labour markets and for policies that protect people's employability rather than specific jobs or sectors.</p>

	<p pid="c.1200W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1200W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question about what assessment has been made of the methods of collecting local authority population statistics. (81985)</p>
	<p pid="c.1200W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) liaises with users of population statistics across Government including the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). The ONS provides advice to DCLG on the use of population statistics and on any issues raised by individual local authorities concerning the data and methodology used. Nevertheless, as an ONS product, any assessment of methods used in calculating population statistics remains a matter for the ONS. It is for this reason I have been asked to reply to your question originally addressed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1200W.2/5" class="indent">The detailed methodology for population estimates is published here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Productasp?vlnk=575">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Productasp?vlnk=575</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1200W.2/6" class="indent">This methodology has been developed over a large number of years. Development of the methodology, together with the methodology for other population statistics, is done in conjunction with the Central Local information Partnership (CLiP) subgroup on population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1200W.2/7" class="indent">The usually resident definition which formed the basis of the 2001 Census enumeration, and hence the mid-year estimates, was the result of extensive consultation with users and was reported in Census Advisory Group paper AG(99) 04 'Population Definitions for the 2001 Census'. A similar process is currently underway for the 2011 Census. For international migration, the population estimates use the United Nations definition of an international migrant (someone who migrates for a period of at least twelve months.)</p>
	<p pid="c.1200W.2/8" class="indent">The Cohort Component Method, which is the method used in the UK, is an internationally respected method used for estimating population estimates in a large number of countries. ONS is undertaking a study of the Cohort Component Method for the national population estimates, comparing the method used with those used in other countries. This is part of a larger project, Improving Migration and Population Statistics, about which I have written in more detail in other replies to you.</p>

	<p pid="c.1201W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) are currently carrying out an extensive programme of work titled Improving Migration and Population Statistics Project which is designed to investigate improvements to the population and migration statistics produced by ONS. Further information on this work can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/5" class="indent">As part of this work, ONS is investigating how improvements may be made to estimates of internal migration which are currently produced using health records. In particular, the movement of students and young men are being considered and research is being carried out so that we have a better understanding of the movement of these and other mobile groups. We are also investigating other data sources that may inform our estimates of internal migration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/6" class="indent">The programme of research described above is also taking forward recommendations from the National Statistics Quality Review (NSQR) into International Migration. The quality review made recommendations for improving the estimation of total migration flows to and from the UK and the allocation of international migration to local areas. This work includes investigating administrative sources that may be used in producing or quality assuring the international migration estimates, investigating potential sources of information about short-term migrants and making improvements to the current source of information on international migrants, the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The latest Progress Report on taking forward the recommendations of the NSQRon International Migration can be found at <a href="http://vrww.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp">http://vrww.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/methodology/quality/reviews/population.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/7" class="indent">ONS are also conducting Local Authority case studies as part of the IMPS programme of work. These aim to get a better understanding, from a local perspective, of the administrative data sources that are currently used in the population estimation procedure. They will also investigate any other high quality sources that the local areas use themselves for population purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/8" class="indent">The local areas selected for these studies are ones that are known to have reasons which make their population difficult to estimate, e.g. those with a high volume of migratory moves. It is intended that these studies will contribute towards the improvement of both internal and international migration statistics.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/9" class="indent">In May ONS set up a Task Force on Migration Statistics with other Government Departments, to identify improvements that could realistically be made over the next couple of years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1221W.3/1">The information available centrally shows that average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMFT) among five year olds in the area of South and North Stoke on Trent primary care trust (PCT) is 2.01, compared to 0.97 for West Midlands and 1.49 in England as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.1221W.3/2">We have also taken note of the fact that Oldbury and Smethwick PCT, which has similar social profile to North Stoke, but receives fluoridated water, has a DMFT of 0.93. Changes we have made in the legislative framework governing fluoridation give communities with high levels of dental decay a real option of having their water fluoridated.</p>

	<p pid="c.1228W.0/1">The independent advisory committee on pesticides (ACP) provides authoritative advice to Government on all aspects of pesticides. At its meeting in November 2004, the ACP considered a report produced by its medical and toxicology panel on the possible links between pesticides and Parkinson's disease. At that meeting, the committee concluded that although this review indicated a correlation between recalled pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease it did not point to a particular toxic mechanism or a hazard from a specific compound or group of compounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1228W.0/2">However, the committee did advise that further mechanistic and epidemiological research be carried out on the association between pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease. The tender process has been organised by the pesticides safety directorate and has now finished. Two research proposals have now been funded by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, one is an epidemiology study, the other a mechanistic study.</p>
	<p pid="c.1228W.0/3">The issue was briefly discussed at the ACP meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-27">27 June 2006</phrase> and a full evaluation is expected soon. A new study by the Harvard School of Public Health has recently been widely reported in the press and ACP shall review this as soon as it becomes available.</p>
