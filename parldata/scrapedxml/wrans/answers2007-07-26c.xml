	<p pid="c.1243W.3/2">The Fleet relies on a layered defence approach to defeat an aerial attack. The backbone of the Fleet's ability to defend itself from air attack in the outer layer of maritime air defence will continue to be provided by destroyers. At present, this is achieved using the Type 42 Destroyers equipped with the medium range Sea Dart surface to air missile system. Type 45 Destroyers will gradually replace the Type 42 destroyers. These new ships will be armed with the Principal Anti Air Missile System, enhancing the Fleet's capability to counter the most sophisticated aircraft and anti-ship missiles in the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.1243W.3/3">In the inner layer of Maritime Air Defence the Fleet's close range air defence capability will continue to be provided by Type 22 and Type 23 Frigates equipped with the Seawolf point defence missile system. Additional air defence capability will also come from a combination of close-in weapon (gun) systems, such as Goalkeeper and Phalanx, and decoys.</p>
	<p pid="c.1243W.3/4">Airborne Early Warning Sea King helicopters will provide the long range detection of airborne contacts.</p>

	<p pid="c.1243W.6/2">The MOD has one programme which incorporates enhanced blast technology, the Anti-Structures Munition (ASM), as announced by my predecessor on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-06">6 February 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 34WS, due to enter service at the end of 2009.

	<p pid="c.1249W.2/1">A process and outcome evaluation of the pilots over their two-year duration is an integral part of the project. The key measures, advised on by national clinical experts, will be the assessment and treatment regimes provided, and the patient (and carer) experience and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.2/2">The costs of running the pilot scheme are not yet available as negotiations for the funding of individual sites are still continuing between the MOD, the Department of Health and NHS trusts. The cost of rolling out the scheme nationwide will depend on the outcomes of the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.2/3">The proposed service is advised on by clinical and health care experts and reflects the long established intention that veterans' health care is primarily a matter for the NHS. Using NHS best practice and processes, veterans-sensitive evidence-based interventions will be delivered by public, private or charitable providers. These will be modified as necessary in the light of the pilot evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1249W.2/4">In addition, we have recently announced the expansion of our Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) based at St Thomas' Hospital, London, to include assessment of veterans with mental health symptoms with operational service from 1982 (including veterans of the Falklands campaign). The clinician in charge is a recently retired service military psychiatrist, who will provide support and advice to GPs and other civilian health professionals where the individual is concerned that the service background of their condition may not have been understood within the NHS or where the health professional is seeking expertise on the assessment or treatment of a veteran's condition.</p>

We have identified and published the lessons of the past, accepting that mistakes were made in 1990-91, particularly with regard to medical record keeping. The Government's view is that there are no substantive issues to be addressed by a public inquiry and that, in particular, it would not help to resolve the long outstanding issue of why veterans are ill; only scientific research might do this. We have funded a substantial programme of research designed to address the key candidate causes so far put forward, but recognising that it would not be sensible to duplicate work being undertaken elsewhere.</p>

However, I can assure the hon.

	<p pid="c.1255W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of 16 to 19 year olds in York were registered as unemployed in January 2007. (151627)</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles unemployment statistics for parliamentary constituencies from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following ILO definitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.2/6" class="indent">For the 12 months ending in December 2006, the latest available data, there were 1,000 persons aged 16 to 19, resident in the City of York constituency, who were unemployed. This estimate is 16 per cent of the resident population aged 16 to 19. The unemployment rate, which is the number of unemployed expressed as a percentage of the economically active population, in that age group, was 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.2/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1255W.2/8" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). For January 2007, there were 200 persons aged 16 to 19, resident in the City of York constituency, claiming JSA. The corresponding figure for the latest available month, June 2007, is 180.</p>

	<p pid="c.1262W.2/1">Following the South East England regional assembly's adoption of housing growth options in October 2004, SEEDA commissioned work to explore the needs of the region's economy. This established that maintaining present economic growth rates would require up to 45,000 new houses per annum, and that improvements in productivity and economic activity rates could reduce this requirement to 34,800 new houses per year while maintaining overall growth rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.2/2">On the basis of this work (which was published by SEEDA), SEEDA's board agreed in March 2005 a response to the Regional Spatial Strategy consultation draft (published in April 2005) which made the case for a minimum average level of housing growth of 34,800 units per year 2006-26. The regional assembly adopted a proposed profile of 32,000 units per annum for 2006-11 and 36,000 units per annum for 2011-26.</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.2/3">Once the draft RSS was published in April 2006, SEEDA's board reconsidered the evidence at its June 2006 meeting and reaffirmed its support for the housing growth levels given above.</p>
	<p pid="c.1262W.2/4">On this basis, SEEDA submitted written objections to the draft RSS which were considered by the Panel of Inspectors at the Examination in Public (October 2006-March 2007).</p>

	<p pid="c.1274W.3/14">Workforce planning is a matter for individual trusts to undertake, working with their commissioners and strategic health authorities. Plans need to be, and are, regularly reviewed as circumstances change. North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust has recently provided information to the Department on projected numbers for paramedics. I understand that the trust intends to have 1,347 whole-time equivalents in employment as paramedics in 2007-08, 1,361 in 2008-09 and 1,375 in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.3/15">In 2006, numbers of ambulance staff were collected under new, more detailed occupation codes. This included the introduction of a code for emergency care practitioners and the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust recorded 39 ECPs in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1274W.3/16">More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration by those analysing trends over time.</p>

	<p pid="c.1276W.8/1">It is estimated that at least 25 per cent. of red cells are given to patients with cancer. Not all of these units are given for direct treatment of cancer. Figures for the actual number of transfusions are not collected, but in 2006-07 the National Blood Service issued 1,864,271 units of red blood cells.</p>
	<p pid="c.1276W.8/2">These figures are based on provisional results from the Epidemiology and Survival of Transfusion Recipients study, a National Blood Service study of patients transfused in England in 2001-02. The study is in the final stages and will be submitted for publication soon. However, it is based on data collected five years ago so it is likely that changes in blood use have occurred since then.</p>

	<p pid="c.1289W.14/24">It is the responsibility of local planning authorities to identify and release land for housing as part of the planning process. This means that the requirement for the provision of social housing will need to be negotiated and agreed with the local planning authority. The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply for housing. A register of surplus public sector land held by central Government bodies has been established. English Partnerships reviews the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As at June 2007, there were over 700 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interest are received after a site has been marketed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1300W.5/1">The Department has made no such assessment. Training schedules for national health service staff in independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) are agreed locally, subject to the meeting of accreditation standards. The number of junior doctor training posts available is based on local service requirements and future workforce planning needs in discussions with strategic health authorities, deaneries and trusts. When training is attached to activity, which is transferred from the NHS to a Wave 1 ISTC, junior doctors will complete the training in the ISTC.</p>
	<p pid="c.1300W.5/2">All ISTCs in Wave 2 are required to provide training in up to 35 per cent. of clinical services that they provide for the NHS. This includes not only medical training, but also other clinical training such as nurse or Allied Health Professional training.</p>

	<p pid="c.1301W.0/1">Since 2001, the Department and the Home Office have provided for drug treatment in the form of the pooled drug treatment budget (PTB). This funding is allocated to the 149 drug action teams across the country to use, along with local mainstream funding, to provide for treatment and services according to the specific needs of each locality. We do not have information on drug treatment spend prior to 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1301W.0/2">It is for primary care trusts to determine the level of expenditure on alcohol services within their area in line with local priorities. Information is not collected centrally on local spend; however the Alcohol Needs Assessment Research Project found that around &pound;217 million was being spend on alcohol services during 2003-04. Funds from the PTB may be spent on alcohol services provided that adequate progress is being made on drugs priorities.</p>

The procedures for the latter require that a draft order is published and consulted upon at least three months before the amended order is laid before Parliament.

	<p pid="c.1313W.5/1">The 2010 inequalities targets for life expectancy, cardiovascular disease and cancer are based on narrowing the gap in mortality between the population as a whole and the fifth of local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators (the spearhead group), and the primary care trusts that map to them, by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1313W.5/2">Life expectancy has increased for both males and females for England as a whole but it has improved more slowly in the spearhead areas. In England, average life expectancy for males is 76.9 and for females 81.1; in the spearhead group it is 74.9 for males and 79.6 for females. The slower rate of improvement in has led to a widening of the relative gap in life expectancy between England and the spearhead group. The latest data for 2003-05 show that the average life expectancy in the spearhead group was 2.61 per cent. lower than the England average for males, and 1.91 per cent. lower than the England average for females. Therefore, the relative gap has widened by 2 per cent. for men and 8 per cent. for women since the baseline (1995-97).</p>
	<p pid="c.1313W.5/3">However, although the 2010 target for life expectancy is a challenging one, data for 2003-05 also show that some 60 per cent. of the 70 spearhead areas are on track to narrow their own life expectancy gap with that of England by 10 per cent. by 2010, compared to baseline for either males or females or both. The information is set out in the following table, with comparison data for 2002-04.</p>
	<p pid="c.1313W.5/4">Data for 2003-05 have also shown continued improvements in CVD and cancer mortality inequalities between spearhead areas and the national average since the 1995-97 baseline. The absolute gap from circulatory disease has narrowed by 27.9 per cent., and we are on track to meet the 2010 target of at least a 40 per cent. reduction, There has been a 12.7 per cent. reduction in the absolute cancer inequality gap.</p>
	<p pid="c.1313W.5/5">Targeted assistance to spearhead areas is being provided through a variety of programmes such as Communities for Health, Health Trainers, Life Check and smoking cessation as well as programmes on cancer, coronary heart disease and primary care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1313W.5/6">The following table shows whether the 70 spearhead local authorities are on or off track to narrow their share of the life expectancy gap by 10 per cent. for males or females or both by 2010 according to 2003-05 data. The table also shows a comparison to 2002-04.</p>

	<p pid="c.1315W.5/1">Present action to tackle obesity in adults includes the care pathways for national health service primary care professionals and a self-help guide, 'Your Weight, Your Health'; the National Heart Forum's toolkit 'Lightening the Load: tackling overweight and obesity'; work on foods high in salt, fat and sugar; front-of-pack labelling as an easy-to-understand way of helping individuals and families to make healthier food choices; the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire; Local Exercise Action Pilots; and the National Step-0-Meter Programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1315W.5/2">We will also continue to work closely with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to support dissemination and implementation of its guidance on physical activity public health intervention and on the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1315W.5/3">Regarding steps to tackle underweight, Government advice is that people should consume a healthy balanced diet, which includes a wide variety of foods, is low in fat, and is based on plenty of fruit and vegetables and starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, and other cereals. The diet should contain moderate amounts of meat, fish, meat alternatives, milk and dairy products and sparing or infrequent amounts of foods containing fat/foods and drinks containing sugar. Eating a balanced diet in combination with physical activity should enable people to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

	<p pid="c.1317W.0/1">The Department does not collect data on waiting times for fitting of digital hearing aids. Since January 2006, the Department has been collecting data on the waiting times for audiology assessments. The latest figures, for May 2007, indicate that there are currently 1,322 people waiting over 13 weeks for assessments in Surrey and 13 people waiting over 13 weeks for assessments in Oxfordshire. In England as of May 2007, 73,381 people are waiting over 13 weeks for an assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1317W.0/2">A National Framework Contract Public Private Partnership with David Ormerod Hearing Centres and Ultravox Holdings plc was in place from October 2003 until March 2007. It was fundamental to the National Framework Contract that the quality of service, and hearing aid, that the patient received mirrored those of the local NHS audiology department. Quality assurance was key in the initiative. Both companies demonstrated their commitment to meeting these standards and invested resources in terms of equipment, IT and staff training in order to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1317W.0/3">Further independent sector capacity for audiology has been procured as part of the Phase 2 Diagnostics Procurement. Providers are subject to ongoing audit and must meet stringent key performance indicators through the delivery of the contract. Independent sector capacity is utilised at a local level alongside NHS capacity and is subject to the same standards and referral procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1317W.0/4">The Hearing Aid Council, which is responsible for standards of professional practice, remains in operation and is working towards transferring its regulatory functions to other bodies in advance of its abolition.</p>

	<p pid="c.1318W.5/15">It is not possible to assess accurately what proportion of transmissions occurred prior to birth, at birth and after birth during this period. In utero transmission is uncommon, and most transmissions occur during labour and delivery, or through breastfeeding. Infant samples need to be taken within 48 hours of birth to make inferences about timing of transmission, and since the majority of infected infants were born to undiagnosed women, sufficient samples were not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1318W.5/16">If the woman is diagnosed before or during pregnancy, she can be offered:</p>
	<p pid="c.1318W.5/17" class="indent">antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy, at delivery, and for the infant after birth;</p>
	<p pid="c.1318W.5/18" class="indent">appropriate management of delivery, e.g. planned caesarean section; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1318W.5/19" class="indent">advice not to breastfeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1318W.5/20">If the woman is diagnosed at or shortly after delivery, the infant can still be offered antiretroviral therapy starting as soon as possible after birth, and the woman can still be advised not to breastfeed, both of which will reduce the risk of transmission if the baby was not already infected in utero.</p>
	<p pid="c.1318W.5/21">Since the introduction of the routine recommendation of antenatal HIV testing in 2000, the majority of infected pregnant women have been diagnosed prior to delivery. In 2005, the latest year for which data are available, about 95 per cent. of infected pregnant women were diagnosed before delivery. During the 1990s, before antenatal testing was routine, the majority of infected women remained undiagnosed at delivery and therefore appropriate treatment and advice could not be offered.</p>

Suppliers also make clear to patients the dangers of using oxygen if they continue to smoke or use equipment close to fires or other naked flames. Suppliers are required to report any incident involving patient safety to PCTs. It is for PCTs to report all serious incidents and to take any appropriate follow-up action, whether reported by a supplier, health care professional or a patient, to strategic health authorities and the National Patient Safety Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1320W.5/4">From national service data provided by suppliers, I am able to confirm that all new suppliers are meeting the response time target 99 per cent. of the time for emergency supply.

Data Quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 6.Ungrossed Data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> HES, The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England.

While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 4. When analysing time series of HES data, the impact of improvements over time in data quality and coverage, and of changes in NHS practice need to be borne in mind.

The strategy outlines what can be done to meet the challenge of the changing demographics in the 21st century and looks specifically at the issues facing society as people live longer, healthier lives.

	<p pid="c.1334W.5/2">The Department was a major partner with the DWP in Opportunity Age. A specific theme of Opportunity Age was the development of LinkAge Plus pilots, which aim to build more effective links between central Government, local authorities and other organisations and deliver a fully integrated service to meet the needs of older people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1334W.5/3">Eight LinkAge Plus pilots were established. LinkAge Plus is a two-year pilot programme, with funding available until March 2008. It was launched in September 2006 and aims to test models of partnership working and build up evidence of good practice to ensure joined up working. The Link Up service in Gateshead is one of these pilots.</p>

	<p pid="c.1354W.8/1">The Department is not responsible for setting curriculums for health professional training. However, the Department does share a commitment with statutory and professional bodies to ensure that all health professionals are appropriately trained, so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver a high-quality health service to all groups of the population, whatever their condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.1354W.8/2">The Department has funded the production of guidance to support the effective delivery of high quality training on substance misuse, including alcohol, within undergraduate medical education in the United Kingdom. Compilation of Substance Misuse in the Undergraduate Medical Curriculum was overseen by an expert steering group and published by the International Centre for Drugs Policy in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1354W.8/3">Although the Department has not made an assessment of the training, guidance and resources available in the national health service for routine screening of alcohol consumption by pregnant women, midwives routinely ask about alcohol consumption during booked antenatal appointments. The Department has also recently reworded its advice on alcohol and pregnancy. The revised advice states that pregnant women or women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol. If they do choose to drink, to minimise the risk to the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week, and should not get drunk.</p>
	<p pid="c.1354W.8/4">The Department has not commissioned or evaluated research on the clinical management of individuals affected by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, the Government welcome the British Medical Association's recently published guide for health care professionals on FASD which will serve to raise awareness of this and provide important advice for diagnosis and those caring for patients affected by this condition.</p>

	<p pid="c.1356W.3/1">Genital warts is the most frequently diagnosed viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) in genito-urinary clinics in England. In 2006, the highest rates of genital warts were in both the 16-19 and 20-24 year age groups in women and in the 20-24 year old age group in men. Most cases of genital warts are asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously in healthy individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.3/2">To tackle the spread of STIs we have set a target that 100 per cent. of patients attending a genito-urinary medicine service are offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. We are already seeing excellent progress on this. Data from the Genito-Urinary Medicine Access Monthly Monitoring return showed that in May 2007, 85 per cent. of first attendances were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours of contacting a service. This compares with 58 per cent. in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1356W.3/3">Last November we launched a new adult sexual health campaign, &quot;Condom Essential Wear&quot;, which aims to normalise condom use among sexually active adults. The campaign focuses on STIs most prevalent in the target 18-24 year old age group.</p>

	<p pid="c.1358W.0/1">The information is not available in the format requested. Figures are available from Hospital Episode Statistics on the number of Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) in national health service hospitals in England with a primary diagnosis of diseases that can be caused by smoking. It is acknowledged that not all these FCEs which can be caused by smoking will be attributable to smoking as there are other contributory factors in these diseases. Therefore for England, the relative risks of these diseases for current and ex-smokers compared to non-smokers can be used to estimate smoking-attributable FCEs. The following tables provide either the number of FCEs that can be caused by smoking or estimates of the number of smoking-attributable FCEs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1358W.0/2">Table 1 shows the number of FCEs in England, for people of all ages, with a primary diagnosis of various diseases which can be caused by smoking for 1996-97 through to 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.1358W.0/3">Table 2 shows the number of FCEs in England, for those aged 35 and over, with a primary diagnosis of various diseases which can be caused by smoking, and estimates of the number of these which can be attributed to smoking. Figures have been provided for 2004-05, as this is first and most recent year for which data on estimates of diseases which can be attributed to smoking are available. Figures are shown for those aged 35 and over only, because relative risks used to estimate the attributable numbers are only available for this age group.</p>
	<p pid="c.1358W.0/4">Table 3 shows the number of FCEs in Hampshire and Isle of Wight strategic health authority (SHA), for all ages, with a primary diagnosis of various diseases which can be caused by smoking for 1996-97 through to 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.1358W.0/5">Relative risks of diseases for current and ex-smokers are not available at SHA level, so analysis estimating the numbers of smoking-attributable FCEs at SHA level cannot be provided.</p>

	<p pid="c.1366W.0/1">Aluminium salts are an essential ingredient of some vaccines in enhancing the protection offered by the vaccine. The safety record of aluminium in vaccines has been demonstrated over more than 50 years of use. There are no serious health risks associated with the small quantities of aluminium in some vaccines. As with many vaccine ingredients, aluminium can cause localised reactions such as redness, swelling and/or tenderness at the injection site.</p>

	<p pid="c.1370W.4/1">In March 2006, we published the 'Parenting Plan'. This easily accessible guide for separating parents helps them work out the best possible arrangements for their children, whether or not they then make court applications. CAFCASS distributes the plans, and it provides further information and support to those families involved in family court proceedings. From September 2007, the Legal Services Commission will be testing demand for giving advice over the telephone to people experiencing relationship breakdown.</p>

	<p pid="c.1378W.11/1">Sponsorship for the first academies was provided in the form of a financial contribution towards the capital cost of buildings. However, we have changed the sponsorship model and sponsors will now, in most cases, establish an endowment fund. To date, only one open academy, St. Mark's Academy in Merton, has this form of sponsorship. The amount of sponsorship pledged to each academy and recorded in their funding agreement is set out in the following table. The total sponsorship contribution is broken down and made to academy trusts in instalments to pay invoices over the lifetime of the building project. Trusts submit the invoices to the Department to confirm that sponsorship has been paid and used in accordance with funding agreements. In many instances, the invoices sent to the Department to confirm the capital contribution by the sponsor, also shown in the following table, do not keep pace with the actual payments made by the sponsor to the trust. If confirmation of the sponsor's capital contribution falls significantly behind the expected payment profile, officials approach academy trusts direct seeking explanations for apparent shortfalls, with a view to regularising the position.</p>

	<p pid="c.1383W.0/5" class="indent">Cafcass does not categorise practitioners in this way. All Cafcass practitioners are qualified to work on both public and private law cases and, because of variations in demand in any local area at any given point in time, this is essential to ensure capacity to cover all types of cases. Local demand can vary by up to 20% in any type of case in a year. We are developing new services such as duty schemes, and extending our dispute resolution (DR) schemes, evidenced by the increase in DR hours during 2006/07: a rise in 33.6%. Currently Cafcass has 1340 employed practitioners who may complete either around 55 private law cases a year, or around 12 public law cases or work on dispute resolution or extended dispute resolution which we measure in hours worked. In addition Cafcass has access to self-employed contractors and staff registered on a bank scheme. These are used as budget permits to cover peaks in referrals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1383W.0/7" class="indent">Cafcass has a quality assurance system in which we assure all aspects of our work on an ongoing basis. We have recently implemented a new electronic case management system, which will help to track cases if they return to court. We are monitoring the effectiveness of our dispute resolution work by tracking how many of our dispute resolution interventions result in partial or complete agreement being reached or are referred for section 7 reports. Based on a sample of Feb/March 2007 data, only 20.7 % of section 8 referred for dispute resolution were not resolved at least in part and referred for a section 7 report.</p>
	<p pid="c.1383W.0/8" class="indent">Feedback from Service users is part of our quality assurance system and helps us to know how effective our interventions have been. Cafcass relies on a mixture of service user (including children) feedback and external research. Over 250 children have used our online feedback system and reported very high satisfaction rates. All work is quality assured to ensure that it is of a good standard and meets Cafcass National Standards and Cafcass policies. Practitioners also receive one to one supervision from their line manager and an annual appraisal.</p>

	<p pid="c.1391W.0/1">Knife incidents in schools in England are extremely rare. To help maintain that, we gave head teachers a power, from May 2007, to search a pupil without consent when, after screening with metal detectors or on other grounds, they suspect the presence of a weapon. This supports the efforts of the police to reduce crime by and against young people on the streets around schools and supplements initiatives by the Department for Children, Schools and Families on, for example, improving behaviour and learning about responsibility, conflict resolution and safety. We do not burden schools by asking them to report whether they do or will screen. We intend to continue taking the views of our Working Group on School Security on all aspects of screening and searching, in particular in order to review the statutory power to search after three years.</p>

They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1394W.2/19">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1394W.2/20">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. As the DSG is just a mechanism for distributing funding there is not a primary/secondary split available. There are other grants that support the schools budget, these are not included in the provided DSG figures. The figures are for all funded pupils aged three to 15.</p>

This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DFES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.  <sup>(3)</sup> The school based expenditure calculation for 2005-06 is broadly similar to the calculation in 1997-98. However, 1997-98 includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses whereas only the schools element of these categories is included in 2005-06. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 onwards and hence would be excluded from the 2005-06 school based expenditure figures, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.  <sup>(4)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for the 1999-2000 financial year. Comparable figures for school based expenditure in local authority maintained nursery schools are not available from 2002-03 onwards and consequently direct comparisons should not be made between the pre-primary and primary figures and total (including pre-primary) figures for 1997-98 and 2005-06.  <sup>(5)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is not available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under fives funded by the authority and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.  <sup>(6)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.  <sup>(7)</sup> Figures for 1999-2000 onwards reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.  <sup>(8)</sup><i> </i>Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</td> </tr>

EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>

As the DSG is just a mechanism for distributing funding there is not a primary/secondary split available. There are other grants that support the schools budget, these are not included in the provided DSG figures. The figures are for all funded pupils aged 3-15.</p>

	<p pid="c.1402W.2/1">Funding for local authorities within the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) includes an element for deprivation. In 2007-08 the notional amount available to local authorities to distribute to schools from the DSG and grants totals &pound;3,808 million, with the amounts given to individual local authorities as part of the DSG provided in the attached annex. (This amounts to &pound;2,730 million and excludes the additional grants to local authorities which do not currently have the deprivation element separately identified). It is not possible at present to say how much is passed on by local authorities to schools on the basis of deprivation. However, over the summer and early autumn of 2007 the Government Offices Children's Services Advisors are to discuss with their local authorities how much funding each authority is passing on to schools on the basis of deprivation and how this can be improved where necessary. As part of the process, Department officials will be collecting baseline information regarding the distribution in 2007-08 in order that change can be tracked in future years. Guidance to authorities is to be published during August 2007.</p>

One pupil was killed with a weapon on school premises in the past 10 years (in a community secondary school, with a knife), and no members of staff. Neither this Department nor the Home Office collects any other relevant data. In the main, schools are very safe places: most pupils never carry a knife in school. Schools can screen for weapons if they wish, and have a statutory power to search pupils they suspect of carrying one. Safer School Partnerships, programmes to improve behaviour, curriculum opportunities for learning about responsibility, conflict, and safety, and other DCSF programmes for young people and parenting can also help.</p>

We have stretching targets in all these areas and will be introducing legislation to make participation in education or training compulsory up to the age of 18.

I would like to draw particular attention to challenge and support through the secondary National Strategy; of swift and targeted intervention to tackle school failure; more effective use of data by schools and local authorities, helping to track and monitor the progress of pupils; and a system within which schools and local authorities are setting ambitious targets for their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="c.1413W.5/3">Government policy is to foster more sixth-form colleges; they do an outstanding job and are generally popular with students and parents. The same is true of larger school sixth forms, formed either by an individual school or a consortium. To overcome England's unacceptably low education participation rate beyond GCSE, more provision will be required of both types, working in partnership with other local providers to provide a wide range of high quality opportunities for learners aged 14-19.</p>

	<p pid="c.1415W.0/2"><i> </i>The latest figures show that in 2005-06, there were 2,870 retirement awards made to teachers whose last known employment was in the leadership group in a maintained school in England. Of these, 500 (17 per cent.) were premature retirements, 1,210 (42 per cent.) received actuarially reduced benefits, 250 (9 per cent.) were ill-health retirements and the remaining 910 (32 per cent.) were age retirements. (Source: Database of Teacher Records and the Pensioner Statistical System (PENSTATS)). These figures were published in December 2006 and can be found at</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000681/addition6.xls">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000681/addition6.xls</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/4">For comparison, in January 2006 there were 56,800 full time equivalent teachers in the leadership group in maintained schools in England. (Source: 618G Annual Survey of Teachers in Service and Teacher Vacancies).</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/5">The leadership group encompasses head teachers, deputy heads and assistant heads.</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/6">Research commissioned by the Department and published in 2003 looked into the factors influencing teachers' decisions to leave the profession. It identified five main reasons: Workload (eg workload too heavy), New Challenge (eg attracted by another job), School (eg way school is run), Salary (eg offered higher salary elsewhere) and Personal Circumstances (eg opportunity to travel). Of these, workload was the most important factor and salary the least.</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/7">The research found that head teachers were less likely, and deputy heads more likely, than classroom teachers to cite workload as being of great importance in their decision to leave the profession.</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/8">Considering all teachers, the research found that most of those taking early retirement were doing so because they felt they had worked long enough or because they could afford to. Some wanted time to themselves, others to be with a partner who had retired. Some were prepared to leave without an immediate pension and were contemplating other employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/9">The research report is available on the Department's website at</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/10" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR430.pdf">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR430.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/11">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, new provisions have been introduced into the Teachers' Pension Scheme that will provide teachers with greater choice and flexibility over the way they manage the transition from work to retirement. The new provisions will allow teachers to wind down in the years leading up to retirement, for example by moving to part time working or taking a post with less responsibility, while protecting their pension rights. New phased retirement provisions have also been introduced that will enable teachers to remain in the workplace in a reduced capacity while at the same time drawing some of their pension benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.1415W.0/12">The Department has commissioned research into the impact these changes to the pension scheme may have on the retirement behaviour of teachers. The fieldwork for this study has already taken place and the project is due to report early in 2008. The research will help inform the key work that the National College of School Leadership is taking forward on succession planning to ensure that we have the right quantity and quality of school leaders both now and in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.1421W.6/2">In the 2006-07 financial year, English local authorities received &pound;65.8 million worth of capital grant from DEFRA for coast protection projects and &pound;5.8 million for flood defence projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.1421W.6/3">Local authorities also received funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government to support non-capital expenditure. In 2006-07, this involved:</p>
	<p pid="c.1421W.6/4" class="indent">&pound;14 million for direct local authority expenditure on coast protection;</p>
	<p pid="c.1421W.6/5" class="indent">&pound;21 million for direct local authority expenditure on flood risk management;</p>
	<p pid="c.1421W.6/6" class="indent">&pound;27 million in connection with levies paid by local authorities to internal drainage boards;</p>
	<p pid="c.1421W.6/7" class="indent">&pound;23 million for levies paid to the Environment Agency. These help to fund agency works that are of local importance but do not meet national prioritisation criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.1421W.6/8">Local authorities carry out works to manage flood risk on less critical watercourses and sea defences in some areas (flood defence) and are responsible for works to protect against coastal erosion (coast protection). However, the Environment Agency is the principal operating authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England from both rivers and the sea.</p>

	<p pid="c.1425W.0/1">The responsibility for carrying out such an assessment lies with the Mayor of London. This work was undertaken and published in July 2005, in the London Housing Capacity Study. This study provides a comprehensive technical analysis of London's potential for future housing growth. It was used to inform the Early Alterations to the London Plan (published December 2006) which provided a minimum target for housing provision in London from 2007-08 to 2016-17, of 30,500 additional homes per year. The study can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1425W.0/3">Almost all housing development in London takes place on brownfield land (97 per cent. in 2005). From the Mayor's study, the distribution of identified housing capacity in London for the period 2007-08 to 2016-17 is shown in the following table. About half of identified capacity for housing in London over the next 10 years is located in seven boroughs: Newham, Tower Hamlets, Greenwich, Barnet, Redbridge, Southwark and Brent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1429W.2/3" class="indent">The Department for Communities and Local Government has asked me to reply to your parliamentary question on guidance to local authorities in relation to the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.2/4" class="indent">The Audit Commission has not provided general guidance to local authorities on the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as this is primarily a matter for the Information Commissioner. The Commission's auditors and inspectors may, however, have had discussions with individual local authorities as part of their work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.2/5" class="indent">As part of a wider Audit Commission national study on &quot;Making better use of information to drive improvement in public services&quot;, the Audit Commission commissioned the Constitution Unit of University College London (UCL) to undertake research into Freedom of Information. This resulted in a report &quot;Improving access to and use of public sector information (Helping local authorities to develop good practice in the context of the Freedom of Information Act 2000)&quot;. This report is available in full on the Commission website at <a href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/localgovernment/foi/index.asp">http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/localgovernment/foi/index.asp</a>?</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.2/6" class="indent">In addition UCL has also published good practice recommendations for cost-effective compliance with the FOI Act.

	<p pid="c.1429W.5/1">The publication 'Land Use Change in England: Residential Development to 2006 (LUCS22)' shows that, on a provisional estimate, 9 per cent. of all dwellings in 2005 were built in flood risk areas. A more robust estimate for 2004 shows that 10 per cent. of all dwellings were built in flood risk areas during that year. This is in line with levels of existing development&mdash;flood risk areas account for about 12 per cent. of land in England, including parts of major cities, and around 10 per cent. of the population already live in flood risk areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.5/2">The definition of high flood risk areas and floodplain used by Communities and Local Government is the high risk zone mapped by the Environment Agency as being at a probability of flooding, excluding the presence of flood defences, of at least a one in one hundred years for river flooding and at least a one in two hundred years for coastal flooding. This is the basis for the definition of &quot;high risk areas&quot; in PPS25.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.5/3">Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development. The Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The Government published Planning Policy Statement (PPS25) in December 2006 to strengthen and clarify earlier policy on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.5/4">PPS25 ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable. In particular, more vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in high risk areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the need for the development outweighs the risk, and it will be safe, without increasing flood risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.1432W.0/1">Data are not available in the format requested. Of the total &pound;3.7 billion PFI credits allocated to this Department, &pound;2.7 billion will be used for the Housing PFI Programme: &pound;620 million has been allocated, or set aside, for schemes that will deliver additional social rented housing. Schemes currently on the programme are projected to provide over 3,000 new social rented homes by 2013.

Under these proposals, the regulator would:</p>
	<p pid="c.1436W.5/2" class="indent">(a) collect information from social landlords to allow it to intervene to prevent poor performance, and to allow tenants and others to compare the performance of social landlords at a local level</p>

	<p pid="c.1436W.5/4">Professor Cave recommended that the reformed regulatory system should apply to all social housing, whether provided by local authorities, housing associations or other bodies, so that tenants could compare services across the social housing domain and expect the same level of minimum service standards. The Government have proposed immediately accepting the new system for housing associations, but is exploring in more detail how local authority and ALMO performance could be regulated.</p>

	<p pid="c.1441W.0/1">We consulted earlier this year on a new Planning Policy Statement (PPS) on planning and climate change. This sets out our proposals for how planning should contribute to reducing emissions, and make a full contribution to delivering the Government's Climate Change Programme and energy policies. This includes giving greater emphasis to local renewable sources for supplying the energy needs of new developments and looking favourably on proposals for renewable energy including the use of wind turbines.</p>
	<p pid="c.1441W.0/2">The draft PPS builds on our policies in PPS22 &quot;Renewable Energy&quot; which state that renewable energy developments should be capable of being accommodated throughout England in locations where the technology is viable, and environmental, economic, and social impacts can be addressed satisfactorily. PPS22 sets out the detailed considerations applicable to determining planning applications for renewable energy projects, including wind turbines. PPS22 is supported by a Companion Guide that provides practical advice for considering proposals for renewable energy.</p>

	<p pid="c.1446W.8/1">The following table illustrates the amount the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), excluding its Agencies and Executive NDPBs, has spent on hospitality in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1446W.8/2">Expenditure from the NIO's hospitality budgets includes general living costs for Ministers, and official visitors staying at Hillsborough Castle and Stormont House. In addition to its own use, the NIO permits a wide range of organisations to use the facilities at Hillsborough Castle for a variety of events. These organisations include; other NI Government Departments, the Prison Service, the Police Service, the armed services, and a variety of charitable organisations. Disaggregating the overall figures would only be possible at disproportionate cost. Customers using Hillsborough Castle and Stormont House are charged for the services they receive. The table also illustrates how the recoupment offsets the expenditure.</p>

(152205)</p>
	<p pid="c.1450W.12/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles employment statistics for local areas from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1450W.12/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of men and women, aged 16 and over, resident in the City of York constituency, who were in employment, for the 12 months ending in February for 1997 to 2004 from the local area LFS and for the 12 months ending in March for 2005 and 2006, from the APS. Corresponding headline employment rates, for persons of working age (males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59), are also provided. The working-age employment rates allow changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers. Table 2 shows corresponding data for the City of York Unitary Authority and Table 3 for Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>
	<p pid="c.1450W.12/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, for the City of York constituency and the City of York Unitary Authority, the sample sizes are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over the period.</p>

	<p pid="c.1458W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-26">26 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will estimate <i> (a)</i> direct and <i> (b)</i> indirect taxes as a percentage of gross income for all households by income decile. (152710).</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/4" class="indent">Estimates of household income and related taxes are provided in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2005/06 was published on the National Statistics website on 17th May 2007 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/5" class="indent">The table below shows the average direct and indirect tax paid by households in each income decile group as a percentage of gross household income. They have been calculated from the numbers appearing in Table 14 of the taxes and benefits analysis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/6" class="indent">Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits, all before tax. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes - these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/7" class="indent">Indirect taxes, when expressed as a proportion of gross income appears particularly high for the bottom income decile, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. Estimates of indirect taxes are estimated based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for the bottom income decile where average measured income is significantly lower than average expenditure. For these households, indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are not being met solely from current income, and so indirect taxes are very high when expressed as a proportion of gross income.</p>
	<p pid="c.1458W.0/8" class="indent">There are a number of plausible reasons why for some households, expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EPS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>

For this reason, ONS includes in its suicide statistics both those deaths from intentional self-harm, and those from 'injury or poisoning of undetermined intent.' The same cannot be assumed in deaths at ages under 15 and therefore deaths from injury or poisoning of undetermined intent are not included when examining suicide (intentional self-harm) in children. As there were no deaths in children aged under 13 with a suicide verdict for the period requested, the table shows the number of suicides in children aged 13 to 14, and the number of suicide or injury/poisoning of undetermined intent deaths in those aged 15 to 17 and 18 to 19.</p>

Friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Barry Gardiner) discussed illegal trade in tiger parts with the Chinese Vice Minister for Forestry in July 2006. We are aware of concerns over the organisation of the Chinese State Forestry Administration's International Workshop on Strategy for Tiger Conservation. We have noted that the International Tiger Coalition has proposed further discussions with the State Forestry Administration and would welcome such a move.</p>

However, the number of extensions that will apply to the UK will be significantly less than 50. We expect 13 extensions will not apply to the UK. Nine of these relate to Justice and Home Affairs (where we have secured an extension of our existing opt-in mechanism). Three relate to the euro (where our opt-out applies).

	<p pid="c.1471W.12/1">Any decision regarding the establishment of new provinces in Iraq is a matter for the democratically elected Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people themselves. We remain opposed to dividing the country or creating enclaves along ethnic or sectarian lines. Many cities and areas of Iraq, including in Ninawa province, have strongly mixed ethnic and religious communities. While creating enclaves may hold superficial appeal, in practice this would be difficult to arrange and carry a significant risk of worsening, not alleviating violence.</p>

The Misseriya tribe objected to the findings of the report, causing increased tension between it and Abyei's Dinka Ngok community. They are backed by the National Congress Party and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement respectively. The deadlock on the Commission's recommendations is unresolved but this need not delay the establishment of a civil administration in Abyei. While the parties deliberate, tensions remain and local people's access to basic services is restricted.

	<p pid="c.1483W.2/1">Since taking up his position my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice has had no discussions with the Secretary of State for Health on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="c.1483W.2/2">There were discussions at ministerial and official level between the Home Office and the Department of Health prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May 2007</phrase> and the creation of the Ministry of Justice. These discussions continued at official level once responsibility for prison policy transferred to the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1483W.2/3">HMP Kennet, which opened in June 2007, was converted from a former secure hospital. There are few unused mental health units in existence and it takes considerable time and investment to convert them meaning that building new capacity in existing prisons usually represents better value for money. Any spare mental health capacity is usually in beds within units, rather than whole units, and so is not suitable for redesignation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1483W.2/4">If an individual is serving a prison sentence and suffers from severe mental illness, they can only be transferred to detention in mental health secure accommodation if they meet the strict criteria of the Mental Health Act 1983. Detention in secure NHS facilities other than under the Mental Health Act 1983 would be unlawful.</p>

Current evidence suggests that the number of other asbestos-related lung cancer deaths is similar to the number of deaths due to mesothelioma. Therefore, since mesothelioma deaths account for the vast majority in the above tabled, the total number of deaths due to asbestos is likely to be approximately double that given above.</p>

	<p pid="c.1486W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1486W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether the Child Support Agency (CSA) has authority to make advance payments of arrears in cases where the arrears is due to error on the part of the CSA; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1486W.2/6" class="indent">An advance payment of maintenance is a discretionary lump sum payment of arrears made to a parent with care by the Agency before the money is collected from the non-resident parent. The criteria which must be met before the Agency can authorise payment are set out in the Advance Payments of Maintenance Guide, which can be found at http://intralink/2/csa/guides/apm_guide/apm_guide.htm.</p>
	<p pid="c.1486W.2/7" class="indent">Where there is a request for an advance payment of maintenance the Agency will thoroughly investigate the circumstances of a case to determine whether it is a valid request. Only those cases where maladministration is established and that satisfy all the pre-defined administrative criteria can be considered.</p>

	<p pid="c.1490W.2/2">Around 80,000 children could be lifted out of poverty by extending the &pound;10 disregard to existing old scheme cases, increasing the flat rate from &pound;5 per week to &pound;7 per week and increasing the proportion of parents with care who are in receipt of maintenance. These measures were outlined in the child maintenance White Paper 'A new system of child maintenance'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1490W.2/3">The level of the disregard has not yet been decided. In the regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the publication of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, we published a prudent estimate, based on the assumption of a &pound;20 disregard, that the reforms would lift an additional 100,000 children out of poverty. Clearly, a higher disregard would lead to a greater number of children being lifted out of poverty.</p>

	<p pid="c.1490W.8/4">In light of this we will not publish further names at this time whilst we would keep under consideration whether this policy has a role to play in the future. In the mean time the CSA will be focusing its expanded debt and enforcement team on a wider range of initiatives that are intended to help improve compliance. These methods include making more use of credit reference agencies and HMRC data and introducing more flexible payment methods.

	<p pid="c.1493W.6/4" class="indent">Option 2&mdash;change size of consultation distance and zones, based on hazard;</p>
	<p pid="c.1493W.6/5" class="indent">Option 3&mdash;change size of consultation distance (as option 2) and development sensitivity levels;</p>
	<p pid="c.1493W.6/6" class="indent">Option 4&mdash;change size of Consultation Distance informed by risk, and adopt new development proximity zone to give more restrictive advice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1493W.6/7">The consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="">22 May</phrase> and responses are being analysed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1493W.6/8">HSE had previously written in December 2006 to all planning authorities identified as having at least one similar installation to the Buncefield depot. This letter asked planning authorities, ahead of the CD's publication, not to progress pre-application discussions with developers about any proposal within 250 metres of the site boundary which would add to the number of people in the area, or any significant public use development up to 400 metres from the boundary.</p>

Therefore it is not possible to comment on individual cases. The Border and Immigration Agency must meet the legal requirements placed on Government Departments by the laws of confidence, article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Data Protection Act 1998. These laws ensure that those genuinely in need of protection can feel secure in telling us the nature of their claim.</p>

	<p pid="c.1510W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/2">Over the last six years the Identity and Passport Service has undertaken a range of initiatives to improve the prevention and detection of passport fraud. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/3" class="indent">Significantly increased security in the passport book through the development and issue from last year of the ePassport which incorporates an RF chip and other advanced physical security features.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/4" class="indent">From 2002 the creation of a database of around 750,000 infant death records to counter frauds using dead children's identities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/5" class="indent">The introduction of secure delivery of passports to customers from February 2004 resulting in an 80 per cent. reduction in losses of passports in the post.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/6" class="indent">From December 2003, improved arrangements for the reporting, recording and sharing of data on lost/stolen passports. This database of around 1 million records is now shared with UK border control and border control authorities worldwide via Interpol.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/7" class="indent">The establishment of fraud and intelligence units in each of its seven passport issuing offices with professional, accredited training for all investigators.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/8" class="indent">The introduction of the Passport Validation Service which enables approved government agencies to validate the status of a UK passport which has been presented to them as evidence of identity. The service is also available to organisations regulated by the Financial Services Authority that have to comply with the &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; statement of good practice requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/9">On an operational level, IPS are using intelligence received and data on known frauds to actively manage passport fraud identified after the issue of the passport. It is currently investigating some 2,000 cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/10">IPS work collaboratively with the Border and Immigration Agency on (BIA) matters relating to passport fraud and with the police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency on joint actions against those involved in passport fraud. The BIA's National Document Fraud Unit regularly provides training for IPS officers to assist them on detecting passport fraud, and works closely with IPS document experts to ensure the latest and most effective security measures are incorporated in UK passports. IPS and BIA exchange information and intelligence relating to document fraud and BIA accesses electronic records of issued, lost and stolen UK passports and notifies IPS when attempts are made to use UK passports fraudulently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/11">Going forward, IPS has developed a comprehensive counter fraud strategy to combat identity fraud in the passport issuing process. This strategy includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/12" class="indent">interviews for all first-time adult customers;</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/13" class="indent">checking biographical information to ensure that the identity claimed on the application form is real, living, and can be linked to the customer through cross checks against a range of public and private sector databases;</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/14" class="indent">the development of facial recognition systems to check applicant images against a database of images of suspected fraudsters;</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/15" class="indent">checking applicants against increasingly sophisticated internal watch files including the database of passports reported lost or stolen;</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/16" class="indent">strengthening its business processes for identity authentication, and training and support for passport examiners and specialist fraud units;</p>
	<p pid="c.1510W.8/17" class="indent">utilising intelligence on known fraud patterns and enhanced capability from information sharing arrangements to conduct searches of the IPS database of 50 million passport records to identify fraud committed in the past.</p>

	<p pid="c.1511W.3/1">The last comprehensive assessment of income poverty in Angola was the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (IDR) in 2001, which was carried out by the National Institution of Statistics, financed by the World Bank. This found that 68 per cent. of the population lived below the poverty line, and 26 per cent. in extreme poverty. In 2004, Angola's Ministry of Health stated that 30 to 40 per cent. of the population had access to primary health care. In 2005 the Ministry of Education reported a primary education net enrolment of 62 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1511W.3/2">Angola rates poorly on corruption indices, although it has shown some improvement in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1511W.3/3">DFID has a bilateral programme of &pound;3 million in 2007-08 for Angola. During this period, Angola will also benefit from other funding sources, including &pound;1.9 million for demining, over &pound;1 million from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, and major regional programmes on HIV/AIDS and reintegration of ex-combatants.</p>

	<p pid="c.1512W.2/1">DFID will provide &pound;1.8 million in the period from July 2005 to March 2008 to support Thai based non-governmental organisations to work with refugees, the majority of whom are Karen, and provide cross-border support to internally displaced people on the Thai-Burma border. The British Embassy in Bangkok regularly speaks to the Royal Thai Government on issues affecting Burmese refugees in Thailand.</p>
	<p pid="c.1512W.2/2">DFID considers that both in-country and cross border support is important. It will continue to review the options for reaching displaced people, and the best balance between support from inside Burma and through cross-border border groups and support to refugees. Decisions will take into account planned new work by humanitarian experts from UN OCHA, which will provide better independent analysis of the needs of displaced people, a clearer picture of what other donors are doing, and a better assessment of where there are gaps.</p>

Both mechanisms have funding available and are awaiting appeals to be submitted to them by relief agencies involved in the flood response. DFID is working with the UN to ensure that these appeals will be promptly considered and, where approved, quickly processed.

This will enable farmers to get on to the land and do what they can to rescue their crops. By notifying the Rural Payments Agency, they are able to use set-aside land for grazing and foraging, unless the agency says there is a difficulty, in recognition of the fact that the land they would otherwise use is currently underwater.</p>
	<p pid="c.1524W.5/3">Compensation will not be available for farmers who have lost crops as a result of the recent flooding. Farmers who have taken out insurance for such damage should, of course, make a claim against their policy. We have great sympathy for those who are uninsured but there is no general right to compensation, since that would undermine the decision of those who did take out insurance and in the longer term undermine the competitive insurance market in this area that the UK currently benefits from. The Government are keen to help farmers manage risk more thoroughly themselves as part of establishing a more market focused farm industry.</p>

	<p pid="c.1528W.8/1">Methods to control grey squirrels are well known and have been published as Best Practice Guidance by the Forestry Commission (FC). The methods advocated are usually effective in reducing populations if used at sufficient intensity, and where there is a high level of support for control by landowners and the public. This has been demonstrated by the successful 10 year project to control grey squirrels on Anglesey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1528W.8/2">Alternative non-lethal methods to control wild populations of animals are being investigated, such as the use of immuno-contraception vaccines. The FC and DEFRA are collaborating on the application of this method for grey squirrel control with partnership funding from DEFRA, FC and Scottish Natural Heritage. However, it is likely that immuno-contraception will not, at least in the short to medium term, be a viable option for grey squirrels. Even if a suitable vaccine is found, there will still be a challenge to establish how to deliver it to grey squirrels without affecting other wildlife, especially the red squirrel.</p>

	<p pid="c.1535W.3/1">A Severn Barrage scheme could make a major contribution towards the supply of renewable electricity, potentially delivering up to 5 per cent. of the UK's electricity needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1535W.3/2">However, construction of a barrage would have a major impact on the unique hyper-tidal nature of the estuary. Some areas of saltmarsh as well as intertidal mudflats and sandflats at the banks of the Severn would be lost. Wildlife, including waders and wildfowl, and migratory fish stocks such as salmon and sea trout would be affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.1535W.3/3">The construction of a barrage would also have an impact on local flood management plans. The precise implications of a barrage scheme would depend on its location, the detail of its operating regimes and, in particular, the extent to which tidal water was permitted to enter the Severn.</p>
	<p pid="c.1535W.3/4">A major study on tidal power in the UK, led by the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), is currently under way. Part of the study is looking at the consequences of building a barrage across the Severn estuary and the social, environmental and economic impacts involved, including the implications for flood management. We will carefully consider the results of this work, which should be available at the end of September, before any decisions are taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1536W.0/2">The paper includes indicative targets and eco-design standards for showers which are sold and used in the UK. The MTP work indicates that if no new policy actions are taken, and current underlying trends continue, water consumption by showers is expected to rise by 48 per cent. by 2020 compared to the 2006 baseline. The policy actions proposed in the document show how this projected increase can be constrained.</p>

	<p pid="c.1547W.0/1">Sport England is working closely with those areas badly affected and has made an initial assessment of the recent flooding affecting public and community sporting facilities in the regions of Yorkshire, East Midlands and West Midlands. Initial assessments show that there is not a wide-scale problem affecting sporting facilities in Yorkshire but that some individual facilities in the worst affected areas are badly damaged. It is still too early to assess the extent of damage from flooding in the Midlands but Sport England's regional offices are monitoring the situation and will be able to make a fuller assessment when it becomes possible to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.1550W.2/1">The cost of introducing smartcards will depend on local circumstance and will vary from authority to authority. The Department commissioned independent Consultants, Deloitte, to produce an estimate of the indicative costs of all stages of introducing a national concessionary bus pass for older and disabled people in England. Their report was received in January 2007, and estimated that the cost, per smart card, would be between &pound;2.64 and &pound;3.59.</p>
	<p pid="c.1550W.2/2">The report drew upon a number of sources. Several regional and local authorities have already implemented smart card travel schemes while many more are actively planning to, and members of several such authorities were interviewed. In addition, a number of representatives from key suppliers and from transport operating companies were also approached for information for the report.</p>

It introduced a system of continuous registration (CR) in January 2004 to enforce VED direct from the computer record. In addition, DVLA let a new contract to wheelclamp unlicensed vehicles in May 2006. In the 12 months since then 100,442 vehicles were clamped and impounded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1554W.0/8">The Road Safety Act 2006 gives the Government powers to introduce a system of continuous insurance enforcement. The scheme will provide a new fixed penalty for people who ignore official reminders that their insurance has expired. This will apply to vehicles that are not declared as being off the road through a Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN) and are not insured. Continuing offenders risk having their vehicle seized and destroyed. This is expected to begin in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1561W.2/1">The Department for Transport does not have health expertise but relies on the advice of the Department for Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP). COMEAP estimated that in 1996<sup>(1)</sup> airborne particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (the two main road traffic pollutants) resulted in 19,200 hospital admissions. More recently concentrations of particulate matter in 2005 were estimated to reduce average life expectancy by eight months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1561W.2/2">It is not possible to separate the health impacts of specific vehicle types from other sources. However, in 2001 road traffic accounted for 55-60 per cent. of particulate matter and 85-90 per cent. of nitrogen dioxide at roadside, and 20-25 per cent. of particulate matter and 65-70 per cent. of nitrogen dioxide at background locations, in London (the worst case location). In this same year heavy goods vehicles were responsible for 13 per cent. and 17 per cent. of urban road traffic emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.1561W.2/3">The Department is committed to reducing road transport emissions. The most effective mechanism for this is via new vehicle emissions standards, often known as 'Euro' standards. These have already brought about substantial reductions in emissions, however further reductions are required if we are to meet our air quality objectives. I am pleased to report that new standards ('Euro 5' and 'Euro 6') which will give major reductions in light duty vehicle emissions were adopted by the European Council in May 2007. We are also expecting a proposal from the European Commission late this year to further tighten heavy goods vehicle emissions requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1561W.2/4">For particulate matter, there is no known threshold below which there are no effects on health, this makes it impossible to identify a number of vehicle movements below which there are no health impacts. However, maps showing ambient concentrations of pollutants<sup>(2)</sup> on a one kilometre square basis relative to Air Quality targets are available from national emissions modelling. In addition the Highways Agency routinely assesses the impacts of trunk road projects on emissions and exceedences of air quality objectives.</p>

	<p pid="c.1575W.2/1">No separate assessment of Coventry has been undertaken but Coventry is a partner in the West Midlands Local Transport Plan (LTP), along with each of the metropolitan authorities and Centro. For the period of the first LTP (2001-06) performance for road safety was assessed as &quot;strong&quot;. The strategy for road safety for the second LTP (2006-11) was assessed as &quot;excellent&quot;. Both assessments were completed in December 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1575W.5/1">A new campaign to re-invigorate the UK Register was launched in February 2006 when the then Minister for Shipping (the hon. Member for South Thanet) held a reception for shipowners/operators at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich with the theme of &quot;Safety through partnership&quot;. In addition, a review of the MCA's Marketing Strategy was undertaken during the second half of 2006 and the recommendations from this are now being implemented.</p>
	<p pid="c.1575W.5/2">A measure of the success of this campaign is that at the end of March 2007 the number of merchant vessels on the UK Ship Register was 1,459, of which the gross tonnage was in excess of 13 million for the first time in 10 years. (If we include all sea-going vessels over 100 gross tonnes, as in the Department for Transport's published statistics, the number of vessels is over 1,900 and the gross tonnage over 14 million).</p>
	<p pid="c.1575W.5/3">The Government are currently engaged with social partners, considering joint proposals from the Chamber of Shipping, RMT and Nautilus UK for stimulating UK and EEA rating and officer training and employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1575W.5/4">Although recruitment is a matter for the shipping companies themselves, a dedicated industry body, the Merchant Navy Training Board (which includes representatives from industry, trade unions and the Government), actively promotes officer training, and the Department for Transport gives financial assistance to training providers through the Support for Maritime Training Scheme (SMarT), for the training of officers and ratings. The support available under SMarT at present amounts to roughly half of the cost of training provided by maritime colleges.</p>
	<p pid="c.1575W.5/5">Seafarer training is also a key element of the UK tonnage tax which imposes a minimum training obligation (MTO) on companies entering the scheme. This is to train one officer trainee per year for every 15 officer posts in the company's effective officer complement. The MTO is cumulative and covers each trainee for up to three years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1579W.0/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/2"><i> (a)</i> The safety of the transport of radioactive material is ensured by the use of appropriate packaging and is not dependent on the mode(s) of transport employed. The transport of radioactive material by all modes of transport is governed by the stringent internationally-agreed standards recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an agency appointed by the United Nations to oversee all aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic energy worldwide. During the period of over 40 years that the IAEA regulations have been in existence, there has been no instance of death or serious injury to persons, nor significant damage to the environment, from radiological effects caused during the transport of radioactive material worldwide by all modes of transport when properly packaged and transported in conformity with these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/3">The Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency, acting under contract to the Department for Transport, carries out periodic assessments of the radiological impact of the transport of radioactive material under normal and abnormal conditions. A list of recent reports can be found on the Department's website at the following location:</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/freight/dgt1/publications/notes/theradiologicalimpactofthetrl">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/freight/dgt1/publications/notes/theradiologicalimpactofthetrl</a> 178</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/5"><i> (b)</i> The security of the transport of radioactive material by road or rail is governed by the security measures introduced by The Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment (Amendment) Regulations 2005. These security requirements are based on international agreements. Measures include the need for operators to develop and have in place a detailed security plan which includes a written risk assessment of their operations where radioactive materials are stored in transit. All freight carried by air from UK airports is subject to the requirements of the DFT's National Aviation Security Programme to ensure that it is not being used to commit an act of violence against a civil aviation target, for example by containing an</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/6">improvised explosive device. Freight on incoming flights remains the responsibility of the country where that aircraft departed from and is similarly covered by a mixture of international regulation and best practice</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/7">The transport of material connected with the civil nuclear fuel cycle (nuclear material) is carried out in accordance with stringent security regulations&mdash;the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (as amended). These regulations are administered and enforced by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), which regulates the security of nuclear material in transit, by road, rail and sea (including globally, when nuclear material is carried on a UK flagged vessel).</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/8">The security of the transport of nuclear material was thoroughly reviewed following the events of September 11 2001, and is regularly reviewed in light of the prevailing threat. OCNS is satisfied that the measures in place to prevent theft or sabotage are adequately robust, and that in the event that a credible threat were detected, appropriate action would be taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.1579W.0/9">Under health and safety legislation it is the responsibility of the organisation carrying out any activity to carry out a risk assessment. In the specific case of activities involving radioactive material this is a requirement of the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (1999 No. 3232).</p>

	<p pid="c.1580W.5/1">Since undertaking joint responsibility for the Government's public service agreement on climate change in 2004, the Department for Transport has continued to develop policy to reduce the climate change impact of transport. Policies in this area can be summarised as action to:</p>
	<p pid="c.1580W.5/2" class="indent">improve the fuels that we in the UK consume (eg by reducing their fossil carbon content),</p>
	<p pid="c.1580W.5/3" class="indent">improve the vehicles we use, for example increasing their efficiency,</p>
	<p pid="c.1580W.5/4" class="indent">improve the way we travel and the choices we all make, for example encouraging use of more sustainable modes and smarter driving techniques, and</p>
	<p pid="c.1580W.5/5" class="indent">reduce the Department's own carbon footprint from its operations (as set out in our Sustainable Development Action Plan)</p>
	<p pid="c.1580W.5/6">Changes to the relative cost of private motoring compared to public transport costs are taken into account in the Department's transport modelling. Increases in public transport patronage are also forecast and policy decisions are made in the light of factors such as these.</p>
