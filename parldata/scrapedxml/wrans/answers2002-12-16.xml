	<p pid=".509W.5/2" class="indent">XIncrease value for money by making improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the key processes for delivering military capability. Year on year output efficiency gains of 2.5% mil be made each year from 2002&ndash;03 to 2005&ndash;06.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".509W.5/3">A wide range of initiatives is in hand to achieve this target, and to deliver business improvement generally across defence on a continuous basis. Key improvements include the following initiatives:</p>
	<p pid=".509W.5/4" class="indent">By <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, to reduce by an average of 6 per cent. the per capita cost of training a successful military recruit to the agreed standard.</p>

At present no satisfactory alternative material exists to achieve the level of penetration needed to defeat the most modern battle tanks. DU ammunition therefore currently remains our most operationally effective capability and the use of non-DU ammunition would significantly threaten operational success and would potentially lead to increased United Kingdom casualties.

	<p pid=".520W.0/1">The Type 23 Frigate was designed with the expectation of spending a high proportion of its operational time in the demanding and stressing environment of the North Atlantic. The nature of the threat has evolved with resultant changes to operational priorities and deployments, the consequence of which is that these ships spend less time in the North Atlantic. An opportunity has therefore arisen to extend the interval between major maintenance periods. Improved processes for the specification and management of equipment maintenance are also being introduced. The collective effect of these developments will be to increase the availability of Type 23 Frigate capability for operations.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.6/2">The recruited figure may seem high, but is necessary to meet the Royal Air Force's needs. Predictably, a number will drop out at an early stage, as they find they do not have the aptitude, do not enjoy the experience, fail the initial medical, or have difficulty meeting the concurrent demands of a difficult degree course and membership of a university air squadron.</p>
	<p pid=".520W.6/3">For those that remain, a commitment to join the Royal Air Force is nurtured and Squadron Commanders have instructions as to how to proceed, should they form the view that a student does not intend to apply to join the Royal Air Force.</p>

	<p pid=".522W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence is working towards a number of improvements in the way it processes proposals. We aim to increase engagement with the wind industry, for example, where minor adjustments to the siting of turbines may result in an objection being withdrawn. We will also provide more central guidance to those reviewing applications and publicise a help line for the industry. MOD is ready to engage with Regional Chambers as the latter move towards considering optimum sites for the siting of wind farms in the longer term when drawing up their regional energy strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".522W.2/2">MOD has also reviewed recently the scope for giving developers a clearer picture of the specific areas of the country where onshore windfarm proposals may cause problems. There remains an unavoidable requirement to examine all applications in some detail before decisions can be made on any likely detriment to defence interests.</p>

It would not be uncommon, for example, for one authority to charge #150 for a licence and another to charge #20,000 or more for the same permission.</p>
	<p pid=".526W.11/2">Under the proposed new regime, however, the cost of a premises licence would remain the same whether it solely covered the sale of alcohol or included any number of additional licensable activities, such as the provision of live music. The estimated fees in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the Licensing Bill were between #100 and #500 for an application for a premises licence with a subsequent annual charge of between #50 and #150. Fees would be set centrally by the Secretary of State in secondary legislation. The assessment estimates that the hospitality and leisure industry would save #1.97 billion over the first ten years that the new regime is in operation.</p>

It will also look at letters of support it receives for the project from the public, or further evidence which applicants are able to give it about the level of public support for their proposals. It also will take into account views of interested parties, particularly those who may be closely affected by a funding decision. However, this does not alter the consideration it must n give to each request for funding against the stated criteria, and against the specific issues outlined in the application pack. Letters of support received after a decision is reached are noted, but cannot affect a decision retrospectively.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.5/2">The Heritage Lottery Fund has an independent Reviews and Complains Committee Organisations which feel that their application for a grant has not been considered fairly or properly can ask for the Committee to review it. The Committee has reviewed 33 cases over the last five years, and asked the Board (or the Heritage Lottery Fund Committee that took the original decision) to look again at its decision on four occasions. On two occasions a decision was reversed. In the first instance, after careful reflection, the Board concluded that the application comprised a number of unique features of heritage merit which, in combination, warranted support. In the other case, the Committee drew attention to a misunderstanding of project costs and partnership funding which altered the level of grant requested by the applicant. This resulted in the then Committee for the English Regions concluding that the application now offered value for money and awarded a grant.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.8/1">The BBC has voluntarily committed itself to a 10 per cent. quota for independent production on its network sources. I welcome the following statement in which the BBC re-affirms its commitment to independent producers, and demonstrates that the BBC is giving further consideration to the scope of the services included in the quota, and the arrangements for reporting against it. The Government shall keep the position under review as the radio market develops. <i>BBC Radio and Independent Production</i></p>
	<p pid=".529W.8/2" class="indent">XThe BBC acknowledges the significant contribution independent producers have made to network radio output over the past 11 years. We remain fully committed to our voluntary pledge that 10 per cent. of eligible hours on our national analogue networks will be made by independents. We also wish publicly to emphasise that we will continue to view this 10 per cent. commitment as a floor not a ceiling. We believe that our behaviour over the past five years highlights this attitude and we will work to open up commissions, where appropriate to independent producers in order to develop the UK production sector.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.8/3" class="indent">In the past our 10 per cent. voluntary commitment has not applied to our national English language analogue radio services for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are looking at how we could develop a similar voluntary commitment to that which already exists for our analogue network services. We believe that we would be able to commit publicly to an appropriate level of commissioning from the independent sector across the English language services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In doing so we must take account of the existing market conditions in order to determine a realistic and sustainable level at which to set such a commitment. We also need to consider how we balance most effectively our ambition to support the development of the independent production sector in the nations in the context of our wider commitment to production in the Nations.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.8/4" class="indent">Given current levels of take-up of digital radio across the country we do not yet feel able to extend a commitment for a particular level of independent commissioning for our new digital services. However, it is our hope that as take-up of digital radio grows and these services mature, we will be able to invite independent producers to provide content for these services where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.8/5" class="indent">We intend to report fully on both the hours we commission from independent producers and our spend on independent production across our analogue radio networks in our annual review.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.8/6" class="indent">We hope that these commitments will act to strengthen the positive and constructive relationship with independent producers which we already enjoy.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".540W.2/2">The Department are carrying out a public attitude survey on renewable energy through the COI and this should be completed in the spring of next year. We also recently undertook a public consultation exercise as part of the preparatory work for the forthcoming Energy White Paper. This examined the public's priorities for energy policy, including the role of renewables and attitudes towards changes in gas and electricity prices. The finding from this exercise are published on the DTI website <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/developep/pubconrep.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/developep/pub con rep.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/3">In addition, DEFRA regularly undertakes surveys of public attitudes to the environment which include questions on people's awareness, concerns and knowledge of climate change.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/4">Most recently, the full results of the Xsurvey of public attitudes to quality of life and to the environment&mdash;2001&quot; were published in October on the DEFRA website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/statistics/pubatt/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/statistics/pubatt/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/5">The target under the Renewables Obligation of 10 per cent. of electricity being generated from renewable sources by 2010 will make an important contribution towards the UK meeting its Kyoto targets. Achievement of the 10 per cent. target by 2010 would represent an annual saving of 2.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Achieving this renewables target is expected to cost an additional 4.4 per cent. on average electricity prices in 2010 over actual 1999 prices.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.8/2">Proposals for closures under the programme will be determined by how many offices are close to each other in the area, the current and projected business volumes and whether individual sub-postmasters have indicated that they want to leave the network. Factors of high importance to customers will also be carefully considered. These include the proximity and convenience of access of other branches, public transport links, facilities for the disabled and the ability of other branches to absorb the work without detriment to service. Before any changes are made, a formal consultation process will be carried out in accordance with the Code of Practice on Post Office Closures, with local communities, interest groups, councillors and MPs. In every instance there will also be extensive consultation with the consumer body, Postwatch.</p>

Detailed implementation plans will now be prepared, with support from UNAMA and donor countries. The UK has already pledged to contribute #10 million from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool to the interim payment of army salaries for the newly trained force, provided the Afghan Government fulfils certain transparency and accountability criteria that the UK has set as a precondition for these payments.</p>

The events have emphasised to the Government of East Timor the need to work harder to deliver benefits equitably to the people of East Timor, and the need for continued training and development of the police service. Two Commissions have been established, one by Parliament and the second an independent Commission initiated by the Prime Minister, to investigate the causes of the riot, and the response of the police.

Seven countries have prepared proposals but these need to be rigorously reviewed by local donor groups, to ensure that they are coherent with each country's existing plans (including poverty reduction strategies and medium-term economic frameworks or their equivalent), and to confirm that countries have the capacity to absorb any additional finance.</p>

	<p pid=".558W.5/1">The problem in southern Africa is one of declining access to food. Poor people are becoming more and more vulnerable to food shortage, as successive harvest failures have eroded their savings and other assets and hence their ability to cope. HIV/AIDS and other disease burdens are compounding this problem. Inappropriate policies, serious governmance failures and a shortage of foreign exchange have contributed to a failure to come to grips with the poverty which lies at the root of this vulnerability. There have also been poor information flows and planning in relation to the short-term response to the humanitarian crisis.</p>
	<p pid=".558W.5/2">The problem of vulnerability is also extreme in Ethiopia&mdash;one of the poorest countries in the world ranking 168 out of 173 on the Human Development Index. Vast numbers of households lack the savings or other assets to cope with even minor shocks, let alone the significant reduction in harvest caused by rain failure in 2002. Government has rural development policies in place but capacity constraints are limiting impact. The systems for short-term response to humanitarian crises are relatively well-developed and function adequately.</p>

	<p pid=".559W.6/1">DFID has not made any direct use of focus group research since 2001. However within our work to raise awareness and understanding of development issues, we have funded a project with the BBC, which involved use of focus groups in the UK to analyse public understanding of international news stories. The results of this research havebeen published and widely disseminated. The work was carried out by Opinion Leader Research at a cost of #38,247.</p>
	<p pid=".559W.6/2">Also we do make frequent use of participatory poverty assessments (PPAs) in developing countries, a methodology which has challenged both traditional modes of poverty analysis and subsequent policy development. When implemented well PPAs allow policy makers a better understanding of how and why poverty occurs in particular contexts and the coping mechanisms adopted by the poor. Furthermore, PPAs provide a forum for the poor to voice their own demands for change in public service provision by reflecting on their own experiences in dealing with government services, their perspectives on the specific constraints they experience in trying to access services, and of the quality and relevance of those services.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.5/1">We are concerned at the continuing conflict in Cote d'lvoire and continue to work with others in the international community to support regional efforts to broker a viable peace agreement. Although precise figures are difficult to determine, large numbers of people, particularly among immigrant communities, but also Ivorian citizens and refugees, have been displaced due to the fighting. Most have found shelter in host communities or are in temporary camps. Several thousand migrant workers have returned to their countries of origin or crossed into neighbouring countries. At present, the west of the country seems worst affected due to on-going fighting between Government forces and new rebel groups, and the presence of large numbers of refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone, many of whom have been displaced. According to UN reports, prior to the crisis, there were a total of 72,000 refugees living in Cote d'lvoire.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.8/1">My Department's Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) carried out an assessment mission to Angola in July to determine the extent of the humanitarian crisis there. They found that according to mine clearance agencies, the number of mines in Angola is now considerably lower than the previously estimated 13 million. Nevertheless, Angola remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Earlier this month, the national coordinator of Angola's Inter-sectoral Commission for De-mining and Humanitarian Assistance (CNIDAH) estimated that Angola has about four to five million unexploded landmines. As many as 70,000 Angolans are believed to have lost limbs as a result of landmine explosions. Relief agencies in Angola also state that landmines continue to restrict the delivery of humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.8/2">My Department has allocated US$ 459,000 to UNDP for a project aimed at improving the effectiveness of mine action through strengthened coordination and planning at the provincial level in Angola. We will also be contributing 19.7 per cent. of the Euro6 million which the EC has recently made available for mine action in Angola. This includes Euro5 million for a variety of mine clearance agencies.</p>

Adherence to procedures, and their effectiveness, is scrutinised internally by DFID's internal audit department.

	<p pid=".564W.6/1">The OECD-DAC data are drawn directly from the figures which the UK reports to the organisation each year. They are compiled on the basis of the international definitions agreed by all donors. The figures are often used to compare donor performance, but can be misleading if used out of context. For our own use, DFID has developed a more sophisticated commitment and reporting system that is better able to reflect the full extent of our commitments.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/2">OECD figures classify all expenditure according only to the primary sector intervention targets. As we move towards greater emphasis on crosscutting and multi-purpose interventions, the figures will represent an increasingly partial picture. Specifically excluded from the UK figures are:</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/3" class="indent">elements of budget support that are targeting health or education;</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/4" class="indent">block funding to NGOs;</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/5" class="indent">emergency assistance; and</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/6" class="indent">basic education or basic health expenditure of any programme whose primary sector was not basic health or basic education.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/7">Education or health expenditure is often presented as a proportion of the total bilateral programme, but it would be more appropriate to present it as a proportion of the allocated bilateral aid.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.6/8">In common with other donors, the sector statistics exclude any resources given to multilateral agencies, which frequently target the basic health or education sectors. It is also important to note that DAC basic health sector definition excludes family planning.</p>

	<p pid=".566W.2/1">Data is not held centrally in the format requested and to collate it would incur disproportionate costs. However, my Department supports a number of international sexual and reproductive health organisations that share our aim of eliminating poverty, including United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). All DFID funding in these areas is in support of the International Conference on Population and Development goal of universal access to reproductive health and is central to attainment of the millennium development goals (MDGs) specifically those related to maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS and child mortality. Without access to high quality reproductive health services and care, it is most unlikely that progress will be achieved in meeting the health MDGs. We will continue to support international organisations and NGOs which make an effective contribution to these goals, and of course the efforts of governments seeking to improve people's access to reproductive health services.</p>

	<p pid=".572W.0/2">The Institute of Education in the University of London was commissioned by the Department to investigate the impact of class size and pupil-adult ratios on educational attainment at Key Stage 1. The findings showed that there was a significant effect of class size on children's educational progress in reception for both literacy and maths. However, there was no clear statistical evidence of an effect of class size on progress in literacy and maths in Year 1 or Year 2.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/3">The Department has now commissioned the Institute of Education to continue this research up to Key Stage 2. The findings of this project are expected in 2004.Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) findings have also indicated that small class sizes are of benefit in the early years of primary education, when children are learning the basics.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/4">In September 2002 the number of five, six and seven year olds in infant classes of 31 or more stood at 10,600, in September 1998 the figure was 354,000. This means that under 1 per cent. of infants are in classes of over 30.</p>

The qualifications framework issued by the Quality Assurance Agency indicates that the term 'degree' should only be used for qualifications which meet the expectations laid down in its qualification descriptors.

	<p pid=".573W.3/1">We have introduced a range of initiatives to enable further education (FE) colleges to recruit and retain good staff. Eligible candidates can now benefit from golden hellos, the repayment of teachers' loans and training bursaries. FE colleges are now covered by the provisions of various equal opportunities related legislation, including the Race Relations Act. Their recruitment practices must meet legislative requirements and colleges should be working to ensure that their workforces are more representative of the communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.3/2">We will be working with the Learning and Skills Council and key partners from the FE sector to ensure that the recommendations of a report published by the Commission for Black Staff in Further Education relating to the recruitment, selection, retention and progression of black staff are implemented and evaluated by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November</phrase> the Secretary of State announced that the total funding for FE is set to rise by #1.2 billion between 2002&ndash;03 and 2005&ndash;06, a real terms increase of 19 per cent. From next year, colleges which have demonstrated their effectiveness will have three year funding deals allowing them to plan on a longer-term basis, with increases linked to performance. We will also consolidate the funds provided for the Teaching Pay Initiative into core funding. These measures should enable colleges to address structural pay issues and to use the additional resources to narrow substantially the pay gap with schools by 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.8/1">We are committed to encouraging young people from deprived backgrounds to aim higher, including entry to our top universities where they demonstrate the ability and potential. We want universities to hunt out the brightest students and to seek better and fairer ways of identifying talent. We have committed over #190 million for three years to the Excellence Challenge programme, which will raise the aspirations and attainment of young people in some of the most deprived areas of the country. All universities, including those in the Russell Group, are engaged with this programme and local excellence challenge partnerships all have links with at least one institution with demanding entry requirements. Through the Excellence Challenge, we have provided additional funding to universities who recruit fewer than 80 per cent. from the state sector, so that they reach out to more young people from deprived backgrounds. We will be publishing our 10-year vision for higher education in January. This will reflect our continued commitment to widening participation and excellence.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.2/2">My right hon. Friend has no current plans to re-examine supply teachers' conditions of service. Local education authorities pay supply teachers in accordance with the statutory arrangements for teachers, laid down in the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document. Private supply teacher agencies agree pay rates and terms of service with the teachers they supply. However, we have introduced a range of measures designed to lever up standards of supply teaching and the recruitment and management practices of agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.3/1">The training for adults over 19 is vital to both increased productivity and improved social inclusion. The priorities for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) were announced in the Grant Letter for 2003&ndash;04, released last <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-05">Thursday 5 December</phrase>. One of the four high level priorities (unchanged since the first remit letter in 2000) is Xincreasing demand for learning, and achievement of skills and qualifications by adults&quot;. The LSC will be assisted in meeting this priority by the generous budget increase that is included in this Grant Letter: resources will increase from #7.5 billion in 2002&ndash;03 to #8 billion in 2003&ndash;04, and rising again to #9.2 billion in 2005&ndash;06. This record level of investment will give the LSC the resources it needs to bring about radical and sustained improvements in adult skill levels.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.3/2">The Grant Letter provides more detail on the priorities for adult learning, including a challenging new target of reducing by at least 40 per cent. the number of adults without a level 2 qualification by 2010, and participation by the LSC in pooled budget pilots with Regional Development Agencies. We are working closely with the LSC on the Review of Funding of Adult Learning which will set out in more detail how to meet the adult skill needs. The outcome of the Review will form part of the Skills Strategy which will be published by my Department in June.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.3/3">Furthermore, the LSC's approach to adult training is set out in detail in its Workforce Development Strategy, released in November 2002. The development of the LSC strategy was co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit report XIn Demand (2): An Action Plan for Adult Skills in the 21st Century&quot;, and thus links into the wider Government strategy for adult skills.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.3/2">Cattle aged over 30 months may only be slaughtered for human consumption if they come from a low BSE-risk Beef Assurance Scheme herd, for which the age limit is 42 months. All such cattle must be slaughtered in a licensed abattoir, test negatively for BSE, and their meat held under Meat Hygiene Service supervision until the test result is obtained. After receipt of a negative BSE test result, the animal's vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia must be removed from the carcass, under Meat Hygiene Service supervision, at a licensed cutting plant that is separately licensed by the Food Standards Agency for this purpose. Following this, the meat may be supplied to the farmer for personal consumption or for consumption by any other person.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.3/3">The only exception permitted to this would be if an over 30 month animal was slaughtered personally by its owner for his or her own consumption, with there being no supply of the beef to any other person.</p>

We have supported the Department of Trade and Industry in establishing an independent group of experts to help develop guidance on how directors should assess whether an item is material to their company and would therefore have to be included in its OFR.

The nature and timing of any decision taken by the Government will depend on the status of each particular crop within the regulatory system. The Government has a voluntary agreement with the industry that GM crops will not be grown commercially in the UK at least until the Farm Scale Evaluation programme has been completed. No GM crops will be grown commercially in the UK until we are satisfied that they do not cause damage on the environment.</p>

	<p pid=".595W.3/1">The Bill that was published last week is intended to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on the contentious issue of hunting with hounds. It seeks to prevent cruelty while recognising those activities which are necessary to countryside management such as the protection of animals or crops. All activities have to satisfy the two tests of Xutility&quot; and cruelty (least suffering). The evidence on which decisions were taken include the report of the Burns inquiry and evidence provided to that inquiry, public hearings held in Portcullis House in September and submissions from a variety of organisations and individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.3/2">All the evidence has been published: the Burns report and related documents in 2000; 194 letters from organisations or individual hunts in response to the consultation letter of <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase>; complete verbatim transcripts of hearings on 9&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September 2002</phrase> in Portcullis House; videotapes of these hearings are also available, and papers of evidence submitted by the witnesses at those hearings.

	<p pid=".598W.2/1">Waste Strategy 2000 recognises that landfill will still have a role to play in any sustainable waste management system, but that it will be a much smaller role.</p>
	<p pid=".598W.2/2">Local authorities should take into account the landfill diversion targets required by the Landfill Directive, to reduce the landfilling of biodegradable waste to landfill across the United Kingdom by around two-thirds in line with the timetable set out in the directive (ie by 2016, should the UK decide not to take advantage of the final four year derogation) and the recycling and recovery targets set out in WS2000.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.2/4" class="indent">Deaths that may be due to drug poisoning are referred to the coroner, who has a duty to report on the cause of death on the best available evidence. As part of his investigations the coroner may order tests to be carried out to detect the presence of particular drugs or other toxins. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that these would separately identify whether the cocaine taken in the form of crack cocaine.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.2/5" class="indent">The Government recognises the concern that precise levels of drug-misuse deaths are not clearly identified due to a lack of available monitored information. As part of an Action Plan to Prevent Drug-related Deaths, #320,000 is being invested in better surveillance and monitoring systems which will allow increased analysis of information from coroners' reports and provide best practice guidance and training to coroners. It is hoped that this will improve the evidence provided by coroners on death certificates to better distinguish different types of drug-misuse deaths, where evidence other than toxicology is available.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.8/2">For an on-balance sheet PFI deal, the capital expenditure adds to public sector net borrowing, assuming that there are no off-setting reductions in other capital spending. For an off-balance sheet PFI contract, the capital expenditure does not affect public sector net borrowing. Professional accountants, in preparing the accounts of Government Departments, judge whether a PFI deal is on or off balance sheet. The National Audit Office, or a comparable audit body, audits these decisions.</p>

The size of the error is within the range of variability seen by changes made in the past when first published GVA estimates have been revised. We are taking the unusual step of publishing a revised series of estimates at NUTS-1, 2 and 3 level in early 2003. Therefore the regional GVA series being published in 2002 are being referred to as provisional, but because the size of the revisions is not anticipated to be outside of past user experiences they will continue to be made available, subject to being marked as provisional from now on.

	<p pid=".611W.0/1">Details of Partnerships UK's business strategy were outlined in the Information Memorandum issued prior to HM Treasury's capital raising exercise in early 2001. The company's progress measured against its business plan is covered in its latest Annual Report, a copy of which is also available from the House Library. Copies of the Information Memorandum and the Annual Report are both available from the House Library.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.0/2">Partnerships UK is a public-private partnership with the majority of its shares held by private sector institutions. As a minority shareholder, HM Treasury does not exercise control over the company. Partnerships UK's board is responsible for the overall management of PUK on behalf of its shareholders which include HM Treasury. HMT also appoints PUK's Advisory Council which monitors the delivery of PUK's public sector mission.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.0/3">The Treasury Taskforce as an arm of HM Treasury issued regular guidance to the public sector on the application of public-private partnerships. The taskforce was also responsible for PFI policy. Following the establishment of Partnerships UK, these roles have passed back to the Treasury and the Office of Government Commerce.</p>

Within this total the direct expenditure by the devolved administrations was #104 million by the Scottish Executive, #21 million by the National Assembly for Wales, and #32 million by the Northern Ireland departments. No overall figures are available to indicate the geographical breakdown of the institutions who received funding from these sources, but so as far as the breakdown of Science Budget spending is concerned, I refer the hon.

The Chancellor's fiscal measures are based on these and hence reflect the changes made to the National Accounts data.</p>

This allows a non-resident parent's maintenance assessment to be adjusted in cases where high contact costs are incurred. In the new scheme, this has been replaced by a system of Variations. These also take account of the cost of overnight accommodation where a return journey on the same day would be impractical.

Also from next April, a further #15 million will be available for the funeral payment scheme, increasing the amount allowed for unspecified funeral expenses from #600 to #700.

It is not possible to identify the specific costs within this overall budget.

	<p pid=".625W.10/2">Air quality in the UK is monitored through the national air quality monitoring networks, which comprise over 1,500 automatic and non-automatic monitoring sites. Many of these monitoring sites are situated in small towns. Historic and current levels of air pollution at all of these sites can be checked via the National Air Quality Information Archive at <a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk">www.airquality.co.uk</a> For some sites, this information is updated on an hourly basis. For others, the information is updated on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the type of site.</p>
	<p pid=".625W.10/3">In addition to this, local authorities carry out their own reviews and assessments of air quality in their areas, in order to identify any pollution hotspots. Several authorities have identified potentially elevated levels of air pollution in small towns, particularly alongside congested streets. In these cases, authorities are required to designate air quality management areas and to draw up action plans setting out what they intend to do to remedy the situation. Details of all the air quality management areas designated by local authorities to date, together with information on their action plans where available, can be found via the local air quality management section of the National Air Quality Information Archive (<a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk">www.airquality.co.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid=".633W.2/2">A survey of anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) monitoring forms indicated that the court process was taking on average 13 weeks. To improve the effectiveness of ASBOs and reduce delays, legislative changes have been made under the Police Reform Act 2002 and new guidance published. Courts may now make an interim order to protect the community from the start of the court process, and criminal courts may make orders on conviction, thereby avoiding the need for a separate court process and making better use of court time. In addition, orders may now also cover a wider area, and from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, county courts will be able to make orders when dealing with other civil action.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.2/3">We will continue to review implementation of these orders with a view to considering whether they can be further streamlined.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.2/1">We do not believe that it is necessary to require all asylum seekers to undergo a medical examination as a matter of policy although development of the new policy initiatives introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act will effectively introduce screening to all those who attend an induction centre.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.2/2">Once they are fully operational we intend that all new asylum applicants who go to an induction centre on arrival will undergo basic health screening. A pilot screening programme started at the Dover induction centre this summer. The evaluation of this pilot has not yet been completed. Immigration officers are obliged, under the terms of the immigration rules, to refer for medical examination anyone who mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for coming to the United Kingdom or who appears not to be in good physical or mental health. Furthermore those seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom for a period of more than six months should normally be referred.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.5/1">Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.5/2">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Teesside. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&ndash;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).</p>
	<p pid=".638W.5/3">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reporting having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three-fifths of all the illegal income reported.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.5/4">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one of more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.</p>

It must focus on either fathering and/or parenting teenagers as funded in the first or second Family Support Grant rounds (1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;2001). #440,000 has been allocated.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/4">The third strand is for voluntary organisations for work with black and minority ethnic parents specifically to help them with their parenting skills. To be eligible the work must focus either on supporting refugee parents with their parenting and/or supporting parents who are struggling with parenting their teenagers. #385,000 has been allocated. In addition, up to #55,000 will be available to provide extra support to the newly funded organisations given that they are likely to be less experienced than those applying for the other two strands, and to enable shared learning.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/5">Each grant is worth up to #55,000 per annum for up to three years. This is a rise from the previous annual maximum of #50,000.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/6">The closing date for applications was <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-10">10 December</phrase>. These are still being processed but there are approximately 300 applications, with the majority applying under the first and third strands. Decisions will be announced no later than mid March 2003 and if it is possible to notify applicants any earlier this will be done.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/7">The Family Support Grant also give score funding to Parentline Plus for its helpline; to the National Family Parenting Institute and to Home Start.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/8">The balance is for continuation funding for those organisations funded from the previous two rounds.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.8/1">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office annual reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 2001&ndash;2002, is available in the Library. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/2">The impact of Home Office policies and actions is not normally examined by constituency and the statistics which the Department collects cannot be matched in the way requested although set out are examples relating to the Hornchurch constituency or the immediate locality, as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/3" class="indent">Hornchurch benefits from projects which cover the wider area of Havering. The Havering Drugs Action Team is receiving #566,000 this year from a combined Home Office and Department of Health fund to develop and extend local drug treatment services. These funds will rise to #924,000 by 2005&ndash;06. Separately the current XDon't Buy Crime&quot; campaign is raising awareness about purchasing stolen goods. This is part of the Home Office's XSafer Communities Initiative&quot; under which #72,565 has been allocated to Havering for 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/4" class="indent">One recent initiative specifically affected Hornchurch: a London Regional Transport close circuit television (CCTV) scheme called the XHewkeye Project&quot;, in which CCTV cameras and associated equipment provided coverage of a station car park. The project was a joint venture involving London Regional Transport, the British Transport Police and local partnerships. Forty-six other car parks in the London region also benefited from the scheme. The package is intended to reduce incidences of motor vehicle crime and the fear of crime for car park users and passengers.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/5">Essex was one of 27 police forces which successfully bid for funding for community support officers and in the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> the Metropolitan Police Force strength had increased by over 1,300 officers compared with the previous 12 months.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/6">More generally, all of the policies of the Home Office will impact on the residents of Hornchurch to a greater or lesser extent. For example:</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/7" class="indent">The level of Class A drug abuse by under 25-year-olds has stabilised and we are increasing the emphasis on treatment as a response to drug abuse generally;</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/8" class="indent">The interim target of 60 per cent. of all asylum applications being decided within two months has been met;</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/9" class="indent">Vehicle crime is down 8.8 per cent. from levels in 1998&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/10" class="indent">There have been no escapes by Category A prisoners since 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.8/11">Information on the Home Office and its policies is also published on its website <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

Member states urged the Commission to produce its overdue report on financial resources for repatriation, border management and migration projects. The Commission explained that the financial resources had to come from the current financial perspective, which required re-evaluation of existing commitments within the JHA and External Relations budgets, but that national expenditure would need to remain a significant source of funding.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/4">The Council adopted negotiating mandates for the Commission to pursue readmission agreements with Turkey, Albania, Algeria and China. The aim will be to agree arrangements with those countries for the return of their nationals who have entered the EU illegally. Over lunch, Ministers also discussed the application of the readmission provision in the Cotonou agreement. This would allow member states to approach African Caribbean and Pacific areas countries bilaterally to ask them to take back their nationals.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/5">The Council discussed the time limits to be applied for determining responsibility for an asylum claim in the regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third-country national (Dublin II). The presidency concluded that member states would have one week in which to accept or reject a compromise package comprising a time limit of one year for responsibility on the basis of illegal entry across the external frontier and five months for tolerated illegal presence in a member state. The Council agreed that the latter criterion should apply only to asylum seekers illegally present after the entry into force of the regulation. The Council also agreed to a minutes statement addressing the possible future inclusion in the regulation's scope of applicants for subsidiary protection.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/6">The Council held a brief discussion of Articles 1&ndash;19 of the Council directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection concerning the definition of a refugee and those entitled to subsidiary protection. However, two member states maintained reservations on the text.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/7">With the exception of one member state, Ministers agreed to amend Article 16 of the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in member states in line with a United Kingdom proposal allowing for the refusal of support to asylum seekers making late applications. The one other remaining reserve on the text was lifted following a change to Article 11 concerning access to labour markets.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/8">The Council also agreed a statement declaring the European Free Trade Areas and Accession States (from the date of signature of the Accession Treaties) to be safe third countries for the purposes of asylum.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/9">The Council adopted a Community programme on the return of third country nationals to source countries and a programme intended specifically to address returns to Afghanistan. The Council also took note of Council conclusions agreed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-18">18 November</phrase> concerning the integration of immigration policy into the Union's relations with third countries. Lord Filkin welcomed the conclusions as a positive first step but called for the monitoring of returns projects to ensure that they were effective.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/10">The Council agreed a package of provisions on child abduction for inclusion in the regulation concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility. These were based on retention of existing Hague Convention arrangements with additional rules where a non-return order has been issued under the 1980 Hague Convention on Child Abduction. In order to encourage other member states to accept the compromise, Baroness Scotland proposed the creation of a strict timetable to initiate custody proceedings in the home court following a non-return order.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/11">Consequently, member states were also able to agree the Council Decision authorising the member states, in the interest of the European Community, to sign the Convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/12">The Council agreed to revise the negotiating mandated for the draft agreement between the European Union and United States of America on judicial co-operation in criminal matters and on extradition.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/13">The Council discussed a presidency compromise package intended to address member states' outstanding reservations on the proposed offences in the Framework Decision combating racism and xenophobia. Lord Filkin, with four other member states, agreed that proposal struck the right balance between punishing racist and xenophobic acts and protecting freedom of expression. However, the remaining member states were divided in either expressing fundamental problems with the scope of the instrument or wanting to go substantially further, in particular in reducing the threshold for criminal liability.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/14">The presidency sought agreement to its compromise proposal regarding the abolition of the dual criminality requirement in the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. This would enable member states to maintain dual criminality for a transitional period of up to five years. Although this was acceptable to the majority of delegations, including the United Kingdom, five member states maintained reservations.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/15">Two member states maintained reservations on the proposed penalties for trafficking in small quantities of drugs in the Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/16">Two member states also maintained reservations on the scope of the offences of active and passive corruption in Article 2 of the Framework Decision on combating corruption in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/17">Under Any Other Business the presidency emphasised the importance of securing an agreement between Europol and the United States of America on the exchange of personal data. The Commission also asked the Council to consider its proposal for a Council Decision on financing certain activities carried out by Europol to fight terrorism. The latter point would be considered at the December JHA Council.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.0/3">We have encouraged the police and local education authorities to undertake truancy sweeps on a regular basis, based on an assessment of local truancy problems.

	<p pid=".652W.5/1">The primary goal of all treatment is abstinence while recognising that some drug misusers may require longer-term support to achieve this. Approaches, such as prescribing methadone or diamorphine as a substitute for illicit opiates, have proven benefits for certain individuals and for society, particularly in terms of stabilising the individual, and reducing injecting behaviour and criminal activity.</p>

Improving the basic health of drug misusers benefits them and the wider community. Programmes will focus on the key risks to health, reaching out on to the street and other places to target drug misusers in crisis.</p>

	<p pid=".654W.3/1">In order to introduce a VED scheme based on carbon dioxide CO2 emissions (in turn, based on information obtained during the EU Type Approval test) it was necessary to develop systems to enable emissions information to be held on the vehicle register at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). It was also necessary to allow time for motor manufacturers and dealers to make changes to their IT systems to accommodate the new system. Although CO2 information has been available for most new cars registered since 1997, it would have been major and very costly bureaucratic exercise to collect CO2 information retrospectively.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.3/2">The Chancellor of the Exchequer took these factors into account in setting <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase> as the date when the scheme should take effect. Whatever date the Chancellor had set, apparently identical vehicles registered either side of that date might have paid different VED rates.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.3/3">A further reason for choosing the date took into account the effect on the second hand car market. The March 2001 date coincided with the introduction of the XY&quot; registration prefix letter and accordingly would make for a clear indication of what vehicles were, and which were not taxed under the CO2 scheme. That was particularly important as we expect and intend that the scheme to have a strong impact on incentives in the second hand market.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.3/4">Since CO2 emissions data are not readily available for vehicles registered before <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase> these cars are taxed on the basis of their engine capacity as a rough indicator of CO2 emissions. There are now around 9 million cars in the lower band of the engine size scheme (set at under 1549 cc) benefiting from a rate of #105, a reduction of #55 per annum on the standard rate.</p>

	<p pid=".655W.5/1">Abandoning a motor vehicle is currently a criminal offence attracting a maximum penalty of a fine of #2,500, three months' imprisonment or both. When a vehicle is abandoned, the local authority that deals with it has the power to recover the cost of removing and disposing of the vehicle from the keeper.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.5/2">Local authorities can seek information about the keeper of the vehicle from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The DVLA has recently made a successful bid under the Invest to Save Programme to fund an electronic link to local authorities to enable them to seek that information more quickly and efficiently. That link is currently being rolled out to local authorities, following a successful pilot in Sussex.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.5/3">The 2002 Finance Act contained outline powers to establish a system of continuous registration, which will ensure that keepers of vehicles remain responsible for licensing that vehicle until such time that DVLA has been properly notified of its disposal. This will ensure that it is much more difficult for keepers of vehicles to evade their responsibilities to dispose of vehicles properly, or to evade meeting local authority costs when a vehicle is abandoned. We are currently considering how this legislation will be implemented and will make an announcement in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.11/1">Decisions on taxation are a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. As announced in his pre-Budget report, the Government will discuss with stakeholders the most effective economic instruments for ensuring that, where justified, the industry limits or reduces its contribution to climate change, local air quality and noise pollution. Any decision to tax fuel used for international aviation would be subject to international agreement under the Chicago Convention. And EU Directive 92/81/EEC, on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duty on mineral oils, prohibits levying duty on most aviation fuel.</p>

	<p pid=".662W.6/1">The Food Standards Agency advises me that the risk of prions being transferred to meat for consumption is currently estimated to be low. Specified risk material (SRM) controls cover those parts of animals considered most likely to harbour any transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) infectivity. The TSE regulations require that SRM neither enters the food chain nor comes into contact with any other animal material while in the slaughterhouse.</p>
	<p pid=".662W.6/2">Ongoing research underway includes investigation of different parts of a bovine animal beyond the currently defined SRM, and their response to an experimental challenge of BSE infected feed. This has not indicated to date that muscle tissue would itself become infected.</p>
	<p pid=".662W.6/3">The Agency is, in addition, undertaking research to evaluate the risk of prions being inadvertently transferred to meat at abattoirs, and possible ways through which risk can be reduced. This work in progress includes the examination of alternative cutting techniques for removal of spinal column. Results will be published once the work has been completed.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.0/1">Directive 2002/46/EC on Food Supplements was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-12">12 July 2002</phrase> and must be implemented into Member States' national legislation by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>. The Food Standards Agency is currently consulting on draft implementing Regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/2">In the short-term the EU food Supplements Directive is unlikely to have any effect upon employment, profit, the number of small firms or sales in the health food industry.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/3">In the longer-term, the impact of the directive will depend upon progress in adding vitamin and minerals and their sources to the lists of permitted nutrients in the Directive and upon developments in the setting of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency is arguing the case for these maximum limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments so that there is no unnecessary restriction on the range of products that can be marketed.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/4">We have received a substantial number of representations from the National Association of Health Stores, Consumers for Health Choice, Holland and Barrett and General Nutrition Centres about the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. The main thrust of the representations is to express strong opposition to, or serious concerns about, the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products and to express the view that the proposals would threaten viability, profits and jobs in the health food sector, particularly among independent stores. They fear that the Directive will lead to a substantial reduction in consumer choice and have expressed the view that the proposals are over-regulatory in terms of the scope of the Directive and the likely costs of meeting the various requirements. They indicate their belief that there is no evidence that products in question are unsafe or dangerous.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/5">Ministers have met representatives of the natural health specialist retail sector on a number of occasions. Most recently, my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (the Lord Hunt of Kingsheath) met a representative from the National Association of Health Stores on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-21">21 November</phrase> and representatives of Consumers for Health Choice, Holland and Barrett and General Nutrition Centres on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November</phrase>. He also attended a Consumers for Health Choice Parliamentary reception on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-04">4 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/6">The main regulatory burdens arising from the Directive, for example in relation to the cost of preparing dossiers and applying for registrations, would fall on manufacturers. At meetings with Ministers representatives from a wide range of United Kingdom trade associations representing manufacturers of herbal remedies and health foods have told us that that they believe the Directive will lead to greater consumer confidence and greater stability in the market and have requested that the Government should support the initiative while seeking to achieve maximum flexibility. The Herbal Forum which represents ten UK manufacturers' trade associations, covering the health food, herbal remedies, ethnic medicines and aromatherapy sectors wrote to my noble Friend on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-18">18 November</phrase> to support the case for appropriate regulation in order to ensure that the public is properly protected against inferior quality products which the current system can allow onto the market. The forum indicates that it appreciates the need for the Directive while identifying a number of areas of concern that it wishes to see addressed in European negotiations or in implementation at national level.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/7">The proposals remain under negotiation, and there are wide differences of view within the herbal sector about the possible impact of the Directive. It is therefore problematic to make reliable estimates of the kind requested in relation to the health food sector. However, our overall assessment remains that it will be possible for a very wide range of herbal remedies to be brought to the market under the Directive as currently drafted. We also share the view put to us by many people in the sector that the proposed systematic approach to standards of quality, safety and information are likely to enhance public confidence and the future prosperity of the sector. Moreover, if in negotiations we achieve the ability to extend the principle of simplified registration to an additional range of products which currently require a full marketing authorisation, in particular traditional herbal remedies with added nutrients, this is likely to lead to increased opportunities for both manufacturers and retailers and a significant expansion in consumer choice as compared with the current position in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/8">We intend to continue to engage positively in the ongoing European negotiations on the Directive, seeking to ensure the maximum flexibility, consistent with the protection of public health. In negotiations on the Directive, and in any subsequent implementation, we will also seek to contain the regulatory impact, and we welcome the stated intention of the Herbal Forum to work constructively and closely with the Medicines Control Agency to achieve this objective.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.0/9">At this stage of negotiations on the Directive it is not yet possible to make estimates of costs of registering products. The cost of testing finished products before release onto the market is a matter for the relevant licence holders and, if they choose to purchase the service from a third party, this is for negotiation between the user and supplier of such services.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.12/1">The Department of Health is currently taking approximately five months to process inter-country adoption applications received from local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies. This involves comprehensive checking of all the papers received to ensure that they are in the format required by the country of origin and that the various legalisation and authentication procedures have been correctly carried out. The Department process every case as quickly and efficiently as they are able so that all children can have a safe and smooth transition to their new life in the United Kingdom. This processing time has increased following a significant increase in the complexity of cases and UK adopters applying to new countries.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.12/2">In addition to processing applications, the Department also has responsibility for:</p>
	<p pid=".669W.12/3">providing information and assistance to prospective adopters and professionals in the social care field;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.12/4">on inter-country adoption procedures and how the relevant pieces of UK legislation on adoption should be applied in practice;</p>

	<p pid=".669W.12/6">handling a continuous stream of telephone inquiries and letters from adopters wanting to inquire about how their adoption application is progressing;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.12/7">general inquiries about both domestic and inter-country adoption; and</p>
	<p pid=".669W.12/8">providing urgent advice to entry clearance officers overseas and the Home Office about whether all the required documents are in place to be able to issue entry clearance to the UK, and on whether a court in the UK would be likely to make an adoption order after the family have returned.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.12/9">A number of initiatives are being put in place to improve processing times including: Saturday working to target outstanding cases; the recent recruitment of an additional caseworker; and a change in processing for Northern Ireland cases allowing them to be managed direct by the Department of Health and Social Services Public Safety, therefore cutting their overall processing time.</p>

	<p pid=".673W.5/2">Enforcement of the Genetically Modified and Novel Food (Labelling) (England) Regulations 2000 is a matter for the local authorities, with the penalty on conviction under these regulations being a fine not exceeding level five on the standard scale. Parallel arrangements apply in other of parts of the UK. Compliance checks are usually carried out as part of routine premises inspections and no specific costs are recorded for the enforcement of these regulations. There have been no prosecutions to date. No details of the actual costs incurred by the hospitality industry have been received in recent consultations, but the total cost to the catering industry was estimated at #1 to #2 million in the regulatory impact assessment for the Genetically Modified and Novel Food (Labelling) (England) Regulations 2000.</p>

However these side effects were more likely to occur in those with any degree of immuno-suppression or in pregnant women and their offspring. Eczema vaccinatum was a very serious side effect in those with active skin lesions at the time of the vaccination. Post vaccination encephalitis could also occur in anyone.</p>
