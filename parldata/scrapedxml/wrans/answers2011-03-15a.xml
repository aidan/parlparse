	<p pid="a.163W.3/1">I have regular discussions with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on a wide range of issues. The Government's priority is to deal with the deficit, and the end-year flexibility system has led to accumulated stocks of around &#163;20 billion across the United Kingdom which would further increase the deficit if they were spent. The Government have therefore committed to abolish this system and to replace it with a new system which will provide flexibility while strengthening spending control. However, in recognition of the unique situation of the devolved Administrations, the Government have allowed Scotland to carry forward &#163;130 million of agreed under spend from this year into next.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.5/3">Currently 42 businesses have been awarded contracts in Berkshire, with an estimated value of &#163; 17,456,470.35; of these, eight contracts were awarded to businesses in Reading with a value of &#163; 12,670,055.40 and four to businesses in the Reading West constituency valuing &#163;1,387,094.58. These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the value of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="a.175W.9/2">Good quality early education helps tackle disadvantage and improve children's life chances. We announced in the spending review that funding has been protected so that all three and four-year-olds will continue to receive 15 hours per week of free nursery education, and that this will be extended to every disadvantaged two-year-old from 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.175W.9/3">Fairness is at the heart of the Government's agenda. Local authorities have a statutory duty-under section 7 of the Childcare Act-to secure nursery places free of charge, effectively prohibiting top-up fees. This ensures that there are no barriers to accessing the benefits of nursery education for all children, but particularly the most disadvantaged. Parents are free to purchase additional hours and services outside of the hours for which providers receive funding from local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.175W.9/4">Many providers up and down the country are offering an excellent service to parents and their children within existing funding levels. The Government are listening to the views of early years providers and their representative bodies concerning funding issues. The Government are seeking to improve the efficiency with which funding is distributed to providers, through the Early Years Single Funding Formula (EYSFF) reforms, as well as reducing bureaucratic burdens on providers who deliver free nursery education. Many providers will also be benefiting from other support that local authorities provide for early learning and care. Providers will want to take into account this whole package of support before deciding whether delivering free places fits with their business model.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.5/1">The &#163;150 million of redirected funding will help increase the total funding in the national funding formula which addresses student deprivation to almost &#163;770 million in 2011/12; an increase of more than one-third from 2010/11. This funding will be allocated through the disadvantage uplift and Additional Learner Support elements of the funding formula. It is not possible at present to say which geographical areas, or how much each area, will receive of this deprivation funding as this will not be known until the funding allocations for 2011/12 are finalised and communicated to providers by the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.0/1">The deprivation pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals as recorded on the January 2011 school census, pupil referral unit census and alternative provision census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy, via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting, or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting. We aim to extend the coverage of the pupil premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for free school meals.</p>

Determining eligibility for families who do not have recourse to public funds is not currently feasible due to legal and cost barriers in accessing data concerning such families in a useable format.

	<p pid="a.180W.2/1">The coalition Government are committed to improving the quality and consistency of information for prospective university students. We want applicants to be able to easily understand what a course will cost, what it will contain and where it might lead. To ensure pupils make well-informed choices about their options at 18, they need access to impartial careers advice that is independent of any organisation with a vested interest and underpinned by objective information and data. That is why schools working in partnership with expert, independent careers advisers will be at the heart of our new arrangements for careers guidance. Both strong leadership and a work force of the highest calibre are needed to guarantee a consistent level of professional expertise. We are therefore working with the Careers Profession Alliance to establish common professional standards and a code of ethics and to ensure that careers qualifications include an appropriate focus on the essentials of careers guidance.</p>

These allocations have seen small increases for both the primary and secondary phases.

	<p pid="a.188W.2/2">Pressures in managing the population arise from a number of factors. These include the size of particular demographic sections of the prison population and capacity available to accommodate those segments, the geographic distribution of population between regions and NOMS ability to transfer prisoners to maximise the use of space, and whether there are any sudden local increases in population or losses of accommodation. As the total population approaches within approximately 1% of the prison estate's useable operational capacity, the risk of potentially requiring police cells under Operation Safeguard increases and more rigorous assessment of population pressures are required.</p>

Given the demanding settlement the department received we are continuing to finalise our savings plans for the remainder of the SR period, once we have completed this process we will look to provide firm business group allocations for the future years of the SR period-this is likely to include the overall funding envelope for probation.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.6/10" class="indent">Local Concentration-Local Concentration is the population weighted average of the ranks of a YOT's most deprived wards that contain exactly 10% of the YOT's population.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/11" class="indent">Average SOA Score-Population weighted average of the combined scores for the wards in a YOT.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/12" class="indent">Average SOA Rank-Population weighted average of the combined ranks for the wards in a YOT.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/13" class="indent">Number of Employment Deprived-The Employment Scale score is a count of the numbers of individuals experiencing employment deprivation.</p>

	<p pid="a.192W.6/15" class="indent">40% of the formula is based on the 10 to 17-year-old population.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/16" class="indent">10% is based on geographical size of the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.192W.6/17" class="italic"> For Welsh YOTs:</p>

	<p pid="a.193W.2/1">Youth offending teams (YOTs) are yet to be formally notified of their funding allocations from central Government for 2011-12. Government Departments are in the process of finalising their funding contributions to the Youth Justice Board. This is expected within the next 14 days after which the Youth Justice Board will send formal notification to each YOT and their local authority colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.193W.2/2">Throughout the last six months, the Youth Justice Board have kept YOTs informed on progress with funding negotiations and, in the absence of final confirmation, each YOT was recently sent an indicative amount of the likely allocation to assist in their planning for the forthcoming financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.2/1">The Department, its agencies and non-departmental bodies undertake many projects, many of which may have a procurement requirement. In the core Department, the agencies and non-departmental public bodies, most of these have no central record of all these projects and the related procurements and therefore no central record of all designated senior responsible owners. To compile such a list would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/2">Some areas have processes that do allow some collection of data on designated senior responsible owners where the value of the requirement is significant. An example is:</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/3" class="indent">Natural England appointed an SRO for the one procurement project identified over &#163;10 million. The SRO was an executive director and was appointed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-10">10 March 2009</phrase>. The contract was awarded on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-01">1 August 2010</phrase>. Natural England had no other projects over &#163;10 million during the reporting period. Natural England's project management procedures require that a role equivalent to an SRO is appointed for all projects and the seniority of the person fulfilling the role is determined by our financial scheme of delegation.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.2/4">The Department, its agencies and non-departmental bodies use formal project management techniques and processes to manage most of its projects and the assignment of a senior responsible owner, who may or may not be dedicated to the project, is determined by the estimated value, complexity and delivery requirements of the project. In all cases, projects have designated management to lead all requirements and where procurement is necessary, the skills of professional procurement staff in each of the areas will be sought and used as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.202W.5/1">We would prefer to see all animals stunned before slaughter. However, religious slaughter (slaughter without prior stunning) is currently allowed in the UK in recognition of the religious beliefs of Muslim and Jewish faiths. This is consistent with the European directive 93/119/EC which permits an exemption from the requirement to stun animals for methods of slaughter required by certain religious rites.</p>
	<p pid="a.202W.5/2">In the UK slaughter without prior stunning can only be undertaken in a slaughterhouse. Schedule 12 of the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 sets out the requirements in more detail, including conditions for restraint, handling, slaughter and minimum bleed-out times.</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.2/1">The Government encourage the highest standards of animal welfare at slaughter. Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing has been implemented by The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, as amended. These regulations govern animal welfare at slaughter and are designed specifically to prevent cruelty or poor practice in slaughterhouses.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.2/2">The regulations make it an offence to cause any animal avoidable excitement, pain or suffering at any time between its arrival at a slaughterhouse and when it is killed. In particular, animals must be stunned properly so that they are unconscious and unable to feel pain during the slaughter process unless the slaughter is carried out for meat for a religious purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.2/3">The regulations also require slaughterers to be licensed. The licensing process involves an assessment of competence by a veterinary surgeon to ensure that slaughterers can carry out their work effectively and competently.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.2/4">Council Regulation 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at killing was made on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-24">24 September 2009</phrase>. This regulation will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-01">1 January 2013</phrase> and will replace Directive 93/119/EC. The new regulation introduces a number of additional requirements including a requirement that all slaughterhouses (above a minimum size) will have to appoint a specific person responsible for animal welfare and ensure their staff are properly trained and certified. The regulation also permits the use of national rules to maintain existing welfare protection where that is better than the minimum standards set out in the regulation. There will be full consultation on the way regulation 1099/2009 is implemented.</p>

The Department received 309 responses to its Call For Evidence for the review, which included 101 from local authorities, 57 from a wide range of businesses and 53 from private individuals. Copies of the responses to the Call for Evidence will be publicly available in DEFRA's Information Resource Centre until July 2011. Nearly 400 comments were posted on DEFRA's online discussion forum by individuals discussing waste policy, with approximately 1,500 individuals completing a short online survey.</p>

Secondly, detailed monitoring, review and reporting around incidents of concern, the results of which are factored into judgments about whether or not to revoke extant licences and issue new ones. Thirdly, general monitoring on a continuous basis, with information received in-country being fed back to the export licensing and other relevant Departments in London.

	<p pid="a.212W.6/3">While organisational restructuring and reductions in military manpower are clearly linked it is incorrect to assume that because an organisation is rationalised the individuals in that organisation will be made redundant. When organisational change reduces the requirement for officers or soldiers, then the overall strength is reduced. Separate processes are used to determine how to effect that reduction and, therefore, which individuals will be affected. This means that the most appropriate individuals leave the service, not necessarily the ones who happen to be in an organisation at the time it is rationalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.11/2">The most recently published figures for net Ministry of Defence (MOD) research spending in &quot;UK Defence Statistics 2010&quot;, which included the research programme controlled by the chief scientific adviser (CSA) and other activity reported as &quot;research&quot; in the accounts across MOD are (inclusive of non-recoverable VAT at current prices):</p>

	<p pid="a.214W.11/11">MOD research expenditure statistics are designated National Statistics status and as such the release of the figure for 2009-10 and 2010-11 are embargoed until their publication by the Office for National Statistics in September 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, the organisation within the MOD charged with management and procurement of research for CS A, the largest part of the reported expenditure, recorded a net resource outturn of some &#163;466 million for 2009-10 and was allocated a budget of &#163;439 million for 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.214W.11/12">No final decisions have been taken in the current defence planning round (PR11) on the level of research funding for 2011-12 onwards. However, we expect the science and technology budget to rise slightly in cash terms over the comprehensive spending review period. A complete time series detailing MOD research expenditure is published in UK Defence Statistics (Table 1.8), a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.2/1">The aim of the Cross Government Working Group, which was convened following the immigration changes in 2009, was to ensure that ex-Gurkhas in Nepal were able to make an informed decision to come to the UK and if they did so, that there was an end-to-end process to make their settlement as smooth as possible. The Working Group consisted of the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the UK Border Agency, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Local Community and Government, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Cabinet Office, the Foreign Office and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The issues of pension and welfare payments were not examined by the Working Group. All ex-Gurkhas who settle in the UK are entitled to apply for the full range of state benefits, if they are unable to work. There are no plans to review this. The Working Group met three times, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-16">16 February 2010</phrase>, although most business on the key issues has been and continues to be conducted bilaterally between Government Departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.217W.12/2">In the air defence role Typhoon aircraft are held at readiness to defend UK airspace, including the Falkland Islands, and in the air to ground role Tornado GR4 provides a capable close air support, reconnaissance and offensive strike capability. They can support other contingent operations if required.</p>
	<p pid="a.217W.12/3">Tornado GR4 is capable of carrying a full array of strike and counter-insurgency weaponry, including a full range of precision guided bombs, Storm Shadow long range stand-off missile and the highly accurate dual-mode seeker Brimstone weapon. Since 2009 it has also provided the United Kingdom contribution to fast jet operations in Afghanistan. The RAPTOR reconnaissance pod is a highly discriminating sensor which provides an unparalleled combination of stand-off and resolution in a tactical system.</p>
	<p pid="a.217W.12/4">Typhoon deliveries are ongoing and it continues to build up both air defence and multirole capabilities. Our other air defence fighter, the Tornado F3, will be retired when the Typhoon takes over the remaining Quick Reaction Alert duties at the end of this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.217W.12/5">By around 2020 our fast jet fleet will be made up of two modern and highly capable multi-role combat aircraft, Typhoon and Joint Strike Fighter, which will provide the flexibility and strike-power to deal with a variety of new and existing threats in line with the adaptable posture set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review.</p>

A demonstration phase contract worth approximately &#163;500 million was signed in June 2010 for Scout and other early elements of the SV programme. No contract has been signed for the manufacture of Scout, and the remainder of the SV programme has not yet reached its main investment decision point.

	<p pid="a.224W.5/1">The big society is an approach and philosophy which is at the heart of the Government's reforms across all policy areas with the aim of localising power and opening up public services and encouraging social action. Each Department has a range of specific programmes which will contribute to growing the big society. These policies are co-ordinated across Government through meetings at official and ministerial level, including the Informal Ministerial Group on the Big Society and Localism, which shares ideas and supports progress on cross cutting-issues relating to the big society.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has been involved with the big society initiative since its launch in July 2010 with Ministers and Officials attending the inter-ministerial and director general meetings respectively. MOD personnel have also been actively involved in desk level discussion on big society and National Citizen Service initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/3">My ministerial colleagues and I are committed to leading the way to get more Defence professionals to use their skills through active involvement with charities and voluntary groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/4">For civil servants within the MOD, the Department has in place policy, rules and guidance on special leave that provide staff and their managers with a framework within which to support time off to engage in big society goals and volunteering activities. Those can include local Government work, magisterial duties and other unpaid voluntary public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/5">There are a number of initiatives already in place, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/6" class="italic"> Cadet Forces:</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/7" class="indent">The Ministry of Defence has four sponsored Cadet Forces: the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force, the Air Cadet Force and the Combined Cadet Force. They are among the UK's largest and most successful youth organisations, having a long history of preparing young people for all walks of life and encouraging an active involvement in local communities. There are currently 133,000 cadets and 25,000 adult volunteers across the cadet movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/8" class="italic"> Defence Youth Engagement Review:</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/9" class="indent">The MOD is currently conducting a comprehensive review of youth engagement with the aim of determining its youth engagement requirement and methods to deliver it. Interim findings are anticipated in mid 2011 and final recommendations by the end of 2011</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/10" class="italic"> The MOD Education Outreach Programme:</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/11" class="indent">A programme aimed at 'giving students a start'. The MOD undertakes this as a demonstration of commitment to our corporate social responsibility and a visible contribution to helping develop the skills of the next generation. The programme provides a tangible example of the volunteering ethos of the MOD staff, both military and civilian, and relies on over 30 mentors and supporters, all of whom are volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/12">Additionally in the south west, HMS Raleigh is assisting Torbay Youth Service with their National Citizen Service by providing a week's accommodation for two pilot programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/13">Across the civil service, Departments including the MOD recently communicated a policy encouraging staff to make full use of special leave provision in their particular Department to volunteer for the 2012 Olympics, as well as contributing their own time alongside any given by Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/14">MOD employees are able to contribute to charities by deduction from salary or pension. Regular articles in 'in house' magazines encourage staff to donate via payroll giving.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.5/15">To build on this further and to support the big society initiative, the MOD will continue to work alongside other Government Departments through the Civil Service Volunteering Group to communicate to all staff what opportunities will be available to them, and encourage their participation.</p>

	<p pid="a.243W.0/1">The assessment for personal independence payment is being designed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability. Its membership encompasses a wide variety of relevant expertise and reflects a broad range of experience in the needs of disabled people. As well as representatives from RADAR and Equality 2025, the group includes individuals from professions such as occupational therapy, psychiatry, physiotherapy, social work, general practice and community psychiatric nursing. This approach ensures that the initial development work is being undertaken within a holistic view of the impact of disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.243W.0/2">The assessment development group is currently undertaking the early design work on the assessment criteria. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. Once the broad principles are in place, we will work with the assessment group and disabled people and their organisations on the refinement and testing of the detail of the criteria. We know it is essential that the assessment accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is already considering. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's recent report on DLA reform, &quot;Who benefits?&quot;, and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design.</p>
	<p pid="a.243W.0/3">We are still considering the delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We recognise the importance of providing adequate training and guidance for assessors and of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. To ensure that we get this reform right, we will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

	<p pid="a.253W.2/1">The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) policy is to develop its staff who have a wide variety of different roles in the skills required to support a range of customers and to respect their individual needs, including those related to their health conditions. This approach ensures that they are equipped to deal with a diverse set of circumstances whilst treating customers as individuals. For this reason, there is no single set of procedures to be followed which solely focus on understanding and communicating with people with autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/2">The learning programme for Jobcentre Plus focuses on raising awareness of the customer's personal circumstances and also recognises that disabilities and health conditions can affect individuals in different ways and will change over time. Guidance is also available for Jobcentre Plus staff which includes background information on a number of conditions relating to hidden impairments such as: autistic spectrum conditions including asperger's syndrome; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; dyslexia and speech and language difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/3">Furthermore, Jobcentre Plus run a seminar to support staff better understand the implications of current disability/diversity legislation in relation to their job roles when working with disabled customers, colleagues and employers. The 'Raising the Game on Disability' seminar aims to dispel the many myths and misconceptions around the disability agenda in a safe and supportive environment as staff are encouraged to ask questions and share their personal experiences of disability. Part of the seminar includes a discussion about communication, language and etiquette including working with customers with mental ill health, autistic spectrum conditions and learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/4">Jobcentre Plus has also put in place a mental health co-ordinator in each district. Their role is to: improve and facilitate links between local mental health and employment services; identify the availability of local support that advisers may signpost customers to; provide a support role to advisers who are working with customers with mental health conditions, or learning difficulties; and influence local partners to consider whether the help currently available for those with mental health conditions or learning difficulties satisfies local needs and encourage them to address any gaps or shortfall in provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/5">Pension, Disability and Carers Service (PDCS) have specific learning provided by the Professionalism in Decision Making and Appeals (PIDMA) body. The course is Understanding Working Age and Child Customers which has a section on understanding the impact of a learning disability specifically covering autistic spectrum disorders. This course is for all appropriate disability living allowance and attendance allowance decision-making staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/6">The above learning is being modified and updated to reflect the newly widened responsibilities of the Local Service Customer Liaison Managers (CLMs) to deal with visits, where required, to all of the Department's &quot;vulnerable client groups&quot;. The new course is intended to build on that by providing learning more specifically tailored to visiting officers and as part of whole suite on new learning products for local service to be delivered from late autumn 2011 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/7">Since February 2010, DWP formed a National Hidden Impairment strategy group involving medical professionals and experts in the fields of hidden impairments; disability specific organisations such as the National Autistic Society; Autism Plus and Addept; and involving service users with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) conditions. The purpose of the group is to improve the customer service experience for individuals with these conditions. The group is currently producing a further series of guidance in the form of checklists to ensure that staff feel confident in their ability to anticipate appropriate reasonable adjustment solutions at relevant stages of the customer journey. These checklists have been written by medical experts and will be available by the end of March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.254W.2/1">The assessment is being developed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability, including disabled people. This group is currently undertaking the early design work on the assessment criteria. Once the broad principles are in place, we will work with the assessment group and disabled people and their organisations on the refinement and testing of the detail of the criteria. We know it is essential that it accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.2/2">We are still considering the most appropriate delivery model for the personal independence payment assessment and no decisions have yet been taken. We recognise the importance of providing adequate training and guidance for assessors and of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We agree with many of the points raised in the National Autistic Society's recent report on DLA reform &quot;Who benefits?&quot; and we are looking closely at how these recommendations can be incorporated into its design. We are keen to continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

	<p pid="a.255W.5/1">The claims process has already been simplified and pensioners can claim housing benefit and council tax benefit, alongside pension credit, in a single phone call without the need for a signed claim form. Calls to the 0800 claims number from a BT landline or from the six largest mobile phone networks are free.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.5/2">Work is ongoing to improve the state pension &quot;Invitation to Claim&quot; pack. This includes introducing a better structure to make it easier to use, simplifying the content and adding a tier of signposting to Directgov, pension leaflets and relevant partner organisations to help customers find any further information they may need. An interim solution was delivered in November 2010 and further changes are planned from August 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.5/3">In addition, a number of significant improvements are planned for pension credit new claim, changes and annual uprating letters. These are currently under development and are expected to be in use by May 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.5/4">Further changes are also being made to the information on Directgov with good results to date. Customer satisfaction is up by over 10 percentage points since the project started.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.5/5">State pension online provides customers living in the UK, who wish to use the internet, with a swift and convenient way of claiming their state pension via Directgov. Where possible the service will present them with their state pension award details in real time. This service is available 24 hours a day. Customers who do not wish to complete their claim in one go are able to save their claim and return to complete it later.</p>
	<p pid="a.255W.5/6">Additionally, later this year, the majority of Jobcentre Plus customers who are eligible for the state pension will automatically transfer from working age benefits to their state pension without the need for a claim. This service will reuse information already held about them by DWP and will provide a much more effective customer service to approximately 200,000 people every year.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.5/1">The additional state pension payable to a person contracted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) through a defined benefit (or salary-related) occupational pension scheme between 1978 and 1997 is reduced by a contracted-out deduction (COD) equal to the level of the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP), payable by the scheme at 60 for women and 65 for men (subject to the total deduction not being greater than the individual's notional additional state pension accrued between 1978 and 1997).</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/2">Each GMP is calculated in a broadly similar way to the additional state pension but based on earnings on which contracted-out national insurance contributions were paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/3">A person who contracted out of SERPS under a defined contribution (or money purchase) arrangement from 1988 onwards does not accrue a GMP as scheme benefits are dependent on investment returns and annuity rates. The additional state pension paid to such a person is reduced by an amount equivalent to the GMP that would have accrued had he or she been contracted out through a defined benefit scheme, although the actual pension paid may be higher or lower than the contracted-out deduction. However, calculating the COD in this way ensures that people are treated in the same way, regardless of how they were contracted out.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/4">GMPs, and therefore contracted-out deductions, accrued from 1988 onwards receive limited price indexation and so increase in most years. However, pensions or annuities bought from defined contribution contracted-out schemes since April 2006 do not have to provide for any indexation. Individuals can choose to buy a flat-rate annuity which will have a higher starting payment than an escalating annuity but not increase over time. This means that in these cases it would be possible for the COD to increase while the occupational pension remains the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/2">The Government are fully committed to supporting town centres. Town centres are at the heart of our communities and neighbourhoods and have an important role to play in the growth of local economies. Through our new approach to planning and regeneration we will provide residents and local authorities with local rewards and incentives to enable them to drive regeneration and growth that is right for their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/3">We are giving new powers and rights for local councils and communities to determine and influence what happens in their area, for example, through neighbourhood planning, local enterprise partnerships, the power of competence and community right to buy. We are increasing local control of public finance by de-ring fencing and enabling local pooling of budgets. We are offering powerful incentives for housing and business growth, through the new homes bonus and changes to the community infrastructure levy and we are considering options to enable councils to retain locally-raised business rates and to grant business rate discounts if they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.2/4">The &quot;town centre first&quot; policy will continue to be strongly expressed in national planning policy currently under review through the National Planning Policy Framework. The Government's firm intention in reviewing the policy is to make it more accessible and clearer. We will publish, and present to Parliament, the National Planning Policy Framework by April 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.265W.8/1">HMRC's random inquiry programme indicates that poor record keeping is a problem in around 40% of all small and medium enterprise cases (circa five million). Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development indicates that poor record keeping generally leads to an underassessment of tax even where there is an audit-type check into a return for the period covered by such records. On this basis, poor business record keeping is responsible for a tax loss in up to two million SME cases annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.265W.8/2">The loss of tax through poor record keeping, particularly in the current economic climate, cannot continue and HMRC is, therefore, determined to use the powers at its disposal to improve business record keeping and so reduce the loss to the Exchequer that stems from poor business records.</p>
	<p pid="a.265W.8/3">By carrying out tests on the business records, the HMRC officer may identify weaknesses and shortcomings in those records. When such weaknesses/shortcomings are identified they will be highlighted to, and discussed with, the customer and possible improvements may be identified. These checks will not impose a higher level of record keeping requirements than would be appropriate for the size and nature of the business. Identification of record keeping issues may reduce the future cost of compliance for business through issues being identified at an earlier stage with contemporaneous records being reviewed.</p>

This was an exploratory visit to look into opportunities to provide advice on strengthening labour relations between central and local Government, employers and trade unions in Colombia.

We share the Observer Mission's concern that the power of incumbency was exercised to such an extent as to compromise severely the level playing field between the competing candidates and political parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.284W.5/3">The Secretary of State has written to leaders of all local highway authorities setting out the conditions for this exceptional additional funding. For authorities that respond by <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-16">16 March 2011</phrase> confirming their acceptance of these conditions, we will inform them of their allocations shortly this date. As the damage caused by severe weather was widespread across the country, and in order to minimise administrative burdens for all concerned, we intend to distribute the funds formulaically based on the Department's existing highways maintenance capital funding formula which takes into account road length and condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.284W.5/4">The extra funding has been made possible because the Department for Transport is expected to deliver a saving on its budget for 2010-11, following tough decisions already taken, including additional efficiencies made this financial year. It remains the responsibility of local highway authorities to prioritise their resources and build in appropriate resilience as part of their overall maintenance programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.289W.8/1">Following natural disasters, many governments offer emergency service personnel as readily as the UK. We therefore do not find that we need to encourage other governments to respond, but we do try and encourage better co-ordination of those emergency service teams that offer assistance. The UK aims to co-ordinate with other European Union member states through the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), which acts as a focal point for the exchange of requests and offers of emergency service personnel. We also support the rapid deployment of humanitarian experts through providing funding and personnel to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination network (UNDAC). Experts from the UK Fire and Rescue Service also work with the United Nations International Search and Rescue Group (INSARAG), the UN co-ordination body on search and rescue.</p>

This achieved widespread coverage across national and regional media and online with the main aid review documents being downloaded over 24,000 times.

	<p pid="a.292W.0/2">Life cycle analysis conducted by Vestas suggests that the turbines of the type used in the Thanet wind farm will achieve energy payback within seven months, implying that over their lifetime they will produce 35 times more energy than used in manufacture and installation. This is consistent with the range of estimates in the literature on the performance of wind turbines in general. A 2006 note from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology estimated that offshore wind energy has one of the lowest carbon footprints of any low carbon technology at 5.25g CO2 equivalent/kWh.</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.5/7">However, other aspects of the scheme could also be revisited and stakeholders are welcome to make suggestions for changes to the scheme.

	<p pid="a.293W.5/8" class="indent">&quot;How your proposals would tackle the four barriers to the uptake of energy efficiency in large organisations (namely, insufficient financial drivers, uncertain reputational benefits of demonstrating leadership, split incentives between landlords and tenants and organisational inertia).</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.5/10" class="indent">How the energy efficiencies/emissions savings associated with your proposals could be verified/audited in a proportionate but effective manner.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.2/2">Local citizens advice bureaux receive funding from a variety of sources and mainly from the local authority in which they are located. They are all independent charities and the level of funding they are able to attract will determine the level of service they can provide and the number of people able to use the service. But our proposals to transfer the consumer information, advice, education and advocacy functions currently carried out by Consumer Direct, Consumer Focus and the Office of Fair Trading, to the national umbrella bodies should help take pressure off bureaux so they can concentrate on delivering face-to-face advice to those who most need it.

Funding will go with these functions but the details have yet to be fully worked through. BIS hope to go out to consultation on these proposals at the end of March.</p>

Further education and training organisations in England that deliver English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) are funded by the Skills Funding Agency, which is an agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. ESOL provision for individuals resident in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.303W.2/3">From August 2011, full Government funding will be provided for ESOL to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the Employment and Support Allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment We will also continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace as public funding should not be used to substitute employer investment in training. Increased freedoms and flexibilities for providers will allow them to respond to the needs of their communities and determine where their funding is prioritised.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-09">9 February</phrase> the Commission adopted a Decision on the safety requirements to be met by the revision to European standard BS EN 13120:2009 to address certain risks posed to children by internal blinds, corded window coverings and safety devices. We expect this to be published in the <i> Official Journal of the European Union</i> shortly. The UK has been instrumental in the European Standards Committee in ensuring that the revised standard covers all internal blinds and is robust regarding child safety. Work on this is progressing, and we hope to see a revised standard in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.9/1">The Department has not made any specific assessment of the need for co-ordination between local authorities, the national health service and social care services to ensure that services for people diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are fully integrated. However it has established a dedicated national work stream on improving the care of all people with long term conditions (including RA) within the Quality Innovation Productivity and Planning programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.9/2">It is currently the responsibility of primary care trusts (and general practitioner consortia in the future) as commissioners of healthcare services to ensure that their populations have access to the services that they require. Primary care professionals need to ensure the services that patients receive are co-ordinated, helping them to navigate the system and ensure they get the best care through shared decision making. The Health and Social Care Bill enables GP consortia to work collaboratively on commissioning. Commissioners will have greater scope to develop integrated care pathways where this makes sense, working with a range of local clinicians, and new health and well-being boards will promote integration across the NHS, social care and public health.</p>

	<p pid="a.315W.2/1">The Department, through strategic health authorities, has monitored the use and application of growth funds allocated to develop Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services as part of comprehensive spending review 2007. This has been supported by commissioning guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) aimed at ensuring that this investment has been used in addition to rather than substituting for related services. However, the Department does not hold this information centrally. Decisions about the range of services available to meet the needs of each area are the responsibility of local commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/2">A total of 3,660 additional therapists and psychological well-being practitioners have started or completed IAPT-funded training since October 2008. Nearly 491,000 people have been seen by IAPT services between October 2008 and December 2010, with more than 243,000 completing treatment and a recovery rate of around 40%. More than 18,000 of the people treated have come off sick pay and benefits, who would not otherwise have been able to.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/3">IAPT services are intended to complement and supplement a range of existing mental health services by providing primary and community based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) approved treatment to people with depression and anxiety disorders. Historically, around 85% of adults experiencing these conditions have received no national health service support and IAPT is making good progress in addressing this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/4">At the start of the programme, it was envisaged that IAPT services would be additional to any psychological therapy services already in place, but this is a matter for the local NHS to determine in the light of its assessment of local need. Commissioning guidance to PCTs has been issued to ensure IAPT is delivered as an additional service rather than a replacement for existing services.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/5">The IAPT programme exists to help the NHS put in place the evidence-based therapies approved by the NICE for treating depression and anxiety disorders. NICE approves cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling, couple therapy, interpersonal therapy (IPT) and brief dynamic therapy for mild to moderate depression; CBT and IPT for moderate to severe depression; and CBT for all anxiety disorders.</p>

This sets out a framework for supporting the carers of both adults and ill and disabled children. As part of this &#163;6 million of new funding has been made available to train general practitioners to identify and support carers and an additional &#163;400 million has been announced to proved breaks for all carers, including carers of ill and disabled children.</p>

This outlines the ambition to provide ongoing respite care and short breaks for children to help families cope with their day-to-day caring responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.319W.2/1">The Government recognise the dangers posed by diversion of controlled drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) in the community. That is why methylphenidate is subject to strict conditions under schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.2/2">It is the responsibility of prescribers to ensure that any medication prescribed is sufficient to meet the clinical circumstances of individual patients and is being used appropriately. The situation should be kept under review to ensure that the patient is benefiting from the treatment.</p>
