	<p pid="c.239W.10/1">European Regulation 1107/2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, came fully into force in July 2008. It imposes a number of obligations on airlines with respect to the services they provide, including an obligation to carry passengers' medical equipment free of charge. However, there are no specific obligations to carry or provide oxygen in the cabin.</p>
	<p pid="c.239W.10/2">To help the air transport industry to comply with its obligations under the regulation, the Department for Transport has published an updated version of its code of practice 'Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility'. The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of gaseous (not liquid) oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered. Where air carriers wish to supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, the code acknowledges that it would be possible to make a charge for this service to cover the provision of the oxygen.</p>

	<p pid="c.241W.2/1">The Department is conducting research on the potential use of fatigue risk management systems with the object of developing guidance for their use by those who employ drivers. The research is expected to be completed in the first half of 2009. Early indications from the project suggest that such systems offer considerable potential as a more effective method of managing fatigue than compliance with hours of work limits alone. They encourage employers to identify fatigue-related risk factors within their business and to consider the full range of potential contributors to fatigue, both work-related (e.g. work practices, shift patterns) and individual (e.g. lifestyle, medical conditions).</p>

This project, which concluded in 2005, included a workshop on Fatigue (Fatigue, Sleepiness and Reduced Alertness as Risk Factors in Driving) with a particular focus on obstructive sleep apnoea and other sleep disorders.

This advice can be obtained from the Royal Navy's UK Maritime Trade Operation based in Dubai. The shipping industry has also been informed of the Maritime Security Patrol Area (MPSA) established by the Combined Maritime Forces. The MPSA does not eliminate the risk of criminal activity and shipping has been warned to exercise extreme caution and vigilance.</p>

The Government are playing their full part by pressing for effective international action to address the issue by tackling the problem at its roots on land. The Government are very concerned by increasing numbers of piracy and armed robbery attacks in and around Somali waters and we have noted the expressed concerns from industry. We are working proactively with our EU, NATO and Coalition Task Force 150 partners to counter the menace.</p>

	<p pid="c.246W.0/1">The Ten Year Plan gave an indicative figure for congestion on inter-urban trunk roads which was formalised in the SR2002 PSA target: to reduce congestion on the inter-urban road network in England below 2000 levels by 2010. However, subsequently the Government set out the case for new congestion performance targets in The Future of Transport White Paper published in July 2004. A new target was set in SR2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.246W.0/2">The baseline for the SR2004 target was published in February 2006 using new sources of journey time data. Inter-urban journey time reliability performance has since been regularly published against this baseline. The latest provisional data show the current level of performance for the 10 per cent. slowest journeys, which is the PSA measure, to be around the SR2004 baseline level for the year August 2004 to July 2005. This is also the case for all journeys.</p>
	<p pid="c.246W.0/3">Differences in sources used and in measurement mean that it is not possible to produce a consistent series of data from 2000 and report on trunk road congestion in Ten Year Plan terms. Also, data are not readily available at regional level as the current measure is based on routes which extend outside regional boundaries.</p>

This funding was provided to support the development of Transport Innovation Fund packages that address local congestion problems combining demand management, including road pricing, with better public transport. We are awaiting the outcome of the work that has been carried out by Tyne and Wear's People in Motion partnership.</p>

	<p pid="c.253W.2/2">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is committed to better, smarter health and safety legislation. In December 2007 it published its second Simplification Plan<sup>(1)</sup>, which set out how it was reducing the administrative burden of health and safety regulation on businesses and making compliance easier, in particular for low risk, small and medium sized enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.2/3">Among the regulatory improvements detailed in the plan was the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007, which consolidated four sets of regulations, and improved the process for proving competency.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.2/4">HSE is also improving guidance on regulations to help businesses understand and comply. For example, it has produced 29 example risk assessments for different sectors, showing businesses that a risk assessment does not need to be complicated.</p>
	<p pid="c.253W.2/5">Finally, the Better Regulation Executive has carried out a review of the health and safety regulatory regime, particularly for lower risk small businesses<sup>(2)</sup>. This has made several recommendations for improvement. Of those addressed to HSE, some are already being addressed through HSE's simplification work. Others will be considered through the development and subsequent implementation of HSE's new strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.260W.5/2">Two of the intended effects of the local housing allowance are to promote financial independence and personal responsibility. Therefore payments are normally made direct to tenants so they have personal responsibility for paying their rent. However, we recognise that there will always be a small proportion of tenants who will struggle with this, so there are circumstances in which the local authority has the power to pay benefit direct to the landlord.</p>
	<p pid="c.260W.5/3">These are if the local authority either considers that the tenant is likely to have difficulty in relation to the management of their own affairs; for example, the tenant is known to have a learning disorder or a drug/alcohol problem that would mean they are likely to have difficulty handling a budget: or considers it improbable that the tenant will pay their rent; for example, the local authority is aware that the tenant has consistently failed to pay the rent on past occasions without good reason.</p>
	<p pid="c.260W.5/4">Additionally, in housing benefit generally, payment direct to the landlord is a statutory requirement if a tenant has built up rent arrears of eight weeks or more, or is having deductions from their income support or jobseeker's allowance to pay off rent arrears. If this occurs, the local authority has the discretion to continue paying direct to the landlord when the level of arrears drops to below eight weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.260W.5/5">We plan to review the LHA, which was rolled out nationally from April 2008, during the first two years of operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.261W.2/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking if he will make a statement on his plans for the reorganisation of Jobcentre Plus offices and processing centres in the South East of England; and if he will make a statement on the future of the Jobcentre Plus office at Sunley House, Aylesbury. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/5" class="indent">Since 2002 Jobcentre Plus has completed a national modernisation programme to improve levels of service to all our customers through new style Jobcentres, Contact Centres, Benefit Delivery Centres and the Internet. The roll out of Jobcentre Plus in the South East was completed with the opening of our new Portsmouth Jobcentre Plus office on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-24">24 September 2008</phrase>. The Jobcentre Plus network in the South East currently consists of 73 Jobcentres and 8 Benefit Delivery Centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/6" class="indent">Our customers expect to access our services like any other organisation, as easily, directly and flexibly as possible. We are, therefore, offering far more of our services, both to employers and individual customers, through our Contact Centre network and the Internet. Customers making a benefit claim or enquiry can call a 0800 number to provide claim details by phone, this is free to landline users, with a call back facility available for those using mobile phones. This reduces the need to call into a Jobcentre and increasingly our offices are used for booked appointments only. In addition, we are providing a more individual service for our most disadvantaged customers, delivered in partnership with the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/7" class="indent">Social Fund services to most of the region are provided by the Jobcentre Plus Benefit Delivery centre in Bowback House, Milton Keynes. The former Social Security Office Sunley House in Aylesbury has been used for some Social Fund work on a temporary basis until sufficient space became available in Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/8" class="indent">We have now acquired sufficient space in Bowback House, Milton Keynes to house the Sunley House Social Fund operations. The current planning assumption is that Social Fund work will migrate to Milton Keynes Benefit Delivery Centre by <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>. This will allow Jobcentre Plus to close Sunley House and realise a saving to its estate costs of approximately &pound;420,000 in 2009/10.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/9" class="indent">All Social Fund staff in Sunley House have been given the opportunity to redeploy to Milton Keynes Benefit Delivery Centre. A number of staff have already done so. Staff will also be able to apply for other Department for Work and Pensions vacancies at Aylesbury and Chesham Jobcentres as well as vacancies within HMRC in the Aylesbury area.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/10" class="indent">Services to Jobcentre Plus customers in Aylesbury will not be affected by the closure of Sunley House as Social Fund payments to Aylesbury customers will be made from the Jobcentre in Heron House which is just a few hundred yards away.</p>
	<p pid="c.261W.2/11" class="indent">I hope you find this information helpful. I have asked Paul Williams (Customer Services Director for the South East) to contact you to arrange a suitable time to discuss your concerns either by phone or face to face, whichever is more convenient for you. However, if you would like to contact Paul directly in the meantime his number is: 01483 446065.</p>

	<p pid="c.264W.6/21" class="indent">Clearance times for Maternity Allowance increased slightly this year over the summer months resulting in a backlog of 7,000 cases awaiting action. This was as a result of an increase in births leading to an increase in Maternity Allowance applications by a fifth. This increase also coincided with the centralisation of the administration of Maternity Allowance claims between December 2007 and August 2008 into four Benefit Delivery Centres covering the whole country and a temporary dip in productivity associated with retraining existing members of staff. The backlog has now been cleared and we have returned to our normal &quot;head of work&quot;.</p>

It should be noted however, that before benefit centralisation many staff working on other benefits often helped on Maternity Allowance and this work would not have been recorded on the system.

	<p pid="c.279W.6/2" class="indent">&quot;Today's announcement by the National People's Congress that there will not be universal suffrage in the 2012 Hong Kong elections will be a disappointment for all those who want to see Hong Kong move to full democracy as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.279W.6/4" class="indent">&quot;I remain of the view that both China and Hong Kong's interests will be best served by allowing Hong Kong to move to full democracy as soon as possible. The National People's Congress' statement clearly points towards universal suffrage for the Chief Executive election in 2017 and the legislative council thereafter.

	<p pid="c.283W.6/1">The UK has proposed on numerous occasions, both bilaterally and with EU partners, to the government of Uzbekistan that they establish an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan in May 2005. Most recently, Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials raised this issue with the Uzbek government during a visit to Tashkent in May 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.283W.6/2">The EU has held two rounds of EU-Uzbekistan experts' meetings on the Andijan events, where the Uzbek side has maintained that these events were a foreign-led conspiracy to exploit religious &quot;extremists&quot; and terrorism in order to effect a &quot;coloured revolution&quot;. The Uzbek authorities have consistently rejected calls for an independent, international enquiry.</p>

	<p pid="c.293W.11/1">Each Board of Inquiry's (BOI) provisional report is submitted to the relevant convening/reviewing authority for approval before the report is declared final. In considering the provisional report, the convening/reviewing authority may require the Board to undertake further work because fresh evidence has come to light, because some evidence available to the BOI has been omitted, or because some relevant aspect has not been covered adequately and therefore the BOI has not met its terms of reference. Following completion of further work a revised provisional report must be submitted to the convening/reviewing authority for further consideration. This process may be undertaken as often as necessary to ensure the BOI has met its terms of reference. Where further work is required, the convening/reviewing authority should give specific instructions in writing to the BOI. Where it is considered that the BOI has met its terms of reference and no further work is required, the convening/reviewing authority makes its comments on the report and declares the provisional report as the final report and it notifies the president of the BOI that the inquiry has concluded and that the Board is released from its duty. A copy of the final report is then made available to both the coroner and the next of kin if they wish to receive it.</p>
	<p pid="c.293W.11/2">Some coroners await the completion of the BOI report before they hold the inquest, although there is no requirement for any coroner to do so and, indeed, some choose not to. Where the coroner chooses to await the completion of a BOI before holding the inquest, the coroner is provided only with a copy of the final BOI report. Where a BOI is completed after the inquest is held there is no requirement to inform the coroner of its findings.</p>
	<p pid="c.293W.11/3">Where a BOI is held into the circumstances surrounding a death the MOD recognises that the bereaved families of Service personnel will have an interest in its conclusions and our policy is that we offer a personal briefing and a copy of the BOI report to the next of kin. Where the family wishes subsequently to question any aspect of the BOI they may do so in a number of ways: during the briefing given to them on the Board's findings, conclusions and recommendations; through their Visiting Officer; by contacting the relevant single Service authority using the details provided with their copy of the BOI report; through their Member of Parliament; or by contacting the Ministry of Defence in writing by letter or email using the Ministry of Defence website.</p>
	<p pid="c.293W.11/4">Should new information come to light after the completion of the final report which the convening authority judges to cast doubt on the conclusions of the BOI, a new inquiry may be convened to review the findings in light of the new information.</p>

	<p pid="c.296W.0/1">Information about the role of the Service Complaints Commissioner (SCC) is communicated through a number of means. Joint Service Publication 831 Service Complaints (Redress of Individual Grievance) sets out the policy and process for making and handling Service complaints, and includes a chapter on the role of the SCC. This is available on the Defence intranet and <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a> to all serving personnel. A booklet covering the main points of the complaints process, with a leaflet explaining the role of the SCC has been issued for distribution to all Service establishments. A team profile is under development on the Defence intranet to make information relating to Service complaints available electronically. This profile will also provide a link to the SCC's website. The SCC has visited establishments of all three Services, and continues to do so regularly, to meet serving personnel and the chain of command to raise awareness of her role.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/2">There is no standard tri-Service pre-recruitment pack and the three Services have different approaches to providing information to recruits about how to make complaints in confidence:</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/3" class="italic"> Navy</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/4">During Phase 1 training Royal Navy and Royal Marine Rating and Other Ranks recruits at each establishment are briefed on both equality and diversity related complaints and Service complaints generally.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/5" class="italic"> Army</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/6">All recruits and trainees receive briefings that inform them of the function of the complaints procedures and the various channels which are available to raise a complaint. These include: the chain of command, Women's Royal Voluntary Service, the Padre, the Unit Welfare Officer, a Medical Officer and the confidential Support Line.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/7">This is currently in the process of being reinforced by the inclusion of detail covering the role of the SCC in the &quot;Army Recruiting and Training Division Code of Conduct and Behaviour for Recruits,&quot; leaflet and the Recruiting Group publication, &quot;A Guide for Guardians and Parents&quot;. With the Commissioner's agreement, a paragraph outlining her role will be included in letters sent to parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/8" class="italic"> RAF</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/9">There are two training establishments for the RAF, Cranwell and Halton.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/10">At RAF Cranwell, the Officer and Aircrew Cadet Training Unit is responsible for conducting the initial training of all officers and non-commissioned aircrew.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/11">Since January 2008, all cadets at RAF Cranwell have been briefed during their first week of training on the role and contact details of the SCC.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.0/12">At RAF Halton, comprehensive measures are in place to ensure that new recruits are aware of the complaints procedures. These include two 45 minute briefings on the RAF's Equality and Diversity Policy, and the distribution of a booklet entitled &quot;Combating Bullying and Harassment in the Royal Air Force&quot; to all recruits. The issue is also addressed in the Station Commander's Supervisory Care Directive, which is mandatory reading by all instructors at RAF Halton and is available to all recruits.</p>

In order to provide this capability into the future, the best value for money option is to build a replacement uranium handling facility.

	<p pid="c.302W.8/2">The time taken to design and implement an effective encryption mechanism for other removable devices and media under the Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) (DII(F)) programme is driven by the need to ensure the designs themselves are robust and capable of countering known and projected threats to the Department's information assets as well as operating correctly when connected to the DII(F) core infrastructure. Devices and their encryption mechanisms must be thoroughly tested and accredited to meet national governmental security standards before they can be deployed.</p>

As each lease has ended, the last concluding in September 2008, MOD has taken ownership of the aircraft. In accordance with the contractual agreement I am withholding the in-year costs.

	<p pid="c.306W.5/1">NATO has come a long way in recognising the importance of expeditionary capabilities in dealing with the broad range of security threats the alliance is likely to face. It continues to make progress, but not as quickly as we&mdash;and others&mdash;would like. The alliance needs to do more to provide the capabilities it needs for current and future operations, such as strategic and intra-theatre lift and contributions to the NATO Response Force. The UK and other allies have sought to find innovative ways of developing such capabilities through initiatives to make more helicopters and strategic lift available for operations, but ultimately these capabilities depend on sufficient investment by allies in defence, and prioritisation on the capabilities the alliance needs most. NATO Defence Ministers met in London in September to inject more dynamism into this transformation process. NATO's agreement in Budapest the following month to increase targets for the deployability of allies' land forces is a welcome step in the right direction.</p>

The joint Government and FSA financial capability action plan, published in July, set out measures for supporting financial education through the Government's 'My Money' programme led by DCSF, which will help to embed financial capability into the curriculum, and the FSA's 'Learning Money Matters' programme. It also set out how financial education would be evaluated through a DCSF independent review and a further schools survey by the FSA.</p>

	<p pid="c.316W.0/1">When a petition for divorce is lodged at a court the court requires information to ascertain that there was a valid marriage between the parties, and the grounds on which a divorce is sought. The religious affiliation of the parties is not included on divorce documents. Hence it is not possible to provide any statistics that relate to the parties' religion.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/2">Marriages conducted in this country under Sharia law are not recognised in England and Wales unless they also comply with the provisions of the Marriage Acts. Therefore &quot;Sharia marriages&quot; are not a legal reality in this country and we cannot obtain statistics for them. We are aware that many Muslim couples undergo both a civil ceremony in a register office and a purely religious ceremony. The former is recognised but the latter is not. Increasing numbers of mosques are registered so that they can offer a joint civil and religious marriage ceremony. Section 55 of the Family Law Act 1986 allows parties to a marriage to apply for an order that their marriage is valid, or to allow &quot;divorced&quot; parties similarly to test the validity of their divorce. This provision is used rarely, and generally to test the validity of marriages contracted abroad and foreign divorces. A sharia marriage contracted in this country which does not comply with Marriage Act requirements would not be validated.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/3">&quot;Sharia divorces&quot; conducted in this country are also unrecognised by the legal system. The English courts do not approve divorces or annulments granted by any faith group, therefore no statistics are available for them. A sharia divorce dissolves the religious &quot;limb&quot; of a marriage but leaves the civil marriage intact. This must be dissolved by a civil divorce. If no civil marriage has taken place then no civil divorce is required.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/4">Consent orders differ widely according to what is required in each case. Therefore there is no standard form for a consent order. In a consent order relating to children the court can, among other things, make orders relating to contact, residence, a requirement that either parent do something or refrain from doing it, an order for expert reports or for contact activities or for review. In financial matters a court can deal with income, capital, pensions, assets and can, among others orders, make periodical payment, secured periodical payment, lump sum or property adjustment orders, pension sharing orders, and asset distribution orders.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/5">The only orders that can be made during an extant marriage are an order for validity of marriage, as described above, or an order for judicial separation, which has similar effects to divorce save that the parties are still regarded as married, albeit legally separated. This type of order is usually used by those with a religious objection to divorce. Neither of these orders is likely to be made by consent.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/6">Consent orders can be applied for following negotiations and an agreement reached by the parties directly, or with the help of lawyers, mediators, or a third party, which might be a Sharia council. Sharia councils operate under the statutory basis of the Arbitration Act 1996, established by the previous Government. The family court would be unable to tell whether an application for a consent order (whether within a divorce or in other proceedings) had been made as the result of negotiations conducted through a Sharia council, by the parties themselves, through mediation or by the intervention of any other third party. Applications for consent orders are generally filed by solicitors. In those circumstances the court can see whether the parties had the' benefit of legal advice. However, even if lawyers have represented the parties, the court will still check consent orders to ensure that they appear to be within the range of orders that could be made had the matter been adjudicated in court.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/7">There are many forms of alternative dispute resolution available to assist parties to reach an agreement in family cases, but whichever method the parties use; the principles applied by the court are the same. The court cannot simply 'rubber-stamp' an agreement in a family case, whatever the process by which the agreement has been reached, and judges can and do ask for further information where there is any doubt about the propriety of a proposed order.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/8">Any proposed consent order submitted to the court, whether the product of an agreement by the Sharia council or not, might be made by coercion and it is the function of the judiciary to question any order which appears unfair.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/9">An order which on its face involved an undue financial advantage to one party or set out arrangements for children which excluded care by or contact with one parent would be the sort of order which alerts a court to potential coercion and the need to ask for further information and, if appropriate, to refuse to make the order requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.0/10">Court statistics do not include the ages of the parties at the time a consent order is made, although the information is available to the court when considering the terms of the order, and is one of the factors taken into account in making a decision as to the fairness or otherwise of an order. The Office for National Statistics' records show that between 1996 and 2005 only 18 women and no men under the age of 18 were divorced.</p>

	<p pid="c.319W.2/1">Figures showing the numbers of prisoners serving sentences in all prison establishments in England and Wales by offence group and in the sentence length bands requested can be found in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.2/2">I refer also to the Offender Management Caseload Statistics, 2007, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-30">30 October</phrase>, copies of which have been placed in the House of Commons Library. This will provide additional context to the statistics supplied in the answer.</p>
	<p pid="c.319W.2/3">The breakdowns in the table for the years 2002-06 are further breakdowns of tables to be found in earlier editions of the Offender Management Caseload Statistics (table 8.12 for 2006) and Prison Statistics for England and Wales. Data are not available to provide equivalent further breakdowns for the years 1998 to 2001, and the statistics provided for these years are therefore taken from the annual published table in Prison Statistics for England and Wales.</p>

It is for local criminal justice boards and local criminal justice agencies to consider how best to use their funding to meet their targets and local needs. Restorative justice, for a variety of offences, is an established part of the work of youth offending teams and a number of areas have established schemes to deliver adult restorative justice. Where a scheme is available, its use in relation to a given case should depend on whether the victim chooses to participate and, where appropriate, the sentence of the court.</p>

There are no plans to provide compensation for households experiencing negative equity. However, Government are already taking action to provide support for households affected by current market conditions through a mortgage rescue scheme targeted at the most vulnerable households, expanded provision of debt advice and increased support for homeowners who lose their jobs. Government continue to explore options to provide additional support.</p>

	<p pid="c.346W.5/1">The Government are keen to promote a strong private rented sector that acts professionally and meets the needs of all its customers. In January this year, we commissioned Julie Rugg and David Rhodes at the centre for housing policy at York university to carry out an independent review looking at how the sector is operating and what can be done to improve the experience of both landlords and tenants. The review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-23">23 October</phrase>, puts forward some very interesting ideas on how to raise standards and professionalism in the sector which we will be considering in consultation with stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/2">We have already introduced measures to protect tenants' deposits. Under the Housing Act 2004, landlords are required to protect the deposits for all assured shorthold tenancies that have been created since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-06">6 April 2007</phrase> in one of three Government-approved schemes. These arrangements are designed to safeguard the interests of both landlords and tenants, ensuring good practice in deposit handling, so that when a tenant pays a deposit and is entitled to get it back, he or she can be assured that this will happen. The arrangements also include measures to assist with the resolution of disputes, which are designed to make disagreements over the repayment of the deposit faster and cheaper to resolve. The scheme has got off to an excellent start. In the first year, nearly one million deposits totalling over &pound;900 million were protected under the new arrangements at the rate of 2,500 deposits a day.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.5/3">Details of the tenancy deposit protection arrangements and other regularly updated publicity material setting out tenants' rights are available on the Department's website and through:</p>

	<p pid="c.360W.0/1">The UK and French Governments and police organisations co-operate closely on policing of the channel tunnel. UK and French senior officials and police officers meet regularly in the Joint Security Committee (JSC), which is set up by the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) to ensure continued comparability of security standards for the channel tunnel. Kent police provide a permanent police presence and response to the channel tunnel which is funded under the terms of the Channel Tunnel Act. Kent police, under joint arrangements, also maintain a permanent liaison office in Coquelles that provides direct engagement with the French authorities. Article 4 of the Sangatte treaty further mandates regular joint operational meetings between French and UK agencies. The safety and security of the channel tunnel is supported by other initiatives such as the annual exercise programme, the lead for which alternates between the UK and France.</p>

			<tr pid="c.367W.5/28"> <td colspan="3"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust was set up in 2000-01 by merging St. Albans and Hemel Hempstead NHS Trust and RQL Mount Vernon and Watford Hospital. Therefore figures prior to 2000-01 were provided as the total of RPW and RQL.<br/>  2. Numbers provided are for finished consultant episodes and for cases for patients admitted to NHS hospitals only. They do not represent the number of people as one person can have more than one episode during the year. They also do not represent the prevalence of people with Alzheimer's disease.<br/> 3. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> 4. Primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> 5. Secondary diagnoses, as well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> 6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: these figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br/> 7. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis: these figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/>  8. Small numbers: due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br/>  9. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 10. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> 11. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> 12. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> <i> Consultant Main Specialty:</i><br/> This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible for care of the patient is contracted. Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br/> <i> Consultant main specialties included:</i><br/> 710 = Mental illness<br/> 711 = Child and adolescent psychiatry<br/> 712 = Forensic psychiatry<br/> 713 = Psychotherapy<br/> 715 = Old age psychiatry (available from 1990-91)<br/> <i> Data Quality:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.391W.10/1">Since the EU's tariff schedule includes both ad valorem (percentage of price) components and specific (&euro; per tonne) components, tariffs are compared using estimates of the 'ad valorem equivalent' (AVE). Calculation of the AVE requires an estimate of the import price. Typically unit import values (the value of imports divided by the volume) are used as the estimate of the price in the conversion process.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.10/2">There is a further complication in deriving average tariff estimates. Each commodity has several (and sometimes many) tariff lines, often with very different tariff rates. These lines can be averaged in different ways, for example a simple average could be used, or lines weighted according to import volumes. Many imports also take place within the context of tariff rate quotas where the applied rate of duty is lower than the bound rate. Further, each commodity has several (and sometimes many) tariff lines, often with very different tariff rates. These lines can be averaged in different ways, for example a simple average could be used, or lines weighted according to import volumes.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.10/3">Each method has particular disadvantages. For example, weighting by import volume assigns low weight to tariff lines where the tariff is high enough to eliminate imports. This tends to reduce the estimated tariff rate. Historically DEFRA's approach has been to present the tariff for a 'representative' tariff line which accounts for the bulk of imports, or, when there is no clearly dominant individual line, to present a simple average of several important tariff lines.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.10/4">The EU's bound Most Favoured Nation (MFN) agricultural tariffs have remained unchanged over the period 2003 to 2007, and table 1 presents AVE's for the major commodities as calculated by DEFRA. These estimates give a broad indication of the level of protection, but the tariff applied to a particular consignment on a tariff line may differ, as explained above.</p>

	<p pid="c.396W.0/1">Excavated soil removed from a site is classified as waste under the EC Waste Framework Directive, as some soils are contaminated, which means that certain safeguards are required. Unfortunately, this has led to restrictions on the transfer of good quality soil to other sites and can lead to good quality soils being buried in landfill. To address this, DEFRA worked with the Environment Agency, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and industry to try and agree a Waste Quality Protocol setting out when soil should be regarded as safe and where it would be acceptable for soil to be transferred to another site without the need for treatment or being subject to permitting requirements. However, this ran into difficulties due to the lack of a straightforward way of determining when soil should be regarded as safe. Alternative risk based approaches to managing soil from uncontaminated sites are now being looked at.</p>

This is because public bodies are required to ensure public procurement is fair, transparent and not used to discriminate by setting up barriers to free trade. It would also reduce competition contrary to UK public procurement policy that is designed to achieve value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="c.397W.2/3">The legal and policy framework does, however, provide public bodies with the flexibility to be innovative in their procurement and, through the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI), the Government are encouraging them to increase tendering opportunities for small and local producers and to work in partnership with their contractors to similarly open up their supply chains where this is commercially viable.</p>

	<p pid="c.400W.5/2">The red squirrel is a priority species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The conservation aim for this species is to maintain self-sustaining populations of red squirrels, and wherever practicable, expand red squirrel populations where their sustainability is threatened. This action plan is being implemented through a broad partnership of government, statutory conservation agencies and the private and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.5/3">In England, the approach to red squirrel conservation is to secure long-term habitat and conditions favouring the red squirrel in areas where grey squirrels have not yet reached in significant numbers and by limiting grey squirrel expansion into these areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.5/4">The Red Alert North England partners have designated 16 reserves and associated buffer zones where long-term survival of the red squirrel is considered most likely. The partners' Save our Squirrels project is delivering advice to landowners, co-ordinating squirrel control in the buffers, promoting Forestry Commission grants, raising public awareness and gaining further funding for squirrel conservation work.</p>
	<p pid="c.400W.5/5">The Red Squirrel Partnership led by Lord Redesdale was awarded a three-year &pound;148,000 grant in June 2006 from rural enterprise scheme to support the control of grey squirrels in Northumberland to help protect the red squirrel reserves.</p>

WRAP describes this role as encouraging 'resource efficiency'.

This support was of a general nature, across all the issues dealt with by WRAP.</p>

Just over &pound;800 million has been allocated to this programme over the current three-year spending period. The Government announced recently an extra &pound;74 million over the next two years for this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.416W.5/39">Other forms of assistance include the winter fuel payments introduced by the Government in 1997 to help pensioners. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spends around &pound;2 billion a year on this programme. For this winter only, an extra investment of &pound;575 million will be made to fund an additional payment of &pound;50 to eligible households with someone aged 60-79 and &pound;100 to eligible households with someone aged 80 or over. DWP also fund the cold weather payments, paying over &pound;20 million in total over the last five years to eligible households experiencing sustained periods of cold weather. A further &pound;1.5 billion will be provided over the next three years by the energy companies under their carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) obligations to fund energy efficiency improvements in a priority group of low income and elderly customers. In addition, in April my Department secured the individual agreement of the six largest energy suppliers to increase the level of their collective spend on social programmes, which include social tariffs and rebates, to &pound;150 million a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.416W.5/40">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September</phrase>, the Government announced further help, with an extra &pound;1 billion package to tackle fuel poverty.

This &pound;910 million is made up of a 20 per cent. increase in funding for the existing CERT programme, with the remainder coming from a new Community Energy Saving Programme to be funded by energy suppliers and electricity generators. Throughout the country, a partnership of local councils, voluntary organisations and energy companies will carry out house-to-house calls to offer energy efficiency help in some of the most deprived areas of the UK.

	<p pid="c.425W.0/1">I have had no discussions with universities on the subject requirements for student admissions. These are for each university to decide on the basis of the academic and professional needs of each course. If universities do have specific entry requirements for particular courses, these may be shown on their websites, and are generally replicated on the course information of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service website. The Department does not hold that information.</p>
	<p pid="c.425W.0/2">We have made it clear however that admissions policies should be open and transparent. I am aware that the Equality Challenge Unit and Supporting Professionalism in Admissions (SPA) have recently written to higher education institutions about the need to ensure that admissions procedures do not breach equality legislation in terms of the treatment of students with native language qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.425W.0/3">Schools, in partnership with local Connexions services, are expected to provide young people with high quality and impartial, personalised information, advice and guidance about learning and careers that meets the needs of the individual. The Department for Children, Schools and Families is currently working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to pilot approaches that will help all teachers to provide high quality advice on progression opportunities from their own subjects.</p>

	<p pid="c.432W.8/1">Legislation limits the size of an infant class during an 'ordinary teaching session' to 30 pupils per school teacher. Section 4 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 states that an 'ordinary teaching session' does not include a school assembly or other school activity usually conducted with large groups of pupils. We do not prescribe every type of activity that would not be classed as an ordinary teaching session, but guidance to schools and local authorities provides the following examples: PE/games, music, singing, drama, watching television and listening to the radio.</p>

	<p pid="c.434W.2/17">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="c.434W.2/18">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="c.434W.2/19">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described, this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>

	<p pid="c.434W.5/1">The latest evaluation commissioned by the Institute of Education show Every Child a Reader to have a very positive effect on raising the attainment levels of children struggling to read at KS1. In schools funded through the programme, children receiving reading recovery lessons made on average a gain of 21 months in reading age in four to five months of teaching&mdash;well over four times the normal rate of progress. Children receiving reading recovery are routinely followed up after they have finished their programmes, to make sure that their progress is maintained. After six months children taught through Every Child a Reader had developed a normal rate of learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.434W.5/2">In 2008 Burroughs-Lange published a reading recovery follow up study comparing the literacy progress of young children in London schools. This study followed up the impact on children's literacy in London schools a year or more after intervention had been received. In the 2005-06 school year literacy progress was compared of the lowest achieving children in 42 schools serving disadvantaged urban areas who received reading recovery compared with those in schools which provided a range of other interventions. At the end of the 2005/06 main study&mdash;the literacy achievement of children who had received reading recovery (RR) was in line with their chronological age. The comparison group was 14 months behind with an average reading age of five years five months.</p>
	<p pid="c.434W.5/3">In July 2007 the literacy achievement was again compared of those same children remaining in the same 42 schools. At the end of year two the children who had received RR in year one were achieving within or above their chronological age band on all measures and were still around a year ahead of the comparison children in schools where RR was not available. The RR children had an average word reading age of seven years nine months, compared to six years nine months for the comparison children. The gender gap that was noticeable among low attaining comparison children, with boys lagging behind girls, was not evident in RR schools, where there was no gender gap. Writing achievement showed a significant difference between RR and comparison children. At the end of year two, the children who had received RR were able to write twice as many correctly spelled, words as those children who were in the comparison group.</p>

This is leading to more young people volunteering for community citizenship activities and different forms of individual and collective action. In addition, through the national PE and sport strategy, over 1 million pupils&mdash;around 16 per cent.&mdash;are now actively involved in sports volunteering and leadership on a regular basis. &pound;23 million has been invested in this area in the last six years.</p>

	<p pid="c.438W.3/1">The Government believe that there should be more access to project credits in the EU emissions trading scheme than is provided for in the Commission proposal for revising the scheme. This would allow for harmonisation of access among installations in the EU. The UK Government would like to see project credit access in both the EU emissions trading scheme and greenhouse gas (GHG) effort-share limited to 50 per cent. of absolute effort (in the context of the overarching principle that 50 per cent. of absolute emissions reductions from 2005 must take place within the EU).</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.3/2">We are still considering what this &quot;50 per cent. of absolute effort&quot; principle means in quantitative terms across the EU ETS and the non-traded sector. This is difficult because the EU ETS runs across the time period 2008 to 2020, while the non-traded sector runs across the period 2013 to 2020. We need to be sure that we get the balance right to demonstrate that Europe is serious about the transition to a low carbon economy through emission reductions within its borders. We should not rely disproportionately on third countries in order to meet Europe's own targets.</p>

	<p pid="c.438W.6/1">There is limited assistance that can be given to park home residents under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) due to the nature of their homes, which make them harder to insulate than many others. Although the Government set the overall CERT target, it is open to energy suppliers how they meet their targets. Suppliers promote the most cost effective energy saving measures including cavity wall and loft insulation. Measures such as external or internal wall insulation for park homes are not currently as cost effective as other energy saving measures, so are less attractive to energy suppliers. Park homes residents are eligible for assistance for low energy lamps and efficient appliances.</p>

	<p pid="c.439W.3/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and its predecessors have a long established record of supporting UK science to understand current and future climate change and its impacts. Currently DECC is directly responsible for about &pound;31 million of climate change research annually, including supporting the world-leading research at the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC) to the tune of about &pound;15 million each year, through their Integrated Climate Programme (ICP). The ICP is also jointly funded by the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.3/2">A primary output of the MOHC research and modelling is to provide advice with regard to future climate change and the risks of climate change. It provides evidence to DECC which is used to develop policy on curbing climate change.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.3/3">DECC is working with DEFRA, other Government Departments and research councils to frame and implement new work, aimed at more fully integrating robust natural science research with that needed to deliver evidence to enable societies to adapt better to unavoidable climate change.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.3/4">The challenge of moving towards a lower carbon economy requires us to develop a portfolio of low carbon energy technologies such as carbon abatement technologies, hydrogen and fuel cells, nuclear power and renewables. Public sector funding bodies all recognise low carbon energy technologies as a priority and are working closely to ensure that funding is co-ordinated&mdash;and that funding effectively supports the portfolio of technologies that will deliver CO2 reductions.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.3/5">Capital grant and other funding for low carbon and renewable energy technologies is provided under the Environmental Transformation Fund (ETF). Under the UK element of the ETF, DECC supports the demonstration and pre-commercial deployment of innovative low carbon and energy efficiency demonstration technologies, and aims to accelerate their commercialisation in the UK. The scheme aims to address market failures at the demonstration and pre-commercial deployment stage, where developers of new and innovative energy technologies can have difficulty in securing capital funding. The fund operates by means of technology-specific schemes, with projects selected on a competitive basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.3/6">Over the next three years, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) funded Research Councils will be investing over &pound;300 million in energy research and over &pound;360 million in research that will address living with environmental change.</p>

	<p pid="c.440W.2/1">The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has commissioned a report looking at the effect of aviation on radiative forcing of climate through not only its emission of CO2, but also NOx and the effects of contrails and aircraft-induced cirrus.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.2/2">Although much remains to be done on improving modelling at global and regional scales, the report (which is not yet finalised) demonstrates more clearly the effect of NOx emissions from aviation on ozone and methane emissions and the impact of aircraft altitude on temperature.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.2/3">Mitigation of aviation emissions, including the complex technological and atmospheric tradeoffs, is also discussed in the report. A core issue is how to balance the long-term effect of CO2 against shorter-term effects such as those from ozone, contrails and aircraft-induced cirrus that have equal or greater radiative magnitude than CO2. Particular focus has been given to the potential for reducing contrail radiative forcing by modifying flight altitude.</p>

	<p pid="c.454W.12/1">The UK's oil demand is expected to rise gradually over the next decade, mainly driven by demand for aviation fuel and diesel while petrol consumption is forecast to fall. However, global demand is expected by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to rise more sharply over this period, mainly driven by increasing demand in developing economies.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.12/2">The Government do not estimate the timing of peak in global oil production. However, it is our assessment that the global oil reserves are sufficient to prevent total global oil production peaking in the foreseeable future&mdash;provided that sufficient investment in both upstream and downstream is forthcoming in order for production to keep pace with the growing global oil demand.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.12/3">In the long-term, however, unchecked growth of oil demand, both in the UK and internationally, is not environmentally or economically sustainable. The Government are therefore working both domestically and internationally to reduce CO2 emissions from the transport sector which will also help to ease demand for oil in the UK and internationally. This includes policies to reduce the carbon content of transport fuel; improve fuel efficiency of vehicles; enable individuals to make more sustainable travel choices; and explore the use of emissions trading for transport. In particular, the renewable transport fuel obligation, EU standards on vehicle emissions and research into electric and hybrid vehicles are likely to encourage the development and deployment of technologies that provide alternatives to petrol and diesel and/or reduce CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.12/4">The Government hope that the forthcoming meeting of Energy Ministers it will host in December will provide an opportunity for consumer and producer nations to discuss these issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.458W.2/1">The renewables obligation is the Government's key mechanism for encouraging renewable electricity generation. It will therefore play a key part in meeting the 2020 target but we will need a range of other measures as the EU 2020 target is for renewable energy not just electricity. The European Commission has proposed for the UK to have a 15 per cent target. of all its energy from renewable sources by 2020. This will be confirmed when the renewable energy directive is agreed. The Government have committed to publishing a UK renewable energy strategy once the renewables directive has been agreed next spring on how to meet the UK's share of the EU 2020 renewables target. The consultation document made clear that the EU 2020 target required a step change in our policies to deliver 15 per cent. of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. The consultation on the draft renewable energy strategy therefore set out a wide range of potential measures including new and expanded financial support mechanisms for electricity, heat, transport and small scale generation as well as the approach on tackling key constraints such as planning, grid and supply chain. The consultation document was placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Final decisions on how the renewables obligation and other policies will be implemented to meet the renewable energy target will be set out in the final UK renewable energy strategy next spring.</p>

	<p pid="c.460W.0/1">Section 1 of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act provides the Secretary of State with a power to define fuel poverty. This power has not been exercised because since the fuel poverty strategy was published the Government have relied on the following definition:</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;A household is said to be in fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain an adequate level of warmth (usually defined as 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/3">The broad definition of spending on fuel adopted in the measurement of fuel poverty also includes spending on water heating, lights and appliances and cooking.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/4">Section 2 of the Act contains the substance of the Secretary of State's duties to tackle fuel poverty which includes preparing and publishing a strategy, implementing that strategy and keeping the strategy under review.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/5">From the strategy the Government have implemented a package of measures, set target dates and published annual progress reports. The strategy and annual reports help to communicate to stakeholders on progress and the challenges faced. In this sense, section 2 is an effective provision in ensuring the Government's approach to tackling fuel poverty is transparent&mdash;as Parliament intended.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.0/6">Friends of the Earth and Help the Aged brought a claim for judicial review against the Secretary of State alleging a continuing failure to perform his duties in the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000. The case was dismissed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-23">23 October</phrase>. The Government remain committed to tackling fuel poverty. While recent energy prices have made the challenge more difficult, we keep the position under constant examination and develop our approach as the situation changes.</p>
