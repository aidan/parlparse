	<p pid="d.2121W.3/2">2008 was in exactly the same mould as previous years. The four Christmas receptions held in Northern Ireland in 2007 were attended by over 1,400 members of the public drawn from the criminal justice, policing, military, business, charity and community sectors. The guests included families of the security forces and serving personnel, representatives of victims groups, churches and businesses, as well as many others working in the community sectors across Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="d.2121W.3/3">These events provide some recognition of the tremendous contribution made by people, both individually and collectively, who have helped to transform Northern Ireland. We work hard to monitor costs at these occasions as we are mindful in Government of the need to provide value for money. Anyone with a close understanding of Northern Ireland will know the value of these occasions in bringing people together in a renewed political environment.</p>

	<p pid="d.2125W.5/3">The model was produced by the Civil Aviation Authority (commissioned by the trustees of the Air Travel Trust), to assess the sustainability of a per passenger ATOL Protection Contribution in building up sufficient funds to meet potential refund and repatriation costs arising from the failure of tour operators, under different adverse scenarios. External forecasts from third parties such as travel companies, insurance firms and banks were used as the basis for assumptions. Information was received from a spread of ATOL license holders, including the four largest air travel tour operators, five medium sized operators and two online tour operators. The spread of firms accounted for more than half of all passengers covered by the ATOL protection scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.2125W.5/4">The Civil Aviation Authority engaged a professional services firm with expertise in economic modelling and the travel sector to review the model methodology, its fitness for purpose and a number of the underlying assumptions.

The UK will be required to modify the RTFO in order to implement the Renewable Energy Directive in 2010. The directive incentivises second generation biofuels through requiring member states to count their contribution towards renewable energy targets as twice those of first generation biofuels. We shall be consulting later this year about how to take forward the implementation of the directive in UK legislation.</p>

Last autumn the Government also announced that the Department anticipates contributing up to &pound;3 million per year over the next two financial years to the Carbon Trust's Advanced Bioenergy Directed Research Accelerator.

In 2008-09 DFT will provide Chorley borough council with special grant funding of &pound;280,000 for the improvement to statutory concessionary travel; this is in addition to the existing formula grant funding from CLG. The Special Grant Funding represents a 33 per cent. increase in funding over and above Chorley borough council's declared costs of &pound;0.85 million for concessionary travel in 2007-08.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase>, the Government, in consultation with UKFI, agreed to convert the RBS preference shares, plus accrued coupon and underwriting fees, into ordinary shares.

	<p pid="d.2145W.0/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) administer almost 20 different taxes and duties and several other collection and payment regimes such as tax credits, national insurance and child benefit. All of the regimes make provision for administrative financial penalties to underpin compliance.</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/2">Financial penalties are levied to address non-compliant behaviour in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/3" class="indent">Failure to notify taxable activity;</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/4" class="indent">Late filing or non-filing of returns;</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/5" class="indent">Late or non-payment of taxes, duties and national insurance contributions;</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/6" class="indent">Errors on returns due to negligence, carelessness or deliberate action;</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/7" class="indent">Failure to provide information or to make business premises and records available for inspection;</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/8" class="indent">Regime specific contraventions such as unauthorised issue of VAT invoices or unauthorised use of a customs warehouse.</p>
	<p pid="d.2145W.0/9">The numerous existing regime specific penalties are being replaced by a smaller number of new generic administrative financial penalties, with no penalty charged for mistakes where the taxpayer has taken reasonable care. Significant reductions will be available for those who make unprompted disclosures, with smaller reductions for prompted disclosures. Most penalties will be charged as a percentage of the tax under-declared.</p>

	<p pid="d.2157W.3/2">The Government fund projects on C02 capture via the DIUS funded Research Council's Energy Programme and the Technology Strategy Board. In addition, DECC provides support via the Environmental Transformation Programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.2157W.3/3">The Research Councils support wide-ranging underpinning research and training in carbon capture and storage (CCS) through the Research Councils' Energy Programme and through their individual programmes. In the last five years 25 projects covering CCS totalling over &pound;23 million have been funded, of which around 18 include C02 capture technologies. In addition CCS research is carried out at institutes and centres supported by the Research Councils, in particular NERC's British Geological Survey and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Fundamental research is also supported by the councils which may feed in over the longer term to CCS technologies.</p>
	<p pid="d.2157W.3/4">The TSB has identified carbon abatement technologies as a priority for funding and currently supports 11 projects with grant funding of &pound;6.4 million, of which eight projects are specifically on capture technologies.</p>

	<p pid="d.2158W.0/2">The Climate Change Act 2008 puts in place a system of five-year carbon budgets that will set a legally binding limit on UK greenhouse gas emissions. Following advice from the Committee on Climate Change received in December 2008, the Government will set the levels of the first three carbon budgets, covering the period 2008 to 2022, by <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</phrase>. These must set with a view to complying with our European obligations, including the 2020 targets.</p>
	<p pid="d.2158W.0/3">As the Act requires, the Government will lay a report before Parliament setting out their proposals and policies for meeting the first three carbon budgets in mid-2009. A key instrument to reduce emissions will be the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The combination of a more ambitious, EU-wide cap on emissions with an annually declining trajectory to 2020 and beyond will ensure that emissions reductions from the EU ETS will correspond to approximately two thirds of the effort the EU will need to make to reach the 20 per cent. target by 2020.</p>

At the Extraordinary Energy Council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January 2009</phrase> member states again confirmed that diversification of routes and sources of supply must be a major criterion for selecting projects for European support.

However, estimates suggest there are some 20,000 children with diabetes in England (the vast majority type 1 diabetes), and some experts suggest that there may be up to 1,000 children with type 2 diabetes in England.</p>

	<p pid="d.2177W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health published &quot;Valuing People Now&quot;&mdash;a new three-year cross-government strategy for people with learning disabilities. A copy has already been placed in the Library. It encompasses the Department's response to the key recommendations of &quot;Healthcare for All&quot;&mdash;the report of the Independent Inquiry chaired by Sir Jonathan Michael (DH, 2008)&mdash;and affirms that access to high quality health care is a right, and is essential in enabling people to lead healthy, active and fulfilling lives that are free from discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="d.2177W.6/2">We will be establishing a time-limited Confidential Inquiry (CI) to investigate premature deaths of people with learning disabilities. This will help improve the clinical evidence-base that should underpin commissioning of local services. We are developing a specification for the CI and we expect to invite proposals from potential organisations in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="d.2177W.6/3">We will also establish a public health observatory to provide essential information at national and local level. This responds to the call for improved data, so that the national health service can target action to support people to have better health. It will support primary care trusts in assessing the needs of people with learning disabilities in their local population, assessing how these needs are being met and to understand comparative health outcomes for people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.2177W.6/4">The Government accept the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry. We are now taking action that will lead to people with learning disabilities getting the equal access to health care that they deserve. The NHS is already improving the health of people with learning disabilities, for example, through establishing health checks and improving training.</p>
	<p pid="d.2177W.6/5">&quot;Valuing People Now&quot; is supported by existing legislation. The Disability Discrimination Act (1995) places a legal responsibility on all health and social care organisations not to discriminate against disabled people or provide them with a poorer quality of service.</p>

	<p pid="d.2192W.2/1">Raising the public awareness of prostate cancer is a key challenge. We want men to know what their prostate is, what it does, and what can go wrong with it. However, we have to raise awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/2">That is why the Prostate Cancer Advisory Group Public Awareness Working Group developed a definitive set of consistent key messages for the general public about the prostate, including prostate cancer. These messages provide men and their families with information about the prostate designed in such a way as not to cause unnecessary anxiety. The key messages have been agreed by 20 organisations, including charities, patient groups and professional bodies, as well as the Department. The messages are free for all organisations to use, and were published in 2008 in the Royal British Legion's Members Directory and in supplements to the <i> Daily Express</i> and <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> at a cost of over &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/3">The Department invested &pound;100,000 in a pilot public awareness programme of the prostate and its function, a joint programme with signatories to the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action who provided &pound;50,000 of funding. The pilot took place in Coventry in 2006 to test the effectiveness of the key messages, the intervention used to promote the messages and the impact promoting the messages has on national health service (NHS) services. The final evaluation reports and recommendations of the pilot have been referred to the Cancer Reform Strategy National Awareness and Early Detection Initiative (NAEDI).</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/4">NAEDI aims to make the public and healthcare professionals more aware of the signs and symptoms of cancer, including prostate cancer, and encourage those who may have symptoms to seek advice earlier. An example of future work includes the Football Foundation's awareness raising project, which is part funded by the Department, which will work to raise awareness of the signs, symptoms and risk factors associated with bowel, lung and prostate cancers in men aged over 55.</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/5">Other investment in the public awareness of prostate cancer in the last five years has included:</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/6" class="indent">investing over &pound;100,000 in UK Prostate Link, the first comprehensive online source of information of its kind, to help the public, prostate cancer patients, their families and health professionals to find all the information they want to know about prostate cancer, including signs and symptoms. This is a collaborative project, co-funded with signatories to the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action;</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/7" class="indent">providing &pound;30,000 to the Men's Health Forum to help fund its publication, the &quot;Men and Cancer Manual&quot; in 2004;</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/8" class="indent">providing &pound;29,000 to the Men's Health Forum to produce and distribute 'mini' &quot;Men and Cancer Manuals&quot;, including detailed information on prostate cancer, in 2007 and 2008. A further collaboration is planned for 2009; and</p>
	<p pid="d.2192W.2/9" class="indent">providing &pound;105,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to improve awareness of the risks and symptoms of prostate cancer in African and Afro-Caribbean men between 2003 and 2006.</p>

We condemn the marginalisation or persecution of any community based on their religious beliefs.

There are Christians among a variety of ethnic groups in Burma, though their persecution by the authorities appears to be based largely on their ethnicity rather than their faith.</p>

The incident concerned the building of a wall on agricultural land disputed by the local village, Deir Abu Fana and the monastery. The dispute became violent when a mob attacked the monastery, killing a local resident. Two monastery workers suffered bullet wounds, two monks suffered injuries and three monks were taken by the mob and badly beaten. I understand that the disagreement has been settled through customary informal negotiations. We understand that no one has been brought to trial and 15 people remain in detention.</p>
	<p pid="d.2199W.2/2">With at least 8 million Coptic Christians in Egypt, creating tolerance between Coptic and Muslim communities is essential. The Egyptian President is personally involved in efforts to promote tolerance and inter-faith harmony, and has taken steps to promote and protect the rights of Christian, such as appointing Christians to parliament and other senior government posts (including the Head of the National Council for Human Rights). But sectarian tension and discrimination does sometimes exist at grass roots level. We regularly raise our concerns about human rights with the Egyptian government, and will continue to do so.</p>

Several hundred former residents have voluntarily returned to Iran in the recent past. Reporting leads us to understand that those who have returned have not been ill treated.

Whilst residents of the camp were treated as &quot;protected persons&quot;, this was exercised at the good will of the US authorities in charge and was not granted through any legal obligation under international law.</p>

The United Nations Mission in Timor's mandate will be considered later this month and the UK will continue to encourage progress in the above key areas in order to achieve our ultimate goal of helping the people of East Timor stand on their own feet.

	<p pid="d.2215W.6/1">The development of a single form for planning applications to replace a myriad of existing forms used across local government in various different formats is achieving significant benefits for local and central government, stakeholder organisations and the general public. The XML Schema development is required to bring the current schemas and associated standards up-to-date to enable the single form to be widely accessible from different IT platforms and personal computers</p>
	<p pid="d.2215W.6/2">The National Capabilities Survey (NCS) is a key part of the UK Government's programme to increase the UK's resilience. The survey aims to assess current levels of capability and readiness across England. The results will identify gaps in event preparedness and be the baseline for judging priorities for future investment, exercising and policy development.</p>
	<p pid="d.2215W.6/3">Ordnance Survey's GIS Development Project is designed to deliver a 'state of the art' technical environment for the National Geographical Database (NGD) to allow field editing, database transaction and data production management activities to take place in a seamless environment. The new systems will replace aging technology and enable Ordnance Survey to increase efficiency, reduce costs and deliver geographic information to market more quickly, with the improved content, currency and capability that customers demand.</p>

Using prior year volumes, based on historical actuals, and multiplying the total by the fee charge provides the basis of the fee income forecast for the financial year. In addition the impact, on the forecasted fee income, is adjusted to take into account known impacts from proposed changes to fee policy in the coming year, for example new fee charges. Throughout the year the fee income forecast and the assumptions against volume are revisited on a monthly basis, using actual data captured. Any substantial changes to volume trends, that can be identified, are factored in and adjustments made to the income forecast.</p>

	<p pid="d.2238W.2/2">The letter has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Beverley Hughes, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-29">29 January 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/4" class="indent"><i> </i>I have seen the final Annual Performance Assessment (APA) letter for Birmingham, which was published by Ofsted on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-17">17 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/5" class="indent">I was very concerned to see that inspectors have identified a number of issues around safeguarding services for children and young people in Birmingham and judged the &quot;Staying Safe&quot; strand to be inadequate. I am also concerned that four out of five Serious Case Reviews have recently been judged to be inadequate by Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/6" class="indent">I recognise that you have taken a series of actions since April 2008 to address weaknesses in your children's social care service. I welcome that you have decided to personally chair a Task Force to address the weaknesses identified and to drive forward improvements in children's social care. I would like your Children's Services Adviser in the Government Office for the West Midlands, Kay Whyte-Bell, to be a member of this Task Force. She will report to me monthly on progress. I am also pleased that you are receiving support from your Regional Improvement and Efficiency Partnership to appoint an Assistant Director to your new management structure.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/7" class="indent">However, given the critical importance of managing risks to children's safety and the need to ensure that progress is made swiftly and decisively, I have instructed my officials to work with Birmingham to provide a package of intervention support. This package will consist of:</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/8" class="indent">Bringing in an additional two interim Assistant Directors for your safeguarding service, as per your new management structure, through my Department's Children's Services Improvement Framework. The Department will contribute 50% of the costs towards these interim posts. GOWM will quality-assure the procurement process. I have also requested that they quality-assure the potential candidates for your Service Director post and your third Assistant Director post, for which you have received funding from your Regional Improvement and Efficiency Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/9" class="indent">A small team of external consultants to conduct a root-and-branch review of the Local Safeguarding Children's Board (LSCB) and provide recommendations on its operation and structure. This review will look closely at the organisation of Serious Case Reviews and whether changes need to be made to the handling of such cases. This team will also work with middle managers in your Duty and Assessment team and other front-line social care teams to develop performance management systems to ensure current work is on track and meeting requirements that will lead to the improvements necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/10" class="indent">Enhanced monitoring from GOWM. I understand the Children's Services Adviser and Social Care Specialist Support Manager are receiving fortnightly progress reports regarding your Serious Case Reviews and the Secretary of State's commission to review SCRs judged inadequate by Ofsted. I have asked for progress on SCRs to be included in the monthly reports that will be provided to me by the Children's Services Adviser.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/11" class="indent">I am keen to see swift improvements in Birmingham and for children, young people and families to receive the service they deserve. 1 have decided therefore to underpin the improvement measures and progress I expect with an Improvement Notice. This will give Birmingham City Council twelve months to demonstrate robust and sustained progress, with a review after six months. Should improvement not be sufficient at either six or twelve months, I will need to consider the use of statutory powers to direct a solution. 1 am sure you will understand the necessity of this course of action, given we are dealing with safeguarding provision for vulnerable children and young people. My officials will be in touch shortly to discuss a draft Improvement Notice before I formally issue the Notice to the Council.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/12" class="indent">I know that we share a commitment to delivering improved outcomes for Birmingham's children and young people. It is vital now that we work together in order to achieve that goal.</p>
	<p pid="d.2238W.2/13" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Councillor Les Lawrence (Lead Member for Children, Young People and Families), Stephen Hughes (Chief executive) and the Director of Children's Services (Tony Howell). A copy will also be circulated to local MPs.</p>

	<p pid="d.2255W.2/1">The tables showing the grants made by the Department for Children, Schools and Families to Luton borough council for each year since 1997-98, broken down between revenue and capital funding, will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.2255W.2/2">The revenue grant totals for 2006-07 onwards are not comparable with figures in 2005-06 and before, because the introduction of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded for education services.</p>
	<p pid="d.2255W.2/3">Before 2006-07 local authorities were funded through Education Formula Spending (EFS). This formed part of the annual Local Government Finance Settlement. EFS comprised school functions and local education authority (LEA) central functions, whereas DSG only covers the school functions. The DSG is based on each local authority's spend on schools in 2005-06, uprated each year for cost pressures and adjusted for changes in pupil numbers. LEA central functions are still funded through the Local Government Finance Settlement but cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. For information the EFS figures for Luton borough council for 1997-98 to 2005-06 were:</p>

This provides authorities with certainty of funding, which schools and authorities tell us they value when planning capital programmes.

	<p pid="d.2259W.2/1">The Government do not have specific funding arrangements for pupils attending service schools. We allocate revenue funding to local authorities via the dedicated schools grant according to the number of pupils they have on roll at the spring school census. It is then for the local authority to apply their local funding formula, which will have been approved by the Schools Forum, to allocate funding to the schools in their area and it is for the authority to ensure that their formula takes account of the individual needs and pressures of their schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.2259W.2/2">We are currently undertaking a review of the formula for distributing dedicated schools grant. The aim is to develop a funding system that supports schools and local authorities to raise the educational achievement of all pupils and to narrow the gap in educational achievement between all children, including those from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds. As part of this work we will be looking at the issues for particular groups of pupils, including service children. We will consult fully on proposals before taking final decisions.</p>

	<p pid="d.2269W.2/1">Since September 2007 the revised professional standards for teachers provide clear career pathways for teachers from qualified teacher status to advanced skill teachers. These clarify what is expected at each career stage, including expectations about teachers' ongoing engagement in their own continuing professional development (CPD).</p>
	<p pid="d.2269W.2/2">To support this we have introduced revised and robust performance management arrangements in September 2007 which will ensure that teachers' performance is regularly reviewed and that all teachers have clear and robust development plans which take account of their own individual needs and the school's improvement priorities. Teachers play a key role in this process through engaging with their line mangers to agree their professional development plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.2269W.2/3">The new performance management arrangements introduced in September 2007 are part of the broader cultural change agenda that has been transforming the school workforce since &quot;Raising standards and tackling workload: a national agreement&quot; was signed in 2003. They are a key part of the drive to create a &quot;&quot;new professionalism&quot; and are designed to help schools raise standards even further by tying teacher performance with their professional development needs and a school's own improvement priorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.2269W.5/1">Each local authority receives funding within its Area-based Grant to support delivery of its local teenage pregnancy strategy. The amount each local authority receives is based on a formula that takes account of the number and rate of teenage pregnancies, ensuring that areas which face the greatest challenges receive the most funding. In 2008-09, Nottingham received &pound;295,000 within its Area-based Grant to support its local teenage pregnancy strategy.</p>
	<p pid="d.2269W.5/2">Regional teenage pregnancy co-ordinators based in Government offices provide support and challenge to the local areas within each region. &pound;100,000 is allocated to each Government office to support that function. While only a proportion of this &pound;100,000 will be used to support activity in Nottingham, Government offices have been directed to differentiate the support and challenge they provide so that support is targeted on areas&mdash;like Nottingham&mdash;which have made least progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.2269W.5/3">As one of the 21 local areas with high and increasing rates of teenage pregnancy, Nottingham has also received support from the Department of Health's national support team (NST). In monetary terms, the support received from NST is estimated to be around &pound;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.2269W.5/4">In addition, mainstream delivery partners within the local area&mdash;PCTs, schools, youth services and social services&mdash;use a proportion of their budgets to provide services that support local teenage pregnancy strategies. For example, schools support local teenage pregnancy strategies through their provision of sex and relationships education and targeted work with vulnerable young people to raise aspirations. It is not possible, however, to put a monetary value on these contributions.</p>

	<p pid="d.2273W.5/1">Initial site investigation studies on the site of the Velopark were carried out throughout 2007 and continued into 2008, when the poor ground conditions were identified. As part of the review of the Masterplan for the Olympic Park, undertaken in 2007, the Velodrome was moved slightly to the west to help with the design and layout of the wider cycling facilities to be built in legacy. This movement exacerbated the ground conditions problem.</p>
	<p pid="d.2273W.5/2">The July 2008 London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games update report identified a &pound;40 million cost pressure against other Olympic park venues, part of which was for the Velopark. The level of contamination on this site was more extensive than originally assessed and this contributed to the overall increase of &pound;25 million in the Velopark budget to &pound;105 million.

	<p pid="d.2273W.8/1">Business plans are currently being developed for the legacy use of all permanent London 2012 sporting venues.</p>
	<p pid="d.2273W.8/2">The handball venue will be a flexible, multi-use sports venue in legacy, with a capacity of up to 6,000. Through the provision of retractable seating, it will be possible to increase the field of play and reduce the seating capacity to 3,000. Facilities will include a field of play able to accommodate up to three basketball courts or 12 badminton courts, and a health and fitness centre. The venue will have the capacity to be used for a variety of indoor sports including volleyball, handball, badminton, netball, football and basketball at both community and high performance level. Further sporting uses are also being pursued.</p>
	<p pid="d.2273W.8/3">The Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy (WPNSA) will benefit from the improved facilities that the games will leave behind, providing a state-of-the-art facility for elite training, competition and local community use. Enhancements&mdash;which were completed in November 2008&mdash;include a new 250m slipway, race-boat parking, and lifting and mooring facilities. These provide an early legacy of world-class facilities for elite athletes and the local Dorset community to use.</p>
	<p pid="d.2273W.8/4">The Aquatics Centre will have a capacity of 2,500 in legacy, increasing to 3,500 for major events. It will provide two 50m pools (for which there is an identified strategic need in London), a dive pool with multiple level dive tower, and facilities such as a cr&egrave;che, cafe and dry side training. This is a state of the art building that will make use of sophisticated technology including moveable floors and booms. It will be a permanent elite and community swimming resource for east London that will be used by an estimated 600,000 visitors a year after the games.</p>

Post-games it will continue to be operated by the owners. North Greenwich Arena 2 was intended to be a new, temporary arena. Further to the recommendations of a report in December 2008 by KPMG, a review is being undertaken to consider suitable alternative existing venues and Arena 2 is part of that review.

	<p pid="d.2287W.5/2">As part of the Digital Britain report the Department has made interim assessments of the likely effects on the economy of nationwide access to high-speed broadband by reviewing the range of reports and analysis available on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="d.2287W.5/3">I recognise the potential importance high-speed broadband and its potential to positively affect the UK's competitiveness. The Government believe that investment in new broadband networks opens the way to a whole range of job opportunities, both during and post construction of the new networks. The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) estimates that universal super-fast broadband in the UK could directly create 600,000 new ICT jobs and add &pound;18 billion to GDP over four years with even larger indirect benefit. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation published a similar study of the impact investment in network infrastructures could have in the USA.</p>
	<p pid="d.2287W.5/4">It is important therefore for the Government, under the Digital Britain Report to examine the impact of network improvements can have on the UK's employment and competitiveness in the digital economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.2293W.6/2">The Council of Ministers and the European Commission have invited the social partners to analyse the challenges posed by the expansion in the various forms of labour mobility in the Union and in particular of their impact on the European Union's competitiveness, protection of workers' rights, the functioning of national labour markets, and the various modes of industrial relations, taking account of recent rulings of the European Court of Justice. The Commission's high level committee of experts will examine ways to improve the implementation of the directive and to exchange information, experience and good practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.2294W.2/1">The UK Government recognise that losing the individual's right to opt-out of the 48 hour working week as set by the working time directive, would have a detrimental effect on the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full-time for their primary employer. Many other workers also use this important flexibility and so and we remain firmly of the view that this right should remain. We, along with a majority of other member states will be fighting for the retention of the opt-out as this dossier progresses through the European negotiation process.</p>

The Commission have issued a draft. Recommendation for consultation and Ofcom and other European regulators are in discussion with the Commission about the approach taken.

	<p pid="d.2296W.8/2"><i> </i>There are currently no regulatory requirements for the mobile network operators or constraints under the terms of their 2G and 3G licences for provision of signal coverage in rural areas. Although a population coverage requirement is a condition of their licences, Ofcom are satisfied that this has in all cases been met. The Government believe that competitive pressure between each operator is fed by information about the markets in which they operate, providing the best basis upon which they can decide whether or not to build mast base stations in areas where signal coverage is poor.</p>
	<p pid="d.2296W.8/3">However, the Government are keen to ensure that the benefits of digital technology are enjoyed by as many people as possible. As part of the Digital Britain Interim Report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-29">29 January 2009</phrase>, we propose a universal service commitment for broadband data. By the publication of the final Digital Britain Report, we will develop plans for a universal service, which will include the role of mobile technologies. We will additionally consider further network, spectrum or carrier-sharing proposals from the operators, particularly where these can lead to greater coverage levels throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="d.2305W.3/1">In June 2008 at the Rome Food Summit, the Secretary of State called for an international partnership for agriculture and food to deliver an ambitious and sustained increase in our collective efforts to tackle world hunger.</p>
	<p pid="d.2305W.3/2">Subsequently DFID has worked intensively with other donors, the UN High Level Task Force on Global Food Security and other stakeholders to take this forward. The UK worked within the G8 to secure food security as a key priority for the Toyako summit in July. G8 leaders called for the establishment of a Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food and established a G8 Working Group on Global Food Security in which the UK has been proactive. We have also engaged closely with the European Commission through the Working Party on Development Cooperation (CODEV). The result is sold donor consensus on the need for more and better support for food security, social protection and agricultural development and for a global mechanism to help deliver a comprehensive and co-ordinated international response to hunger.</p>
	<p pid="d.2305W.3/3">The recent &quot;High Level Meeting on Food Security for All&quot;, hosted by Ban Ki Moon and President Zapatero in Madrid, agreed to launch a formal consultation process for the establishment of a &quot;Global Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition&quot; (GPAFSN) which will fully engage all relevant stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="d.2305W.3/4">Given the existence of the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Bank's multi-donor trust fund for rapid response to countries badly affected by the recent food crisis, the GPAFSN is not conceived as a new global fund. A small secretariat is envisaged, with its main role being to co-ordinate among the various UN agencies, donors, partner countries and other stakeholders who are serious and ambitious in stepping up joint efforts to reduce global hunger.</p>
	<p pid="d.2305W.3/5">Over $15 billion of new funding has already been announced since the food crisis began last year. G8 leaders announced some $10 billion of new commitments at their summit in Toyako. A further $1.75 billion to tackle food security was announced at the UN High Level Meeting on the MDGs in New York in September. This included one billion euros from the European Commission. Spain pledged one billion euros over the next five years at the recent Madrid meeting. The World Bank has pledged to increase its annual spending on agriculture by some $2 billion per year. Within these figures, during 2008 DFID has committed over &pound;900 million to addressing agriculture and food security, of which over &pound;230 million has already been disbursed.</p>
	<p pid="d.2305W.3/6">The GPAFSN will have a crucial role in promoting the co-ordination of this funding at country level where partner governments are willing to give sustained priority to this agenda. GPAFSN will also be a forum for identifying and addressing emerging international issues, such as global grain price volatility, not appropriate for other international forums.</p>

	<p pid="d.2308W.3/1">I am aware of the difficult situation many women in Afghanistan still face. Our embassy officials regularly discuss women's rights with members of the Afghan government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Afghan parliamentarians.</p>
	<p pid="d.2308W.3/2">The Government work to enhance the status of women in three main ways: through policy engagement with the Afghan government; through support for national programmes and services, which benefit women; and through bilateral programmes. Despite the challenges, progress has been made: over a third of children now in school are girls and we have committed over &pound;35million to support the Afghan government's micro-finance programme, giving women in particular better access to finance. 27 per cent. of seats in the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament are held by women.</p>
	<p pid="d.2308W.3/3">Our main support is channelled through the Afghan government, since gender inequality is a deeply embedded and long-term problem which needs a strategic approach. We have worked, for example, with the government to ensure that gender equality is integrated into the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="d.2308W.3/4">We are giving &pound;500,000 to support a five-year Women's Empowerment programme (2005-10), implemented by the NGO Womankind. The programme focuses on promoting women's equal participation in governance; building awareness of women's rights among civil society and policy makers; and on providing educational, health, community and psycho-social support to women affected by violence and conflict. Womankind implements its programmes through local Afghan women's NGO's, helping to build Afghan capacity.</p>
	<p pid="d.2308W.3/5">Since its establishment in 2002, we have given over &pound;1.75 million to support the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), including &pound;200,000 this year to support its 2009-10 Action Plan. The Commission is a cornerstone of Afghan civil society, with over 500 staff working to improve respect for human rights across Afghanistan. A large part of the Commission's work focuses on women's rights, including documenting and tackling violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="d.2308W.3/6">The AIHRC now has representatives in Helmand province, who are helping support the new Women and Children's Justice group, established in Lashkar Gah in August 2008. Run by prominent female members of the community, the Group is developing and implementing practical programmes on the ground to support women and children's rights and justice issues.</p>

Decisions on contributions beyond the 2 per cent. levy to the AF will be made when it becomes operational, and when its future role and scale becomes clearer through the climate change negotiations. DFID is also providing advisory support with 20 per cent. of a senior adviser's time as the UK alternate member of the AF Board, and support by other DFID and DECC staff working on climate change.</p>
