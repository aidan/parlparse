	<p pid="a.646W.4/1">Responsibility for the management of local authority cemeteries, including the procedures for the safety of staff and visitors, lies with the relevant council. Burial authorities have been encouraged to take account of the Department's guidance, but we have no plans to carry out individual compliance assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.4/2">We have not sought to estimate the extent to which wooden or other support stakes for memorials are still being used. Responses to the Ministry of Justice survey of burial ground operators in 2009 indicated that memorials considered to present a risk of causing serious injury were now more likely to be identified by suitable signs rather than to be fitted with stakes. It would be consistent with the Department's memorial safety guidance for the use of such stakes to be reduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.648W.9/1">Neither the Government's proposals for reform of legal aid nor those for civil litigation funding and costs were informed by specific evidence of compensation culture or perceptions of a compensation culture. However, the Government takes the view that legal aid has been available for a very wide range of issues which has led to the availability of taxpayer funding for unnecessary litigation. Our proposals for reform will ensure that the taxpayer pays for legal advice and litigation only in relation to serious issues which have sufficient priority to justify the use of public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.9/2">Our proposals for reform of civil litigation funding and costs are based on Lord Justice Jackson's year-long review of &quot;Civil Litigation Costs&quot;. Lord Young of Graffham in his report into the compensation culture and health and safety, &quot;Common Sense, Common Safety&quot;, published in October 2010, argues that incentives for claiming compensation must change and strongly endorses the Jackson proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.652W.6/1">There are a wide range of factors which impact on the insurgency and conflict resolution in Afghanistan. Of these, reduced legal economic opportunities could be a factor driving some young males into joining the insurgency and armed opposition groups, as well as dissatisfactions associated with poor governance and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.6/2">The agricultural sector plays a large part in the economy of Afghanistan. Furthermore, the 'Strategic Conflict Assessment of Afghanistan', published by the Recovery and Development Consortium in November 2008, suggests that men in rural communities are most at risk of recruitment into armed opposition groups. Providing increased and legitimate employment opportunities in the sector may, in addition to improving rural livelihoods, reduce the likelihood of disaffected, unemployed male youths joining the armed opposition.

	<p pid="a.653W.2/1">Agriculture is the backbone of the Afghan economy, contributing more than one-third of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Department for International Development (DFID) will continue to support a range of agricultural development programmes in Afghanistan over the coming years, to improve access to markets, add value to farmers' produce and provide support for agricultural livelihoods. For example, the new Helmand Growth Programme will provide support to farmers by providing skills training and access to credit and markets, while the Comprehensive Agriculture and Rural Development Facility provides incentives to sustain the reduction in poppy cultivation, by promoting licit agricultural livelihoods and strengthening agricultural markets. A decision on future programmes supporting agricultural development in Afghanistan will be made following the current Bilateral Aid Review, which will conclude early next year.</p>

Based on information from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), national wheat prices have risen but remain affordable, and the availability of wheat is better than average due to last year's bumper harvest and better than average production this year. There is an overall grain shortage of around 750,000 metric tonnes, however there is good access to imports from Kazakhstan. The Government of Afghanistan and the international community, including the FAO and the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), are closely following the situation and have the capacity to provide support to food insecure areas and groups if required.</p>

	<p pid="a.655W.5/1">The 2010 global hunger index ranks Burundi as one of four countries in the world with an 'extremely alarming' level of hunger. More than 50% of people in Burundi are undernourished. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that Burundi has a chronic deficit of 300,000 tonnes of cereals. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that Burundi's average per capita production is 1,400 kilocalories per clay, compared to a recommended daily intake of 2,100. Even during harvest season, households spend up to 60% of their income on food.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) funded a recent study by the Stockholm Environment Institute into the economic effects of climate change in Burundi. This projects risks of higher temperatures and reduced rainfall, as well as a greater incidence of events producing high intensity rainfall in a short period. Prolonged dryness can create groundwater scarcity and reduced pastureland, which in turn would lead to the loss of harvests and of livestock production. In order to adapt successfully, Burundi would need to diversify its commercial crops and introduce more effective agricultural production systems, including agroforestry and terracing. Without adaptation, Burundi would be at risk of chronic famines.</p>

	<p pid="a.657W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports the FinMark Trust for Southern Africa, which has developed a far reaching programme on micro-insurance. Further to its research on the opportunities and constraints for delivering insurance to low-income households in South Africa, the trust has supported diagnostic studies, regulatory reforms and business innovations in several countries, including Ethiopia and Zambia. This is partly through sponsorship of the global Access to Insurance Initiative. In Kenya, the DFID supported Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT) has supported micro-insurance in two ways: by advising on the design of Safaricom and Equity Bank's M-Kesho product; and to develop and demonstrate the market viability of index-based insurance products to reduce the impact of weather risk on smallholder farmers and pastrolists.</p>
	<p pid="a.657W.2/2">In India, DFID's Poorest States Inclusive Growth Programme (currently under design) is expected to facilitate the development of a range of affordable financial products, including insurance. By the end of 2015, our aim is for an additional 3 million women in the four poorest states to have access to insurance services. We are also supporting the institutional strengthening of the microfinance sector in countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, thereby indirectly assisting the development of a range of financial products including micro-insurance. Going forward, DFID is considering how to further enhance the provision of affordable micro-insurance in a range of countries, in line with its 2011-15 business plan commitment. Further details will be released in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.657W.5/1">Corruption seriously undermines development efforts, and impacts most upon the poor. Anti-money laundering is an important tool for increasing the chances of getting caught, and sanctioned, when using the proceeds of corruption. Support for strengthening anti-money laundering systems in developing countries is a core dimension of the Department for International Development's (DFID's) anti-corruption strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.657W.5/2">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) aims to improve global compliance with anti-money laundering standards. It is addressing this through targeted assistance to countries on the basis of need and willingness to engage, with a focus on low and middle income countries. Assistance is offered through a module-based approach tailored to each country's context, and includes: needs assessments; risk-based approach to anti-money laundering; strengthening the legal and regulatory framework; and enforcement of anti-money laundering regimes by national institutions. Recipients of assistance since mid 2009 include Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Vietnam and the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.657W.5/3">DFID has committed &#163;1.3 million to the IMF for this work from January 2010 to April 2014. This is provided through a multi-donor trust fund (other donors include Switzerland, France, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Japan). DFID sits on the Steering Committee for the Trust Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.658W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has not done such an assessment for the countries in Great Lakes region specifically, but our experience in post-conflict environments is that economic interventions in agriculture can be an important tool for stabilisation. For example, in Rwanda, agricultural development will continue to be the primary driver for poverty reduction which, in turn, should help to reduce conflict. In addition, DFID's Land Tenure programme is helping to reduce conflicts by settling land disputes in Rwanda.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/2">DFID is also supporting the implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the African Union, through a &#163;10 million contribution to the CAADP Multi Donor Trust fund at the World Bank. The CAADP is assisting countries in the Great Lakes region to establish long term investment plans for agriculture, including increasing the proportion of national budgets for agriculture.</p>

Our assessment is that climate change is compounding this and will impact on agriculture and food security in India in a number of ways. Temperature increases, unpredictable monsoons and disease could reduce agricultural productivity, which could contribute to further increases in the price of food, food insecurity and child malnutrition. The poorest people are likely to feel the hardest impacts, with women and children being most affected.</p>

Main findings were that immediate food security responses were required for northern populations and that a substantial portion of the population throughout the country had limited access to basic services.

	<p pid="a.663W.8/2">The Government believe it is important to maintain a distinction between economic migration and asylum and that is why an asylum applicant's claim needs to have been outstanding for at least one year before they can apply for permission to work. This is in line with our obligations under the EU reception conditions directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.8/3">We have considered the merits of reducing this threshold, but we believe such a reduction would encourage those who are not genuinely in need of protection to apply for asylum for economic reasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.3/2">There is a common myth that a CRB certificate cannot be used for more than one position: this is not true.

	<p pid="a.666W.2/1">The Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS) accounted for approximately 30% of the 5,530 foreign national prisoner removals from the UK in 2009, and for around 50% of the 2,425 foreign national prisoner removals in quarters 1 and 2 of 2010. We are unable to advise at the current time the numbers who have received financial assistance and the amount spent on FRS since October 2010. Removal figures for quarter 3 of 2010 was published at the end of November, and for quarter four early in 2011. Once this information has been published the UK Border Agency will be able to confirm the number of foreign national prisoners removed under FRS and the average amount of assistance provided during those periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.2/2">Expenditure on FRS from inception in October 2006 to March 2009 was approximately &#163;4.3 million. The cost of running the scheme for 2009-10 was &#163;7.1 million (including &#163;2.3 million of EU funding) and for 2010-11 is expected to be &#163;9.7 million (including &#163;2.7 million of EU funding). This is a slightly higher figure than previously reported for 2009-10 as the scheme has been successful in removing a larger number of foreign national prisoners than estimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.2/3">The Facilitated Return Scheme is a practical solution that not only saves the taxpayer money in the long run, but also means foreign criminals are removed as soon as possible, denying them the opportunity to re-offend or drag out the removals process. All foreign national prisoners are entered on our watch list when removed, so checks can be made to prevent those who are barred and those who have no right from re-entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.2/4">Only in the most exceptional circumstances would an individual who had taken the FRS package be approved for re-entry to the UK, or for their exclusion to be lifted by the Home Secretary. These cases are considered very carefully and in line with policy. We are aware of two individuals removed under FRS who have later successfully applied to have their exclusion orders lifted, to allow them to return to the UK. We are also aware of a small number of individuals who have re-entered illegally having taken up FRS. In such cases we take urgent action to remove them from the UK.

	<p pid="a.666W.2/5">In order to make the scheme more affordable and bring it in line with other assisted voluntary, return programmes, it has been necessary to reduce the amount of assistance given to those who leave the country under FRS. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase>, those who apply for and are accepted onto the scheme will receive a reduced cash payment amount.

	<p pid="a.673W.5/1">It is essential that Green Deal finance interest rates are as low as possible. The Department is therefore acting in three key ways. Firstly, we are progressing discussions with the finance community regarding appropriate financing solutions; and in particular, low interest investment from the capital markets. Secondly, we are designing secondary legislation so that risks to investors from default and cash flow interruption are minimised.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.5/2">Finally, we are taking steps to ensure that the Green Deal will operate at scale and thereby enable high-value, low cost financing solutions. Importantly, we will ensure that the energy company obligation supports the Green Deal. We are also taking foreshadowing powers through the new Energy Bill to ensure that by 2015, the Government are able-if necessary and appropriate-to require private landlords to improve the least energy efficient properties.</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.3/3">At the pre-Budget report in December 2009, further resource savings were announced, to be made by 2012-13 (that is, in 2010-11 and 2011-12), as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.677W.5/1">Decisions on operational issues such as fire station, fire appliance and firefighter numbers, and associated issues such as non-firefighter posts, are taken by individual fire and rescue authorities as part of the integrated risk management planning process.</p>

Fire and rescue authorities are required by the fire and rescue service national framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. Each fire and rescue authority's IRMP enables that individual authority to decide how best to provide fire and rescue-related services, including prevention and protection as well as response, with resources being allocated on the basis of the evaluation of risk and where the risks are greatest.</p>

	<p pid="a.682W.3/1">This Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships. In the comprehensive spending review, we announced that we will increase investment in adult apprenticeships by up to &#163;250 million during this Parliament. By 2014-15 financial year we will have in place sufficient funding for 75,000 more adult apprenticeships places than under the previous Government's plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.3/2">In this current public expenditure climate we must realise that expanding and improving the apprenticeship programme depends in no small measure on our ability to persuade a larger and more diverse range of businesses to employ apprentices. We are therefore reducing bureaucracy making the system simpler for employers and are considering how we might better support employers through improved funding arrangements. In November, we joined farces with business leaders and the National Apprenticeships Service (NAS) to launch a new campaign to urge more employers to take on apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.3/3">In February 2011 the National Apprenticeship Service will be co-ordinating National Apprenticeship Week which will see apprentices, employers, and providers showcase the benefits of apprenticeship programmes and the value apprentices bring to organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.683W.2/1">There were 273,900 Apprenticeship programme starts in 2009/10 for all ages, based on information for the year to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/2">In support of the coalition Government's principle of greater freedom, &quot;Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. It will be for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/3">From the 2011/12 academic year, there will be a single Adult Skills Budget, with earmarked delivery for apprenticeships. As part of its allocations process later this year, the Skills Funding Agency will set out a minimum expectation of apprenticeships delivery. Further education colleges and training organisations will be able to use their single Adult Skills Budget allocation to expand apprenticeships. However, any diversion of funding away from apprenticeships is to be agreed with the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/4">By the end of the spending review period we will be spending up to &#163;250 million more than was provided under the previous Government. It means we can carry forward the additional 50,000 adult apprenticeship places announced for 2010-11 into future years and add an extra 25,000 by 2014-15. That will take us to 75,000 more places than under the last Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.2/5">The figures above are for adult apprenticeships, that is people aged 19 and above. Funding for 16 to 18-year-old apprenticeships is provided by the Department for Education. They will publish information on funding and learner numbers for 16 to 18-year-old apprenticeships in their annual funding statement shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.686W.8/1">Our reforms to higher education will shift the balance of public funds for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible. Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector providing they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect. We do not expect the overall income of the sector to reduce and we expect improved teaching quality and better informed students to have a positive impact on the economy. We do not have the data in order to make an assessment at the local level of the effect of the reforms in any particular area, as that will depend on the decisions taken by each individual institution in response to the new funding regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.689W.5/2">The Office of Fair Trading recently undertook a review into the corporate insolvency market, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June 2010</phrase>. It recommended that the complaints process should be extended to include complaints over fees charged by insolvency practitioners. We expect to publish the Government's response to this report shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.689W.8/1">No central Government spending has been allocated specifically to fund the activities of local enterprise partnerships. As set out in the White Paper on local growth, local enterprise partnerships will be expected to fund their own day-to-day running costs and will also want to consider how they can obtain the best value for public money by leveraging in private sector investment. Local enterprise partnerships and proposed partnerships may also wish to submit bids to the Regional Growth Fund or European Funding. It is for local authorities to decide how much of their discretionary spending they allocate to local enterprise partnerships.</p>

Announcements regarding these decisions will be made as they emerge.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/2">However, the proposed changes to student funding mean that women taking out time to have a family will not repay their graduate contribution until they are earning &#163;21,000, and are more likely to benefit from any outstanding graduate contribution being written off after 30 years. Additionally, 40% of women will contribute less to the cost of their higher education under our proposals, than under the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/3">During 2010, the Learning and Skills Improvement Service (LSIS), has commissioned nine regional STEM support centres, making best use of existing structures (at a cost of &#163;1.35 million), and has set out a number of priority themes for regional provider-led activity. One of these is Equality and Diversity, and addressing under-representation across STEM. LSIS is also pleased to confirm that a significant proportion of those leading on STEM activity are female.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/4">As a result LSIS has funded a number of projects to support this priority area:</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/5" class="indent">1. Careers guide: LSIS is working with the Centre for Science Education at Sheffield Hallam University to support careers guidance which will impact on the recruitment of women into STEM subjects.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/6" class="indent">2. During 2010, bursaries of &#163;10,000 have been awarded to three college based projects which focus specifically on issues of under-representation and progression to STEM study in FE.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/7" class="indent">3. It is LSIS's intention to continue targeting bursaries for this area in 2011, in line with the priorities we have identified for our STEM activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.2/8">In addition, LSIS has commissioned research into the equality agenda and STEM and, in particular, the low take up and progression of under-represented groups, including women, into science, technology and engineering.</p>

	<p pid="a.696W.2/1">Ministers are actively engaging with overseas governments in these countries to develop better trade links. The Prime Minster's trade-focused visits to India and China, on which I went in support, and my own trips to Russia and Brazil are prime examples of this.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.2/2">UK Trade and Investment is targeting 17 key high growth markets-Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UAE and Vietnam-based on their potential for growth and other criteria such as their market match and scope for UKTI help. UKTI is responding to this demand for help to secure new business by: ensuring there are targeted services and advice available for businesses considering these markets; raising greater awareness among UK business of these-such as through the 'Doing Business in Asia' events around the UK (November 2010, February 2011) this autumn and winter, and 'Partner Middle East'; communicating to business the specific opportunities in them; and campaigning for better access for UK companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.2/3">The UK Government are actively supporting efforts to sign EU free trade agreements with India, Mercosur (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay) and ASEAN (current bilateral negotiations are taking place with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam) as well as seeking a successful conclusion to the WTO's Doha development round, all of which would bring significant benefits to developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.8/1">The Spending Review Framework (Cm 7872) clearly stated that public spending decisions would be made in line with the Government's values of freedom, fairness and responsibility. The Government's approach to public spending ensures that expenditure is focused on protecting the quality of the key front services that are important to the public and provide support to those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.8/2">To ensure that the choices made in tackling the deficit are fair, the Government have for the first time undertaken and published a distributional analysis of the impacts of the Spending Review (see Annex B in the 'Spending Review 2010' document). This shows that after combining the impact of tax, benefits and public service spending changes, the highest quintile of earners will make the greatest contribution towards reducing the deficit as a percentage of their income and benefits in kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.8/3">The Government have ensured fairness by:</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.8/4" class="indent">investing &#163;7 billion in 15 hours of free childcare for disadvantaged two-year-olds; a pupil premium for those at school, and help to get to university.</p>

	<p pid="a.710W.12/1">Ultimately it is a matter of judgment as to the most suitable size of the House, and Ministers decided that a modest reduction to 600 seats would be appropriate, mindful that hon. Members must be able to serve their constituents and that the House must be of sufficient size to be able to carry out its functions effectively. Under the Government's proposals, the <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase> register suggests the electoral quota for the UK would be around 76,000. More than a third of the existing constituencies are already within 5% either side of 76,000, so the impact of our proposals will see constituencies of a size well within existing norms.</p>

	<p pid="a.712W.11/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May 2009</phrase>, as part of an announcement regarding the Maritime Change Programme, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) confirmed that HM Naval Base Clyde will become the main operating base for all classes of submarines, including the future classes of submarines, such as the replacement for the Vanguard Class, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-05-06.17"><i> Official Report</i>, column 17WS</phrase>. Since then, the MOD has and continues to work closely with the local authorities in the Clyde area to assess the potential impact of this decision. This has included releasing preliminary information, which includes initial estimates of the potential numbers of personnel likely to move to the naval base and their potential accommodation requirements. The information released was for future planning purposes only and does not reflect what might be the final position.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/3">In view of his interest in this matter, I will write to the hon. Member to provide him with a copy of the data released to Clyde local authorities along with an explanation of how these forecasts have been calculated.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/4" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Andrew Robathan to Alan Reid:</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/5" class="indent">In my recent response to your Parliamentary Question regarding the trend in the number of service personnel that will be based at Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde and their potential accommodation requirements (Official Report dated 30 Nov 2010: column 745W), I undertook to write to provide a copy of the data that was released to local authorities in the Clyde area. Please find enclosed a copy of the presentation used to brief local authorities in the Clyde area. This has been presented to council members and local government officers for Argyle and Bute Council (<phrase class="date" code="2010-09-22">22 September 2010</phrase>), local Helensburgh and Lomond Councillors (<phrase class="date" code="2010-10-05">5 October 2010</phrase>) and the Helensburgh and Lomond Community Council (<phrase class="date" code="2010-10-28">28 October 2010</phrase>). It is also intended to present the same information to Shandon and Rhu Community Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-08">8 December 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/6" class="indent">First, I would like to explain that this data has been used by the Department for internal planning purposes and to assist local authorities in the Clyde area to review their arrangements in light of the potential future infrastructure and support needs of HMNB Clyde. The data used in the attached presentation was produced before the outcomes of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) were published and is based on a number of assumptions, elements of which may be subject to change. It has, therefore, always been presented with the caveat that the data should not be considered to represent the final position of the Department. Work remains ongoing within the Department to implement the outcomes of the SDSR and HMNB Clyde will continue to update their forecasts as this work progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/7" class="indent">Turning now to specific slides within the presentation, I would like to draw your attention to slide 13, which forecasts a potential increase in the number of service personnel, between now and 2022, from 3,200 to 5,300. This forecast was based on the Royal Navy's existing staffing levels required to support the Fleet and was produced before the publication of the SDSR, which as you will be aware, confirmed the requirement for future manpower changes within the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The forecast therefore, does not take into account any future reduction in the numbers of service personnel. I can confirm that work is ongoing to assess the impact of the SDSR on HMNB Clyde, and this is being conducted alongside that already underway to assess how best to implement the Department's aim of making HMNB Clyde the main operating base for all classes of submarines, including the future classes of submarines such as the replacement for the Vanguard Class.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/8" class="indent">Slide 14 of the presentation includes a projection that the number of all personnel to be based at HMNB Clyde would rise to 9,500. This figure includes the 5,300 figure discussed above and projects that the number of non-service personnel, including MOD civilians, the Commercial Partner (Babcock Marine and Technology Divisions) and other contractors, will increase from 3,000 to 4,200. When presenting the 4,200 figure to the local authorities, the Department made it clear that there are substantial margins of uncertainty in relation to this forecast. For example, the forecast was calculated assuming a direct correlation between workload and workforce and does not take into account any potential efficiencies such as economies of scale. In addition, the estimate does not account for the reduction in the Department's civilian workforce, confirmed in the SDSR, nor does it include any assessment of work ongoing within the Department to develop a procurement strategy that will replace the existing Warship Support Modernisation Initiative, which will deliver future elements of Base and Royal Naval Fleet support to at all three Naval Bases, including HMNB Clyde, from 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/9" class="indent">Turning to slide 17, which contains an estimate that the number of Single Living Accommodation (SLA) spaces may increase from 2,250 to 3,250 and that the number of Service Family Accommodation (SFA) spaces may increase from 515 to 685. As the slide highlights, predicting the future accommodation requirements is a complex area, and I would like to make it clear that these forecasts are about potential space requirements and do not necessarily indicate that the Department will need to build new accommodation to meet such a forecast. For example, it is possible that some of this requirement could be met by better utilisation of existing capacity, including through refurbishment, and work continues within the Department to assess how best to deliver the future SLA and SFA requirement. I can, however, confirm that informal discussions on how we might meet our potential future SLA requirement for HMNB Clyde have recently taken place with the Argyll and Bute Council, but more work is required before the Department can place any formal plans before the Argyll and Bute Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/10" class="indent">I understand that there has been recent local media interest in the potential numbers of personnel moving to HMNB Clyde over the coming years and the impact this might have on local services such as education and health services. I would like to reassure you that the Department is committed to working closely with the local authorities in the Clyde area to assist them in planning for the future infrastructure and support needs of the area. As part of this process of continuous engagement with the local authorities, HMNB Clyde will continue to provide them with preliminary forecasts and to consult with them on the Department's plans, which may have an impact on the local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.11/11" class="indent">I hope that you find the copy of the presentation helpful and that this letter has helped to explain the calculations and assumptions behind the data contained in the presentation.</p>

	<p pid="a.718W.6/1">All initial flying training for UK fast jets, helicopters, and multi-engine pilots takes place within the UK. However, training does not cease after pilots have completed their formal training but continues throughout their flying careers, because all operational flying includes an element of training. Small numbers of UK pilots are regularly posted on exchange tours overseas and this often involves conversion training to adapt to specific aircraft types. In addition, UK pilots regularly take part in flying exercises overseas with international partners. However, the information requested on location, aircraft type, hours flown and costs for these activities outside of the UK is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.2/1">The Ministerial Advisory Group on Dementia Research is currently working via its subgroups on the key issues affecting dementia with the aim of suggesting practical ways to improve the volume, quality and impact of dementia research. The sub groups will report back on their progress to the final meeting of the ministerial group in March 2011.

	<p pid="a.720W.2/3">Most recently, at the end of September we published a new dementia outcomes focused Implementation Plan. This set out the Department's priority objectives for improving the care of those with dementia including a focus on early diagnosis and intervention for all, improved quality of care in general hospitals, living well with dementia in care homes and reducing the use of antipsychotic medication to treat people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/4">In support of the Implementation Plan a National Dementia Declaration was jointly launched in October by the Government and the Alzheimer's Society. This brings together a range of bodies, each setting out what they plan to do to support the implementation of the strategy. With respect to research, for example, the Alzheimer's Research Trust is launching a new strategy to increase their research spending and is supporting 37 new projects including pioneering work on diagnosis using brain scans, further research on unravelling the genetics of the disease, and research in the biomarkers which play a crucial role in diagnosis and understanding disease progression. They will also be undertaking a project working with scientists to better understand research capacity in the field looking at encouraging more people into this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/5">The Department is developing a commissioning pack to provide guidance for primary care trusts and local authorities on how best to commission dementia services.</p>

	<p pid="a.725W.8/1">This information is not collected by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/2">Currently, the numbers of people travelling overseas for treatment are low. We know, for example, that less than 1,000 people travel each year under the arrangements enshrined in article 22 of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71-i.e. the S2 (formally E112 route).</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/3">Decisions relating to the application of fundamental rights under article 56 are made locally by national health service commissioners. Accordingly, there is currently no central data collection as to how many patients are requesting treatment via this route, whether the request is approved or refused (and on what grounds), what treatment is being requested or how much it costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/4">However, primary legislation has been introduced in relation to EUROSTAT, the European Union (EU) organisation which collects and analyses data on a range of issues across the EU), this requires all member states to collect data on cross-border health care under article 56. Currently, we are awaiting the development of secondary legislation by the Commission before the United Kingdom (UK) can consider how to transpose these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.725W.8/5">Additionally, a European directive on patients' rights in cross-border health care is currently the subject of negotiations in Europe. The intention behind the directive is to clarify and codify patients' rights in this area, within a single legal instrument. Depending on the progress of negotiations, a directive may be adopted in spring 2011. We intend looking at article 56 data collection requirements as part of the work to transpose the directive into UK law and NHS systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.2/1">The transition from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult services is a critical point for young people with complex mental health needs.

The Social Care Institute for Excellence, the National CAMHS Support Service and National Mental Health Development Unit are collaborating to produce a series of resources to support practitioners and commissioners to provide better care for adolescents and young adults.</p>

The Government intends a wholesale shift in emphasis that puts mental health outcomes alongside physical health indicators in assessments of the quality of the national health service. The strategy will take a cross-Government and life course approach focussing on outcomes that are meaningful to patients and their families. The strategy is due to be published in the new year.</p>

Employment tribunals already have discretion to accept an out of time application depending on the reason for the delay. In some jurisdictions, employment tribunals may consider claims made out of time where it was not reasonably practicable for a claim to have been submitted within the time limit. In others, late claims may be considered where it is just and equitable to do so. Responses to a public consultation in 2007 on time limits for making employment tribunal claims did not evidence any significant problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.734W.2/1">Most expenditure in support of looked after children (including children in care) is through local authorities. In 2007-08 local authority net expenditure recorded by them under the heading of children looked after amounted to &#163;2,181 million, and in 2008-09 the figure was &#163;2,453 million. Data for 2009-10 will be available in early 2011. These figures do not include other expenditure which contributes to supporting looked after children, such as expenditure on social worker salaries, on undertaking assessments of need or on delivering wider services such as school and leisure services. Over the last three financial years the Department itself has directly spent some &#163;65 million in support of looked after children through the Care Matters programme budget; other departmental spending programmes have also contributed to improving outcomes for these children.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.2/2">The cost to the Department since September 2008 of litigation in connection with looked after children, including in relation to care leavers and adoption, is in the region of &#163;60,000. The cost of local authorities of litigation in respect of looked after children is not collected centrally.</p>
