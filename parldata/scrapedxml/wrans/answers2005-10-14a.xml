	<p pid="a.601W.3/2">Our assessment concludes that the Commission's initial proposal would probably have an adverse impact on the continued efficiency and effectiveness of UK ports which would not be adequately balanced by any compensating advantage to the sector or its stakeholders. It is the Government's view, therefore, that significant improvements are needed in many aspects of the directive if it is to benefit UK ports and a thorough assessment of potential impacts across Europe will be needed before the European Parliament and Council are in a position to adopt a text.</p>

	<p pid="a.602W.3/4">The scheme in Northern Ireland which requires new drivers to display an &quot;R&quot; plate and restrict speed to 45mph for their first year of driving has been evaluated. This concluded that there is little firm evidence of effectiveness in relation to accident prevention, compliance or offence rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.602W.3/5">The consultation document and decision letter mentioned in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October</phrase> also considered options for restricting the speed of newly qualified drivers or the power of cars that they may use. The Department concluded that the disadvantages of a lower speed limit for new drivers outweighed the advantages and that it would not be effective to restrict newly qualified drivers to low-powered cars. Even small-engined cars can be driven at speeds well above 70mph and certainly faster than is suitable for many road conditions. The Department considered that the way forward was to focus on improving the educational environment so that learners were better trained and that driver training services were of high quality.</p>

	<p pid="a.605W.0/1">The SRA has recently completed a study into the future use of Waterloo International Platforms. This has been placed in the Libraries of the House and is available on the DfT website. The Study has concluded that there is a strong case to use the platforms for domestic train services once Eurostar have stopped using the station.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.0/2">A decision on which specific services should use the platforms will be informed by the SRA/DfT Southern Regional Planning Assessment (to be published in spring 2006) the Network Rail Route Utilisation Study for the South West Main Line routes (which will go to consultation in spring 2006) and further work to be carried out by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.0/3">Ultimately if South Western train services are to use the platforms then this could be incorporated into the new franchise specification (as an option). It is likely that the earliest that domestic services could use the platforms would be the middle of 2008, following the transfer of Eurostar services and any necessary infrastructure works at Waterloo.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.0/4">It should also be recognised that other (significant) infrastructure investment may be required on the rail network to fully utilise these platforms given the existing constraints on the approaches to Waterloo which are not impacted upon by the withdrawal of Eurostar. Any infrastructure changes will of course be subject to the normal investment process and subject to a value for money assessment and tests on affordability.</p>

These summits have involved a wide range of stakeholders from the public, private and voluntary sectors. Consultation on the business plans individual cities are being invited to prepare is a matter for the cities themselves and we are not aware that any specific timescale has been set for this. Most business plans are likely to draw on existing plans and programmes at city and city-region level which have already been subject to consultation, so further consultation may not be required.</p>

This is an inefficient use of resources. Under the new system, these activities will be handled by administrative staff outside the regional control centres. The activities essential to the running of the control centres are included in a comprehensive document on scope that has already been widely reviewed within the Fire and Rescue Service. A questionnaire on out-of scope activities is currently on circulation to individual fire and rescue services. Analysis of the responses when completed will fully define those activities which are not in the scope of the control centres. It will identify those which are related to the running of the fire and rescue service but not to the control centres, and those which are not related to FRS activity at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.609W.9/1">No detailed costs and savings for the South East are available at present as the FiReControl business case exists at national level only. Nationally, over a 15 year period (2004&ndash;05 to 2018&ndash;19) running the control service and implementing the FiReControl project will cost &pound;988 million at 2005 prices. Leaving the control service in the existing 46 controls would cost &pound;1,090 million. After the final control centre goes live, there will be annual savings of over &pound;20 million (30 per cent. reduction in annual running costs) which will be available for spending on other local initiatives such as community fire safety. The criteria for the project include ensuring that response times will be as good as or better than those achieved at present, and the project includes features that will help to reduce response times. These include the creation of a national network and dynamic mobilising of appliances i.e. mobilising direct to the vehicles which are closest to the incident, wherever these may be.</p>

	<p pid="a.611W.2/1">Depending on its scale and pace, growth will require potentially major upgrades to utilities infrastructure with significant lead-in times (often three to five years). Our objective is to encourage adequate long-term planning by the utilities to avoid delivery of growth being constrained or prevented by the late programming of investment. The role of the public sector is principally to help ensure that the utility companies are properly equipped with the information needed to plan for growth, as well as providing maximum certainty around the magnitude, timing, and location of growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/2">Public consultation and examination of growth plans for the Milton Keynes/South Midlands sub region involved a number of the major utilities or their representatives and the sub regional growth strategy was published in March this year. To follow this up local authorities and delivery agencies in the growth areas liaise with the utility companies to ensure that, as sub regional plans and Local Development Framework information becomes available, the utility companies can update their plans for investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.613W.5/1">The letter to which the hon. member refers was a reminder to local authorities of their existing powers in this area. It also alerted them to forthcoming guidance on the use of section 215 notices, which ODPM published in January. The letter was advisory only, and information about representations is not kept in the manner requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.5/2">We expect to consult later this year on two changes to Article 4 Direction procedure, and also on some new guidance to replace that issued in DoE Circular 9/95, General Development Order Consolidation 1995. The proposed legal changes will increase a local planning authority's power to make directions without having to wait for the Secretary of State's approval, and enable them to bring directions into immediate effect where it is difficult to trace owners of all the land covered by a direction.</p>

Munich Re, for example, has been tracking the economic and insured losses as a result of natural and weather-related catastrophes since the 1970s. In the last few years, it has published annual reviews of natural catastrophes. Estimates for 2004 suggest that economic losses due to weather-related natural catastrophes amounted to over US$100 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.2/2">As a member of the European single market the Government cannot, by itself introduce mandatory minimum standards in the UK which would prevent the free trade of products on the basis of their energy efficiency. In order to do this we need to persuade the European Commission and other member states that this is necessary across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.2/3">The recently agreed eco-design for energy using products (EUP) framework directive will provide a streamlined and effective route for setting EU-wide environmental requirements for traded goods such as boilers, fridges, air-conditioning and consumer electronics.

	<p pid="a.616W.2/4">Based on evidence gained from the use of existing directives aimed at removing inefficient fluorescent lighting ballasts, hot-water boilers and refrigeration products which will now be incorporated into EUP it is estimated that by 2020 EUP alone could save around 10 percent. of the EU's total annual energy consumption.</p>

We believe that these provisions, where they can be shown to be both technically feasible and cost-effective, will act as an important driver for delivering significant improvements in the information available to UK consumers about their own energy consumption. Under our presidency of the EU, we are working closely with other member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament to take forward negotiations on this important dossier with the aim of securing early adoption.</p>

	<p pid="a.618W.0/1">Over the years, there have been consistent calls for the introduction of a system of applications to higher education based on students' actual achievements rather than predicted grades. These include, in 1997 Sir Ron (now Lord) Dearing's National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, and Sir Mike Tomlinson in his Inquiry into A Level Standards in 2002. Most recently, in his report on Fair Admissions to Higher Education, Professor Steven Schwartz concluded that the current system, relying on predicted grades, more than half of which are inaccurate, cannot be fair. That is why, in September 2004, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills asked for work to be carried out to identify ways to resolve the practical issues associated with implementing a new system based on known examination results.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-09">9 September 2005</phrase>, after detailed work with key stakeholders, the Department launched a public consultation making a number of proposals for changes to the higher education applications system including a proposition that predicted exam results should play no part in applications and admissions decisions. Analysis confirming the extent to which predicted grades are inaccurate was provided in a report prepared for the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) (&quot;Estimating the Reliability of Predicted Grades&quot;). This analysis confirmed that only 45 per cent. of predicted grades are accurate and that they are most inaccurate for students from lower socio-economic groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.0/3">The consultation document proposes a number of changes to the existing higher education applications process that could be made by the academic year 2008/09. In the longer term, it also acknowledges that there can be more than one way of achieving the objectives of a post-qualification applications system and sets out two possible approaches on which it is seeking views. One would involve institutions making no formal offers of places until after exam results; the other would see some places offered before results and a proportion of places reserved until afterwards. The consultation also welcomes the idea that new approaches may appear as a result of the discussion it will stimulate. The consultation runs until <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>, after which there will be a period to analyse the responses and post a summary on the consultation website.</p>

	<p pid="a.618W.3/2">The Permanent Secretary was not personally involved in clearing the press release, nor in the arrangements for announcing the consultation on Improving the Higher Education Applications Process which drew on Dr. Hayward's report to UCAS on the reliability of predicted examination grades. These functions were carried out by departmental officials. In so doing, there was a genuine and regrettable mistake in the press release that referred to a finding that was not supported by the UCAS report. I have apologised for this publicly. This inaccuracy however should not be allowed to obscure the important fact that the majority of predicted results are inaccurate and that they are most inaccurate for students from lower socio-economic groups. The intention is to develop a fair system for all students. Different groups over time have argued that predicted results should play less of a role in higher education applications and admissions decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.621W.6/1">175,000 children under the age of five in Mali, and 57,000 vulnerable people in Burkina Faso are receiving emergency feeding with DFID support. DFID sent a humanitarian assessment team to both countries in the second week of August to complement our close monitoring of the regional nutritional crisis and to identify how DFID might best respond. As a result, we have provided $1.2 million (&pound;675,000) to support the relief efforts in the two countries. $1 million is supporting the World Food Programme's (WFP) emergency operation in Mali, and $200,000 to support the Catholic Relief Services' work in Burkina Faso.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.6/2">These allocations bring the total amount of DFID funding for the countries of the Sahel region, including Niger, to &pound;3.925 million. In Mauritania, nutritional surveys undertaken by partners have not revealed a significant crisis. The WFP has a three year feeding operation there which is funded sufficiently well to cope with the immediate and imminent need. We are actively verifying whether current responses continue to be sufficient in the countries of the region. If we find that this is not the case, we will respond.</p>

	<p pid="a.622W.3/1">Some developing countries highly dependant on the revenues from oil exhibit high levels of corruption, conflict, environmental degradation and poverty. But this is not inevitable. Oil can and should make a major contribution to poverty reduction and sustained economic growth, if it is managed wisely and the revenues earned used properly and fairly. For this reason, the UK Government set up and now takes the lead on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This provides assistance to countries and companies seeking to increase the transparency of payments by oil, gas and mining companies and revenues received by host governments. Progress has already been made, for example, in Azerbaijan, the first audited reports have been published and are being discussed by the Azeri people.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.3/2">The causes of climate change are largely due to the use of fossil fuels in industrialised countries. These countries have the primary responsibility to reduce their own emissions of energy related, greenhouse gases and lead by example. The UK is acting to reduce emissions, both nationally and internationally. We have set demanding domestic targets to cut emissions and expand the use of renewable energy and are also working to promote international agreement on a global framework to tackle climate change to follow the Kyoto protocol in 2012. Through our G8 and EU presidency initiatives on climate change, we are promoting a new international dialogue on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development and agreed a range of measures to help developing countries adopt more efficient, lower carbon energy technologies.</p>

	<p pid="a.626W.5/2">The national health service has historically been funded to provide 12 per cent. more pre-registration house officer/foundation programme year one posts in England than the anticipated number of graduates from English medical schools and this is planned to continue in the future. A foundation programme workforce group, operating as part of the modernising medical careers implementation process, is overseeing the allocation of funding from the multi-professional education and training (MPET) budget that will enable the creation of the increased number of foundation programme posts required over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.626W.5/3">In line with &quot;Shifting the balance of power&quot;, the Government have devolved local workforce planning to strategic health authorities (SHAs). It is the responsibility of primary care trusts and SHAs to analyse their local situation and develop plans, in liaison with their local NHS trusts and primary care providers, to ensure that the number of junior posts matches the number of newly qualified staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.2/1">Through the mobile telecommunications and health research programme (<a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>) the Department is contributing to the 13-nation interphone study of mobile phone use and brain tumours including acoustic neuroma. Results from three relatively small parts of this study already published suggest there is no substantial risk of acoustic neuroma in the first 10 years of use although the authors state that an increased risk after longer term use could not be ruled out. The results to date are not entirely consistent but emphasise the need for continued high quality research. We will await the conclusions of the full study due next year.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.8/1">In December 2003 a new strategy for the management of security in the national health service was published, entitled &quot;A Professional Approach to Managing Security in the NHS&quot;. The introduction of local security management specialists provides NHS health bodies, for the first time ever, with professional skills and expertise to tackle security-related problems such as violence against NHS staff. This is reinforced by accredited training, advice and guidance from the NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS).</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.8/2">The local security management specialists' work is underpinned by two national frameworks; the first deals with tackling violence against NHS staff, replacing the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; campaign, and the second deals with general security management measures. The first framework introduced a number of measures to proactively and reactively tackle the problem of violence against staff. As a result of this new framework, it is estimated that in 2004&ndash;05, 85,000 frontline NHS staff received training in how to prevent and manage violence and the number of criminal sanctions identified involving those who have assaulted NHS staff has risen fifteen-fold; from 51 in 2002&ndash;03 to 759 in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

Of these, 251,805 resulted in the issue of form SDLT8 (request for further information relating to incomplete or incorrectly completed returns). This represents 25.85 per cent. of the returns processed electronically. Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August 2005</phrase> the percentage of cases where SDLT's are issued has continued to fall to approximately 15 per cent. HMRC will continue to work to reduce the incidents. It has also been possible to file SDLT returns on-line directly into the SDLT automated system. Using this service removes the need to use post, and (because of the in-built checks) has a very high probability of returns being complete and correct first time. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is working with representative bodies to encourage the use of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.637W.8/2">A recent review by HMRC of SDLT legislation revealed that the statutory provisions for charging interest on SDLT were incomplete and that HMRC had been collecting and paying interest in error for a period since <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase>. As soon as HMRC became aware of this problem all interest charges were suspended, as were the reminders for interest outstanding. Any interest already paid is being refunded. HMRC will be contacting each purchaser affected, and their agent, where applicable, as soon as possible to repay the interest paid. Further information is available on the HMRC website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/sdlt_interest_qa.htm">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/sdlt_interest_qa.htm</a>. The appropriate legislation has now been introduced and interest on late payments of SDLT is chargeable from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-26">26 September 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.639W.0/1">It is important that appropriate procedures exist to oblige officials to report serious wrongdoing and to enjoy protection if they do so in good faith. The United Kingdom supported the introduction of the &quot;Whistleblowers' Charter&quot; and pressed strongly for these procedures to be included in the revised Staff Regulation, which came into force in May 2004. This charter, and the rules now in force, obliges the staff of the EU institutions to raise any concerns they have with regard to serious wrongdoing with either the Director-General of their institution, the Secretary-General, &quot;persons in equivalent positions&quot;, or the independent European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.0/2">Dorte Schmidt-Brown made allegations of wrongdoing against senior managers at the European Union's statistical body, Eurostat. Disciplinary procedures were opened immediately against the senior managers allegedly involved, and their cases are now in the hands of French prosecutors who will hold them to account if the outcome of their investigations confirms that serious wrongdoing has taken place. It is clear the irregular financial practices in existence at Eurostat in the late 1990s left the EU's resources vulnerable to fraud. But thanks to the new systems put in place, these practices have been discovered and the financial management improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.0/3">Ms Schmidt-Brown raised a libel action (against a UK company &quot;Eurogramme&quot;, that she alleges was improperly awarded Eurostat contacts) before the High Court of England and Wales, seeking damages for defamation she claimed to have suffered through statements made by the company. That case was settled out of court.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.0/4">In December 2002, Ms Schmidt-Brown asked the Court of First instance to order the Commission to pay the costs of her libel case in the High Court (&euro;75,000), claiming that they, as her employer, had a duty themselves to take the steps necessary to protect her reputation. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July 2005</phrase>, the Court ruled against Ms Schmidt-Brown. It would not be appropriate for us to comment on this judgment by the Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.0/5">Further information can be found in OLAF's annual activities report which is available at: <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud/index_en.html">http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud/index_en.html</a> for more information on the progress of EU activity in this area. The report provides information on the different sources of information it receives which lead to investigations, including whistleblowers.</p>

We estimate over 20 people died in clashes between the security forces and protestors. As Presidency of the EU, we demarched the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-22">22 August</phrase> to express our concern at the excessive response by the Iranian authorities, the reports of arrests and harassment of journalists and the closure of two newspapers for their coverage of the protests.

	<p pid="a.643W.6/1">A great deal of debate was generated in both Houses of Parliament, when interest in this issue first arose in December 2003. We consulted the United States embassy in London, who noted that the export of anthrax from the United States to Iraq in the 1980's was subject to scrutiny by the relevant US authority. Export licenses were granted for the transfers in accordance with controls in place at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.6/2">The quantities exported were consistent with the requirements of legitimate scientific research and the United States authorities judged that there was no reason to suppose that the materials would be used for anything other than legitimate scientific purposes, namely the manufacture of vaccines. Anthrax, in particular, is endemic in Iraq.</p>

Particulate matter is thought to worsen the condition of those who are already ill rather than being an absolute cause of death. Therefore deaths caused by particulate matter alone cannot be solely calculated. The Committee of Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) have however developed a methodology based on a dose response relationship that allows estimates to be made of deaths brought forward affected by particulate matter PM10 and the calculations for Northern Ireland would suggest that deaths brought forward due to particulate matter PM10 were: 177 in 2001, 157 in 2002, 180 in 2003, and 147 in 2004.

	<p pid="a.650W.2/2">The Criminal Justice Review acknowledged that, subject to conditional safeguards, such schemes could also have a role to play in dealing with the types of low level crime which commonly concern local communities. My officials have therefore been working with the key criminal justice agencies and the representatives of the community restorative justice schemes on the development of guidelines to support the management of appropriate referrals from the statutory agencies for a community restorative solution. Once these guidelines have been agreed it is proposed to establish a pilot scheme to test the mechanisms in a practical environment.</p>
