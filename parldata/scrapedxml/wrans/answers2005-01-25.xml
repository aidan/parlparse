	<p pid=".208W.2/1">While the projections published by DTI in November 2004 confirmed that, on the basis of existing policy measures, we were on track to go well beyond our Kyoto Protocol commitment, they also showed that we were only likely to achieve a 14 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.2/2">The shortfall is because projected emissions were higher than previous estimates due mainly to lower nuclear generation, higher electricity demand and higher coal generation and because the measures to reduce emissions were in aggregate expected to deliver less than originally anticipated.

	<p pid=".209W.3/2">The UK has a small number of known cold-water coral reefs. The best studied of these is the Darwin Mounds some 150 km off the north-west coast of Scotland. When last surveyed in 2000, there was evidence of damage from bottom trawling. The UK sought, and was granted in 2003, emergency European Commission measures to restrict this type of fishing and so avoid further damage to the reef. The emergency measures were made permanent in 2004. It is hoped that surveys in 2005 will enable the condition of other possible reefs to be checked.</p>
	<p pid=".209W.3/3">It is not certain what the full effects of global warming will be on the seas of the UK although it seems unlikely that warming of the seas will be great enough to affect cold-water corals in the short to medium future. Deep-water reefs are less likely to be affected.</p>
	<p pid=".209W.3/4">The rise in CO <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is likely to cause a rise in acidity of surface waters, and affect the amount of calcium carbonate used by coral reefs for growth in shallow waters. How these predicted effects in shallower waters will affect deeper waters is not known, but any decreases in amounts of available calcium carbonate will not be beneficial to coral reefs.</p>

	<p pid=".209W.6/1">The Government's obligation under the Birds Directive is to ensure that measures taken under the directive do not worsen the initial status of the species protected. The directive was made in 1979 and although no accurate figures for wintering or breeding cormorant numbers are available for this date, it is generally accepted from monitoring of trends that wintering numbers in Britain have increased around four-fold since that date. These are our legal obligations. However, we have no intention of allowing the cormorant population to be reduced to anything approaching this level and the current policy, which aims to resolve cormorant/fishery conflicts at problem sites, will balance the interests of fisheries with the sustainable conservation status of the cormorant.</p>

	<p pid=".212W.0/1">The Government are not in a position to impose mandatory environmental standards specific to housing in the Milton Keynes South Midlands sub-region as the boundaries of the growth areas do not have any legal status. Furthermore, to set such mandatory standards could potentially lead to perverse consequences, by providing a disincentive to development in the growth areas relative to other areas.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.0/2">However, the Government are keen to promote the construction of sustainable and energy efficient housing in the growth areas and believes that local delivery vehicles (LDVs) have an important role to play in promoting all aspects of sustainable development. Draft guidance has been circulated to the LDVs in the newer growth areas which identifies achievement of high quality design and higher environmental performance as being among their main objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".212W.0/3">More generally, the Government are keen to promote environmentally sustainable and energy efficient housing throughout the country. In line with the commitments made in the Energy White Paper and at the Better Building Conference work is in train on bringing the next major revision of the building regulations energy efficiency provisions into effect this year and to publish a Sustainable Buildings Code that will encourage energy efficiency standards above those in the regulations and address sustainability more widely. For publicly funded housing, the Housing Corporation is already recommending that social housing schemes should achieve an EcoHomes rating of &quot;very good&quot; from April 2005 with the &quot;good&quot; rating as an essential condition for a project to receive a grant.</p>

	<p pid=".223W.2/2">Under the national scheme EMA is not available to young people in custody aged 16 years and over. The reason is that EMA is an incentive to support young people with the costs of their learning, and for those in custody these costs are already met. Connexions services and other agencies promote EMA as part of a range of services and support to help young people leaving custody return to learning.</p>

Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires local authorities and schools to obtain the written consent of the Secretary of State before they can dispose of any part of a school's playing field. Applications to sell school playing fields are only approved where it is clear that they meet the needs of local schools and their communities and that any proceeds are used to improve school sports provision or educational facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".229W.3/1">The report &quot;The Influence of the School in the decision to participate in learning post-16&quot; indicated a number of reasons why the provision of a sixth form within a school might be an important influence on the decision of young people to participate in post-16 education and training:</p>
	<p pid=".229W.3/2" class="indent">(i) &quot;Schools with sixth forms have a ready made post-16 route and pupils are more channelled in their choices and decisions.&quot; Such schools often actively promoting post-16 academic routes, compared to other forms of post-16 participation which were much less clearly promoted. In schools with no sixth form there was a greater element of choice and decisions were aimed more generally at providing students with opportunities that more adequately addressed their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.3/3" class="indent">(ii) &quot;Careers advice in schools with sixth forms was found to be qualitatively different from that in 11 to 16 schools.&quot; Pupils attending 11 to 16 schools were more positive about the careers education they had received and often exposed to a rich network of information, guidance and advice from diverse sources. Pupils in schools with sixth forms felt their advice and guidance to be less impartial than those in schools with no sixth form. Schools with sixth forms tended to have a strong academic tradition and a focus on university entrance, and an expectation that students would continue in full-time education post-16 which may not be the right decision for the young people concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.3/4" class="indent">(iii) &quot;There was a greater tendency in schools with a sixth form to provide post-16 advice and guidance which is more closely related to academic sixth form provision.&quot; Knowledge about post-16 provision in schools and colleges tended to be strongest among pupils in schools with sixth forms and weakest in schools with no sixth forms. The opposite was true about knowledge of post-16 training and labour markets.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.3/5">Other important influential issues of the school &quot;in the decision of young people to participate in learning post-16&quot; were the socio-economic environment of the school, and the schools' culture, ethos and leadership.</p>

The low level of cultivation and low production figure in 2001 reflect the Taliban ban on opium cultivation; the ban did not however address the underlying causes of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, which was enforced with a mix of threat and bribery and drove up the price of opium, benefiting those with opium stockpiles.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.2/1">The sectarian violence in El-Kosheh in January 2001, which left 20 Christians and one Muslim dead, was deeply concerning. We have followed the case closely and made our concerns known at the time, including visiting the area. We were initially encouraged that the Prosecutor-General persistently sought judicial review of early judgments in the case.

	<p pid=".239W.5/2">As soon as the Government received news of the tsunami in the Indian ocean, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) activated its emergency plans for handling a major crisis overseas involving British nationals.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>, the FCO established temporary offices working in all the affected areas to offer support and assistance to British nationals. Providing this support was the priority of all FCO posts in those areas. Our Embassy in Bangkok and our High Commission in Colombo were reinforced with consular staff from both London and other posts in the region. A rapid deployment team of 18 was sent to Colombo. There are currently 45 staff in Bangkok and 32 in Phuket providing consular assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/4">In the immediate aftermath of the event, FCO staff provided those British nationals in the affected areas with the full range of consular support including helping them to access medical facilities, issuing emergency travel documents and registering missing persons. An FCO charter flight brought 98 passengers back from Thailand on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/5">The Government also ensured that there were full reception arrangements at airports for people returning to the UK. This included tailored medical attention where necessary, assistance with getting home and access to psychological and emotional support services. The British Red Cross also established a Help Line for victims of the disaster and their family and a family support network for those affected.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.5/6">FCO officials and UK police personnel are now working with the families of the victims to repatriate remains where appropriate and to help the injured get home. There are 84 UK police personnel in the affected areas helping to identify people as quickly as possible. Police family liaison officers have been assigned to bereaved families. There are currently over 300 liaison officers assigned to families. The FCO has put together a package of financial and other assistance to those affected by the tsunami. This package includes meeting the cost of repatriating remains; immediate medical expenses for those seriously injured; medical evacuation; long-term psychological support; and return travel for two members of the victim's family to the region and five nights accommodation.</p>

	<p pid=".247W.3/1">Prior to 1994, the SAA Department provided tap water for Committee and meeting rooms. A trial was conducted in that year in response to requests from Members who frequently found the tap water stale and undrinkable. It was found that the use of bottled water was significantly more convenient and required fewer staff, as well as being more hygienic and better tasting. Subsequent experience with operating this system has confirmed these benefits. They are particularly valuable given the increase in the number of committee rooms following the opening of Portcullis House and the earlier sittings of committees under the revised sitting hours. For these reasons there are no plans to return to the previous arrangements.</p>

Its food disposal policy is designed to meet these legal obligations and to take all possible precautions against the risk of causing food poisoning to any person consuming food prepared by or sold by the Refreshment Department.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.0/2">The policy on the disposal of food left over from receptions is that same as the policy on the disposal of left-over foods from its catering outlets. Fresh-cooked foods that have retained a core temperature of 65oC or above while on display are chilled rapidly and are then either held chilled or frozen for re-use. Hot foods that have fallen below this safe temperature, or that have been re-heated, are disposed of with the general refuse. Chilled foods that have been maintained at a temperature of 8oC or below are retained and re-offered for sale provided that they are within any &quot;use-by&quot; date stamp. Foods which have exceeded 8oC are also disposed of with the general waste.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.0/3">Although the Department makes every effort to re-use foods that are still safe to consume, there are some occasions on which this is not possible. From time to time, the Department has contacted charities assisting the homeless to discuss the possibility of donating left-over food. Such inquiries to-date have been unsuccessful for two principal reasons: the charities (as part of their own due diligence procedures required under the food hygiene legislation) are unwilling to accept foods that have been prepared in our own kitchens; and, the charities have been unable or unwilling to make collection arrangements for any packaged foods because of the infrequency and relatively low quantity of such food being available to them.</p>

	<p pid=".249W.3/1">In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol established the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The purpose of the CDM is to enable developed countries and economies in transition (more precisely, those countries that are included in Annex I to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) to meet their greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets (5 per cent. compared to 1990 levels by the period 2008&ndash;12) at lowest possible cost by undertaking projects in developing countries. To be eligible under the CDM, projects must also assist in the achievement of sustainable development, and contribute to the attainment of the environmental goals of the Framework Convention.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.3/2">To fall within the scope of the CDM, any project proposal to extinguish burning coal mines would need to meet these three criteria. It would further need to be shown that the resulting emissions reductions were &quot;additional&quot; (i.e. going beyond what would have happened in the absence of the project) and calculated in accordance with an approved CDM methodology. To date, the Department for International Development (DFID) has not received any requests from developing countries to provide assistance to extinguish coal mine fires. We would encourage any country seeking international support to consider using the CDM.</p>

	<p pid=".250W.6/1">DFID's contribution to HIPC debt relief covers the UK pledge to the HIPC Trust Fund and the UK's policy of going beyond the requirements of HIPC to cancel 100 per cent. of all bilateral debts to HIPC countries. The vast majority of HIPC debt write-off is financed by the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD).</p>

	<p pid=".252W.2/1">The Government of Iraq has said that it is committed over the medium term, to enhancing the effectiveness of social safety nets in Iraq by moving from a food ration system, which handed out virtually free food to the entire population of Iraq, to a cash distribution system targeted at the poor and unemployed. The aim will be to help domestic agriculture, encourage private trade and remove price distortions, at the same time as ensuring that families in need are properly safeguarded. The details have yet to be determined, and are expected to be followed up by the Iraqi Transitional Government after the forthcoming elections. DFID supports the reform in principle. DFID staff and advisers will continue to maintain contact with the Iraqi authorities, and with interested international organisations including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World Food Programme, to ensure that the interests of poor and vulnerable families in Iraq are protected.</p>

	<p pid=".252W.5/1">Mauritania is poor and often short of its food staples. A high proportion of the population relies on agricultural production to satisfy its food and income needs. During prolonged drought, communities may go hungry through poor yields or lack of recourse to alternative sources of income. In 2004 Mauritania was badly affected by the worst invasion of locusts in West Africa for 15 years. Millet and legumes suffered serious damage; sorghum and rice were less affected. Access to food is already posing problems for many households, both rural and urban, which are directly or indirectly affected by the crisis. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that 2004 production will only amount to 64 per cent. of the 5-year average. More food imports, including food aid, may be required. DFID stands ready to contribute to urgent humanitarian needs in Mauritania, and other countries in West Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.5/2">DFID provided &pound;1.5 million to the FAO's emergency international appeal for locust control and eradication operations in West Africa in 2004. UK funding assisted the immediate emergency control of swarms until December 2004. The European Commission is providing &euro;23.5 million (&pound;16.33 million, UK share about &pound;3 million) to assist those countries worst affected. The FAO operations may need to be continued in northern Mauritania to counter remaining immature swarms gathered there, and also in the Mahgreb countries until the spring, to reduce the scale of potential re-infestation of the Sahel in summer 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".252W.5/3">In 2002&ndash;03 DFID contributed &pound;1 million to the World Food Programme's regional appeal, which covered five countries in the region, but was mainly focused on Mauritania where the drought situation was most severe. DFID also contributed &pound;0.5 million to an Oxfam appeal focused on the most badly affected areas in the south of the country.</p>

	<p pid=".253W.2/1">The UN World Food Programme (WFP) appeal for US$30.8 million for Mauritania issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-17">17 January</phrase> aims to provide food aid to 400,000 people in 33 of the most vulnerable communities until 2007. About 60 per cent. of the proposal is for creation of productive assets through food for work activities, the construction of small dams, and improving village water supplies. These activities may be useful, but DFID believes that the sustained developmental impact of food aid is limited. DFID stands ready to contribute to urgent humanitarian needs in Mauritania, and other countries in West Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".253W.2/2">DFID does not have a bilateral development partnership with Mauritania, but does provide a significant amount through multilateral channels, mainly the EC programme, of which the UK share amounted to some &pound;6 million in 2003. We have also provided humanitarian assistance in recent years in response to the severe drought and food shortages.</p>

	<p pid=".255W.8/1">In response to the tsunami disaster which followed the earthquake in South East Asia, the Department for International Development has committed &pound;75 million towards the immediate and medium term needs. This assistance is being channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement, non-governmental organisations and by DFID direct action. Of this, &pound;40 million has been pledged as the UK contribution to the UN flash appeal. Requests for support from non-governmental organisations are still being received and we are continuing our direct action in support of priority needs. We estimate that the combined value of these will be about &pound;25 million. The balance is being provided through the Red Cross, local initiatives being considered by DFID country offices, and the Ministry of Defence to cover the marginal costs of their operation.</p>
	<p pid=".255W.8/2">In addition to the &pound;75 million already committed for immediate and medium term needs, DFID is preparing plans to support longer-term rehabilitation and reconstruction. DFID's focus is expected to be on support to rebuilding livelihoods and services for poor people in affected countries. The governments concerned are currently completing needs assessments with the support of the World Bank and others, and DFID will consider how we can best channel our support once we have the completed assessments of need.</p>
	<p pid=".255W.8/3">We will work to ensure that the views of the poorest and most vulnerable are taken into account throughout the process of rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid=".255W.8/4">It is clear that there needs to be an early warning system and more effective disaster response for the Indian Ocean and probably other areas too. The Association of South East Asian Nations has already committed to a system for their region, and the UK is ready to provide support and contribute to funding. Last week, DFID's parliamentary Under Secretary of State, attended the Kobe World Disaster Reduction Conference which discussed the setting up of a framework to achieve a global warning system covering all natural hazards, and all countries by June 2007.</p>

	<p pid=".256W.2/1">The governments affected are currently completing assessments of the longer-term rehabilitation and reconstruction needs with the support of the World Bank and other donors. We expect these to be ready in the next few weeks. DFID will make an announcement of plans for supporting the longer-term efforts&mdash;which will be additional to the &pound;75 million already committed for immediate and medium-term needs&mdash;once we have a clear idea of the need, and of the delivery mechanisms preferred by the governments concerned. DFID will work to ensure that the views of the poorest and most vulnerable are taken into account throughout the process of rehabilitation. It will be important that the donor response is well co-ordinated. DFID will also work to ensure that the UN relief effort is sustained and that there is a smooth transition from the recovery phase to longer-term rehabilitation.</p>

	<p pid=".258W.0/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Clwyd, South constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road casualties in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 290,607 in 2003, and the numbers of children aged under 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 4,100 in 2003. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;07 to 40.9 billion in 2003&ndash;04, a rise of 27 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK's two main pollutants&mdash;nitrous oxides and particles&mdash;fell by 31 per cent. and 27 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".265W.12/1">We need to ensure that we address the underlying causes of those who beg. If we help those who beg because of drug use to get access to effective treatment we help them, help communities and help those intimidated by begging. Better use of enforcement powers and alternative giving schemes will help to address the underlying and immediate problems.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.12/2">Begging is already a criminal offence, by making the offence of begging recordable the offender's details will be entered on the police national computer and there are powers to enable the offender to be finger-printed. This enables the police to identify repeat offenders and the courts will be able to issue community sentences, rather than fines, for those convicted a fourth time for an offence. This may include drug treatment. Since the end of July this year, begging has been included as a trigger offence under the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme. This will mean that those charged with begging will be drug tested and will enhance their opportunities for the underlying causes of their behaviour to be addressed and to route out repeat offending by offering treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.12/3">Members of the public often find begging intimidating. A MORI survey carried out in August 2003 for the Antisocial Behaviour Unit at the Home Office found that two thirds of respondents resent being approached by those who beg and over half will not use a cash point if someone is begging near it.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.12/4">The Antisocial Behaviour Unit at the Home Office are working with five areas around the country: Brighton, Bristol, Camden, Westminster and Leeds to tackle begging.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.12/5">The approach developed in these areas involves a 'twin track' approach of enforcement and support; addressing the underlying causes of begging such as drugs as well as taking enforcement action when people don't heed advice or offers of support.</p>
	<p pid=".265W.12/6">Initial findings from the trailblazing areas indicate a reduction in begging and positive outcomes for former beggars. More detailed findings from these areas will emerge in March 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".279W.8/1">Custodial penalties are enforced and administered within the private and public sector prisons system. Community penalties are enforced and administered largely under arrangements made by local probation boards and with electronic monitoring contractors. Provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will introduce tougher requirements for the courts when dealing with breaches of community orders. The Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill, currently before Parliament, includes provisions further to develop offender management within the National Offender Management Service. Measures include extended powers to direct the contracting out of probation services and the preparation of sentence plans for all offenders receiving custodial or community penalties.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.8/2">Financial penalties are enforced by the magistrates courts. The Department for Constitutional Affairs' Enforcement Programme is delivering a wide programme of change aimed at improving the enforcement and administration of financial penalties. These include improving intelligence; a new legislative framework for enforcement provided by the Courts Act 2003; and taking the opportunity offered by the launch of Her Majesty's Courts Service to introduce more effective and efficient ways of working.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.8/3">Most fixed penalty notices are enforced by prosecution or by the registration of a fine against a recipient who fails to pay the penalty or request a court hearing within the specified time. Registered fines are then enforced by the magistrates court in the same way as any other fine. For road traffic offences, consideration for prosecution follows when the endorsement of the statutory penalty points would result in disqualification. There are no plans to change this process.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.8/4">Fixed penalty notices for road traffic offences and disorder are administered through a computer system which operates in both police forces and magistrates courts. There are no plans to change this arrangement, although the computer systems will need upgrading in the medium term. Certain changes to the fixed penalty system are proposed in the Road Safety Bill currently before Parliament. These are designed essentially to enable road traffic fixed penalty notices to be given to those who do not hold a GB driving licence and counterpart and to enable more effective enforcement against those who cannot prove an address in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.2/1">The Police Standards Unit (PSD) has been working with Northamptonshire Police since the spring of 2004. This work has included a diagnostic phase which reviewed how the force manages burglary, vehicle and drug related crime. The review has also looked specifically at the use of forensic science and the custody processes in operation. The results of the diagnostic phase were a series of recommendations to enhance performance in each of the above areas, and these have been put to the force to consider for implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.2/2">In addition to this work, the force has completed a review of its structure and policing style and as a result of this has put into place the Northamptonshire Policing Model (NPM). This model restructures the force around different policing units to enable the force to deal more effectively with incident management and with community issues, crime investigations, and prisoner handling. The PSU is part-funding consultants who are working with the force to ensure that the NPM is implemented with minimum disruption, and that the focus on performance is vigorously maintained.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.2/1">Community support officers (CSOs) are not police officers, but police staff for whom the chief officer of the force may designate certain limited powers.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/2">The police service in England and Wales does not have a category of reserve police officers.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/3">The total number of police officers in England in Wales is usually expressed in terms of full-time equivalent posts for which part-time posts are aggregated and not pure headcount (which, consequently, is always a higher figure). The full-time equivalent figure is used when announcing overall police officer numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/4">The full-time equivalent strength for <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-31">31 August 2004</phrase> for the four forces in Wales was 7,414. The most recent data available on part-time police officers is <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>, when the full-time equivalent strength was also 7,414 and the headcount figure was 7,545. There were 188 part-time police officers in post at that date; this is 2.5 per cent. of the 7,545 headcount figure.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/5">In addition, there were 629 special constables on that date. At the end of September 2004, there were 130 CSOs in post in Wales. On <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> I announced that funding was available for an additional 125 community support officers for the four Welsh police forces.</p>

	<p pid=".284W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1995-03-31">31 March 1995</phrase> there were 1,703 police officers in the Hertfordshire Constabulary.

	<p pid=".284W.2/2">The increase in officer numbers and funding for Hertfordshire Police Authority was affected by changes to the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>, when parts of the Metropolitan Police District were transferred to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. The effects of the boundary changes were incorporated into the police funding formula and the overall transfer was in terms of financial resources, not officers.</p>
	<p pid=".284W.2/3">However, 183 MPS officers were seconded to Hertfordshire on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> for up to two years to assist with policing while Hertfordshire Constabulary arranged to recruit its own officers for the expanded force area.</p>
	<p pid=".284W.2/4">General grants (comprised of Home Office principal Police Grant, Revenue Support Grant and redistributed business rates) to Hertfordshire Police Authority have increased by 45.4 per cent. between 1995&ndash;96 and 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".284W.2/5">In addition to general Government grants, Hertfordshire Police Authority has also benefited from specific grants for targeted programmes, first introduced in 2000&ndash;01, such as the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF), to increase and maintain the number of police officers. Hertfordshire has had CFF funding to support the recruitment of 113 additional police officers.</p>

	<p pid=".287W.2/2">The Police Standards Unit (PSU) has been working with Nottinghamshire police since the spring of 2003. Developed in close liaison with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, there is now a mature and comprehensive programme of work in place aimed at supporting the force to reduce and better investigate crime through delivering performance improvements in operational and organisational areas.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.2/3">The key areas of PSU work with the force are on improving capacity for forensics, intelligence-led policing (with a particular focus on drugs and major crime), performance management, and on tackling persistent offenders. PSD is also working with the force on management of serious crime, sanction detections, and tackling violent crime.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.2/4">In addition to the investment of time from PSU staff, the total cost of PSU's work with Nottinghamshire police to date has been &pound;2.4million. This funding has been divided between provision of staff (including extra Scenes of Crime Officers and a drugs manager), infrastructure (e.g. provision of hardware) and consultancy support (e.g. on the force's performance management framework).</p>
	<p pid=".287W.2/5">Nottinghamshire police have achieved significant reductions in crime during the time that PSU have been working with them. For example, according to the latest figures from the force, over the last 12 months the number of domestic burglaries has fallen by 23 per cent., robberies by 26 pre cent. and vehicle crimes by 15 per cent., when compared to the previous 12 months.</p>

	<p pid=".287W.5/18" class="indent">Change 1: The level of the Multi Stage Fitness Test (Bleep Test) was lowered to 5.4 from 6.5</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/19">The reason for the multistage fitness test change was based on advice taken from Loughborough University who said that the minimum level of VO2m for a Prison Officer was 34.7, which equated to level 6.5 on a 20-metre bleep test.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/20">The Prison Service work to a 15-metre bleep test and it was proven by Roehampton University that the 15-metre course is harder than the 20-metre one. The minimum level of 34.7 VO2m on a 15-metre course is achieved at level 5.4, hence the change.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/21">Although the level of the bleep test was lowered it is still measuring the same level of VO2m which is the minimum fitness level required of a Prison Officer joining the Prison Service after <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-02">2 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/22" class="indent">Change 2 : The grip test which was lowered from 28kgf to 25kgf</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/23">The grip test was reduced due to the Prison Service changing its testing equipment with the original dyno-meter being was much more user friendly and suited a smaller hand. The change to the dyno-meters was made due to the high cost of repair (they had to be sent to America) as they worked on a hydraulic system that continually leaked.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.5/24">The new dyno-meter disadvantaged Prison Officers with a small hand and so the grip test was lowered to 25kgf to accommodate this.</p>

	<p pid=".289W.5/1">Guidance on crime recording was issued by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 2002 in the form of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS). The aim of the Standard was to promote greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime and to adopt a more victim oriented approach to crime recording. The police should record all reports of incidents, including attendance at disturbances in pubs and nightclubs, in accordance with the NCRS.</p>
	<p pid=".289W.5/2">The Standard states that all reports of incidents, whether from victims or third parties and whether crime-related or not, will result in the registration of an incident report by the police. Such an incident will subsequently be recorded as a crime if, on the balance of probability:</p>
	<p pid=".289W.5/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law (the police will determine this, based on their knowledge of the law and counting rules); and</p>
	<p pid=".289W.5/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> there is no credible evidence to the contrary.</p>

It is designed to avoid some of the negative outcomes&mdash;loss of employment or accommodation, and family breakdown&mdash;which can accompany even relatively short periods of full-time custody. Pilots of intermittent custody began on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-26">26 January 2004</phrase> at Kirkham Prison, in Lancashire, for male offenders and at Morton Hall Prison, in Lincolnshire, for females.</p>

The early results&mdash;including a high level of compliance with the orders&mdash;are very encouraging and we have decided to extend intermittent custody beyond the existing pilot sites. Planning for that expansion is already under way.</p>
	<p pid=".290W.8/3">The intermittent custody pilots are the subject of a detailed independent evaluation by a team from the Institute for Criminal Policy, based at King's College, London. Their final report will be completed in December 2005, but any emerging findings will be incorporated into the planning for the expansion of intermittent custody during the course of this year.</p>

SOPOs impose prohibitions on the offender and make him subject to the notification requirements for the duration of the order.

	<p pid=".293W.3/1">The department will not be publishing the papers from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. The papers received by the inquiry and their own records amount to more than 80,000 pages. The department is currently in the midst of reviewing and appraising the inquiry records prior to their transfer to The National Archives (TNA) where they can be made available for public inspection. This is a huge task and one that needs to be carried out with due sensitivity for the people involved. The current review schedule anticipates the inquiry transcripts being transferred to TNA in March 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".296W.5/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State has regular meetings with PCS officials to discuss and listen to their views and concerns about a wide range of issues facing the Department, including the efficiency challenge. These are generally national issues and therefore, do not focus on individual centres.</p>
	<p pid=".296W.5/2">However, since January 2004, The Pension Service has held regular meetings with their Pensions Trade Union Representatives to consult and share information on The Pension Service transformation programme. The criteria for selecting sites that would form the future pension service organisation, and the outcome for London Pension Centre (Glasgow), has been included as part of this dialogue.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.3/1">A recent amendment of European Union Directive 2000/13/EC on ingredient listing will require the declaration of all ingredients including allergens on pre-packed food from November 2005. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) consulted on the new requirements and the representations received indicated wide support for the new rules from allergy support groups and food manufacturers. In addition, a number of respondents identified the need for better control of the use of &quot;may contain&quot; allergen labelling, and the need for the provision of more allergen information for foods sold loose and in catering establishments. The FSA is actively considering with key stakeholders how best to encourage the provision of clearer, more helpful allergen information in these cases.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.6/2">The Department will work with a wide range of key players to ensure future developments in allergy care are credible and command respect and ownership of those people they are designed to help and the practitioners who care for them. The first key stage of this work will be to carry out a review of the available data and research on the epidemiology of allergic conditions, the demand for and provision of treatment and the effectiveness of relevant interventions. Developing a sound evidence base will be essential to determining the correct future direction of allergy services.</p>

	<p pid=".320W.5/1">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase>, ethylmercury was present in the combined diphtheria, tetanus and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTwP) in the form of the preservative thiomersal. With the introduction of a new combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated polio and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b (DTaP/IPV/Hib) vaccine on this date, the routine childhood immunisation programme no longer includes a thiomersal-containing vaccine.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.5/2">This change was made because the low risk of importation of polio in the United Kingdom provided the opportunity to move from the use of a live polio vaccine to an inactivated polio vaccine as well as the availability of an acellular pertussis vaccine which was as effective as the previous whole-cell pertussis. Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine does not contain (and never has contained) thiomersal.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.5/3">There is no credible scientific evidence that demonstrates a mechanism through which thiomersal in DTP could interact with MMR. The issue of whether ethylmercury-containing vaccines could affect a constituent of another vaccine has been considered by the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) as part of their review of multiple immunizations and immune dysfunction (Immunization Safety Review: 'Multiple Immunizations and Immune Dysfunction', 2002). Several large studies have found no evidence of a link between either MMR vaccine or thiomersal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
