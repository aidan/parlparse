Besides paying the arrears, DFID paid compensation for their losses.</p>

An administrative error resulted in invoices never being received by DFID, leading the storage company sub-contracted by DFID's freight contractor eventually to sell the effects to cover their costs. DFID's payment was a contribution to the total loss, with the bulk of the compensation paid by our freight contractor.</p>

This would equate to about 57,000 premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.2/2">From an ongoing survey of licensing authorities in England and Wales in relation to pubs, bars and nightclubs, we estimate that two-thirds (about 54,000) will have secured licences for a variety of hours beyond 11 pm and that about 80 per cent. of these (or about 43,000) will have terminal hours of 1 am or earlier.</p>

Under the Licensing Act 2003, premises apply for a one-off premises licence and then pay an annual charge for their licence thereafter. The charge is based on the rateable value of the property. The current fee structure for these two payments is as follows:</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="b.801W.5/15">The fee relating to an application for a personal licence has been set at &pound;37 to be paid every 10 years. This would not be paid by sports clubs that hold club premises certificates.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.5/16">The regulatory impact assessment that accompanies the fees regulations states that non commercial premises such as village and community halls and sports clubs tend to fall in fee bands A and B which should not place an undue or disproportionate burden on the premises affected. In addition, no fee is payable by a village hall or community centre if it intends only to put on entertainment. The Licensing Act 2003 also brings deregulatory benefits, reducing the number of administrative licensing processes under the previous arrangements by almost tenfold. This benefits village halls, community centres and sports clubs by removing the need to apply for several licences and permissions and allows them to offer a wider range of activities to their users and members under a single licence. Once the new licence is obtained, there will be no more form filling for committees unless the hall or sports club wish to change their licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.5/17">As part of our arrangements for monitoring the impact of the Licensing Act 2003, an Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel has been established to consider the impact of fees on a wide range of stakeholders, including village and community halls and sports clubs. The panel will deliver an interim report shortly, followed by a Final report in autumn 2006 detailing findings and where appropriate making recommendations for the development of the licensing fees regime. We will consider carefully the evidence from these exercises and any recommendations to help community and village halls and sports clubs operate within the new regime.</p>

	<p pid="b.809W.6/35">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.6/36">1.Figures for the North East are provided using a three-year rolled average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year-on-year changes. Figures are therefore not the same as previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. Due to this, the absolute and relative figures in 1996&ndash;97 to 1998&ndash;99 will not necessarily match. In circumstances such as a change in trend, rolled averages will show less variation than single year estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.6/37">2.Regional three-year rolled average figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.6/38">3.The estimates use the same income measures as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI). Income is net of income tax and council tax, and adjusted for household size and composition.</p>

However it held an expert workshop into the medical causes of daytime sleepiness in 2002. Following that event, it has strengthened advice provided to doctors. A question on sleep disorders is now included in the medical report form that must accompany any application, and re-application (from the age of 45 years), for a vocational (i.e. heavy goods vehicle or bus/coach) driving licence.</p>

	<p pid="b.813W.5/1">Government statistics distinguish accidents involving mini-buses from those involving larger passenger vehicles but are unable to differentiate those accidents involving buses from those involving coaches. Similarly, the statistics do not differentiate between organised school transport and regular bus services carrying children to school.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/2">With respect to children (12 to 15), and making no distinction for the time of day at which the accident occurred, there was an average of 0.4 fatalities and 20 serious injuries per year for the period 1994&ndash;98. In 2004 there was one fatality and 18 serious injuries. These figures reduce slightly if we consider the peak time of day for school transport. Considering only the period 7am to 10 am and 3 pm to 6 pm during weekdays, serious injuries reduce to 15.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/3">The figures are lower for the younger age group (0 to 11) where the 1994&ndash;98 average was 0.2 fatalities and 14 serious injuries. In 2004 the figures for this group were 0fatalities and nine serious injuries, reducing to eight during the peak school transport period.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/4">Buses and coaches are the safest mode of personal/passenger road transport, when considering the number killed and seriously injured (KSI) with respect to the number of kilometres travelled. Figures for 2003 indicate that the rate of KSI per billion kilometres travelled was 10 for bus and coach travel compared with 27 for passenger cars, 534 for cyclists and 443 for pedestrians.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/5">The Government is committed to improving child road safety. In 2000 it set itself a challenging target to reduce, by 2010, the KSI child casualties (0 to 15 years) to 50 per cent. of the 1994 to 1998 average. The data indicate that in 2004 there were 3,905 KSI child casualties. This represents a reduction of 43 per cent. on the baseline and we are therefore well on track to meet or exceed our target.</p>

Work is continuing to mature the design, address risks and refine costs to the point at which the main investment decision can sensibly be taken and we can commit to manufacture within defined time, cost and performance parameters.</p>
	<p pid="b.817W.13/2">Given that both we and France are embarking on major, complex carrier procurement projects, we are examining areas of mutual benefit and opportunities to deliver economies. It is for industry to put forward proposals which will be judged on their merits and in light of national policies. It has been agreed with France that for co-operation to work, it must deliver cost savings and must do so without delaying UK or French programmes.</p>

This represents around 1.5 per cent. of total UK service personnel deployed to the region during the same period. Out-patient treatment takes place at 13 MOD Departments of community mental health (DCMH) located throughout the UK and three satellite centres in Cyprus, Germany and Gibraltar. In-patient treatment, when required, has been provided by The Priory Group since April 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.823W.8/1">Postcards, letters and small packets, up to a maximum weight of 2 kg, can be sent by airmail to any member of HM forces or otherwise entitled persons serving abroad, at a concessionary rate, which is subsidised by the Ministry of Defence. For example, a 2kg packet can be sent by airmail to a British forces post office address at a cost of &pound;7.16, whereas to send the same packet by the standard Royal Mail airmail tariff to a civilian address in Germany would cost &pound;10.59, and, to a civilian address in world zone 1 (i.e. outside Europe) would cost &pound;37.31.</p>
	<p pid="b.823W.8/2">BFPO mail for Iraq is normally despatched six times per week by RAF aircraft. Typically, a letter posted in the United Kingdom could take one to two days to reach the BFPO sorting office in London, and a further two days to reach the British forces post office deployed in Iraq. Final receipt by the addressee is of course dependent on the operational activities of the addressee's unit, and the difficulty of effecting delivery from the forces post office, via the addressee's unit, to the named individual.</p>

Figures for 2005 were published last week and revealed an increase in the number of women on the boards of FTSE 100 companies. 78 companies have women on their boards, which reflects an increase of 13 per cent. since 2004. Women now make up 10.5 per cent. of board members, compared to 5.8 per cent. in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="b.845W.11/1">Under the national health service dental reforms being introduced from April 2006, units of dental activity (UDA) refer to courses of treatment that are weighted to reflect their relative complexity. The proposed weightings for different courses of treatments, that is the number of UDA to which they correspond, were set out in the draft general dental services (GDS) and personal dental services (PDS) contract regulations, which were published in August 2005. The final version of these proposed regulations will be laid before Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.845W.11/2">UDA do not have a fixed price attached to them. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) and dentists to agree annual contract values and to agree the number of UDA that the dentist is expected to carry out over the course of the year in return for this contract value. The cost of a UDA will therefore be locally determined.</p>
	<p pid="b.845W.11/3">From the end of November, GDS dentists began to receive information showing their level of activity, expressed in terms of UDA, during the reference period, <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, and their NHS earnings during the same period. PCTs and dentists will use this as the basis for agreeing new annual contract values and the number of UDA that the dentist is expected to carry out over the course of the year in return for this annual contract value. GDS dentists will be guaranteed an annual contract value based on their reference period earnings, uplifted to reflect 2006&ndash;07 pay and prices, provided the dentists agree with their PCT an annual level of UDA equivalent to 95 per cent. of their activity during the reference period.</p>
	<p pid="b.845W.11/4">PDS dentists are due to receive similar information from PCTs at the end of November. PDS dentists will be guaranteed an annual contract value worth at least that of their current PDS agreement, uplifted to 2006&ndash;07 pay and prices, in return for carrying out annually an appropriate level of UDA agreed with their PCT.</p>

The directive and the implementing national measure also contain rules on the labelling, advertising and promotion of infant formula to ensure that this information does not negatively impact on the promotion of breastfeeding.

	<p pid="b.853W.2/1">The findings of the 2000&ndash;01 national diet and nutrition survey of adults aged 19 to 64 years show a mixed picture of the diet and nutritional health of this age group. On average, adults in Britain were getting sufficient nutrients from their diets. There were some positive dietary changes since the previous survey of this group in 1986&ndash;87, notably the fall in average intake of fat, which is now close to the recommended amount. However, intakes of saturated fat, non-milk extrinsic sugar and salt are still higher than the recommended levels. Young adults in particular had low consumption of fruit and vegetables and low intakes of some vitamins and minerals.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.2/2">The survey findings have informed the development of Government's priorities for action on diet and nutrition set out in Choosing A Better Diet: a food and health action plan&quot; to reduce the consumption of fat, salt and sugar and increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables. It has also informed the development of specific targets in the Food Standards Agency's (FSA) Strategic Plan for 2005 to 2010. These include targets to reduce population intakes of salt and saturated fat.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.2/3">The FSA is setting up a new rolling programme of national diet and nutrition surveys. The survey will cover all age groups including people under 19 years and over 64 years, providing data to supersede earlier surveys of these age groups. The first results from the rolling programme should become available by 2008&ndash;09.</p>

	<p pid="b.856W.2/1">Three-year rolling average rates are generally used for monitoring purposes, in preference to single year rates, in order to produce a smoothed trend from the data and to ensure the underlying trend is captured rather than year-on-year fluctuations. The resulting trend is more statistically robust than that produced by using single year rates. This approach has been successfully used in monitoring many of the national targets from current and previous public health strategies, for example, Our Healthier Nation (1999) and Health of the Nation (1992).</p>

	<p pid="b.858W.6/1">At September 2005, the total number of (registered) child care places reported from Ofsted stood at 1.22 million. We do not collect national data on the demand for child care places although we have commissioned a number of sample surveys of parental needs and surveys, most recently in 2001. This survey found that a quarter of all households experienced some form of unmet demand in that year. Estimating the supply and demand at the national level is difficult because the child care market operates at a very local level, leading to significant local variation. We know for example the gap is bigger in London, South West and the East Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.858W.6/2">The Childcare Bill currently going through parliament formalises a new duty on local authorities to secure sufficient child care to meet local needs. Within this the duty also requires LAs to carry out an assessment of the local child care market, at least every three years, to develop an overall picture of child care provision in the area. This will help them to identify gapsin provision&mdash;and to support providers, from all sectors, to achieve a child care market that meets local needs of working parents. Statutory guidance will support the provisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.859W.5/2">If parents are not satisfied with the action taken by the local authority and believe that there has been maladministration, they can refer the complaint to the local government ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.5/3">All complaints received by a local authority about its duties under the Childcare Bill will be available to Ofsted to take into account when forming judgments as part of the Joint Area Review and the Comprehensive Performance Assessment process.</p>

	<p pid="b.859W.8/2">We wish to ensure that safety checks are undertaken in all cases where there is a concern that a child could be at risk. Subject to parliamentary approval, the Children and Adoption Bill will strengthen the safeguards for children, by placing a statutory duty on Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) officers to undertake risk assessments whenever they are involved in private law family proceedings, where they suspect that a child is at risk of suffering harm. This will include those cases of disputed contact which are the subject of court applications, where the child resides with a parent who has a new partner and there is a concern that a child might be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.8/3">Since section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, parties in contact, and other section 8 Children Act 1989 proceedings, have the opportunity of raising concerns about harm, when an application for proceedings is first made or when the respondent files an acknowledgement of proceedings. If either party indicates there may be an issue of harm, including concerns about a new resident partner, they are then expected to provide details in a supplemental information form. These forms will be copied to CAFCASS by the courts, thus enabling its practitioners to prepare in advance of the hearing by making relevant checks and assessments. These include checks of social services and police records, which CAFCASS is entitled to ask for through its duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under section 12 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.8/4">Subsequently, assisted by information from CAFCASS, the courts are then well placed to considerwhether it is necessary, at the outset of formal proceedings, to make findings of fact.</p>

	<p pid="b.862W.2/1">This Government want all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010, with half of all primary and a third of all secondary schools doing so by 2008. We want to see at least 2,500 schools providing access to the core offer by September 2006. The core offer, which should be available to all parents and pupils of the school, comprises: high quality child care; a varied menu of study support activities parenting support programmes; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialised support services; and wider community access. It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to the core offer through schools. This will include determining how many primary and secondary schools develop access to the core offer in each year. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-29">29 September 2005</phrase> my Department published its report on the baseline survey of extended services in schools which it commissioned earlier in the year.

Of the &pound;680 million to be allocated across 2006&ndash;08, &pound;250 million will go direct to schools through the School Standards Grant and the formula for calculating each school's allocation for 2006&ndash;07 will be announced in the near future. The remaining &pound;430 million will be distributed to local authorities through the Standards Fund and the General Sure Start Grant. Of this Staffordshire will receive &pound;2,537,634 in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;3,121,417 in 2007&ndash;08. Funding will be released to schools in accordance with each local authority's extended schools strategy. My Department wrote out to each local authority on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase> detailing what their extended schools allocation, excluding the School Standards Grant, will be over the period 2005&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.863W.5/1">My right hon. Friend and I welcome the contribution that higher education is making to national and regional economic development and have discussed this on a regular basis with a wide range of partners, including representatives of the higher education sector, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and other Government Departments. Although we have no present plans to change the system whereby HEFCE's research funding allocations reward research excellence wherever it is found, the Higher Education Innovation Fund continues to support universities' capacity to interact productively with business and the community. The third phase of the fund will run from 2006&ndash;08 and will guarantee all HEFCE-funded higher education institutions a minimum allocation from a total budget of more than &pound;200 million. We also welcome the work that regional partners, including the regional development agencies, are doing to support collaboration, knowledge transfer, innovation and inward investment within their regions.</p>

	<p pid="b.864W.5/2">To assess the benefits of funded early education, delivered in a wide range of both maintained and private, voluntary and independent settings, my Department commissioned the effective provision of re-school education (EPPE) study. This study, which began in 1997, follows 3,000 children from the age of three to the end of key stage 2. So far, the study has demonstrated that there are benefits of pre-school education for attainment and social and emotional development in key stage 1. Other findings include that children with experience of pre-school education demonstrate significantly higher attainment in KS1 national assessments in mathematics and English compared with children who have no experience of pre-school education. The EPPE study will continue to follow children's development to the end of key stage 2. Further information can be found at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research">www.dfes.gov.uk/research</a></p>
	<p pid="b.864W.5/3">This study found that the children of those parents who actively engaged in activities such as teaching songs and nursery rhymes and reading to the child did better at the end of key stage 1 compared to children whose parents did not engage in such activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.864W.5/4">My Department has also commissioned the University of Bristol to look at the impact of different types of childcare (including informal care, for instance with relatives) on children's behavioural and cognitive outcomes at ages five and seven, using data from the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children. We will publish a report of these findings in early 2006.</p>

Further details are available in the strategy which can be found at <a href="http://www.nda.gov.uk">www.nda.gov.uk</a></p>

Based on these estimates, the report concluded that the number of unrecorded rights in England was likely to be in the region of 20,000. The estimate for the length of additional unrecorded rights was 16,000 km. It was estimated that 58 per cent. of that increase would be in the form of footpaths (9,300 km), 25 per cent. would be bridleways (4,000 km), and the remaining 17 per cent. (2,700 km) would be byways.</p>

	<p pid="b.872W.5/1">The UK supports the efforts of the United Nations and the Government of Cambodia to bring to justice some of those who bear the greatest responsibility for crimes against humanity carried out by the Khmer Rouge. A successful outcome to the Khmer Rouge Tribunal (KRT) will help strengthen accountability, the rule of law and judicial reform in Cambodia and will send a strong international signal that war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide will not be treated with impunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.872W.5/2">Progress in achieving a KRT has been slow to date for many reasons and significant hurdles still need to be overcome. The Government of Cambodia has encountered major difficulties in raising the $13.8 million contribution it is expected to deliver. Less than $2 million has been made available to date. Other factors include finding, selecting and training suitably qualified, experienced and politically independent national judicial staff including judges, prosecutors, investigators etc. who can meet international standards. In that context, we welcome the recent appointments of a director and a deputy director by the Government of Cambodia and the UN respectively. Addressing gaps in Cambodia's national legislation to ensure it is compatible with international criminal law has also proved problematic.</p>
	<p pid="b.872W.5/3">The UK has been one of the leading financial contributors to the KRT to date. We provided &pound;500,000 in 2004&ndash;05 and expect to do so again for 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07. Bilaterally, EU members have pledged a total of $8.5 million approximately and the European Commission has additionally pledged a further &euro;1 million. We continue to underline the importance we attach to a credible Tribunal starting work as soon as possible with the Cambodian authorities at official and ministerial level and have offered our support.</p>

We regularly urge the Colombian Government to implement all outstanding UN human rights recommendations arising from successive annual reports of the Colombia office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), and have offered our assistance to achieve this goal. When Vice-President Francisco Santos called on Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) officials in August 2005, we made clear, as Presidency, the importance the EU attaches to active progress by the Colombian Government in implementing the UNHCHR recommendations. We regularly reinforce this message in our contacts with the Colombian Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.873W.2/3">In addition, the EU Ministerial Council conclusions, which were agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October 2005</phrase>, state the willingness of the EU to discuss a mid-year progress on the implementation of the UNHCHR recommendations within the framework of the G24, the group drawn from participants in the 2003 London meeting of international support for Colombia, in Bogota. We will continue to look for ways to encourage and assist the Colombian Government to improve the human rights situation in Colombia. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the FCO (Lord Triesman of Tottenham) discussed human rights issues with Vice-President Santos on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.873W.5/2">The UK, in line with the EU, considers that the only viable solution to the armed conflict in Colombia is through a negotiated settlement. We have made it plain to the Colombian Government that the rights of the victims of the armed conflict to truth, justice and reparation must be taken into account in the paramilitary demobilisation process. These issues were raised directly with President Uribe during his visit to London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July</phrase>. The EU expressed its willingness, in the EU Ministerial Council conclusions of October 2005, to work with the Government, institutions and civil society of Colombia, as well as with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), Michael Fruhling, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and others who may be involved in monitoring the implementation of the judicial process of the demobilisation of the paramilitary groups. The EU also welcomes the continued engagement of the Organisation of American States in accompanying the demobilisation process. The Conclusions also spelled out specific areas of intervention where the EU is willing to assist Colombia in support of the search for peace. While we do have some concerns over the pace of paramilitary demobilisation, we acknowledge that effective and transparent implementation of the recently agreed Colombian Justice and Peace Law would make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia.</p>

	<p pid="b.876W.8/1">There are no negotiations at present between the E3/EU and Iran. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-05">5 August 2005</phrase>, the E3/EU presented a comprehensive proposal for long term arrangements intended to give the international community objective guarantees that Iran's nuclear programme was exclusively for peaceful purposes, while equally providing firm guarantees on nuclear, technological and economic co-operation and firm commitments on security issues. Regrettably, Iran rejected this proposal and resumed uranium conversion activities on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-08">8 August 2005</phrase>, in violation of the framework for talks it had agreed with the E3/EU. The resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-24">24 September</phrase> and thediscussion at the board's meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November</phrase> have underlined that questions about Iran's nuclear programme remain unresolved. The Secretary-General of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani, wrote to the E3/EU on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-06">6 November</phrase> expressing Iran's interest in resuming talks. In their reply on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-27">27 November</phrase>, E3 Foreign Ministers and EU High Representative, Javier Solana, expressed the hope that Iran would meet the expectations of the international community and help create conditions that would enable talks to resume. They outlined the European sides willingness to meet to see if a basis for the resumption of negotiations can be agreed.</p>

	<p pid="b.877W.2/1">Iran's nuclear programme continues to be of deep concern to the whole international community. This was highlighted in the resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-24">24 September 2005</phrase> and at the Board's most recent meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November</phrase>. Since 2003, the UK, France and Germany, with the support of the EU high representative, Javier Solana, have pursued a diplomatic solution, that would give Iran an opportunity to address international concerns and provide objective guarantees that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. These efforts have helped raise international awareness of Iran's activities and have enjoyed increasing support. But, although we have seen limited progress in some areas, the steps taken so far by Iran fall far short of what is required. The E3/EU will continue to engage closely with key partners including Russia, the USA, EU member states and members of the IAEA board of governors to maintain the pressure on Iran to address the international community's concerns.</p>

The public on St.Helena are familiar with the position that, should the Public Solicitor be unable to help them, they may seek the help of a lay advocate. There is a small fund which allows lay advocates to seek the advice of a UK solicitor if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.885W.5/1">National Grid's Winter Outlook report shows that under normal weather conditions there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity generation to meet demand. Under much worse than normal winter weather, however, it may be necessary for large industrial users to restrain demand&mdash;a perfectly normal market response. Much of this demand reduction can be done through the electricity generating industry switching to coal or other fuels.&mdash;Under all credible scenarios, however, the market will be able to deliver energy supplies to domestic consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.5/2">Concerning contingency arrangements in the unlikely event of shortages, in the first instance, we expect a commercial response from the market to price signals indicating tightness in the supply-demand balance. National Grid's Winter Outlook report contains a detailed assessment of the extent to which this sector would be able to reduce demand for gas in this way while continuing to meet demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.5/3">Only if the market fails to balance itself might it be necessary to take contingency measures. The Government has detailed emergency plans in place which have been developed and well rehearsed in close co-operation with industry. Our legislative powers to deal with gas emergencies date back to 1976. We are obviously updating operational response plans on a regular basis and our current plans, which have been thoroughly tested and developed in partnership with industry have been in place for the last three years. However, we would not expect such an eventuality to arise merely as a result of colder than average weather.</p>

	<p pid="b.887W.5/1">Fuel poverty is defined as the need for a household to spend more than 10 per cent. of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth (21C in the living room and 18C in other occupied rooms). There are some minor differences in definition used across the devolved Administrations, and these are set out in The UK Fuel Poverty Strategy of November 2001&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.5/2">Net trade in energy is defined as the total quantity of fuels exported less total quantity of fuels imported. There is a net importation of energy when the total quantity imported exceeds the total quantity exported.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.5/3">The units of energy used by the Department are expressed in million tonnes of oil equivalent which is a measure of the energy content of the individual fuels.

Much of this is expected to fund UK research on Generation IV systems for potential international deployment from around 2030; the exact amount will depend on the mix of research proposals that are submitted.

	<p pid="b.895W.8/1">The Protection of Trading Interests Act (PTIA) was enacted in 1980 to counter US assertions of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the late 1970s. The PTIA was modified in 1996 by an order under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in order to give effect to Council Regulation (EC) 22717 96, otherwise known as the EU Blocking Statute, which prohibits compliance with the US embargo on Cuba. Although the PTIA was introduced as a defence against US extraterritorial attempts to assert its jurisdiction, the Act does not relate specifically to the US and can be invoked against any third country attempting to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.8/2">Three orders have been made under section 1 of the PTIA:</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.8/3" class="indent">Protection of Trading Interests (US Re-export Control) Order1982 (SI 1982/885);</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.8/4" class="indent">Protection of Trading Interests (US Antitrust Measures) Order1983 (SI 1983/900);</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.8/5" class="indent">Protection of Trading Interests (US Cuban Assets Control Regulations) Order 1992(811992/2449).</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.8/6">There has also been one order made under section 5, the Protection of Trading Interests (Australian Trade Practices) Order 1988 (SI 1988/569).</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.8/7">However, its terms have not been invoked since the introduction of the EU Blocking Statue in 1996, and in recent years the role of the PTIA has shifted from a means of enforcement to that of a deterrent.</p>

	<p pid="b.897W.2/1">For conventional generators, efficiency is the delivered energy expressed as percentage of the fuel input to the generator.

	<p pid="b.897W.2/2">The capacity factor (or load factor) of an electricity generator is a relative measure of the output of the device.

	<p pid="b.897W.2/3">A paper by the Environmental Change Institute on Wind Power and the UK Wind Resource, suggest that the annual capacity factor for wind power in the UK (long-term average of over 27 per cent.) compares favourably to that of Denmark (around 2 per cent.) and Germany (around 15 per cent.). The expansion of wind power to higher wind speed locations, including offshore, may result in capacity factor increasing in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.898W.9/1">I have placed a table in the Libraries of the House that sets out information on people working for UK Trade and Investment overseas using Foreign and Commonwealth Office figures for the current financial year. In this table UK Trade and Investment's operations are shown broken down by market&mdash;normally an individual country&mdash;and by the location of the individual posts within the market concerned. As regards personnel, UK Trade and Investment is a joint Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign and Commonwealth Office organisation, and is not an employer in its own right. Consequently it has no employees of its own. The majority of people deployed on its overseas operations are either staff of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who are sent abroad on diplomatic terms and conditions (and referred to in the tables which follow as UK-based&quot;), or locally-engaged employees of the embassy, high commission or consulate general in question (referred to in the tables which follow as LE&quot;). There is no centrally held data on consultants engaged overseas, and acquiring it separately from each FCO Post overseas would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

The expansion of wind power to higher wind speed locations, including offshore, may result in capacity factor increasing in the future.</p>

The Department of Trade and Industry works closely with other relevant Government Departments, in particular the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for International Development, to design UK trade policy and influence the EU trade policy position.</p>

These analyses draw on published trade and tariff data collected by the above organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.5/1">The Government are committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development package at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December, which will allow a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.5/2">The DDA has the potential to deliver a freer and fairer trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting subsidies by industrialised countries, with poor countries given the flexibility to decide, plan and sequence trade reforms. The Department is pressing for as much progress as possible towards a deal at the Hong Kong ministerial.</p>

	<p pid="b.904W.2/2">Many issues remain to be resolved in the negotiations and reaching agreement on as many of these as possible in Hong Kong will be critical to meeting the 2006 deadline. This deadline, which is widely accepted, stems from the expiry of the US Trade Promotion Authority in 2007.</p>
