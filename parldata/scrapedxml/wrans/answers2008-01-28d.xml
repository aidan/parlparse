	<p pid="d.1W.6/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/2"><i> (a)</i> Free-range chicken, eggs, other poultry and pork: free range chicken accounted for 10 per cent. of the catering service's total chicken purchases for calendar year 2007. The catering service has quickly reacted to recent consumer demand and increase in awareness and have now completely moved away from intensively reared poultry. A species called Devonshire Red has been sourced which is corn fed and Freedom Foods (RSPCA) monitored; currently discussions are taking place with the supplier for a longer term relationship if consistency of supply and price can be guaranteed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/3">Since February 2002 catering services have purchased only free range eggs from Ashford in Kent and in 2007 were awarded a Good Egg Award which recognised continued leadership on eggs, helping to promote animal welfare and corporate social responsibility in the food industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/4">Apart from chicken, no other poultry purchases are free range or Freedom Foods monitored. However the Purchasing Department is currently engaged in the sourcing of better quality, higher welfare products to include turkey, duck, and guinea fowl.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/5">Pork purchases are all classed as free range and come from West Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/6"><i> (b)</i> Organic food: the catering service does not keep records that specifically identify organic purchases and so it is not possible to put a value on this expenditure. The issues of consistency and availability are still prevalent in this area, consequently purchasing of organic products is restricted to branded, pre-packed goods, such as sandwiches, salads, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, etc. which offer some guarantee and assurances of quality.</p>
	<p pid="d.1W.6/7"><i> (c)</i> Fair trade products: in 2007 the catering service purchased 72 fair trade food and beverage products throughout the estate including fresh fruit, juices, coffee, tea, chocolate, cakes, cookies, biscuits, tropical whole foods, smoothies and sugar. Spend for these items was &pound;62,137. 11 fair trade souvenir items are available for sale, for example wooden picture frames (India), stationery (Nepal), coffee (Kenya). A regular supply of fair trade chocolate is currently being arranged. Two fair trade wines are sold in the House's dining and banqueting rooms. Fair-trade products are used when supply and quality can be guaranteed.</p>

	<p pid="d.2W.2/1">Over the last year, the catering service has spent approximately &pound;5,000 on veal, 40 per cent. on meat including offal (&pound;2,000) and the remainder on bones (&pound;3,000).</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.2/2">The majority (91 per cent.) of veal meat products purchased are small speciality cuts, and come from a well-established company in Holland (as do all the bones). It is the world's largest veal producer and has an excellent traceability system (back to a specific animal) and a guarantee that the veal is free of growth promoters, hormones and b-agonists. Quality systems are based on HACCP and are BRC compliant which surpass international standards. Animal welfare is of utmost importance and the calves are given diets that are high in fibre (and not iron deficient), generous space allowances, and adequate bedding. All the calves are accommodated in groups in spacious, well-ventilated and well-lit stables.</p>
	<p pid="d.2W.2/3">The remainder (9 per cent.) was purchased from UK suppliers which have the highest standards and best welfare practices for veal production, but not the availability and consistency of supply.</p>

	<p pid="d.3W.9/2">Outline assessments during the bid phase were conducted on the basis of providing the overlay required to stage shooting events at the National Shooting Centre at Bisley. However, during the bidding phase, the International Olympic Committee commented on the distance between Bisley and the Olympic Park. On the basis of this feedback, and following consultation with the International Shooting Federation and British Shooting (the national governing body), the Royal Artillery barracks at Woolwich was selected as the shooting venue, due to its iconic location and its close proximity to the Olympic Park and Village. These factors will improve the athlete and spectator experience by limiting travel and making it easier to attend other Games events on the same day in the Olympic Park.</p>

	<p pid="d.9W.0/1">Eastern Chad hosts 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 refugee camps and 46,000 central African refugees in four refugee camps. There are 180,000 IDPs, and an estimated 700,000 in host communities have been adversely affected by the ongoing conflict. DFID relies on data from partner agencies for assessment of the humanitarian situation affecting the displaced populations, and the humanitarian situation in Chad is monitored closely by a dedicated west African humanitarian advisor. In financial year 2007-08, DFID has committed &pound;6.5 million to Chad through humanitarian agencies. These include ICRC (3600,000), UNHCR (&pound;2 million) UNOCHA (&pound;260,000), Oxfam (&pound;330,000), WFP (&pound;1.8 million) and Islamic Relief (&pound;500,000).</p>
	<p pid="d.9W.0/2">Though conditions for refugees remain of concern, the immediate humanitarian needs of most of the refugee population are being addressed. In the majority of refugee camps, for example, refugees are receiving 15 litres of potable water per person per day, in accordance with international standards. According to the UN, refugees all have access to primary health care facilities, although vaccination coverage is less than the accepted level. The UN estimates that 82 per cent. of refugee school-age children are enrolled and attend school. In line with international nutritional norms, refugees are all receiving 2,100 kCal per person per day. Nutritional surveillance shows that in the refugee population, global acute malnutrition is 7.7 per cent. which is within the WHO-defined 'alert' band, and severe acute malnutrition is 0.75 per cent.&mdash;which is defined as 'acceptable'.</p>
	<p pid="d.9W.0/3">The situation for the internally displaced population is more worrying; in many cases, standards fall below the internationally accepted norms. Of the total of 180,000 IDPs, only 125,000 are receiving more than 10 litres of potable water per person per day. The UN estimates that 70 per cent. of IDPs have access to primary health care facilities at utilisation rate of one visit per person per year, which is below what is to be expected for a displaced population. 2,100 kCal per day have been provided to a caseload of 150,000 IDPs. Global acute malnutrition levels are at 21.4 per cent. and severe acute malnutrition levels are at 2.6 per cent; both levels are classified by WHO as 'serious'. The UN notes that information relating to the full extent of coverage of humanitarian need is as yet incomplete. The situation for the host population, and those otherwise affected by the conflict, is very serious, with global and severe malnutrition figures comparable to those prevalent amongst the IDPs. The UN estimates that some 700,000 additional people fall into this category.</p>

	<p pid="d.10W.2/4">The UK will continue to push for action to address health worker shortages in developing countries at the forthcoming meeting of the G8 health experts group.

	<p pid="d.18W.11/1">In 2005 DCMS formally consulted on Permitted Temporary Activities and the temporary event notices (TENs) regulations. Ministers considered views from all respondents and decided not to further restrict the limits on TENs.</p>
	<p pid="d.18W.11/2">While there had been some representations about licensed premises using TENs to operate additional hours or activities which have not been included on the full licence, the Government believed that the existing limit was sufficient. Licensed premises were able to hold events outside their set hours under the old licensing regime by the use of special orders of exemption.</p>
	<p pid="d.18W.11/3">However, we will continue to monitor the position with stakeholders and if there is compelling evidence to suggest that the TENs regulations are not covering problems which cannot be dealt with by using the other powers available to the police for handling disorder or noise nuisance, including the closure of premises in certain cases where a TEN has effect. The premises holding the TEN may also have their licence reviewed if they are found to be failing to promote the four licensing objectives.</p>

This change was introduced in order to bring these clearance types more closely into line with police services in England and Wales where they have been applying the Crown Prosecution Service evidential test since 2002. In Northern Ireland the equivalent standard became relevant to PSNI clearances only with the establishment of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in June 2005. While this has had the effect of reducing the overall clearance rate, sanction clearances (those where a formal sanction is taken against an offender by means of charge, summons, and caution or where the offence is taken into consideration at court) remain unaffected.  <i> Source:</i>  Central Statistics Unit, PSNI.</td> </tr>

In particular officials spoke on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-05">5 September 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase> on sponsorship and there were a number of other exchanges.

These results would regularly place them well within the equivalent of the top 25 per cent of local education authorities in England. In order to understand academic achievement more widely, the Department for Children, Schools and Families has introduced a service indicator on the annual school census and is working with MOD on a joint mitigating mobility project to identify the best way of improving outcomes further.</p>

	<p pid="d.32W.11/2"><i> </i>The 1998 Strategic Defence Review (Cm 3999) and 2002 New Chapter (Cm 5566) White Papers identified the major challenges to UK security as the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, the spread of international terrorism and the threat posed by weak and failing states. In response to these challenges, they set the requirement for the UK to maintain expeditionary, balanced and flexible armed forces. These assumptions were validated in the 2003 White Paper &quot;Delivering security in a Changing World&quot; (Cm 6041-I) and were endorsed again in work leading to the 2007 comprehensive spending review (Cm 7227). The recent CSR settlement of 1.5 per cent. real terms growth means an additional &pound;7.7 billion for Defence by 2011, continuing the longest period of sustained real growth in planned defence spending since the 1980s. Our priority is to continue to modernise the armed forces to deliver the capabilities needed to meet these challenges.</p>

	<p pid="d.43W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-21">21 January</phrase> this year, we announced we are investing a record &pound;140 million in cycling over the next three years. This will enable an extra 500,000 children to have access to the new Bikeability cycle training by 2012 and create many additional safer walking and cycling routes to at least 500 schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.43W.2/2">Measures to improve road safety for all cyclists include providing better infrastructure, promoting cycle training, improved training and testing for motorists and encouraging cyclists to protect themselves, by making themselves conspicuous and by wearing a safety helmet.</p>
	<p pid="d.43W.2/3">The new edition of the Highway Code, published in September 2007, includes enhanced advice to all road users to look out for and be aware of vulnerable road users, including cyclists. To make drivers more aware of cyclists the theory test question bank</p>
	<p pid="d.43W.2/4">contains a large number of questions about vulnerable road users. The screen-based theory test allows the use of digitised video clips to help test hazard perception with moving images, which include cyclists.</p>
	<p pid="d.43W.2/5">We concentrate our cycle safety publicity on teenagers and younger children, as these are the most vulnerable groups. We have run various cycle safety campaigns over the last 10 years. Currently, cycling safety messages for younger children are included on the Hedgehogs website including advice and games. In 2006 we produced an online advertisement for children called 'No helmet, no ride', which encourages children to wear a cycle helmet.</p>
	<p pid="d.43W.2/6">There is also the cyclesense website aimed at teenage cyclists, giving advice and tips of cycling safety. In 2007 we ran an MTV/THINK! competition, where teenagers were asked to come up with ideas for TV commercials about road safety, including cycling, aimed at their peers. This activity ran over five months and the three best ideas were produced as TV commercials and teens voted for their favourite ad online.</p>
	<p pid="d.43W.2/7">The Department's leaflet 'Drive Safe Cycle Safe' also encourages drivers and cyclists to share the road safely. The Department has grant funded a number of projects to improve road safety for cyclists including a ROSPA produced DVD on safety for cyclists and lorries.</p>

	<p pid="d.45W.0/1">It was originally envisaged that Galileo would be built and operated by a private sector body under a concession contract. However, the Transport Council concluded in June last year that these concession negotiations had failed and should end. Instead, the Community has agreed that the deployment and initial operation of Galileo to 2013 should be taken forward through a public procurement managed by the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.45W.0/2">The December Transport Council agreed that decisions on arrangements for the subsequent operation of the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems could be taken only after further studies, and invited the Commission to undertake these by the end of 2008 bringing forward proposals at the appropriate time. Issues over which legal regime would govern any concession contract for operations, or which courts would have jurisdiction, will be considered at that point.</p>

	<p pid="d.60W.7/1">Statutory maintenance schemes have been designed around the principle that the responsibility to support a child applies to its natural or adoptive parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.60W.7/2">Responsibility does not extend to a parent's new partner. In the old child support scheme, the non-resident parent's partner's income may be taken into account in order to assess the extent to which the partner may be expected to contribute financially to the upkeep of any children of their relationship, and to ensure that that family has sufficient disposable income to meet their day-to-day needs. This could affect the amount of maintenance that the non-resident parent must pay.</p>
	<p pid="d.60W.7/3">Under the new child support scheme, introduced in March 2003, the method of calculating child support maintenance was simplified in a number of ways, which included removing the need to take into account the non-resident parent's partner's income.</p>
	<p pid="d.60W.7/4">Currently there are no plans to change the old rules to reflect the new rules. However, once the future scheme, currently being debated by Parliament in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, is fully implemented, all cases will operate on a single set of rules and, as with the new scheme, no account will be taken of a parent's new partner's income.</p>

	<p pid="d.62W.5/1">The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the family resources survey (FRS) may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>
	<p pid="d.62W.5/2">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2005-06&quot;. This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent. 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty.</p>

For example, last year the Government introduced the Animal Welfare Act 2006, under which it is an offence to cause an animal, under the control of man, any unnecessary suffering. The Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 makes it an offence to intentionally inflict unnecessary suffering on wild mammals. In addition, the Government are committed to improving the welfare of animals such as through the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy and the Animal Welfare Delivery Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="d.71W.2/2">The samples for routine dead wild bird surveillance are collected according to standardised protocols, accredited to a United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) International Standards Organisation (ISO)17025 quality system. DEFRA employs the diagnostic expertise of the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge, which is the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) and European Union (EU) Reference Laboratory for avian influenza (AI). Our sampling, collection, storage and transportation methods are entirely consistent with international and European Union standards. We continually revise and subject all aspects of our AI surveillance activities to peer review in light of new international evidence as it arises. Our testing regime conforms to the highest standards for protecting animal and public health.</p>
	<p pid="d.71W.2/3">The delivery target for the following dead wild bird surveillance activities is five days. Eligible wild birds are collected from the field by a collection agency operator (generally from the Meat and Livestock Commission) in a biosecure manner, including double bagging of the bird to protect operator health and safety. The wild birds are then delivered to the nearest VLA regional laboratory, where they are refrigerated (+4&deg; Celsius) pending sampling. Once samples are collected from the wild bird at the VLA regional laboratory they will also be stored at +4&deg; Celsius. Samples are then packaged and despatched. Rapid courier delivery of specimens collected in this manner ensures high quality material is received at the VLA headquarters laboratory for testing. Testing of the samples at VLA Weybridge usually commences as soon as practically possible upon the day of receipt, with samples held at +4&deg;Celsius as required.</p>

	<p pid="d.72W.2/2">DEFRA is continuing to work towards its public service agreement target of eradicating BSE in GB by 2010. However, due to the long incubation period of BSE, achievement of this target will be determined by past events and will be affected by the EU's surveillance regime and the longevity of cattle born before August 1996, in which the prevalence of infection is highest. The Government are working with industry leaders to encourage producers to dispose of these cattle under the older cattle disposal scheme before it closes at the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.72W.2/3">Future BSE cases born after the reinforced feed ban in August 1996 could also impact on our achievement of the 2010 target although epidemiological assessments have demonstrated a clear decline in the prevalence of BSE infection in successive birth cohorts born after July 1996.</p>

	<p pid="d.76W.5/2">The news release of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November 2006</phrase>, announced that DEFRA had become concerned about possible illegal practice in the egg industry. In the course of investigations information had come to light that eggs had been incorrectly labelled, including the labelling of non-free range eggs as free range. The Government called on the egg industry and retailers to ensure that the eggs they are selling are correctly labelled. The Egg Marketing Inspectorate are continuing to focus their activities in this area, to ensure that any eggs marketed in this country are correctly identified.</p>

	<p pid="d.77W.2/1">The Government support an open trading scheme, as was agreed at the December 2007 Environment Council. Under this agreement, aviation operators will be enabled to purchase EU allowances to cover emissions beyond the agreed cap, where they have not made sufficient reductions within their own sector. These additional emissions may also be covered by Kyoto project credits up to a limit of 15 per cent. of the total number of allowances surrendered by operators. The advantage of this approach is that it will enable aviation, as a sector with limited short term abatement options, to purchase allowances that have resulted from real emission reductions in other sectors to meet its obligations.</p>

	<p pid="d.80W.5/2">In 1999 the predecessor to the Pesticide Residues Committee (PRC), the Working Party on Pesticide Residues (WPPR) analysed 43 samples of soya products for 13 pesticide residues including glyphosate at a reporting level of 0.1 mg/kg. The products included were soya milk, soya mince, and tofu. Glyphosate was not found at or above the reporting level in any of the samples.</p>
	<p pid="d.80W.5/3">In their quarter 2 report of 2006 published in December 2006 the Pesticide Residues Committee reported the results of their survey of 60 samples of soya milk. Glyphosate was sought but not found at or above the reporting level of 0.1 mg/kg in any of the samples.</p>
	<p pid="d.80W.5/4">In their quarter 4 report of 2006 published in June 2007 the PRC reported the results for their survey of 60 samples of soya pieces and tofu.

	<p pid="d.82W.5/1">It is open to energy suppliers, who are responsible for the costs of meeting their targets under the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) and Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), how they do so. Under CERT there will be an option for suppliers to focus a proportion of their activity on those who may occupy hard to treat homes. Suppliers may promote solid wall insulation to those on low incomes in the private sector and ground source heat pumps to those on low incomes in the private sector who are off the gas grid. Accordingly, EEC/CERT does not ring-fence money in the manner suggested. However, the Government have sought to encourage energy suppliers to target their activity at hard to treat homes. Any activity promoted in this sector will result in greater carbon savings being attributed to a measure than would otherwise be the case.</p>

	<p pid="d.92W.2/1">Under section 5(5) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, a project licence cannot be granted if the purpose of the programme could be achieved satisfactorily by the use of a reasonably practicable non-animal method. Applicants for project licences are, therefore, required to explain why animals have to be used and a key element of the assessment of licence applications by Home Office inspectors focuses on ensuring that the use of animals is essential. In considering this issue, inspectors have access to a wide range of expertise and sources of relevant information and fully explore potential alternative methods in discussion with applicants.</p>
	<p pid="d.92W.2/2">The avoidance of unnecessary duplication of animal use is another key consideration in the assessment of applications and all reasonable steps are taken to prevent it. However, the replication of experiments by more than one research group is not necessarily prohibited. The scientific method demands that research findings can be corroborated by the same or different research groups to establish the validity of the results.</p>

	<p pid="d.98W.2/2">Statistics on the deportation of foreign nationals were last published in 2002. Copies of this are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.98W.2/3">Published information on persons removed as a result of deportation action has not been available from 2003 onwards due to data quality issues. The Border and Immigration Agency is putting in place new systems to improve its data collection systems for the future in this area.</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.2/1">BERR's Design and Demonstration Unit has developed a model under which deprived communities without access to mains gas and that meet certain criteria can be connected to the network, using existing funding. A number of communities have been connected using the model. In partnership with the regional development agencies in north-east England and Yorkshire and Humberside, we are co-funding demonstration projects delivered by Community Energy Solutions, a community interest company that will provide cost-effective energy to 40 communities. These projects will use mains gas and renewable technologies as appropriate, will benefit both urban and rural communities and are designed to be replicable elsewhere. Under the new gas distribution price control, Ofgem, with our support, has incentivised the gas distribution network companies to provide mains gas connections to deprived communities. We expect this to result in many thousands of customers gaining access to mains gas during 2008 to 2013.</p>

	<p pid="d.105W.3/1">The Government's response to the national public consultation on the post office network in May 2007 set out the definitions supporting the minimum access criteria for the post office network. The definition of a rural area is a settlement of less than 10,000 inhabitants. Deprived urban areas are defined as the most deprived 15 per cent. of super output areas in England, 15 per cent. of data zones in Scotland, and 30 per cent. of super output areas in Wales and Northern Ireland to take account of the proportional spread of disadvantaged areas across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.3/2">There is no departmental definition of a remote area as no access criteria relates solely to 'remote' areas. Alongside the Government's national access criteria, is the criterion that 95 per cent. of the population in every postcode district should be within six miles of a post office service. Implicit in this criterion is a safeguard for people in remote areas who might otherwise not have been assured of reasonable accessibility to services under nationally-applied criteria alone.</p>

	<p pid="d.110W.0/1">The Department's main public facing telephone inquiry service, the Customer Service Centre, has a geographic number (020 7210 4850). The Department also uses a Government wide switchboard service for contact with Richmond House (020 7210 3000). There are individual switchboard services for the Department's main buildings and these have geographic telephone numbers.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.0/2">The Department's Executive Agencies, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency also have geographic numbers.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.0/3">The Department has a healthy start scheme (formerly known as the welfare foods helpline), a service operated under contract to provide assistance to individual members of the public with inquiries about welfare foods e.g. milk tokens. The number for members of the public is 0845 607 6823. The text phone (for minicom users) is 0845 601 7698. The numbers for commercial providers are 08707 203063/201688. The nursery milk reimbursement unit helpline provides information to nurseries and other early years providers. This number is 08707 203055. These telephone numbers will be reviewed as part of the contract review in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.0/4">The Department does not collect information on the telephone numbers used by local national health service organisations and general practitioner practices. Under the NHS next stage review options are being considered in adopting a 3-digit number as a single point of access to NHS urgent care.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.0/5">The NHS Direct telephone advice service, which currently operates on 0845 4647, will shortly have to change its number. The Department has had a preliminary discussion with Ofcom about the possibility of securing a 3-digit number for NHS Direct.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.0/6">The Department has 25 arms length bodies and a number of national programmes e.g. NHS Employers. Information about telephone services for these bodies is not held centrally and cannot be provided except at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.0/7">The Department also grants funds a wide range of voluntary and charitable organisations to provide services relating to health and healthy living. Some of these organisations include telephone helplines as part of their services. It is not possible, without incurring disproportionate cost, to identify individual projects with telephones services and whether geographic telephone numbers are used.</p>

	<p pid="d.115W.2/1">There have been cases where the remediation of contaminated land was not addressed appropriately prior to redevelopment. This is why the Government published new planning policy on land remediation in 2004. The policy, set out in Planning Policy Statement 23: &quot;Planning and Pollution Control&quot; (PPS23) and supporting annexe, expects a local planning authority in granting planning permission for new development to be satisfied that the proposed development is appropriate, having regard to the information available to it about the contamination and the proposed remediation measures and standards. PPS23 makes it clear that the developer is responsible for ensuring appropriate, competent professional advice is available to carry out investigations of land potentially affected by contamination, assessment of risk and the design and execution of remediation works, including verification of their effectiveness. The local planning authority is entitled to rely on that advice or to challenge it on the basis of similarly-qualified expert advice accessible to it in-house or externally. In all cases the standard of remediation to be achieved through the granting of planning permission for a new development is the removal of unacceptable risk and making the site suitable for its new use.</p>

	<p pid="d.115W.5/1">The new planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change will boost the use of local renewable and low carbon energy in new development. The PPS sets out our 'Merton-Plus' approach. It expects all local planning authorities to have a council-wide target (like existing Merton rules) and, additionally, tailored targets for sites where there is greater potential for using decentralised energy to supply new development. These targets should be flexible enough to consider community schemes (for example, wind turbines or CHP schemes serving more than one site) as well as building specific technologies.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.5/2">Councils could still set an on-site target in their Development Plan Document (DPD) provided they can show this is the only local energy option and there are no other options than on-site. In practice, we think there are unlikely to be many situations like this. We wouldn't rule out on-site renewables targets in DPDs provided it is clear that the DPD policy/target will be applied flexibly and will allow carbon savings from local energy supplies to be considered and count towards it.</p>

This drew on the evidence of a programme of evaluation of English LSPs between 2002 and 2006 and a full public consultation which ran from December 2005 to March 2006. The findings of this research and consultation are available on the Communities and Local Government website. Following this assessment, the Secretary of State has recently issued draft guidance for consultation which sets out the role that Government think, subject to the results of consultation, LSPs might be expected to perform and the key governance principles which we recommend they might adopt. This draft guidance is available on the CLG website:</p>

	<p pid="d.138W.0/1">At the end of September 2007, the most recent date for which information is currently available, there were, overall, a total of 11,211 foreign national prisoners in all prison establishments in England and Wales. There were an additional 919 prisoners where the nationality was not currently recorded on central IT systems of which 650, were untried prisoners held on remand and their nationality is not yet recorded on central data systems. The total includes prisoners held on remand or serving custodial sentences, as well as those held under the Immigration Act 1971 (including those in the immigration removal centres of Dover, Haslar and Lindholme).The full breakdown of these figures can be found in the following table below.</p>

	<p pid="d.154W.2/1">The Government share the concerns about offending by young people and recognises that the military may have resources that could benefit young offenders. We are consulting with a range of organisations which have an interest in youth justice and the provision of youth justice services as part of the Youth Crime Action Plan which will be published in the summer, and will consider the feasibility of sending young offenders on training programmes by the armed services in light of the response to that consultation.</p>
	<p pid="d.154W.2/2">However, we do not think that a course of military training is the answer. Research from the United States indicates that simply adopting a military-style regime does not, of itself, reduce reoffending. The more successful programmes were those which supported their physically challenging and highly disciplined regimes with well developed education and training addressing offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="d.154W.2/3">We are planning to test out the referral of young adult offenders (18 to 25 years) to existing senior attendance centres through the conditional cautioning scheme, which diverts offenders who admit their offence from court in appropriate circumstances. The centres aim to assist these offenders to acquire and develop personal responsibility, self-discipline and new practical skills and interests within a structured and disciplined environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.154W.2/4">At present, the conditional cautioning scheme applies only to those aged 18 and above, but we are extending the scheme to young offenders aged 16 and 17 years old through provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill currently before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="d.157W.2/2">Effective language and communication skills are fundamental to children and young people's learning, development of social skills and fulfilment of their potential. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-11">11 September 2007</phrase>, my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and the Secretary of State for Health launched a major review of the provision of services for children and young people with speech, language and communication needs, to be led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/3">The review will build on the investment and improvements to speech and language therapy and resources in the last 10 years. It will advise the Government on how the very best provision can be mirrored in all areas and how local services can work together so children and young people up to 19 years of age get the support they need, when they need it.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/4">The review has been specifically asked to consider the clarity of accountability and responsibility for planning service delivery from national to local level across health, social services and education and to analyse good practice in joint working by schools, local authorities and PCTs, particularly in joint commissioning, including needs assessment and design of service delivery. As mentioned in the Children's Plan, it will also look at means of improving support and information to parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/5">The review plans to submit an interim report in March 2008 and produce a final report by July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/6">As regards parent support advisers, we have recently announced funding to expand their availability in every local authority. These advisers work with parents to improve children's behaviour and school attendance, offering advice with parenting, and providing support for families at the first sign a child or young person may be experiencing social, health or behavioural issues. Such support would include help where parents need it to address children's communication needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.157W.2/7">The Parents' Charter, as outlined in the Children's Plan, will describe the minimum level of support all parents can expect to receive from their local authority. We are currently working on options for the design of a charter and these will be outlined in the Spring following discussion with the newly established Parents Panel.</p>

However, we have committed to giving early warning (by no later than the end of January 2008) to those local authorities to which this applies. Key considerations will be in relation to low performing schools or excess surplus places.</p>

	<p pid="d.165W.2/1">The training programme for lead teachers in gifted and talented education began to be rolled out in September 2007.

	<p pid="d.165W.2/2">Data on numbers undertaking the initial face-to-face sessions will not be available until March 2008. Survey evidence suggests training is under way in over 80 per cent. of local authorities, though with some variation in the proportion of schools so far engaged.</p>

	<p pid="d.165W.5/23">GNVQs represent a very limited percentage of the overall A* to C grades. Their contribution to the national overall pass rate in 2007 (60.3 per cent.) was just 3.3 percentage points. The contribution of academic GCSEs was 51.9 percentage points. The contribution of all GCSEs (including vocational GCSEs and short courses) was 53.9 percentage points. GNVQs have now been phased out. The last cohort sat the examination last summer. GNVQs will disappear from the Achievement and Attainment Tables from 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.170W.6/17">As set out in Budget 2006, it is the Government's aim, over time and adjusting for inflation, to increase levels of maintained school funding to average private sector day school levels in that year, 2005-06. Our private sector target is an estimated &pound;8,000 per pupil in independent day schools in 2005-06 compared with total revenue and capital funding per pupil in the maintained sector of &pound;4,750. We have so far increased maintained sector funding to &pound;5,550 per pupil this year, which is &pound;5,300 in real terms at 2005-06 prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.6/18">As a result of the comprehensive spending review settlement for education, total per pupil revenue and capital funding will rise to &pound;6,600 in 2010-11, or &pound;5,750 per pupil in real terms at 2005-06 prices. This means that between 2005-06 and the end of the CSR period we will have raised maintained sector funding by &pound;1,000 per pupil in real terms, equivalent to closing the gap with the private sector target by 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.6/19">Progress over future spending reviews will depend on the Government's fiscal position; demographic change; and progress by schools in continuing to deliver improvements in results and wider support for parents and pupils.</p>
	<p pid="d.170W.6/20">Budget 2006 also announced a separate commitment to close the gap between the state sector and private sector levels of per pupil capital investment. The schools capital settlement for 2008-11 fully closes this gap by providing for maintained sector capital investment to rise to &pound;1,110 per pupil by 2010-11 which is in Sine with 2005-06 private sector levels, adjusted for inflation.</p>

	<p pid="d.173W.0/1">Surplus school places can represent a poor use of resources. Local authorities must examine the benefits and drawbacks of redeploying resources tied up in surplus school places for the wider benefit of pupils in the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.173W.0/2">Individual authorities must determine how to reduce levels of surplus places, but reducing surplus need riot always mean school closures. Capacity can be reduced by removing temporary accommodation, consolidating split site schools, or by rationalising school space. Rationalisation can involve adapting accommodation for alternative use and broadening the services their schools offer in line with the likely future pattern of children's services and the needs of local communities. We also encourage schools to pool resources through working more closely together either through federation or close collaboration.</p>

For example, in 1998 we introduced a presumption against closing rural primary schools which means that, although we cannot guarantee that no rural school will ever close, the case for closure needs to be strong and clearly in the best interests of education provision in the area. In the Education and Inspections Act 2006 we introduced a statutory duty on those proposing to close a rural primary school to consult parents of pupils registered at the school; the district council for the area in which the school is situated; if the local authority is a county council, any parish council for the area in which the school is situated; and any other relevant person(s).</p>

	<p pid="d.180W.2/1">Performance management arrangements, introduced for teachers in England, in September 2007, are designed to establish a clear and consistent process of planning and assessment so that teachers and head teachers understand what is expected of them, and that support teachers and head teachers in addressing their professional development needs. The revised arrangements introduce a more structured approach to the planning meeting at the beginning of the year, including clarity about how performance will be assessed at the end.</p>
	<p pid="d.180W.2/2">In order for performance management to operate in a fair and transparent way, teachers must know what is required of them before any assessment can be made. The framework of professional standards for teachers, introduced in September 2007, helps to provide this context. The standards are statements of a teacher's professional attributes; professional knowledge and understanding, and professional skills. They provide clarity of the expectations at each career stage and support teachers in identifying their professional development needs. The framework for standards will, therefore, provide a backdrop to the revised performance management arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.180W.2/3">Effective management, clear expectations and appropriate support are key factors in addressing weaknesses in performance. Ongoing professional dialogue will enable any such issues to be identified early, thereby avoiding the need for formal capability procedures in most cases. Where a teacher's capability is still in question after all normal avenues have been exhausted then formal capability procedures should be instigated, in line with locally agreed practice.</p>
