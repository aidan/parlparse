The Act places a duty on the CRB (as the Secretary of State) to include details of all convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings that are recorded on the police national computer (PNC) on a certificate. The CRB will not routinely include harassment warnings on a CRB certificate unless it forms part of a disposal of a conviction/caution that is recorded on the PNC.</p>

	<p pid="a.401W.9/1">The primary objective of the Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) scheme is to incentivise additional small-scale, low carbon electricity generation. Extending FITs to sub-50kW installations made before <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July 2009</phrase> could not deliver this objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.401W.9/2">Extending FITs to existing installations would increase the costs of the scheme, without the corresponding benefit of new installations. We do not think that this represents value for money, particularly in the current economic climate, and cannot therefore justify the additional cost to consumers, who ultimately pay for the scheme. Additionally, it would set a precedent for other incentive schemes such as the renewable heat incentive. Therefore, after careful consideration, we decided that the scheme as it relates to early adopters should remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.401W.9/3">The Department estimated that allowing all<sup>(1)</sup> such existing generators to claim FITs at full rate, without repaying grants would represent a discounted cost in the order of &#163;5.8 million<sup>(2)</sup> for the period 2011-12. In addition to these costs there would be additional administrative costs to DECC, Ofgem and suppliers. In practice, these administrative costs would have increased, had such a policy also included a requirement to repay some or all of any grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.401W.9/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> These figures are based on estimated numbers of sub-50kW installations prior to <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-15">15 July 2009</phrase> that received grants from the following programmes: Clear Skies, LCBP1, LCBP2 and the Major PV Demo Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Sam Younger, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-25">25 October 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question on what assessment has been made of the effect of the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review on the Charity Commission's ability to discharge its statutory duties to (a) regulate and (b) support the charitable sector (19691).</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/4" class="indent">As an independent non-Ministerial Department, the Charity Commission negotiates its Spending Review Settlement directly with HM Treasury. The Charity Commission's settlement amounts to a 33% reduction in its budget in real terms by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/5" class="indent">In order to make these savings, the Commission will need to make significant changes to the way in which it engages with charities and the public, the services it offers, and the scope and shape of its regulatory activity. This will not be easy but the Commission is determined to continue to develop as an innovative, confident and flexible modern regulator within the resources Treasury has made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/6" class="indent">The Commission will manage these changes by:</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/7" class="indent">(i) beginning a comprehensive review of its strategy and operating principles, to agree the key priorities for the Commission's work over the next four years and beyond; and</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/8" class="indent">(ii) continuing to reduce the costs of regulation, for example moving more of its services to charities online, and further reducing its back office administration costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/9" class="indent">The Commission anticipates that it will have to reduce staff numbers by about 140 full-time posts as a result of this settlement. Final decisions on the necessary restructuring of the Commission will follow its strategic review, which is intended to conclude in April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.9/10" class="indent">The Commission will begin a public consultation on its strategic review in the next few days, seeking views from a range of stakeholders within and beyond the charity sector. A review of the Charities Act 2006, which sets the Commission's statutory objectives, functions and duties, is expected in 2011 and this will provide an opportunity to review the legislative framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.5/6">The programme aimed primarily at improving patient experience, through improving the quality and availability of food. Measures taken included the introduction of protected mealtimes, greater access to snacks and the launch of an NHS Recipe Book-which includes material on 'soft meals' for the many patients who find chewing and swallowing difficult. Measures such as this would be expected to have a knock-on effect on nutritional status, but this was not formally measured. Details of clinical malnutrition are collected via the Hospital Episode Statistics process and these are routinely provided on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.5/7">Central initiatives can only go so far in supporting local improvement. The decision to close the BHF programme was taken in April 2006. Funding previously allocated centrally was passed directly to the national health service-to allow it to develop services in the way that is appropriate for local organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.5/8">Work on implementation of hospital food policy was moved to the National Patient Safety Agency in 2005-06. The resources developed as part of the programme are still available via the Hospital Caterers' Association website. Their contribution to ongoing improvement therefore remains, even though the programme has closed.</p>

	<p pid="a.418W.2/1">There is no plan to establish a joint commissioning board for commissioning mental health services at a national level. The NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate services are commissioned for the whole population and local arrangements will be for local determination.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.2/2">Our proposals for commissioning give general practitioner consortia responsibility for commissioning the majority of national health service services, supported and held to account by an independent NHS Commissioning Board, and Health and Wellbeing Boards. Mental health services will form an integral part of the range of services commissioned, informed by the output of the local joint strategic needs assessment process led by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.2/3">Flexibilities in the NHS Act 2006 can support and enhance opportunities for integrated working, particularly section 75, which supports a range of partnership arrangements where they can demonstrate this will lead to improvements for services.</p>

	<p pid="a.424W.3/2">For the national CQUIN goal on venous thromboembolism (VTE), the period over which commissioners will assess achievement during 2010-11 is a matter for local negotiation between commissioners and providers, although published guidance states that achievement of 90% must be over at least a full quarter to earn the related CQUIN payment. We understand that many providers are aiming to achieve the goal during the last quarter of 2010-11. A national data collection on VTE risk assessment started in June 2010.

	<p pid="a.426W.9/1">To ensure a sustainable and balanced economic recovery, the Government need to encourage people to save and invest. Recent levels of saving have been too low with the household saving ratio dipping into the negative in 2008 for the first time since the 1950s. The Government are therefore committed to creating conditions for higher savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.9/2">The Government want a saving system based on freedom, fairness and responsibility, as well as ensuring lasting affordability and measureable effectiveness. These principles will guide the Government's aims of rewarding saving, supporting pensions, and helping vulnerable households to smooth their expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.9/3">A number of measures have been announced which will take the first steps in meeting these aims, such as the Annual Financial Healthcheck, the indexation of annual subscription limits for Individual Saving Accounts (ISAs), meaning that savers will be able to pay an extra &#163;480 into their ISAs in 2011-12, and an end to the effective requirement to annuitise pension savings at 75.</p>

	<p pid="a.439W.0/1">The latest available figures show the median equivalised gross income in 2008-09 is &#163;515 per week. This statistic is based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the 2008-09 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Gross incomes have been presented. The HBAI publication looks at net disposable incomes before and after housing costs. Figures have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.5/1">Since the earthquake in Haiti, the EU's immediate humanitarian response, managed by the European Commission, has amounted to &#8364;30 million (&#163;27 million) up to the end of September. A further &#8364;90 million (&#163;80 million) is planned to be spent by August 2011 on various interventions including shelter, water sanitation and hygiene, health, nutrition and food assistance.

The settlement provides resources to cover the United Kingdom's legally binding commitments on assessed peacekeeping costs (the Peacekeeping Budget) as well as discretionary expenditure on conflict prevention, stabilisation and peacekeeping (the Conflict Pool).

A statement on detailed allocations for Conflict Pool activity next financial year will be made in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.8/3">This financial year, the Conflict Pool is &#163;178.5 million. DFID has allocated an additional &#163;1.5 million from its departmental budget to supplement the Conflict Pool's programme in Sri Lanka and &#163;10 million for stabilisation activities in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.443W.9/1">Any analysis of tax and welfare changes by gender must make assumptions about how resources are shared within the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.9/2">Sharing of resources within the household will mean that although a benefit is received by a particular person in the household, the full impact does not fall on that person because the resource is shared with their partner and/or children. Taking account of this kind of income pooling is very difficult, as data and research in this area is sparse. Households share their resources in different ways-some will have no income pooling; some will share some income while others will share all their income. To analyse the impact of Budget decisions by gender, assumptions must be made about the extent to which resources are shared.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.9/3">The House of Commons Library has chosen to assume no income pooling in their research. While I accept that this assumption was chosen without political bias, it is an extreme assumption, and is unlikely to represent the way most households share resources. The results of the analysis depend heavily on the assumption that there is no household sharing, and should be interpreted accordingly recognising that a different choice of income pooling assumption would give different results. The analysis only includes selected measures, such as the abolition of the Health in Pregnancy grant, and excludes others, for example, the council tax freeze. Therefore the coverage can only be partial.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.9/4">In producing the analysis in annex A of the June 2010 Budget document, the Treasury based its assumptions about family structures on the Expenditure and Food Survey, and factors supplied by the Office for National Statistics. The Budget analysis was produced at a household level, and therefore assumptions around resource sharing would have no direct impact on the analysis presented.</p>

Based on the Spectrum Audit conducted by Professor Martin Cave in 2004-05, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is paying a fee of some &#163;64 million to Ofcom in financial year 2010-11 for the use of its spectrum holdings. The value of individual elements of MOD's spectrum holding will be determined when we bring some of our spectrum to market in the 2012-13 financial year.

Some of these have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice the MOD's negotiating position with its commercial suppliers. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trades unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity, and health and safety.

	<p pid="a.450W.8/1">The decision not to bring the Nimrod MRA4 into service announced by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-19">19 October</phrase> was difficult, owing to the nature of the military tasks to which it was designed to contribute, the amount of public money that had been spent on it, and the impact of such a decision on the people who have dedicated their careers to delivering this capability, or who depend on it for their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.8/2">However, the severe financial pressures faced by the nation and the urgent need to bring the defence programme into balance meant that we could not retain all our existing programmes, and that we had to prioritise those capabilities that we could continue to maintain. This project has suffered from repeated delays and cost overruns. But it is the aircraft's future support costs that contributed to the decision not to bring it into service, despite its advanced state.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.8/3">The Nimrod MRA4's role as an Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance platform was to contribute to a wide range of military tasks. These included the protection of the nuclear deterrent and deployed Maritime Task Groups, surveillance and tracking of surface shipping, and a number of other operations relevant to the security of the UK and its overseas territories. The aircraft also fulfilled a secondary role in support of Long Range Search and Rescue.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.8/4">Since the withdrawal of the Nimrod MR2 in March this year, the Ministry of Defence has sought to mitigate the gap in capability through the use of other military assets, including Type 23 Frigates, Merlin Anti Submarine Warfare helicopters and Hercules C-130 aircraft, and by relying, where appropriate, on assistance from allies and partners. Although it was originally assumed that such measures would only be required for a limited period of time, we are now developing a longer-term plan to mitigate the impact of cancellation on our continuing military tasks and capabilities. In view of the sensitive and classified nature of some of these military tasks, and the implications for the protection of our armed forces, including the nuclear deterrent, it is not possible for us to comment on these measures in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.8/5">Following last week's announcement we have also begun discussing with BAE Systems arrangements to terminate the contracts for production and support of the aircraft. Until these negotiations are complete it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the likely costs or the impact on personnel employed on the Nimrod MRA4 programme.</p>

To date, some &#163;740 million has been paid to projects, with some &#163;3,890 million (84%) remaining to be spent. However, well over 50% of the ERDF allocation of &#163;4,630 million has already been contracted to projects. Payments to projects are on target and can be made up until end 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.459W.2/1">We have endorsed the broad thrust of Lord Browne's proposals because they would place the funding of higher education on a sustainable basis; would protect students from low income backgrounds and low earning graduates; and because those students who benefit most in financial terms from their higher education would contribute most to the costs. Lord Browne also recommended that students need clearer information about the employment outcomes, including future earnings, of particular courses. Taken together, we would expect these recommendations to support appropriate levels of recruitment to graduate entry professions like teaching and medicine. We are considering our detailed response to Lord Browne's recommendations and will respond shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.6/1">The UK has the safest roads in Europe and the Government wish to ensure that we maintain that position. However, the Government have made clear that their urgent priority is to tackle the UK's record deficit in order to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery. As a contribution to the in-year spending reductions as part of our programme to address the record deficit, we have reduced the planned level of road safety grant in 2010-11. At the same time, local authorities were given greater freedom and flexibility in the management of their finances and the use of grant funding streams. Therefore, the fact that this grant has been reduced does not mean that the Government necessarily expect local authorities to reduce their road safety spending by a similar proportion. It is for local authorities and local communities to determine the priorities for their areas. The Department currently forecasts allocating &#163;76.5 million towards dedicated road safety programmes and administration in 2010-11. It allocated &#163;145.0 million in 2008/09 and &#163;143.1 million in 2009-10 towards comparable activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.6/2">These totals include the road safety funding stream in area based grant and the specific road safety grant. Other items included are expenditure on THINK! campaigns, road safety research and statistics, vehicle safety and related administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.6/3">These totals do not include expenditure by the Department's agencies, nor do they include funding support for other organisations used in part for, but not dedicated to, road safety (for example the integrated transport funding for local authorities and the block grant for Transport for London).</p>

	<p pid="a.481W.3/1">In my written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>, columns 37-38WS, I set out that I would commence provisions in Part 1 (Coroners) of the Act which would enable operational problems facing coroners to be tackled. This will include making it simpler to transfer cases from one coroner to another, and removing rigid boundary restrictions on where post-mortem examinations may be carried out. The aim is to implement these provisions by April 2012 at the latest. I also set out that provisions requiring the appointment of a chief coroner would either not be implemented or that certain key functions may be transferred to another body. These key functions might include oversight of training for coroners and their staff, and direction that responsibility for a case is transferred either to a judge or to another coroner. The timescale for this transfer of functions will depend on parliamentary progress of both the Public Bodies Bill, in which the office of chief coroner will be abolished, and the subsequent affirmative order which will set out to which body or bodies the chief coroner's powers are to be transferred. It is likely therefore that it will take longer than April 2012 to implement these provisions.</p>

The Government are committed to diverting women away from crime and tackling women's offending.

The aim is to meet the distinct and complex needs of women which are linked to their offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.2/1">The Government believe that prison is the right place for the most serious, dangerous and persistent offenders. We will always provide enough prison places for those whom the courts judge should receive a custodial sentence. But we are committed to a new approach to rehabilitation, involving voluntary and private sector partners alongside prison and probation resources. We will publish a Green Paper later this year, setting out our plans to reform sentencing and rehabilitation policy, and we will review our prison capacity strategy in the light of responses to our proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.5/1">This Government are committed to improving rehabilitation outcomes from those leaving prisons or on community sentences. The Ministry of Justice is releasing a compendium of reoffending statistics on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November 2010</phrase>. This covers a wide range of subjects including factors which influence reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.5/2">As part of overhauling the system of rehabilitation to reduce reoffending we are also looking at the sentencing frameworks for adult and young offenders, and the range of penalties available in the criminal justice system. We will take time to get it right and will consult widely before bringing forward specific plans for reform. Our forthcoming Sentencing and Rehabilitation Green Paper will set out our plans in more detail.</p>
