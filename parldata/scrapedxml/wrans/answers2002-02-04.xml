In January this year on a two-day visit to Toronto, my noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment called on existing major investors and multipliers and held media interviews to promote inward investment. On a visit this month, I shall be hosting an inward investment dinner during my attendance at the largest ICT (information and communications technologies) conference taking place in India this year.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.6/1">Existing mechanisms for dealing with complaints within Juvenile Justice Centres are operated by an independent Juvenile Justice Board, as required by the Secretary of State. These arrangements, which are fully explained to all young people entering custody, include child protection protocols, planned and unannounced inspections by the Social Services Inspectorate and an Independent Representation Scheme provided by the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (NIACRO).</p>
	<p pid=".649W.6/2">The existing arrangements are broadly in accordance with the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, and as such no representations have been received by the Secretary of State in relation to their compliance. However, in line with the recommendations made in the Criminal Justice Review, they are being reviewed by a development team, established by the Juvenile Justice Board, as part of a much wider brief to develop new operating policies and procedures in preparation for the closure of Lisnevin and the move to a single centre on the existing Rathgael site.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.6/3">The development team's remit is currently in draft form and will be placed in the Library when it is finalised.</p>

We are seeking to support international efforts to promote an end to conflict and achieve a secure and lasting peace.

In the current financial year we have committed &pound;1 million for support for emergency health and nutrition programmes, and for the promotion of human rights and political dialogue. We envisage increasing this support during 2002. In addition the UK's share of ECHO's &pound;20 million humanitarian budget for Burundi in 2001 was some &pound;4 million. We have also committed &pound;5.175 million for the implementation of a three-year project tackling the pressing problem of HIV/AIDS in Burundi, and have provisionally allocated US$1 million to the proposed Multilateral Debt Trust Fund for this country.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.9/1">All juvenile establishments work with Youth Offending Teams to plan the transfer of the young person into the community phase of the Detention and Training Order. Juvenile establishments plan a young person's release from prison with the young person's community supervising officer and where applicable his/her parents or carers. Release is planned from the start of a sentence through a series of meetings and action plans. A final meeting takes place 10 days before release in order to finalise arrangements for on-going support in the community. The personal officer from the custody setting then attends the first training plan meeting in the community. This ensures that the two parts of the sentence are linked. Sentence planning forms part of this process and is, so far as is possible, tailored to individual needs.</p>

	<p pid=".659W.9/1">In the year ending March 2001, just under 1.25 million recorded crimes were detected. This amounted to 24 per cent. of all recorded crime in England and Wales in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.9/2">This figure is much higher for some crimes than for others&mdash;for example, 62 per cent. of all crimes of violence against the person were detected. Of that figure, 90 per cent. of homicides and 81 per cent. of attempted murders were detected.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.9/3">There are also striking variations in performance at both force and basic command unit (BCU) level. For example, in 2000&ndash;01, the detection rate for burglary across thirty comparable urban BCUs varied from 27.7 per cent. to just 5.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.9/4">There cannot be any justification for such variable performance in similar parts of the country. That is why the work of the Standards Unit will be so important: it is the means by which we will identify and spread good practice, driving the performance of all forces up to that of the best.</p>

Research undertaken by the Home Office shows that home detention curfew helps prisoners to make the transition between prison and the community. (Home Office Research Study 222, Electronic monitoring of released prisoners and evaluation of the Home Detention Curfew scheme, March 2001). We have asked Governors to make full use of the scheme where they can do so without unacceptable risk to public safety.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.2/5">The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) has agreed in principle to a package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service. The agreement is subject to ratification by all parties by the end of February. We believe that, taking the package as a whole, it will benefit the vast majority of officers.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.2/6">The PNB package includes more flexible arrangements to retain officers who are entitled to retire with maximum pension benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.2/7">We also intend to remove the requirement for part-time officers to work a minimum of 16 hours a week. This will help improve retention of officers with parental or caring responsibilities.</p>

Prior to <phrase class="date" code="1978-04-05">5 April 1978</phrase> the police scheme attracted a widow's pension of half the husband's pension. However, in line with other public service pension schemes, it did not provide survivor benefits for wives married to those who had already retired from the police service. Officers' pension contributions at the time reflected this. The greater current contribution rate of 11 per cent. partly reflects the additional benefit of the provision of pensions for post-retirement widows.</p>

	<p pid=".675W.9/1">The Government are determined to tackle illegal pornography whether on or off line, and the criminal law applies equally to both.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.9/2">We are particularly concerned to deal with child pornography both on and off line. In January 2001, we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo- photographs of children to 10 years (from three years), and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months).</p>
	<p pid=".675W.9/3">In November 2000, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced a &pound;25 million investment in the police over three years specifically to fight hi-tech crime and to enhance the capability of the police at a national and local level to investigate computer based offences, including the possession and distribution of illegal pornography.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.9/4">In March 2001, the then Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1258" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, established a Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet. The task force began work in May. It is a partnership of: representatives from internet service and communication providers; the Internet Watch Foundation, set up in 1996 which provides a hotline for the public to report child pornography; PC and software retailers and manufacturers; child welfare organisations; the main opposition parties; law enforcement agencies and academics. The task force is looking at proposals for legislation to tackle paedophile 'grooming' activity on and off-line; a best practice model of Internet chat safety measures for providers and computer awareness training for the police and child protection practitioners.</p>
	<p pid=".675W.9/5">Internationally, the Government actively support efforts within the European Union, and more widely, to combat child pornography on the Internet. In November 2001, we signed the Council of Europe convention on Cybercrime, which will underpin co-operative action between signatory states in respect of computer-related crimes, including the making, distribution and possession of child pornography.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.2/1">The Government consider that effective legislation to criminalise and punish trafficking in human beings is an important component of any strategy to tackle this crime. This must also encompass effective enforcement, alongside support and assistance for victims, and prevention and education.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/2">United Kingdom (UK) Ministers were among the first to sign the Trafficking Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and are committed to implementing its measures, one of which is the introduction of trafficking offences. To take measures forward, the European Union Framework Decision on trafficking in human beings has been provisionally agreed by representatives of all European Union member states and will be adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council as a legally binding document in the near future. We will introduce legislation to introduce criminal offences into UK law as soon as parliamentary time permits.</p>

This changed the accounting for some components of taxes and public spending. The ESA95 treatment was described in &quot;National Accounts Concepts Sources and Methods&quot; (ONS, 1998, ISBN 0&ndash;11&ndash;621062&ndash;1), chapters 5 and 21. The impact of the changes on the main public finance aggregates was quantified in the 1998 pre-Budget report (Cm 4076), paragraphs B26 to B36.</p>

The impact of the introduction of RAB on departmental expenditure limits was set out in Spending Review 2000 (Cm 4807), Table A7.</p>

Community amateur sports clubs are able to apply immediately. The commission has received a significant number of inquiries from sports clubs interested in taking advantage of the new charitable purpose. As clubs will have to consider the implications of charitable status, seek agreement from their members if they wish to pursue this option and make any necessary changes to their constitutions before applying for charitable status, there will inevitably be some delay before clubs are in a position to formally apply for registration.

(NATS) on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-16">16 January</phrase>. It was a useful and constructive meeting, at which I stressed the importance of the NATS new Scottish Centre (NSC) at Prestwick to the Scottish economy.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/2">Mr. Everitt confirmed that NATS remained committed to a two-centre strategy, and to the construction of the NSC at Prestwick to bring it into operation in the 2008&ndash;09 time scale. he has agreed to keep me informed over the coming months about NATS plans for implementation of the project.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/3">I continue to have regular discussions with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions on a wide range of transport issues which affect Scotland, including matters relating to the new air traffic control centre at Prestwick.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/4">I have not received any requests from NATS asking for financial assistance for the centre at Prestwick.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/5">NATS have indicated that their intention is to transfer staff from the existing centre at Prestwick to the new centre when it is completed. It is not expected that the operation of the new centre will result in additional jobs; however, there will be some additional short-term employment opportunities during the construction and commissioning phase.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/6">Although construction of the new air traffic control centre at Prestwick is being deferred, contracts for the design of the building and initial site works are in progress and will be completed. The value of these contracts is a commercial matter between NATS and the contractors. Construction of the building and the design and installation of equipment systems will be subject to a competitive procurement process, which will determine the total costs of the new centre.</p>

	<p pid=".715W.9/2">The Learning and Skills Council will begin funding LEAs for the provision delivered in their school sixth-forms from April. LEAs will continue to pass funds to schools and retain their wider responsibilities for sixth-forms.</p>
	<p pid=".715W.9/3">The overall amount of funding that we have transferred to the LSC is &pound;1.35 billion for 2002&ndash;03. This represents our best estimate of the likely funding for school sixth- forms in that year, taking into account growth in pupil numbers and in funding per pupil. The LSC issued provisional allocations for 2002&ndash;03 to LEAs and schools in December. These include funds for both mainstream sixth-forms and for post-16 pupils with special needs. The provisional allocation for Coventry was &pound;11.8 million, of which almost &pound;1 million was for provision for pupils with statements of SEN.</p>
	<p pid=".715W.9/4">Data on pupil numbers and qualifications taken from the September 2001 pupil count have been used to calculate funding levels for mainstream school sixth- forms under the LSC's formula. A higher proportion of schools than originally expected are being funded under the formula. For around two-thirds of sixth-forms it generates higher levels of funding than their underpinning real terms guarantee. The pattern in Coventry is broadly in line with this national picture.</p>
	<p pid=".715W.9/5">The total amount of funding passing to an LEA from the LSC for school sixth-forms will be matched by a deduction from their Education SSA. The allocations will be confirmed shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".719W.0/1">Trade unions play a key role in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this my Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1998. This year (2001&ndash;02) funding will total &pound;7 million, rising to &pound;9 million next year and &pound;11 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.0/2">When it was launched, the Union Learning Fund was a new and innovative experiment, but it has now become an established part of the lifelong learning agenda. It is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and others to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their capacity as learning organisations. It has so far benefited over 25,000 people in the workplace through a wide variety of projects ranging from tackling basic skills needs to advanced professional development. It has also led to the development of a new breed of activist, the union learning representative, and helped to establish a network of over 3,000 learning representatives nationwide.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.0/3">Union learning representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly among the very lowest skilled workers and those with literacy and numeracy problems. That is why we have included a clause in the new Employment Bill that will give statutory backing to union learning representatives. It will reinforce the invaluable role that union learning representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote work force development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.</p>

	<p pid=".721W.2/1">We have several strategies that are helping to raise educational attainment in coalfield and other areas. Standards of literacy and numeracy in primary schools are the highest they have ever been and evidence shows that the coalfields are benefiting from these strategies although we recognise that there is still work to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.2/2">We published the Schools White Paper &quot;Achieving Success&quot;, last September, which sets out our vision for education for the years ahead. The Key Stage 3 strategy (11 to 14-year-olds) aims to build on the success at primary level but has been adapted to meet the more diverse and complex nature of the secondary curriculum.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.2/3">We have introduced floor targets so that every school, wherever it is based, will be supported to secure at least 20 per cent. of students with five good GCSEs by 2004, rising to 25 per cent. by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.2/4">Coalfield areas are also benefiting from more localised targeting with initiatives such as Excellence in Cities and Education Action Zones providing additional resources for schools serving disadvantaged areas. Coalfield areas already benefiting from these initiatives include Rotherham, St. Helens, Barnsley, Doncaster and Wigan.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.2/1">Our primary concern is with the safety of those who crew and travel on ships, and with the protection of the marine environment. Analysis suggests that some open registers have a better safety and environmental performance than some of the more traditional maritime flags. We are working with like-minded states within the International Maritime Organisation, including the more reform-minded open registers, to raise the level of flag state performance. The wider shipping industry is also making a helpful contribution within the context of the international Quality Shipping Campaign.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.5/1">Britain is a natural maritime nation, so shipping is vitally important to us. 95 per cent. of our trade by weight arrives or leaves by sea, and the UK shipping industry is one of our biggest service-sector exporters. The UK industry was, however, in decline until we introduced our new shipping policy. A central element of our new policy is the tonnage tax, which brings certainty and clarity about tax liabilities, which are related to the tonnage of the ship operated rather than to actual profits made. Shipping companies are not obliged to enter the tonnage tax regime or to register their ships in the UK, but the new climate created by the tonnage tax, together with reforms at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, has helped to bring about significant increases in the UK registered fleet.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.5/2">A key feature of the tonnage tax, unique to the UK, is a minimum training obligation. This requires each shipping company opting for the tonnage tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet and also give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings. The Government provide financial support for seafarer training through the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme. Following a review of SMarT in autumn/winter 2000 and the receipt of EU State Aid clearance, additional courses will be included in the scheme and levels of funding will be increased.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.0/1">The Department monitors traffic speeds and traffic levels at about 130 sites on different types of road throughout Great Britain. The information comes from automatic traffic counters, which are generally situated away from junctions, hills or sharp bends, at locations where traffic is likely to be free flowing. Thus in principle they provide information on the speeds at which drivers choose to travel when their behaviour is not constrained by congestion or other road conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.0/2">Results are published annually. The latest available results relate to 2000 and were published in 'Vehicle Speeds in Great Britain: 2000', in July 2001. A copy is in the House of Commons Library. Results for 2001 will be published when they are ready later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.3/1">Recruitment and retention are matters for the individual shipping companies themselves. There are Government measures, however, to assist and encourage the training and employment of British seafarers. We provide financial support for seafarer training through the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme. Following a review of SMarT in autumn/winter 2000 and the receipt of EU State Aid clearance, additional courses will be included in the scheme and levels of funding will be increased. We introduced the Tonnage Tax option as part of the Finance Act 2000, a key feature of which is a minimum training obligation. This feature is unique to the UK, and requires each shipping company opting for the tonnage tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet and also give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.6/1">A specific assessment has not been made of Ordnance Survey's progress in facilitating the work of government by collaboration with other data providers. However, it is clear that a number of initiatives by Ordnance Survey in recent years has increased other data providers' input to the national topographic database.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.6/2">One initiative has been the CODES project, Collection of Data from External Sources, where data from architects, house builders and construction companies has been taken into the database. Commercial terms have been agreed for the use of these data such that Ordnance Survey costs have reduced and customers in both the public and private sectors have benefited from more up-to-date mapping being available sooner. The inclusion of this type of data will increase further in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.6/3">In addition, Ordnance Survey has developed its policies on working with data providers following responses to Information Paper 13/1999 'Joined-up geography for the new millennium' and Consultation paper 1/2000 'Digital National Framework'. Both of these documents are within the public domain and can be found on the Ordnance Survey website.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.6/4">The launch of OS MasterMap in November 2001, with its system of unique referencing for every individual map feature, provides new opportunities for data providers and customers to link their own information to Ordnance Survey data. Ordnance Survey actively promotes the benefits of such data association and integration among its customers and partners. Some additional layers of OS MasterMap are already being taken forward in collaboration with other data providers.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.6/5">The continued growth of licensed partners and their development of new and innovative products is at the heart of Ordnance Survey's business model. These products draw on Ordnance Survey's own data and data from other providers.</p>

	<p pid=".740W.0/1">Revised procedures were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-01">1 August 2000</phrase> to improve the handling of planning appeals by inquiry, hearing, and written representations to streamline the process and make the arrangements fairer and more transparent. When launching the new arrangements we indicated that their operation would be monitored and reviewed after a year.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.0/2">We have now completed the review in conjunction with the Planning Inspectorate and a wide range of stakeholders, including appellants, local planning authorities, planning agents, and third parties. Local planning authorities were surveyed and a series of stakeholder meetings was held.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.0/3">Overall, the new rules are meeting the objectives of improved handling and greater fairness. The new arrangements represented a radical change of culture for all concerned. Strict enforcement of deadlines has had a big impact on parties' delivery of documents and has contributed to improved performance by the Planning Inspectorate in deciding planning appeals over the last year. There is now greater recognition and acceptance that all parties have a responsibility in making the appeals system work smoothly.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.0/4">We have concluded that no further changes to the procedures should be made at this stage. Rather, we intend to allow more time for the new rules to bed in. In the meantime, it is essential that all parties adhere to deadlines and do not seek to gain advantage over others by failing to do so. We shall continue to reinforce this message and to keep the operation of the procedures closely under review. We do not rule out the possibility of further measures to improve the operation of the planning appeals procedures to tackle abuses and to improve the speed of decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.0/5">The Planning Green Paper which we published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase> notes the dramatic improvements made by the Planning Inspectorate in the timeliness of appeal decisions and that we are working with them to consider ways in which the targets we set for this work might be improved still further without compromising quality.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.0/6">We welcome the publication on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-30">30 January</phrase> of &quot;Planning Practice Standard: Handling Appeals in England&quot;, prepared by the Royal Town Planning Institute with the active involvement of the Planning Inspectorate. This gives helpful good practice advice on participation in the planning appeals system and underlines the importance of parties acting in a responsible, co-operative and timely manner and of observing high standards of professional conduct.</p>

	<p pid=".741W.9/17">All the days of moderate, high and very high pollution recorded at Lullington Heath were due to ozone pollution. There were no recorded days of moderate, high or very high pollution for nitrogen dioxide or sulphur dioxide in any of the five years. High air pollution episodes due to ozone are recorded only in the summer months. The pollution is linked to hot sunny weather when industrial and motor vehicle emissions react under these conditions to form ground-level ozone. Light easterly winds sometimes bring this pollution across to the UK from central Europe. If conditions are very still for several days then high pollution can be generated by pollution emissions from UK sources too.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.2/4">The issues raised are cross-cutting, from regeneration to justice. They involve many Government Departments and agencies. Examples of our work so far include the Action Plan published last November for addressing the housing needs of black and ethnic minority people. This has 70 specific commitments about such things as, for example, allocations policy. The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit has developed Community Support Teams. Each has a pool of people with special skills who can be deployed flexibly and directly. They will be able to support and develop local political leadership to supplement the local authorities and Local Strategic Partnerships. The reports published in December 2001 about last summer's disturbances in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley stressed the need to make community cohesion a central policy objective of all that we do. This must include environmental policy.</p>

The Small Business Service has sent out 3.7 million copies of their leaflet &quot;Coping with Foot and Mouth Disease&mdash;help for business&quot; via banks, post offices, trade associations, employer organisations, etc. Business advice fact sheets have been posted on DEFRA's website, <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/">http://www.defra.gov.uk/</a>, and we have set up help lines. The regional development agencies have also been actively promoting the Business Recovery Fund.</p>

We are further promoting increased awareness and penetration of the measures we have put in place.</p>
	<p pid=".743W.0/3">The Small Business Service embarked on an ambitious &pound;2.5 million national advertising campaign in autumn 2001 under the title &quot;The Unfair Advantage&quot;.

	<p pid=".743W.0/4">Farmers whose animals have been culled out as a result of foot and mouth disease have been targeted directly for the enhanced (five day) Farm Business Advice Service (FBAS). Publicity for the service has been direct to farms in the form of a personalised mail shot and explanatory leaflet. In addition the Rural Development Service's seminars held locally outlined the components of the service and how farmers can register. Further regional promotion by Business Links is conducted as and when it is necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".744W.2/1">There are certainly no arrangements to conceal disposals of radioactive waste for which the UK Government are responsible.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/2">The arrangements for disposal of radioactive waste in the UK require that all disposals of civil waste are subject to the provisions of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, as amended. This Act does not apply to the Ministry of Defence, but its policy is that where practicable it will apply standards at least as stringent as those required by the Act. At present the main UK disposal site is at Drigg in Cumbria; this is authorised to accept only low level waste. The UK environment agencies are the enforcing authorities for the Radioactive Substances Act. The health and safety executive are the enforcing authority for the safety of workers at the Drigg site.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/3">With regard to arrangements for the retrieval of waste already disposed of on land, the Government have accepted a proposal from the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority that it retrieve the waste from the Dounreay shaft and process it to a form suitable either for disposal or any other long-term management option which the Government decide on for intermediate-level waste. Such retrieval will be subject to regulation by the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear installations inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/4">The consultation paper &quot;Managing radioactive waste safely&quot; sets out the Government's proposed decision making programme. The consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-12">12 March</phrase> and we would welcome comments from people all over the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/5">The radioactive waste which was dumped at sea by the UK in the past does not give any cause for concern provided it is left undisturbed. Results obtained under the OECD's co-ordinated research and environmental surveillance programme (CRESP) related to sea disposal of radioactive wastes have demonstrated that the radiological impacts on human and oceanic populations emanating from the north east Atlantic dumpsites are exceedingly small compared to the natural background levels, and are likely to remain so. This view was reiterated in the OSPAR convention's quality status report 2000, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. Any attempt to retrieve such waste would be both unnecessary and potentially hazardous for the personnel involved.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.3/1">Except in the specific circumstances under which sewage works are regulated under the IPPC provisions, local authorities have a duty under section 79(1)(d) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, to investigate complaints about smell or odours arising on industrial, trade or business premises and being prejudicial to health or a nuisance. If a local authority's environmental health officer is satisfied that the smell or odour complained about amounts to a statutory nuisance then the local authority must serve an abatement notice on the owner or occupier of the premises. However, in coming to a decision an environmental health officer would need to determine whether &quot;best practicable means&quot; are being used to prevent the nuisance or counteract its effect. Generally local authorities will try to work closely with the water undertakings to investigate and monitor odour problems from sewage treatment works without having to resort to abatement measures or legal action.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.6/1">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act was the first major piece of wildlife legislation for 20 years and introduced new rights of access to the open countryside, amended the law in relation to rights of way and improved protection and management of sites of special scientific interest, wildlife and areas of outstanding natural beauty. We believe the Act has significant benefits, both for the wildlife which, through the provisions in Parts III and IV of the Bill, it aims directly to protect and conserve, and for people better to appreciate the wildlife in our countryside.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.6/2">The wildlife and access advisory group has collated known research and guidance on the sensitivities of wildlife to access. The group comprises English Nature, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the Countryside Agency, the Countryside Council for Wales, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and others. In addition the Access Scientific Research and Monitoring Group, whose members also include EN, the agency and CCW, is advising on a range of project proposals arising from the report &quot;Access and bird conservation: priorities for research&quot;, produced in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.6/3">No studies about the implications of Part II for wildlife have been carried out or are planned: however the provisions include amendments to the circumstances in which traffic authorities may make traffic regulation orders, so as to include the purpose of protecting SSSIs.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.6/4">English Nature is responsible for implementing the new provisions for more effective protection and management of SSSIs. The improvements are likely to take time to take effect. English Nature's regular SSSI condition assessments will show over time how far the new legislation has resulted in improvements to these sites. Further detail on the exercise of the new powers will be provided in English Nature's annual report, to be published later in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.6/5">In relation to the wildlife law enforcement provisions in Schedule 12, officials have asked for information, through the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime, about the use of the new powers and the imposition of higher penalties for offences under Part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. From the responses received it is clear that the powers are being used to good effect and that at least one person has received a prison sentence while others have been given community service orders.</p>

	<p pid=".747W.2/1">Existing possibilities for competition in the water industry have led to significant improvements in the efficiency of statutory undertakers and benefits for customers. Undertakers already contract out a number of their services and activities on a competitive basis. They compete with one another to offer large industrial users water management services and customers using more than 100 mega litres of water per year are also able to take advantage of inset appointments. The regulatory regime also provides for a system of comparative competition which enables the Director General of Water Services to compare the efficiency of statutory undertakers when setting price limits. The Department has been examining the possibilities for extending the scope for competition in the water industry, including consideration of the impact this would have on different customer groups. DEFRA will be publishing a consultation paper, setting out the issues and proposals later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".747W.8/2">Climate change agreements set eligible operators challenging targets to reduce their energy use in return for an 80 per cent. reduction in the level of climate change levy on that energy use. A move to use more energy efficient combined heat and power (CHP) installations is one way in which operators can meet their targets. The targets for most facilities have taken into account any contribution that CHP installations can make. However, in some sectors not enough was known about the technical and economic feasibility of combined heat and power in their processes. In these cases the agreements provided for an assessment of the feasibility over the first 18 months of the agreements, with a view to revising targets for those installations in which CHP could make a significant, cost effective contribution, by the third milestone ie 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.8/3">The first stage in the assessment was completed in November 2001 and the second was due to be completed by <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-04">4 January</phrase>. However, current conditions in the energy markets have not helped the economic case for CHP and there have also been delays in obtaining data with which to set the tests. Consequently, stage 2 has been deferred. This will also allow the procedure's design to take account of developments resulting from the Government's draft CHP Strategy and DTI's consultation on the Impact of NETA on Smaller Generators, both of which will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.8/4">A decision on the revised timetable for the assessment will be made over the coming months but it will not delay the re-negotiation of targets for the third milestone as originally intended.</p>

	<p pid=".748W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the UK at the Environment Council held in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-29">29 October</phrase>. This was the first Environment Council of the Belgian presidency. Council reached political agreement on four common positions: the UK voted in favour of each. Four sets of Council conclusions were agreed. There were two orientation debates: one, in public, on a proposed regulation concerning traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and products derived from them, and a second on the Commission's review of the Pesticides Authorisation Directive (91/414/EEC).</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/2">Political agreement was reached without discussion on a recommendation concerning implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) in Europe. This aims to encourage member states to carry out a stocktake of institutions and laws affecting their coastal zones, and to adopt national strategies to promote integrated management.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/3">In reaching political agreement on a proposed amendment to Directive 97/68/EC on non-road mobile machinery emissions, the UK achieved its objective of ensuring deletion of an article permitting the use of economic incentives, noting that the directive did not have an appropriate legal base for such an article. The amended directive will introduce exhaust emission standards for small, off-road petrol engines and large diesel generators, and aims to align European provisions with existing US regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/4">Political agreement was also reached on an amendment to Directive 94/25/EC laying down limit values for exhaust and noise emissions from new recreational craft placed on the Community market. The Council agreed limit values at the levels proposed by the European Commission in COM(2000)639 dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-12">12 October 2000</phrase>. Particularly in relation to noise emissions, agreement was reached on less costly methods of demonstrating compliance. Overall the agreement represents a reasonable balance between achieving challenging environmental objectives while minimising the cost to small and medium-sized business and individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/5">Council reached political agreement on a proposed decision continuing for the period 2002&ndash;06 an annual funding programme for environmental NGOs active at a European level. The Commission's proposed total budget of euro 32 million was agreed. The UK's main objective of ensuring that the selection and monitoring process was transparent and fair was met in the common position text.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/6">Ministers agreed a common approach on a proposed directive to bring Community rules into line with the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention dealing with public consultation in environmental decision-making. The UK welcomed the proposal and asked that the Commission also take steps to present another proposal seeking to apply the provisions of the Aarhus convention to the Community institutions, in order to enable the Community to ratify the convention.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/7">During a public orientation debate on a proposed regulation on traceability and labelling of GMOs, Council discussed the scope of the proposed system. While welcoming the intention of the proposal to improve safety and consumer choice in GM food and crops, the UK's current judgment was that the requirement to label and trace the source of products which contain no detectable GM material would be unworkable. The UK expressed concern about whether the information given to consumers would be reliable and whether developing countries would be able to provide the information expected from importers. The UK took the view that the Commission's proposals for allowing certain imports of crops containing GMOs that are not approved in the EU were unsatisfactory as they stood and that further urgent work was needed, particularly on agreeing an international system for identifying individual GMOs. Member states were still divided on when the EU decision-making process for GM products could be restarted. While recognising the importance of the proposal to rebuilding confidence in the decision-making process on GMOs in the EU, the UK called for case-by-case consideration of applications and said that it was not tenable to encourage an illicit moratorium.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/8">Council conclusions adopted in preparation for the seventh Conference of the Parties (COP7) to the UN framework convention on climate change, taking place in Marrakech from <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-29">29 October</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-09">9 November</phrase>, called on all parties to respect the Bonn agreement, and underlined the need for progress in the relevant international fora in tackling emissions from aviation and shipping. The conclusions stressed the resolve of the Community and its member states to ratify the Kyoto protocol in a timely manner, with a view to its entry into force by the World summit on sustainable development next September. Environment Commissioner Wallstrom also presented a proposal to ratify the Kyoto protocol, a draft directive on a CO2 emissions trading scheme and a communication on the European climate change programme.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/9">Council Conclusions were adopted on a Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Programme stressing the priority attached to the problems of ozone, particulates and acidification. Council also adopted Conclusions on a Communication on Conservation of Natural Resources, and Conclusions on the Commission's general Communication on Biodiversity, highlighting the need to implement biodiversity action plans and halt biodiversity decline across the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/10">Council held a discussion to inform the adoption of six sustainable development indicators to be used in the Commission's synthesis report for the Barcelona spring European Council. The Commission would publish its report on indicators on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-31">31 October</phrase>. An exchange of views was also held on the Commission's review of Directive 91/414/EEC on agricultural pesticides. The UK stressed the need to speed up the pace of the review of older compounds. The debate also considered the substitution principle and restrictions on those allowed to use certain categories of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/11">The Belgian presidency and Commission reported on a number of proposals, including the EU Chemicals Strategy, environmental liability and a recently adopted Communication on dioxins, furans and PCBs. France briefly outlined measures taken by the French Government since a major explosion at an ammonium nitrate manufacturing plant in Toulouse in September. The inquiry into this accident will inform the planned revision of the Seveso II directive, but the Commission will not delay adoption of its proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/12">Over lunch Ministers discussed preparations for the WTO Ministerial in Doha on 9&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-11-13">13 November</phrase>, and preparations for the World summit on sustainable development (Rio+10) to be held in Johannesburg in September 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".751W.2/2">The original Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) started in 1991 and ran until May 2000. HEES was available in Great Britain and provided a single main insulation measure up to the value of &pound;315.</p>
	<p pid=".751W.2/3">New HEES was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-01">1 June 2000</phrase> and is now marketed as the Warm Front Team. The scheme has been designed to provide packages of insulation and heating measures up to &pound;2,000 to private sector householders in England, dependent upon their needs and property type. The annual budget is &pound;150 million. HEES is expected by 2004, to have provided assistance to 800,000 fuel poor householders i.e. those who spend 10 per cent. or more of their income to stay warm.</p>

Noisiness of equipment is regulated variously at UK and/or international level depending on the type of source. New noisy and noise-sensitive development is potentially subject to planning controls, and local authorities must have regard to PPG 24 (Planning and Noise) when formulating and applying their development plans. Noise from dwellings may be addressed by local authorities. Noise from aircraft taking off or landing is subject to airport-based noise controls, and in the case of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports is regulated by my right hon.

	<p pid=".760W.11/1">Tackling fuel poverty is one of this Government's key priorities. A number of measures have been put in place to ensure that by 2010, no vulnerable household will have to struggle to heat their home when it is cold. These measures include the &pound;200 winter fuel payment for households that qualify, cold weather payments, a cut in the level of VAT on fuel and radical improvements to the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.5/1">At the Brussels process ministerial meeting today the Secretary of State and Spanish Foreign Minister, Josep Pique, continued to make good progress in our discussions about Gibraltar in the atmosphere of friendship and understanding which links the UK and Spain, reaffirming the full range of commitments that we assumed at our previous meetings in London and Barcelona.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/2">Our common aim remains to conclude a comprehensive agreement before the summer, covering all outstanding issues, including co-operation and sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/3">Both Governments confirmed that their shared objective is to overcome their differences over Gibraltar and to ensure a secure future for Gibraltar in which Gibraltar can preserve its way of life and traditions, enjoy greater internal self-government, sustain and enhance its prosperity, and reap the full benefits of a harmonious and mutually beneficial co-operation in all fields together with the wider region.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/4">We reiterate our invitation to the Chief Minister of Gibraltar to attend future Brussels process meetings so that he, and through him the Gibraltarians, can join the current dialogue and contribute to it to the benefit of Gibraltar. We confirmed that the Chief Minister is warmly invited to participate on the basis of the two flags, three voices formula, having his own and distinct voice as part of the British delegation.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/5">Our intention is that the comprehensive agreement we seek will offer the best framework for a secure, stable and prosperous future for Gibraltar. In that framework, our objective is that Gibraltar can enjoy enhanced powers of internal self-government allowing its Government and population to have a greater say in their lives. We will invite the Government of Gibraltar to develop together with us the relevant ideas on this objective.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/6">We also took forward our work on all possible ways of enhancing co-operation to improve the quality of the daily lives of people in Gibraltar and the Campo region. The UK and Spain reaffirmed that the aim of the arrangements they seek is to promote the highest level of fruitful co-operation within the wider region, favouring better standards of living and working conditions in Gibraltar and the Campo, and fluid communications with the region.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/7">The Spanish Government recalled the arrangements it had made to allocate a further 70,000 telephone numbers for Gibraltar and reaffirmed that, as regards the technical responsibilities of the Spanish side, they are operational. It expressed its commitment to ensure that no obstacles prevent their immediate use for the benefit of all Gibraltarians. To that end, the UK and Spain agreed to engage in immediate talks to assess the situation and attain their objective. Both Governments also tackled the issue of pensions, a problem on which they will intensify their efforts to find a prompt solution consistent with the responsibilities of the public authorities involved.</p>

	<p pid=".768W.3/1">Regular media and oil industry reports have shown that in 2001 Syria suddenly began exporting an average of over 100,000 barrels of oil per day more than the previous year, without increasing its own domestic production. These reports have consistently attributed this to Syria's illegal import of large quantities of Iraqi oil through the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline connecting the two countries. 100,000 barrels per day is a significant amount of oil, worth at current prices about $260 million of humanitarian funding every six months. This is more than Iraq plans to spend on medicine or education under the current six-month phase of the humanitarian programme. The export of Iraqi oil, without seeking UN approval, would be a serious breach of UN resolutions 661 and 986. We have therefore sought Syrian assurances in the UN Sanctions Committee that they will make transparent the operation of this pipeline, bring it within the UN system and allow the revenue raised from it to benefit the Iraqi people rather than the Baghdad regime.</p>

	<p pid=".770W.2/1">Health spending per head of population in North Staffordshire health authority was &pound;675.34 in 1999&ndash;2000 and &pound;725.72 in 2000&ndash;01. Future estimates of spending are not available.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/2" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/3" class="indent">1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/4" class="indent">the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission health care;</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/5" class="indent">asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities; and</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/6" class="indent">some double counting of expenditure between health authorities and primary care trusts within the health authority area.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/7" class="indent">Expenditure on health per head cannot therefore be reliably compared between health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/8" class="indent">Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/9" class="indent">2. Expenditure on health is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent on the commission of health care by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/10" class="indent">3. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be readily identified.</p>

Some people may also seek help through other routes, including specialised services in the charitable and voluntary sector. We support a selection of such services each year.</p>

	<p pid=".771W.6/1">We take very seriously our responsibility to protect infant health in the United Kingdom, and support the promotion of breast-feeding. It is important that women and their partners are able to make a fully informed choice on how to feed their babies based on accurate and consistent information. This means that women should have access to information about all infant feeding practices through the relevant health care professional.</p>
	<p pid=".771W.6/2">The Infant Feeding Initiative was established in May 1999 with the aim to increase the incidence and duration of breast-feeding among those groups of the population where breast-feeding rates are the lowest, as well as to help all women to make informed choices about how they feed their infant. Breast-feeding rates are low in lower socio- economic groups. A total budget of nearly &pound;3 million over three years from Public Health Development Fund has been allocated for this initiative and reflects our commitment to tackle health inequalities that was highlighted by the Acheson report.</p>
	<p pid=".771W.6/3">It included the appointment of two part-time National Infant Feeding Advisers and funding of 79 &quot;best practice&quot; projects to date to enable effective communication and evaluation of current good practice, to address the barriers to breast-feeding, and thereby lead to improved breast- feeding rates among those least likely to breast-feed. This has resulted in joint working efforts between health professionals and voluntary organisations. Sure start initiatives also support local projects on breast-feeding.</p>
	<p pid=".771W.6/4">Other departmental activity includes support for an annual National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, support to four main voluntary organisations involved in the promotion of breast-feeding, research into breast-feeding through quinquennial surveys of infant feeding practices, and maintaining close links with UNICEF's Baby Friendly Initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".774W.0/113">1. Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".775W.5/1">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective medicines in the treatment of depression, features of which may include suicidal behaviour. It is known that features of depression, including suicidal behaviour, can worsen after introduction of any antidepressant prior to its beneficial effect being apparent.</p>
	<p pid=".775W.5/2">As with all medicines the safety of TCAs and selective SSRIs is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The safety profiles of TCAs and SSRIs are well established and are reflected in the product information for prescribers and patients.</p>
	<p pid=".775W.5/3">Reports of adverse effects, including suicidal behaviour, suspected to be associated with SSRIs and TCAs are collated by MCA/CSM through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the yellow card scheme. These data are reviewed on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid=".775W.5/4">A possible causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour has been reviewed by the CSM on a number of occasions, most recently in 2001. The CSM concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to confirm a causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour and advised that the issue should be kept under review.</p>
	<p pid=".775W.5/5">The product information and the British National Formulary warn that patients should be closely monitored for suicidal impulses, particularly in the early stages of treatment. An article emphasising this advice was published in the MCA/CSM drug safety bulletin &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot; in September 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.3/1">Diagnosis of autism and early interventions are being considered by an independent group chaired by Professor Ann Le Couteur which is expected to report in 2002. The Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and Paediatrics and Child Health, the National Autistic Society and the British Psychological Society are all represented. The Department and the Department for Education and Skills both have observers on the group. We will consider what further discussions may be required in the light of the group's report.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/2">As we develop the National Service Framework (NSF) for children we will consider the needs of disabled children, including those with autism. The NSF will set out to tackle inequalities, raise standards and reduce unacceptable variations in NHS and social services. We have recently announced that one of the exemplars we will use to show how services should be provided will be around services for children with autism.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/3">The data requested on numbers of psychiatrists and waiting times for assessments are not collected centrally. We recognise that assessment of communication skills plays an important part in the diagnosis of autism. This requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency assessment and may be led by a consultant community paediatrician or a child and adolescent psychiatrist. In some places specialist learning disability psychiatrists offer a service to children as well as adults and they, rather than child and adolescent psychiatrists, will be involved in diagnosis and management of children with autism. All these professionals have a broad range of responsibilities. The proportion of their time devoted to diagnosis and treatment of autism will vary. In the three years ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> we will have invested some &pound;85 million in children and adolescent mental health services across the national health service and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/4">We have no objection in principle to involving the private sector in assessment processes at whatever stage may be appropriate. Local statutory authorities have a duty to ensure that the particular health and social care needs of each person with autism are met with genuine choices for both clients and families, through the most appropriate community based services, in a cost-effective way. They should determine the pattern of services in their areas in the light of their knowledge of local needs.</p>

	<p pid=".787W.2/1">The Department obtains advice on the possible health implications of exposure to electromagnetic fields, including the extremely low frequency fields (ELF) associated with overhead power cables, from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).</p>
	<p pid=".787W.2/2">In March last year, the NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) issued a report on &quot;ELF Electromagnetic Fields and the Risk of Cancer&quot;. This was issued following a wide-ranging and thorough review of scientific research related to this issue. The group concluded that the power frequency electromagnetic fields that exist in the vast majority of homes are not a cause of cancer in general. However, some epidemiological studies do indicate a possible doubling of the risk of childhood leukaemia associated with exposure to unusually high levels of power frequency magnetic fields. The AGNIR found no clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect in adults or of a plausible explanation from experiments on animals or isolated cells. Their view was that the epidemiological evidence is currently not strong enough to justify a firm conclusion that such fields cause leukaemia in children.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.2/3">The board of NRPB issued a statement following publication of the AGNIR report. This indicated that if the doubling of the risk of leukaemia in children with exposures to magnetic fields above 0.4 T (400 nanotesla) was causal then an additional two cases of childhood leukaemia might be caused each year in the UK in addition to the 500 cases that would arise from other causes. Possibly one case every two years would be due to proximity to powerlines. There is no clear evidence of effects of magnetic fields on other cancers in children or of any cancers in adults. The AGNIR is, however, examining the possible effects on health of corona ions generated by powerlines. A number of concerns have been raised by members of the academic community in the United Kingdom that corona ions may have an influence on the behaviour of pollutant aerosols and cause an increase in exposure which could cause increases in risk of cancer or other diseases.</p>

	<p pid=".789W.5/2">The mobile telephone health research (MTHR) programme that has recently been announced follows from the publication of a report in May 2000 by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE on &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&quot;. Radio signals from handsets were identified as a research priority because local exposures of people using phones are in general appreciably higher than exposures to the whole body from base stations. In both cases, however, exposures need to comply with exposure guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".789W.5/3">The first group of proposals agreed for funding by the programme management committee has generally related to the areas of research identified in the Stewart report. Although the main focus of much of the funded research relates to the use of mobile phones, in practice many of the experimental studies will also be valuable in providing evidence on any possible effects on people of exposures to radiofrequency (RF) radiation from base stations. The agreed programme includes a study on exposures from the newer types of base station that are being introduced in urban areas. Details of research now approved for funding are given on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".789W.5/4">A second call for proposals was issued last year with a deadline for submission of outline proposals of <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-25">Friday 25 January 2002</phrase>. The aim of this call was to extend the range of research being carried out in the MTHR programme. One aim of this call was to seek further proposals for volunteer studies that will examine possible effects of RF exposure of people. The proposals have yet to be considered but it is expected that some of the proposals will be of direct relevance to exposures to RF radiation from base stations.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's last Budget, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-08">8 March 2001</phrase>, did not include an announcement of new money for hospices. Funding to increase investment in specialist palliative care was included in the resources to support implementation of the NHS Cancer Plan. The overall increased investment for implementing the Cancer Plan includes an additional &pound;50 million for specialist palliative care by 2004. This investment is intended to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and enable the national health service to increase their contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service. This will mean that NHS investment in specialist palliative services will match that of the voluntary sector.</p>
