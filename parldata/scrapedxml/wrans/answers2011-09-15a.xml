	<p pid="a.1250W.0/1">Energy and climate change policies are funded by a mixture of levies and general taxation. Levy-funded policies (such as the renewables obligation (RO), feed-in tariffs (FITs) and warm home discount (WHD)) place the obligation of financing the policies onto energy companies which is then passed onto the consumer. Estimates of how these levies impact the public finances were published in Budget 2011, see Tables C.3 and C.4 of:</p>

At spending review 2010, the Government committed up to &#163;l billion for the capital investment for the first CCS demonstration project.

	<p pid="a.1254W.0/1">The decision to close the Sellafield MOX Plant (SMP) was an operational and commercial matter for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The Government were kept fully informed and as it was clear that closure was the only commercially viable option they endorsed the decision on value for money grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254W.0/2">While the closure of SMP is regrettable, it should not detract from the fact that the renaissance of nuclear in the UK opens up new opportunities for Sellafield. The site continues to be the home to much of our nuclear skills, our nuclear expertise and many of our key facilities. It has also been identified as one of eight sites for a new nuclear power station.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254W.0/3">The NDA's decision on SMP has no connection with the separate consideration by the Government of the policy options for dealing with the UK's plutonium stockpile. We consulted earlier this year on our preliminary view that the best prospect of delivering a long-term solution for plutonium management will be by reusing the plutonium to make mixed oxide fuel. As set out in the consultation document SMP was never expected to be used for dealing with the UK stockpile of plutonium.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254W.0/4">We are currently reviewing the results of that consultation and expect to publish the outcome and next steps later this autumn. If, following the consultation, the Government were to decide to reuse plutonium as MOX fuel, in due course we would need to consider building a new MOX fabrication plant. Any such plant would need to take fully into account the lessons from SMP and from other MOX plants around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.1255W.2/1">The information is not available: the question refers to data on all private rented sector (PRS) rents which come from market evidence data (MED) collected by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and rent services in Scotland and Wales. The data consider a relatively small selection of properties and are used to generate local housing allowance rates for each broad rental market area (BRMA). However, it is not a comprehensive source of data on the number of rents that are below the 30th percentile of the local rent distribution.</p>

Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example, it does not include applications which were processed clerically and have not yet been entered on to the Social Fund Computer System. 5. If an applicant receives an initial award and this award is increased on first review in the same month as the initial award was made, then the Policy, Budget and Management Information System (PBMIS) does not count the initial award and the review award separately, but counts one award on the one application. However, if a first review award is made in a later month than the initial award, then PBMIS counts two awards on the one application. Similarly, if an initial or first review award is increased by the Independent Review Service, then all awards made in the same month on one application count as one award. However, if an initial award or any review award(s) on one application are made in different months, then PBMIS will count one award for each month in which an initial or review award was made. Because of this counting method, only the numbers of initial awards have been given. 6. Figures are for initial awards made, not the number of people who received an initial award.

An assessment of the technology available for the delivery of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), including robotic systems, was also made in the report. A copy of the NRIG report has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.8/2">The report brought together all the existing evidence on SBRT and concluded that a small number of patients would benefit from this treatment. There are at least 20 radiotherapy centres across the country with the capability of delivering this treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1261W.8/3">Ensuring that all cancer patients receive the appropriate treatment delivered to a high standard is critical to improving cancer outcomes. It is now for the local national health service to take account of this guidance when considering whether to commission SBRT for a particular indication. As with all clinical decisions, these should be made locally on a case-by-case basis taking into account the individual circumstances of each patient.</p>

	<p pid="a.1270W.5/1">The Government closely monitors, relevant research on the role of financial market activity on commodity markets and prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270W.5/2">It is important to note that trading in commodities markets plays an important role in providing liquidity (the volume of trades being made in a market) in these markets and that liquidity is essential to the effective functioning of these markets. Against the backdrop of climate change, and the possibility that international agricultural prices may become more volatile over time, the role of agricultural futures and options markets, and the liquidity they rely on, become more important. Liquid, well functioning markets bring important benefits to commodity producers, processors and traders, sending important price signals and allowing them to hedge price risks, and as such benefit end consumers as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270W.5/3">The Government strongly supports the G20 commitment to improve the regulation, functioning, and transparency of financial and commodity markets and the UK authorities are playing a full role towards meeting this objective&#8212;working with partners in the EU and internationally. The Government supports greater transparency in commodities derivative markets, including the reporting of positions by trader type, especially where it enables data to be compared across different markets allowing regulators to analyse, interpret and act where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270W.5/4">On the regulation, and limiting of positions in commodity markets, the Government supports strong regulatory oversight powers including through the application of an active and formalised position management regime. A position management regime means that the regulator actively monitors what is happening in the market. If it is concerned about any activity, the regulator can intervene with those carrying out the activity, requiring them to explain their actions or, if necessary, to wind down their position in the market. The authority to set position limits would appropriately be a part of a position management regime, though not the leading element. Position limits by their nature are inflexible tools, and the Government is sceptical that such measures would be effective in reducing the presence of a particular participant type in the market, or would be an effective tool to address price volatility. Indeed, position limits may ultimately reduce liquidity, which could pose serious risks to those markets and could increase price volatility.</p>

	<p pid="a.1285W.0/2">We deeply regret all civilian casualties. Protecting the Afghan civilian population is a cornerstone of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)'s mission, and all British troops undergo comprehensive training on the strict rules of engagement. Where incidents do occur, procedures are in place to ensure they are promptly reported to the chain of command and follow-up actions take place in accordance with ISAF and UK national procedures. This contrasts directly with the attitude of the insurgents, whose indiscriminate use of suicide bombs, roadside explosive devices and human shields cause the majority of civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan. We will continue our efforts to prevent insurgents harming civilians and to develop the capacity of Afghan security forces to protect the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.0/3">The records relating to the follow-up actions taken following these incidents are not held centrally by the Department and will take time to identify. I will write to the hon. Member once work has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.0/4" class="italic">Substantive answer from Liam Fox to Paul Flynn:</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.0/5">I undertook to write to you in response to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-03">3 November 2010</phrase> (Official Report, columns 847W-850W) on Armed Forces Investigations. I am new in a position to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.0/6">Let me begin by reiterating that protecting Afghan civilians is among our and ISAF's top priorities. There are strict procedures in place to both minimise the risk of casualties occurring and to investigate any incidents that, regrettably, do happen. Where there are incidents in which civilians have been injured or killed, and UK forces are potentially believed to have been involved, the chain of command conducts an investigation to ensure that Rules of Engagement (ROE) have been complied with and Escalation of Force procedures followed. If it is suspected that a criminal act has taken place it will be reported to the Service Police for further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.0/7">The information disclosed by Wikileaks about each incident came from the Serious incident Report, which is an initial snapshot of what occurred, often reported in the few moments immediately after an event. Because of their immediacy to the event these reports do not always have all of the-facts and it is .for this reason that sub-sequent, more detailed investigations are conducted to consider all of the relevant information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1285W.0/8">I can confirm that we have located the necessary records to confirm that 11 of the incidents you enquired about were fully investigated by the Chain of Command in theatre. All the troops involved complied with UK ROE and followed Escalation of Force procedures correctly. Those incidents were:</p>

	<p pid="a.1285W.0/40">With regard to Allegation 6 (dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-12">12 March 2008</phrase>), no investigation took place as there was no indication of civilian casualties. A possible Afghan National Police casualty was initially reported (as published by Wikileaks) but a few moments later he was confirmed as a UK soldier. UK helicopters were called in and engaged the enemy. However, despite The Guardian stating two women and two children were killed, and another child injured, in this incident there is no mention of this in our reports.</p>

These arrangements are often referred to as 'Yellow Book' rules. This is because the EU treaties and the directive establishes the legal framework under which a decision is made to procure goods, works and services in the defence and security fields either sole source or through competition. Only when that decision has been made are any specific rules governing the selected type of procurement applied. When a decision, in compliance with that legal framework, has been made to procure sole source, then the existing sole source arrangements will continue to apply to that procurement.</p>

It does have a small potential future pipeline of housing and aircrew training service projects which are subject to investment decisions prior to commencing procurement. The MOD remains committed to using PFI only where it is value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.1299W.5/1">When major assets such as ships and aircraft become surplus to requirements, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) first looks at selling to other governments. This has the potential benefit of strengthening international relationships and generating income that can be reinvested in defence. It also enables other governments to contribute to international security and could also provide UK industry with opportunities to undertake some of the regeneration work. If such a sale is not feasible, then other options are considered, such as sale to private commercial enterprises or even recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.5/2">When the MOD updates its equipment and stock, surplus and obsolete items (including spare parts) are sold through the MOD's own Disposal Services Authority (DSA), largely through a network of marketing agreements for the collection, storage, and specialist marketing and sale of surplus equipments, so as to achieve the best return for the taxpayer. Contractors are selected through open competition in compliance with European Union public procurement regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.5/3">The DSA marketing contractors will sell through target marketing to potential customers, direct negotiation or by competitive tender or auction including websites for purely commercially viable kit where this route to market will provide the optimum return. DSA are not made aware of the market value of equipment when it is declared as surplus but can set a minimum guaranteed price and a minimum selling price for major and unusual items when they are sold by the marketing contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299W.5/4">In the financial year 2010-11, the MOD achieved receipts of around &#163;10 million from the sale of surplus naval equipment, including items such as capital ships, naval spares and scrap, small boats, clothing and vehicles.</p>

Most of this funding comes from efficiency savings from remaining BSF projects&#8212;all of which are continuing as planned. This money will be allocated in this financial year to the local authorities with the greatest demographic pressures so they can provide enough places, especially at primary schools, in 2012. Details of those allocations will be provided in the autumn. Although this is 2011-12 money, it will be delivered to local authorities as unringfenced grant, where they have no time-limit on spend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.0/3">Local authorities can invest this funding in additional places in all categories of school, considering where the additional places will best benefit the children of their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.0/4">The Secretary of State also announced the establishment of a new, privately-financed, programme of school building which will address between 100 and 300 of the schools in the worst condition. We expect to announce in December 2011 the projects which will be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.0/5">We are currently consulting on the recommendations made in Sebastian James's review of education capital and will make further announcements on local capital allocations when we have considered the responses. We would expect all local authorities to maintain asset management plans, enabling effective targeting and timing of investment in the schools across their estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1304W.3/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. The Chief Inspector, Miriam Rosen, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Miriam Rosen, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-08">8 September 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/3">Your recent Parliamentary Question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/4">Ofsted has regulated and inspected childcare providers since September 2001, taking over that function from local authorities. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase> Ofsted registered providers by type of care including full day care and out of school care. The Childcare Act 2006 which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September 2008</phrase> changed the way in which childcare was registered and categorised. From this date Ofsted has held two registers, the Early Years Register for providers caring for children from birth until <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August</phrase> after their fifth birthday, and the Childcare Register for older children or where compulsory registration is not required. The Childcare Act also removed the different types of childcare and combined ail types of care on non-domestic premises into one category &#8216;childcare on non-domestic premises&#8217;. This includes full day care settings and out of school care but also has other types of care within it such as sessional pre-schools. The figures below therefore use the new categories from September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/5">The information you have requested is provided in Tables A and B below. Figures are provided by financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/6">You requested the number of providers who have opened in each year since 2005-06. We have provided the number of those who have registered with us in each of the years since this date. This does not necessarily mean that these have opened for the first time. Some are registrations where providers change their legal entity, for example from an individual to a limited company, but still continue to provide childcare from the same address; or involve providers who are already registered with us on one register and who choose at a later date to register on the other register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/7">For &#8216;closed&#8217; providers we have given the number of providers who resigned or had their registration with Ofsted cancelled in the year concerned. Some of these providers may have resigned from one register but continue to provide childcare in relation to the other register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/8">Please note that the same provider may appear in figures for both the full day care</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/9">and the out of school day care, up to and including the first part of the year 2008-09, This is because it was possible for the same provider to register to provide both day care types.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304W.3/10">A copy of this reply has been sent to Sarah Teather, Minister of State for Children and Families, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1307W.2/2">When carrying out an appraisal of a project or policy, the Green Book sets out that options should be adjusted for material differences in tax. Differences in tax receipts between PFI and conventionally funded projects are considered as part of HM Treasury's Value for Money model which is run for each PFI project at the appraisal stage. The output of the model is one source of information that is used to inform the overall value for money assessment of the project.

Since then the Secretary of State for Education has announced further support for schools with the greatest need. A new, privately-financed programme of school building (the Priority School Building programme) will address between 100 and 300 of the schools in the worst condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1322W.3/1">Our assessment is that China is developing its economic and political relations with countries surrounding the Indian ocean, including through investments and infrastructure projects. The 2010 White Paper on &#8216;China's National Defence&#8217; stated that the Chinese Navy had been developing its capabilities to conduct operations in distant waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1322W.3/2">It is important for UK interests that China uses its growing economic, political and military weight in a responsible manner, in line with international norms and global interests.

We continue to step up our engagement with China through political, diplomatic and military channels on the full range of foreign and security policy issues.

The required statement under Section 5 of the Act as to whether the treaty falls within Section 4 must be made within two months of the date when the Accession Treaty is agreed. We therefore expect it to be made within two months of signature of the Accession treaty, expected in December 2011.

The UK missions in Tripoli and Benghazi have met representatives of minority communities on the NTC. The NTC has made clear its commitment to international humanitarian and human rights law. Article 6 of the NTC's Draft Constitutional Declaration states that 'all Libyans are equal before the law, enjoy equal civil and political rights and equal opportunities, have equal duties and public responsibilities, and are not discriminated against because of religion, faith, language, wealth, gender, ancestry, political views, social status or tribal, group or family affiliation'. Article 8 of the same document sets out that the Libyan state will guarantee equal opportunities to all citizens, including the provision of adequate living standards and right to work, education, healthcare and social security for every citizen. We welcome this emphasis and the NTC's commitment, and we will continue to raise the issue of minority rights. We will also explore the scope for provision of international support and expertise to the NTC in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1334W.0/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has operated a fully flexible resourcing system since April 2011. This model enables the Department to quickly adapt to changing priorities by targeting resources in order to meet our departmental objectives. The Department operated a more limited model of flexible resourcing from 2008 onwards in which some individuals were in a flexible pool but others were in standing teams dedicated to specific policy areas. As individuals are deployed flexibly across our entire remit, we do not have the data to provide complete FTE figures broken down to specific policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338W.8/1">Schedule 21 of the 2003 Act provides guidance to judges in determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence for murder. It provides for starting points not mandatory minimum terms. Schedule 21 provides for a starting point of 30 years for a murder aggravated by hostility towards the victim on the basis of race, religion, and sexual orientation, but not disability. We are aware of this anomaly and we are currently looking at the best way to address it. However, it is important to bear in mind that the courts can, and do, aggravate sentence in cases of hate crime whatever form it might take.</p>

He made a number of recommendations that are designed through their emphasis on the importance of a risk-based approach to H&amp;S to reduce the burden of compliance with H&amp;S requirements on Small and Medium Enterprises and micro-businesses, including self-employed people. A further review of H&amp;S legislation (both domestic and EU) has been commissioned by the Minister of State for Employment, Department for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" name="Chris Grayling">the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>. The review is being led by Professor Ragnar Loefstedt and I expect him to set out his views on whether we can sensibly make further simplifications and/or exemptions to H&amp;S regulations.</p>

She was asked by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to identify what the Government, local authorities and businesses can do to create diverse, sustainable high streets where small businesses and independent retailers are able to thrive. Mary Portas is engaging with not just retailers, but all high street businesses, the public sector and the third sector to identify what the Government, local authorities, businesses and the third sector can do to create diverse and sustainable high streets. This includes considering how best to develop high streets that contribute to promoting economic growth, creating jobs and improving the quality of life in local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1345W.5/2">The Government's plan for growth, published alongside Budget 2011, committed BIS and the Department for Communities and Local Government to develop a package of measures to support thriving town centres and build on the Town Centre First Policy.

	<p pid="a.1345W.5/3">In addition, we have published the &#8220;Healthy High Street Guide&#8221; to help communities recognise decline in their high streets and take appropriate action. It is a practical guide for local businesses and people, which they can use to evaluate their shopping areas, and draw up a plan of action to improve them. It can also be used by communities to look at what their retailers offer, what is available elsewhere in the area, and what can be done to develop these offerings in a complementary way.</p>

	<p pid="a.1350W.3/1">This information is not held in the form requested, but it is possible to provide notional figures for the amount of grant distributed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for teaching and research apportioned by the number of learners (full-time equivalent) in each year. It should be noted that there have been some significant changes in HEFCE's funding methodology over this period which means that the following table should not be read as a time series. In addition the data do not take account of other sources of public funding, for example from the NHS or the research councils. Crucially it should be borne in mind that institutions have a significant degree of freedom in terms of how their grant is distributed internally. It is for that reason that the figures given are notional and should not be read as the actual level of resource attached to any particular learner.</p>

Economic growth is the top priority for the Government and discussions cover a wide range of issues, including how we can help UK manufacturers take advantage of the opportunities presented by the transition to a green economy and development of a package of measures for energy intensive businesses whose international competitiveness is most affected by our energy and climate change policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353W.5/3">In addition UK Trade and Investment, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, and the Department for Energy and Climate Change work closely together to attract inward investment to support the development of low carbon infrastructure, for example for offshore wind manufacturing. There are also considerable opportunities for our manufacturers from developing greener production processes throughout the supply chain, so that they minimise carbon emissions and use energy and resources efficiently and effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1356W.8/1">The Government take a view on the overall level of funding to science and research and its distribution between the research councils. These decisions are informed by external advice drawn from a wide range of expert sources including academia and industry, both nationally and internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.8/2">Every Government will have some key national strategic priorities, which the research base has a role in addressing. It is appropriate for Ministers to ask the research councils to consider programmes to tackle these strategic priorities, but it is for the councils to decide on specific projects and people to fund within these priorities, free from ministerial interference.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.8/3">In line with the Haldane Principle, BIS does not interfere on decisions concerning funding of individual research proposals, which are best taken by researchers themselves through peer review. This is a matter for individual research councils based on advice from the science community. The coalition Government support this principle as vital for the protection of academic independence and excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1356W.8/4">The Medical Research Council (MRC) has worked with its major stakeholder groups to review and evaluate its strategic direction. Discussions with the MRC's Council (which BIS attends), Strategy Board, its research boards and overview groups have reflected on how the MRC can be best positioned to deliver its mission. BIS also has sight of MRC's draft strategic plan before it is published.</p>

	<p pid="a.1363W.2/1">The &#163;20 million High Street Support scheme announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-11">11 August</phrase> will support businesses affected by the recent disturbances. It will help them to get back up and running quickly, for instance if assistance is needed with business clear-up, replacement of equipment, or costs of temporary accommodation. This includes help with cash flow while insurance claims are being made, staff costs incurred while the business is affected by temporary closure, and many costs not fully covered by insurance. Local authorities will also be able to use the fund to cover the full costs of business rate hardship relief for affected business up to the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1363W.2/2">Government recognise that the impact on business will continue beyond this immediate recovery period. We continue to work together with local enterprise partnerships, local authorities and trade and business organisations to identify what longer term help is needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366W.2/1">We currently estimate that of the new students starting courses from September 2012 onwards, around 60% of those taking student loans will repay the balance of the loan in full, while around 40% will have some of their loan written off. Loans are written off 30 years after the borrower becomes liable to repay or on the death or permanent disability of the borrower.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.2/2">These figures are consistent with our estimate that the resource accounting and budgeting charge for the loans&#8212;representing the cost of both write-offs and interest subsidies&#8212;will be around 30% of the face value of loans issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1366W.2/3">All of the above estimates are for full time English students at UK institutions and full time EU students at English institutions.</p>
