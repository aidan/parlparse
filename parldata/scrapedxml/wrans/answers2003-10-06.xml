	<p pid=".993W.3/1">The Government are taking action to tackle the complex factors behind the pay gap, including promoting voluntary pay reviews and good practice on equal pay. We have set a target for pay reviews and are working in partnership with businesses and trade unions, the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) and Opportunity Now towards ensuring that 35 per cent. of large companies have done pay reviews by 2006. We provided the EOC with &pound;100,000 to produce a toolkit to help employers conduct pay reviews and provided trade unions with additional funding to train over 400 representatives in equal pay issues. The Government have committed all civil service Departments and agencies to review their pay systems and produce action plans to close any equal pay gaps, 83 action plans have been submitted, representing 98 per cent. of the civil service. We are also taking steps to widen women's opportunities in the labour market. The Employment Act 2002 introduced measures to help parents maintain links with the world of work and better balance their work and home lives. These will help women return to the labour market and have a positive impact on the pay gap. The Act also introduced an equal pay questionnaire that will make it easier to tackle pay discrimination in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.6/2">We have set out a comprehensive approach to tackle trafficking in women and other forms of organised crime in the &quot;White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven&quot; published in 2002. The United Kingdom was one of the first countries to sign the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, and its Optional Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children. The Government also supports action to combat trafficking, in both European Union and international fora and has supported information campaigns aimed at alerting women to the risks involved in such illegal immigration.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.6/3">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 introduced a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling prostitution with a maximum penalty of 14 years, and comprehensive offences covering trafficking into, out of and within the UK for purposes of sexual exploitation are included in the Sexual Offences Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.6/4">The Government have also recently published a trafficking toolkit, which will be a best practice guide for immigration officers, police and others potentially dealing with trafficking. A pilot scheme to support victims of trafficking to help them give evidence against their exploiters has been running since March 2003.</p>

Interchange is a key tool in meeting that commitment. Secondments are encouraged as part of the interchange programme, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the civil service and other organisations. Before an interchange can occur all parties must be satisfied that no conflict of interest arises. In all cases agreement is reached with the parent organisation on the salary reimbursed by the Cabinet Office to ensure it falls in the civil service pay range appropriate to the post.</p>

	<p pid=".999W.6/1">The CPS handles about 13,000 cases of domestic violence each year. The revised policy on prosecution of cases of domestic violence launched in November 2001 focuses on the safety of the victim and children and on conducting cases, wherever possible, on the basis of evidence other than that of the victim. The work done by the CPS at operational level is complemented by the strategic contribution of the network of CPS Domestic Violence Co-ordinators across England and Wales who share information and good practice and issue guidance to prosecutors to help them identify and address difficult and sensitive issues that are regularly raised in domestic violence cases.</p>
	<p pid=".999W.6/2">The CPS also contributes to the Government's strategy by consulting and working closely at a local level with criminal justice partners and the voluntary sector by participating in local domestic violence fora. At national level the CPS Policy lead on domestic violence attends the Home Office Virtual Unit and made a significant input into the Government White Papers, &quot;Justice for All&quot; and &quot;Safety and Justice&quot;, addressing issues of prevention, protection and support.</p>

	<p pid=".1000W.3/3">To help to counter the increasing insecurity, four international joint civil-military provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) have been established in Mazar-e Sharif, Bamiyan, Kunduz and Gardez with four more planned to be operational before the end of this year in Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat and Charikar. The PRTs are designed to bring stability to the regions and facilitate the reconstruction effort of the Afghan Administration, UN and NGOs</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.8/1">The central focus of the Government's policy on international development is a commitment to the internationally agreed target to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015, together with associated targets including basic health care provision and universal access to primary education. We believe that reducing poverty is the best way of empowering people to take control of their own lives and gain access to basic requirements such as food, shelter and water.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/2">The Monterrey Consensus, agreed at the UN Financing for Development conference in Monterrey in 2002, recognised the crucial role played by developing countries' own poverty reduction strategies. Experience has shown that the reform agendas drawn up locally are more successful than those imposed from outside. More effective use of aid means moving away from donors allocating funding to selected sectors and donor-led projects to providing support that is consistent with poverty reduction strategies drawn up by the developing countries themselves. It is for this reason that we do not plan our resources on the basis of different sectors. Rather, we allocate funds to regions and countries and allow country programmes to determine priorities according to national plans.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/3">It is not therefore possible to provide an exact figure for the percentage of the Department's overall budget spent on particular sectors. Over half of the Department's overall budget is allocated to expenditure through multilateral organisations and other categories, such as direct budget support and humanitarian aid, where it is difficult to attribute precisely spending according to sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/4">We are committed to the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation as well as to the adoption of national policies and strategies for integrated water resources management in all developing countries by 2005. Improvements to water management are central to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. DFID expenditure on water and sanitation in 2001&ndash;002 was &pound;33.8 million. We do not yet have final figures for 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/5">The United Nations agency responsible for shelter is UN-Habitat. The UK contribution is around &pound;1 million a year (which in 2002&ndash;03 amounted to 27 per cent. of their core funding). We do not have figures on bilateral spending on shelter.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/6">The causes of hunger are many and include poverty, ill health, exclusion, conflict and natural disasters. Poverty is, however, the principal cause. The concept of 'food security' focuses on people's ability to obtain food, rather than simply on food production, which is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for tackling hunger. Policies to tackle food insecurity need to be based on a clear understanding of who is hungry and why. The design of such policies needs to take into account people's vulnerability, the impact of shocks and the effects of trade policies.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/7">DFID spent an average of around &pound;275 million a year in the period 1998&ndash;99&ndash;2000&ndash;01 on Sustainable Livelihoods (including Agriculture and Food Security). Final figures are not yet available for 2002&ndash;03. This does not include short-term emergency food aid.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/8">DFID's total bilateral spend in 2001&ndash;02 was &pound;1,506 million, of which &pound;964 million can be allocated by sector (this does not include budget support or humanitarian assistance).</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/9">It should be noted that all these figures are likely to understate the amounts actually spent in these sectors for the reasons given above and because, in the past, DFID only attributed expenditure to one sector even when an activity contributed to more than one sector.</p>

	<p pid=".1007W.0/1">The Government of Ethiopia are undertaking a programme of voluntary resettlement. We recognise that if properly managed, such programmes can have a role to play as part of a wider set of actions to address food insecurity. However, badly managed resettlement can have a negative impact if people are moved into inappropriate areas or given insufficient support or services.</p>
	<p pid=".1007W.0/2">There clearly have been some cases of inappropriate resettlement in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region. Our overall policy has been to engage with the federal and regional Government to promote a more careful and measured approach. In addition, we have remained ready to respond to humanitarian situations that might develop. Our Ethiopia office will continue to monitor the situation carefully.</p>

	<p pid=".1010W.8/1">Recent assessments suggest that the Baghdad water system is working at approximately 80 per cent. of its pre-war capacity, and that 75 per cent. of the population of Baghdad has access to sewage networks. The supply of clean water and access to sanitation in other areas is difficult to assess accurately. UNICEF and the General Corporation for Water Supply are compiling a database on progress in the water and sanitation sector in order to provide better assessments of the current level of services.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.8/2">Electricity supply throughout Iraq has improved over the last month. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-08">8 September</phrase>, power generation had reached 3550 megawatts, approximately 81 per cent. of the pre-war level of 4400 megawatts. The Coalition Provisional Administration has set a target for reaching this pre-war level by the end of September. Work is also taking place to restore the transmission grid, which has suffered particularly badly from looting and sabotage. This will allow the additional power to be used effectively throughout the country to improve the reliability of service and to provide additional power to the less well served areas. In July and August Baghdad had power on a 3 hours on and 3 hours off basis while Basrah had up to 20 hours per day.</p>

	<p pid=".1014W.0/1">The Middle East and North Africa compares badly with other regions of similar incomes and characteristics in terms of public accountability and inclusiveness. A number of reports have been published recently which highlight the relationship between accountable governance and economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa. The 2002 &quot;Arab Human Development Report&quot; concluded that social and economic development was being hampered by deeply rooted shortcomings in the structures of governance in the region. More recently, a World Bank's report, &quot;Better Governance in the Middle East and North Africa&quot;, noted that income growth per head averaged just 0.5 per cent. across the region in the period 1985&ndash;2000, and at the heart of this poor record was a noticeable &quot;governance gap&quot;. Taken together, these reports provide a substantial body of evidence to support the view that improving accountable governance, strengthening political and economic freedoms, and enhancing public participation are prerequisites for lasting economic, social and human development in the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1014W.0/2">Promoting better governance is a key feature of DFID's bilateral programme to the region: this is set out as a central theme of our soon-to-be-published Regional Assistance Plan. Examples include support to public administration and civil service reform in both Jordan and the Palestinian Territory. We are also working to help ensure that the European Commission's development programme takes proper account of the need to improve governance and respect for human rights, and reduce poverty, in partner countries in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".1014W.6/19">DFID support for reproductive health is wide ranging. It covers HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and maternal and adolescent health. Reproductive health also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health and in particular to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection. The &pound;31 million expenditure for 2003&ndash;03 cannot therefore be apportioned between HIV/AIDS and Family Planning, as many reproductive health programmes and projects contribute to both objectives (for example through the provision of information on family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention or the provision of condoms).</p>

The UN, Organisation for Security and Co-operation for Europe (OSCE), the EU is active in South Ossetia. The UN through its UNOCHA and (formerly the UNHCR) is responsible for humanitarian assessments and aid provision. The EC has participated in the Joint Control Commission (JCC) on South Ossetia since 1991. This quadripartite body (with Georgia, South Ossetia, North Ossetia and Russia) is conducted by the OSCE. The OSCE continues the search for a settlement.

This convention was adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2003 and has been signed by 56 countries so far, including many developing countries. The convention requires countries that have signed it to implement comprehensive tobacco control programmes and strategies at the national, regional and local levels. These include promoting treatment programmes to help people stop smoking, education to prevent people from starting and measures to prohibit sales of tobacco products to minors. The convention recognises that tax and price measures are an important way of reducing tobacco consumption, particularly in young people, and requires signatories to consider public health objectives when implementing tax and price policies on tobacco products.</p>

We run a nationwide programme, which covers the whole of India, and we also have state-level programmes in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal. Our main partners are the Indian Government; focus state governments and non-governmental organisations. The principal objectives of DFID's work in India under the current strategy are to have partnerships with selected state governments, to support economic reform, services, empowerment of poor, especially minority groups, and better management of the natural and physical environment. We are currently revising our country strategy in India.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.0/2">In Pakistan we support priorities agreed following reengagement with the Government in 2000. The programme has three objectives: creating economic conditions for poverty reduction; improving health outcomes; and improving education outcomes. In Pakistan too we are preparing a new Country Assistance Plan to support the Government of Pakistan's own Poverty Reduction Strategy due for publication in October 2003. DFID works in Pakistan with a wide range of partners including Government departments and non-government organisations, and closely coordinates its activities with those of other multilateral and bilateral development agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.0/3">In Bangladesh we work in accordance with our Country Strategy published in 1998. Here too a new County Assistance Plan is about to be published which gives priority to advancing the position of women and girls. The new Country Plan supports the Government of Bangladesh's own national poverty strategy and focuses DFID activity around seven areas of importance: support to the private sector, land transport, maternal mortality, primary education, access to food and water and Governance. DFID works in Bangladesh Government departments and non-government organisations and closely coordinates its activities with those of other multi-lateral and development agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".1019W.3/1">Since September 2001, DFID has provided approximately &pound;120 million in emergency assistance to the six countries in Southern Africa (Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) that have been most affected by the humanitarian crisis over the past two years. Most of this assistance (approximately &pound;90 million) has been provided to Zimbabwe and Malawi, where needs have been greatest. In addition, we estimate that our contribution to commitments by the European Commission to date is around &pound;26 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.3/2">Since January this year, over &pound;35 million has been spent on supporting continuing humanitarian operations, particularly in Zimbabwe, but also covering Zambia, Malawi, Swaziland and Mozambique. We intend to programme a further &pound;40 million of emergency aid to Zimbabwe this year, building on our existing programme commitments, in response to the serious humanitarian needs there. We, along with the UN and other donors, will ensure that our humanitarian assistance continues to be distributed according to need and without political interference.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.3/3">Where immediate humanitarian needs have reduced, as we have seen this year in Zambia and Malawi, we have shifted our support to programmes that support recovery from the crisis, including through provision of seeds and fertilisers. In Malawi, some &pound;9.3 million has been committed for these activities&mdash;again with the objective of improving food security at the household level and ensuring that safety nets that cover an appropriate mix of cash, food and subsidised inputs, are available for the most vulnerable. We have also provided seeds and fertilisers in Mozambique and Swaziland and responded to UN calls for support to seed fairs in those countries.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.3/4">Emergency assistance is still needed this year in areas of southern Mozambique, and in Lesotho where the failure of the winter harvest has put more people at risk. We are working to identify where the greatest needs are in these countries and will provide emergency aid to help cover the greatest gaps.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.3/5">DFID is also supporting the work of the UN Regional Inter-Agency Co-ordination and Support team in Johannesburg, which works to co-ordinate and harmonise UN and NGO efforts across the region. We have provided &pound;2 million of support to this team so far, and are looking to continue this support until the end of the current phase of the UN Consolidated Appeal, which ends in June 2004.</p>

The incidence of poverty has halved from 58 per cent. in 1992 to 29 per cent. in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1020W.2/3">DFID's current assistance to Vietnam includes supporting the development of primary education, the building and maintenance of rural roads, public financial management reform, state owned enterprise reform, reducing HIV infection, and area based rural development in the Northern Mountains and Central Region. We will continue to work in these areas. We are also directly supporting the Government of Vietnam's reform programme under the CPRGS by providing budget support through the World Bank Poverty Reduction Support Credit. In addition we are supporting the development of the National Assembly, and a project to analyse how market institutions can achieve better development outcomes for the poor. Our assistance is mainly co-financed with other donors.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.2/1">The UK, with DTI and DEFRA as the lead departments, has taken a central role in determining the European Union's negotiating position on trade and environment issues. Despite the collapse of Cancun, we will continue to work towards achieving a successful outcome at the WTO and jointly ensuring the implementation of the WSSD Commitments.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.2/2">One of the WTO trade and environment negotiating mandates is to clarify the relationship between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). The EU's overall aim is to ensure that these two bodies of international law are mutually supportive. With a view to better informing the WTO debate, at Cancun, the EU proposed that agreement be reached to formalise the observer role of MEAs, UNEP and UNCTAD in the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment Special Sessions. The text under discussion when the Conference collapsed had taken on board the EU view by making clear that MEAs and UN agencies should be given observer status in the Committee on Trade and Environment Special Sessions.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.2/3">The EU has also been the main driver supporting further work on eco-labelling and increased market access for environmental goods. At Cancun, the EU proposed that agreement should be reached on a new WTO Committee on Trade and Environment work programme on labelling for environmental purposes. However, there was little support for this from other WTO members and at the time of the collapse of the talks, no progress had been made on this issue.</p>

	<p pid=".1022W.2/1">Each Part of the Building Regulations consists of a, usually small, number of functional requirements. Guidance on the application of the requirements is provided by a statutory 'Approved Document'. Each such document states that it is intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations, but recognises that there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements, and advises builders and developers that &quot;. . . there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.2/2">Every building in its site context is different and there must therefore be room for discretion and adaptation to local circumstances. Nor is it possible in a usable guidance document to illustrate an acceptable solution for the almost infinite variety of building situations. Absolute consistency of application of any part of the Building Regulations is thus neither achievable nor desirable, and reliance must be placed on the professionalism and competence of the building control community.</p>

In July 2002, the Government announced its acceptance in principle of the recommendations for reform of the 1980 Act contained in the Law Commission report &quot;Limitation of Actions&quot;, subject to further consideration of certain aspects. Legislation will be introduced when an opportunity arises.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.11/3">The Commission proposed a core limitation regime that would apply to the majority of claims for a remedy for a wrong or the enforcement of a right. In broad terms, a claim would have to be brought within a primary limitation period of three years from the date on which the claimant knows (or ought reasonably to know) the facts giving rise to the claim, the identity of the defendant, and that any injury, loss or damage was significant. No claim could be brought after the expiry of a 10-year &quot;longstop&quot; period, which normally would run from the date on which the cause of action arose. At present in a simple contract claim the limitation period is six years from the date the cause of action arose.</p>

	<p pid=".1024W.6/1">Tackling domestic violence, and supporting those who are victims of domestic violence, is taken very seriously across Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.6/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced at the end of last year a &pound;7 million capital investment programme through the Housing Corporation to extend and renovate the national network of women's refuges in England. Initial allocations for 2003&ndash;04 were agreed in conjunction with the Housing Corporation in March this year and it is hoped that further schemes will be supported in the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.6/3">The Supporting People programme, which begins on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April</phrase>, will put in place a new integrated policy and funding framework for housing-related support services, including those for people experiencing domestic violence. Current annual expenditure is &pound;34 million for a total of 5,000 places. Local authorities have now submitted their shadow Supporting People strategies. These are currently being analysed and will provide valuable data on the supply of refuge and support services for people experiencing domestic violence, so helping to inform and direct future action.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.6/4">Supporting People guides have also been issued on addressing the accommodation and support needs of households experiencing domestic violence; and two dedicated co-ordinators are working with providers and local authorities to ensure that the sector is prepared for the new programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.6/5">In July 2002, the main homelessness provisions of the Homelessness Act 2002 and the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 were brought into force. These required local housing authorities to take a more strategic approach to preventing and tackling homelessness, placed stronger duties on authorities to help homeless people, and extended the groups of homeless applicants who have a priority need for accommodation, including, among others, people vulnerable as a result of fleeing their home because of violence. The Homelessness Directorate has allocated &pound;70 million in 2003&ndash;04 to local authorities and other agencies to help them address homelessness. This will include some support for domestic violence schemes where local authorities have identified this as a priority.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.6/6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in partnership with Comic Relief, plans to support the introduction of a national freephone helpline, linked to a 'refuges online' database to assist victims of domestic violence which it is hoped will be operational before the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".1028W.3/1">In his Budget statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Government would be giving increased emphasis to the regional and local elements of public sector pay. As a first and immediate step, the terms of reference or remit letters of the Pay Review Bodies have been modified to require them to have regard to regional/local labour markets and their effects on recruitment and retention. The ability to recruit and retain staff in every location is crucial to high quality public services. Staff shortages, resulting from an inability to recruit and retain staff with the requisite skills in the right numbers in specific locations, are currently concentrated in certain areas, mainly but not exclusively in parts of London and the south-east. A stronger local and regional element to pay is one important tool to address these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1028W.3/2">The area cost adjustment already directs grant to areas with higher wages in recognition of the increased recruitment and retention cost experienced there. Any effect of regional public service pay will be reflected in the pay cost evidence that we use in calculating the area cost adjustment.</p>

	<p pid=".1030W.3/1">Elected regional assemblies will be strategic bodies with an efficient and focused membership of between 25 and 35 elected members. They will have a similar role to that of the Greater London Authority, which has a Mayor and 25 assembly Members.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.3/2">The Government expects that elected regional assemblies will have an executive of at least three members and a maximum of six, including the leader. The Government believes that this leaves a sufficient number of members to exercise the scrutiny function.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.3/3">Approximately two thirds of elected members will be constituency members, the other third will be regional members elected from a regional list. This form of proportional representation will ensure that the assembly is representative of the region. Fewer than 25 members would make it difficult to reflect the vote proportionately. Membership will be larger where population is greater up to a maximum of 35. Any larger size would risk compromising the strategic role of Elected Regional Assemblies and could cause confusion between this and the separate representative and service delivery role of local authorities. Elected regional assemblies will also be expected to involve regional stakeholders in their work, which will help ensure that different views are taken into account.</p>

	<p pid=".1034W.1/1">The Courts Bill, which is currently before Parliament, makes provisions that will allow the Government to replace the existing 42 magistrates courts committees and the Court Service with a single executive agency, responsible for the administration of all the courts below the House of Lords. No date has yet been set for the establishment of the new unified courts agency although it will not be before April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.1/2">The unified courts agency will be an entirely new organisation, twice the size of either of the two services that will be subsumed within it. The Secretary of State and I have given close consideration to the regional management structure for the agency and what the boundaries of those regions should be. In this context, we paid careful attention to the &quot;Modernising Government&quot; White Paper of March 1999. This sets out the Government's policy that, wherever possible, the boundaries of government departments and public bodies at regional level should coincide with those of the Government Offices for the Regions. This commitment was repeated in the White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice&quot; in May 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.1/3">Since May 2003 the Secretary of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" name="Yvette Cooper">the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, officials from the Department for Constitutional Affairs and I have held meetings with the senior judiciary, representatives of the General Council of the Bar, and judges and barristers from the Western Circuit to discuss the structure of the new agency and in particular how the area currently covered by the Western Circuit should fit within that. Written submissions from judges and barristers have also been received on the subject.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>, the Secretary of State and I announced our decision that, at local level, the unified courts agency would have 42 management units coterminous with local government boundaries. This is in line with other criminal justice agencies such as the Police Authorities, Crown Prosecution Service and the Probation Service. There will also be seven regions. The boundaries of these regions will be coterminous with those of the Government Offices for the Regions, with two exceptions. The Secretary of State and I have decided that the Cheshire management unit should be linked with the Wales region for the time being but that we want to review this in 2006&ndash;07 as part of a general post implementation review of the agency's working arrangements. We have asked for further work to be undertaken before deciding whether to align the Hampshire unit with the South East or South West regions. This work will cover what the impact of including Hampshire within the South East region would be on the administration of justice throughout the current Western Circuit and in particular whether there would be a need to change the way in which cases are handled in Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire. This will inform our decision, which we intend to take by <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>. I would be happy to discuss this matter with hon. Members representing constituencies in those counties.</p>

	<p pid=".1035W.5/3">We want to encourage contact between children and their non-resident parent where it is in the best interests of the child and safe for all family members. We encourage parents who are divorcing or separating to agree contact arrangements for their children. Most parents do agree such arrangements. Where the courts are asked to intervene, the Children Act 1989 makes the welfare of the child its paramount concern. The courts are required to consider any harm a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering when determining what, if any, contact order to make. The court is also obliged to make a finding of fact in any case involving allegations of violence. The court must determine whether or not the alleged violence has occurred and, if so, its impact on the child. This obligation is set out in best practice guidelines issued by the Children Act Sub-Committee to the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Board on Family Law in spring 2001. The impact of these guidelines is being evaluated.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.5/4">The court may attach supervisory conditions to an order for contact that may be for indirect rather than direct contact. We are providing &pound;2.5 million over the next three years from the Children's Fund to extend the provision of supervised contact.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.5/5">Section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 amended the Children Act 1989 to make it clear that when a court is considering whether a child has suffered or is likely to suffer harm, this harm includes harm a child may suffer as a result of witnessing the ill-treatment of another person. In addition the Safety Stakeholder Group has suggested revisions to the court forms used in applications for residence, contact, specific issues and prohibited steps to highlight allegations of domestic violence. This would enable domestic violence to be raised right at the beginning of proceedings and enable the judge more effectively to determine whether, and in what terms, any order should be made on the basis of all the available facts. The revised definition of harm and the changes to the court forms to highlight domestic violence will be implemented as soon as the necessary resources are identified.</p>

These figures are based on the total annual expenditure of the lodgings network and therefore not only include the costs of providing accommodation, travel and subsistence for High Court judiciary and their clerks, but also the accommodation overheads (i.e. rent, rates, capital charge) of the lodgings themselves.</p>

	<p pid=".1042W.5/2">An internal review of judges' lodgings reported to the, then, Lord Chancellor in July 2000. Progress on a number of the administrative and staffing improvements has been good and new arrangements for transporting the judges to and from lodgings have now been introduced. We have, in addition, discontinued the use of Mold Lodgings. These measures will save in excess of &pound;450,000 per annum in running costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1042W.5/3">It is still our policy intention to introduce further efficiencies, particularly on rationalisation of lodgings ownership. I will be in a position to make a statement later this year.</p>

In addition, through the work of over 200 CLS Partnerships, and supported by initiatives such as the Partnership Initiative Budget and the Legal Services Commission's Methods of Delivery Pilots, we are devising new ways of delivering frontline legal advice services to local communities. Regional Legal Service Committees and CLS Partnerships are responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of legal and advice services in their area and through an analysis of local legal needs, can ensure that resources are more effectively targeted to help the socially excluded and other vulnerable groups.</p>

However, as part of the process of abolishing the office of Lord Chancellor, the Government proposes that his responsibilities as the Privy Counsellor primarily concerned with the affairs of the Crown Dependencies should be transferred to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.</p>

	<p pid=".1045W.6/1">The Supreme Courts Act 1981 established the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Crown Court, collectively, as the Supreme Court of England and Wales. The Court of Appeal is divided into Criminal Division, which hears appeals from the Crown Court, and the Court Martial and Civil Division, which hears appeals mainly against decisions in the High Court and county court. The High Court has three divisions: Chancery Division, Queens Bench Division and Family Division, each of which exercises appellate jurisdiction and handles different types of civil work. The Crown Court is responsible for trials of indictable offences, appeals from magistrates courts and cases for sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".1045W.6/2">We have proposed the creation of a UK Supreme Court, which will be the highest court in the whole of the United Kingdom and will take on the present jurisdiction of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords as well as the devolution functions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This will not affect the function of the three courts that currently make up the Supreme Court of England and Wales.</p>

This initiative provides a platform for new and emerging talent to explore innovative ways of telling stories and is not designed to provide a financial return on the investment.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.9/4">The UK Film Council investment in a film is likely to take place well before the film receives a theatrical (or other) release, resulting in a considerable time-lag between the investment and any recoupment. Individual films are expected to generate income over many years through different &quot;windows&quot; of exploitation around the world (for example, DVD, Pay-TV, Free TV). The recoupment received to date is therefore only a small part of the return on the investment expected by the UK Film Council.</p>

	<p pid=".1047W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not made any recent assessment of lottery funding specifically for projects in seaside towns. However, since the introduction of the National Lottery Act 1998, and changes to policy directions, distributors have increasingly focussed on areas of social and economic deprivation, including seaside resorts. The Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of the country should have access to lottery funds. Many areas, suffering wider social and economic deprivation, need extra support to develop and put in applications of a quality that will succeed. The National Lottery Funding Decision Document, published in July, contained proposals to make it easier for communities to access lottery grants.</p>

We issued joint guidance with LSC to encourage local planning for workforce development.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/4">A national child care recruitment campaign has been running since 2000 to encourage people to consider a career in child care. It includes television and media advertising, a variety of customised information and materials, a national orderline and a website with order facility. Local authorities promote careers in child care using a range of materials and events, working with local partners such as Jobcentre Plus, Careers Services, providers and sector organisations to provide practical help to potential recruits.</p>

	<p pid=".1051W.2/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question asking what measures are taken by Jobcentre Plus, as the public Employment Service, to ensure that businesses advertising vacancies with us are genuine. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.2/4" class="indent">Our aim is to maintain a reasonable level of assurance about our vacancies without setting up a costly and cumbersome checking process that may deter genuine employers from giving us their vacancies. We have systems in place to establish the genuine nature of both the employers and their jobs. For example, the employer is required to provide us with a valid UK address, postcode and landline telephone number. If there is any cause for doubt a visit may be arranged to the employer by staff from the local Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.2/5" class="indent">We maintain regular contact with all employers using our services. If we believe that an employer has deliberately misled us and we are unable to obtain assurances to the contrary, the employer's vacancies are removed from display.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.2/6" class="indent">By and large these arrangements work well and we rarely receive complaints from customers as to the genuineness of employers. However, when we do receive such a complaint, we investigate the complaints thoroughly and promptly and, if appropriate, remove the company's vacancies from display. Should such an 'employer' attempt to advertise further vacancies, these are not advertised until the previous problems have been resolved satisfactorily.</p>

Our payroll information does not distinguish between contracts that run their course or those which are terminated early.

	<p pid=".1052W.0/20"><sup>(11)</sup> It is not the usual practice to extend contracts beyond 51 weeks. One contract was extended while the individual was awaiting the imminent results of her application for a permanent appointment&mdash;for which she was unsuccessful so her contract was ended. Two contracts were extended to cover acute shortfalls of staff.</p>

	<p pid=".1052W.0/22">Information from FAMIS and REBUS Payroll Database</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/23">Jobcentre Plus employs temporary workers for a number of reasons, for example, to help manage peaks of work and to aid release of permanent staff for training and preparation for major business change.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/24">All Jobcentre Plus permanent staff are recruited through procedures and criteria which meet the Civil Service Commissioners' rigorous fair and open competition criteria. However, to support flexibility and responsiveness Jobcentre Plus generally does not recruit temporary staff through such procedures, as they are only being recruited to meet a short-term need. All temporary staff are recruited through a procedure that includes an initial application form, a sift, an interview, and the completion of pre-appointment checks. The Department recommends that at least three applicants are interviewed for each post. Equality of opportunity is central to all the Department's personnel and recruitment policies.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/25">Jobcentre Plus informs temporary staff of the length of time they are likely to work for us by specifying the duration of their temporary contracts. This situation is then kept under review in relation to any changing business needs. Temporary contracts can be extended, up to a maximum of 51 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/26">Managers at all levels of the business discuss with their trade union representatives Jobcentre Plus overall staffing requirements on an ongoing basis. In particular, these discussions cover the need for recruitment or promotion exercises, redeployment of staff, or the need to manage staff reductions. Discussions take into account the established policies within the Department for Work and Pensions for dealing with these issues&mdash;policies which have been subject to consultation with the trade unions at Departmental level.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/27">In the case of managing staff reductions Jobcentre Plus has agreed principles for redundancy avoidance and handling with the trade unions which set out a number of measures to avoid redundancies of permanent staff. These measures make specific reference to reducing or eliminating the use of casual/temporary staff and contract employees.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/28">Between April 2002 and February 2003, Jobcentre Plus London region reduced its permanent staffing through a combination of staff moving to The Pension Service, other parts of the Department for Work and Pensions, other Government Departments and through natural wastage. In reaching the reduction in staffing figures, no permanent members of staff were dismissed or made redundant.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/29">A number of meetings, at both Regional and District level, have taken place with trade union representatives since last summer about the deployment of staff across London region. These meetings have also been supplemented by correspondence. Headcount target figures were shared with trade union regional colleagues in September 2002, and a discussion on measures required to manage towards those workforce numbers took place at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-25">25 September 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.0/30">Subsequently, specific plans for releasing temporary workers were discussed with union representatives in January 2003. Detailed letters followed this meeting together with a further meeting, which took place in February 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1054W.3/2">In very exceptional circumstances the effect of applying the normal formula will be that some pensioners will receive a reward of &pound;1.20 instead of 60 pence for each extra pound of qualifying income. This may happen if the Pension Credit recipient is also receiving a working tax credit, spousal maintenance, or a social security benefit which does not count as rewardable income. It will only occur if their total income brought to account is greater than their appropriate guarantee level but the income which counts for the savings credit is less than the guarantee level. If this happens the pensioner will be able to ask the Pension Service for an explanation.</p>

We will be publishing a first progress report on the implementation of this Strategy very shortly. Emissions of key air pollutants from motor vehicles are set to fall by about 30 per cent. over the next decade as progressively tighter European regulations come into effect for new vehicles, and as older, more polluting vehicles drop out of circulation. The Government is also playing a constructive role in discussions in Europe on future vehicle emission standards for the period from 2010 onwards.</p>

	<p pid=".1057W.0/1">There are no international airworthiness standards in respect of tethered balloons for passenger transport.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/2">In the UK, the Air Navigation Order 2000 exempts such aircraft, described as captive balloons, from the requirement to be registered and thus from any airworthiness certification requirement. Tethered balloons carrying passengers are treated as fairground rides and their safety standards have been regulated by the Health and Safety Executive, rather than the Civil Aviation Authority. The Department for Transport accordingly has had no duties relating to the airworthiness of tethered balloons.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/3">Some other European countries have required tethered balloons to be registered and established national airworthiness certification requirements. Such requirements have been the responsibility of the states concerned and the Government has had no reason to research their safety regimes. UK produced tethered balloons sold into these countries have been required to meet national requirements which has caused some practical difficulties due to those states' unfamiliarity with UK Health and Safety Executive regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/4">EC Regulation 1592/2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency came into force in September 2002. Its primary objective is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation in Europe and an additional objective is to facilitate the free movement of goods, persons and services. The regulation lays down safety essential airworthiness requirements for aircraft and aviation products within its scope, which includes tethered balloons, and empowers the agency to establish the type certification basis for each aircraft, to issue the appropriate type certificates and to conduct, either itself or through national aviation authorities, the technical inspections associated with such certification. This system will facilitate the marketing of aircraft, such as captive balloons, throughout the Community.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/5">The agency is required to take up its certification responsibilities by <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-28">28 September</phrase>. Commission Regulations detailing how these responsibilities will be implemented are being drawn up to a very tight timetable and should be finalised very shortly. The UK has been fully involved in the process of drawing up these implementing regulations. The regulations will include transitional provisions to ensure that all aircraft types currently used in member states can continue to be used after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-28">28 September</phrase>, including UK built tethered balloons.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/6">There are also provisions to give grandfather rights to a large range of aircraft and products certified under previous regimes. Under specified conditions, the type certification basis for certain products will be deemed to be an EASA certification basis: this will apply to a number of types of tethered balloons certified in other member states. Such provisions cannot apply to UK designed balloons because there has been no UK type certification basis for them. The agency has to establish an EASA certification basis for these aircraft and work is in hand to draft the appropriate certification specification (Certification Specification 31 Tethered Gas Balloons, known as CS 31 TGB). The agency is using a team of national expert put together by the Joint Aviation Authorities to develop this specification, industry will be consulted and it is expected to be adopted early in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/7">EASA arrangements for outsourcing tasks to national aviation authorities will allow the CAA to carry out a range of certification activities on behalf of the agency after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-28">28 September</phrase> and we understand that the CAA could quickly begin the necessary certification work for UK tethered balloons on the basis of the current draft of the certification specification. The authority has been in touch with the manufacturer of tethered balloons in the UK about the EASA developments and will endeavour to ensure as smooth a transition to the new system as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1058W.2/2">The Department's catering services are all contracted out, with the contractor recovering costs through the sale of services. Expenditure on food in DfT is, therefore, limited to official hospitality provided by the Department and its Agencies, and canteen subsidies. Records of spend on food provided at some external conferences and similar events are not kept centrally and are not included.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.2/3">The Department does not generally prescribe the sourcing of goods and produce supplied to the Department or sold in staff restaurants, nor are contractors currently required to provide this information. The percentage and value of foodstuffs sourced from the UK under existing departmental catering contracts is not, therefore, readily available.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.2/4">DEFRA has published a &quot;Guidance and action Sheet for buyers and their internal customers&quot; that includes guidance on local sourcing and in particular how to remove obstacles to tendering faced by local and UK suppliers. I am taking steps to ensure that the guidance is implemented by departmental purchasers involved in the procurement of facility management/catering services.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.2/5">We are also working closely with DEFRA, and our agencies, to integrate and promote the principles of sustainable development into the public procurement of food and catering services.</p>

	<p pid=".1061W.2/2">Following the opening of the Toll Road, the Highways Agency in conjunction with the Concessionaire will carry out a review of flows along the adjacent network together with flows on the toll road.</p>
	<p pid=".1061W.2/3">Under all charging scenarios, the net relief to the M6 was forecast to be quite small. Long distance through traffic which transfers onto the M6 Toll, which represents about one third of M6 traffic, will release capacity on the M6 which will be taken up by local traffic, thus providing significant relief to many local roads.</p>

Funding for local road maintenance has been doubled, with the aim of eliminating the long-term maintenance backlog by 2010. Network Rail is now focussing on reducing the maintenance backlog on rail, and plans toreplace 740 miles of track this year (compared to 300 miles achieved by Railtrack and in the run-up to privatisation). And substantial new investment is now going in through the PPP to tackle the long-term maintenance backlog on the London Underground.</p>

Although some of the principles of the Leipzig declaration&mdash;for example, its emphasis on a strengthened Community regional and cohesion policy and an enhanced role for regional and local government&mdash;are reflected in the Government's approach, our overall position is somewhat different. In particular, we believe that richer EU member states should fund their own regional policy within an EU-wide agreed framework and we do not regard the current budget maximum, 0.45 per cent. of EU GDP, as a reference point for future Structural and Cohesion funding.</p>

	<p pid=".1067W.15/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.15/2">Since 1997 the UK has implemented mandatory UN arms embargoes on Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Ethiopia/Eritrea and Liberia, an EU embargo on Indonesia and a unilateral embargo on Zimbabwe. The latter was superseded by an EU arms embargo in February 2002. The UN arms embargo on Sierra Leone from 1998 was in response to internal armed conflict between the rebel militia group, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and the government. In 1999 an arms embargo was imposed on Afghanistan because of internal conflict. In 2000, a UN arms embargo was placed on Ethiopia/Eritrea due to armed conflict between the two states. It was terminated in 2001. The UN arms embargo on Liberia from 2001 was imposed (superseding the UN arms embargo UNSCR 788 (1992)) because Charles Taylor's government was supporting the RUF in Sierra Leone, and at war internally with a rebel opposition group, the Liberian United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). The UN Security Council deemed that all of these conflicts represented a threat to international peace and security and therefore the Security Council acted under Chapter 7 of the Charter of the United Nations. An EU arms embargo was imposed on Indonesia in September 1999 because of conflict in East Timor; this was limited to four months and it fell away in January 2000. In February 2001, the UK imposed a unilateral arms embargo on Zimbabwe because of human rights violations involving repression by the government of the Zimbabwean public. In February 2002, the EU imposed an arms embargo against Zimbabwe for the same reason, which the UK now implements instead.</p>

Their basic pensions are secure even in times when, as is now the case for the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, investment performance has produced a deficit. Under the terms of the Guarantee, that deficit will be met by a transfer of several hundred million pounds from the Investment Reserve, which represents Government's share of pre-privatisation surpluses in the Scheme, to the Guaranteed fund to pay members' guaranteed benefits. And despite the deficit, Government have agreed to a Trustee proposal allowing members of the MPS to continue to receive inflation linked increases to their total pension (i.e. basic pension plus bonus) over the next three years.</p>

Some other changes to the Guarantee arrangements were agreed, as were further discussions to consider possible different methods of paying for the Guarantee and also other ways of guaranteeing the bonuses that have already been awarded to members, while not representing a significant additional burden on the taxpayer</p>

	<p pid=".1071W.8/2">The chemical sector is very important to the north-west and DTI has worked very closely with the private sector lead North West Chemical Initiative to develop a strategy and action plan for the sector. The North West Chemical Initiative was established with the financial support of both the North West Development Agency and DTI.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has recently announced that &pound;50 million worth of regional selective assistance has been awarded to chlorine manufacturer Ineos Chlor (subject to EU Commission approval) to help modernise its Runcorn facility on Merseyside. Over 2000 direct jobs at the plant will be safeguarded by the aid, part of a &pound;389 million investment programme by the company, safeguarding around a further 8,000 jobs in associated businesses which are dependent upon the Runcorn site.</p>
	<p pid=".1071W.8/4">The UK Government fully supports the objectives of the new European chemicals strategy. However, it considers that the draft legislative text published by the Commission before the summer would not create a workable, efficient system that will provide the right level of protection of human health and the environment while avoiding unnecessary burdens to industry. Indeed, the UK Government consider that as currently drafted the legislation would be both too costly and damaging for the chemicals industry (particularly small businesses) and not effective enough in terms of protecting human health and the environment. We are working with other member states and the Commission to ensure that there are substantial changes to the legislation before it is finally agreed.</p>

	<p pid=".1079W.2/1">Government support for new businesses comes in a variety of forms. The Business Link Operators (BLOs) put together programmes for start-up businesses, working with Enterprise Agencies and other partners, which are funded from a variety of sources, including: SBS core funding, residual SRB monies, RDA &quot;single programme&quot; funds, and European funds. In total, in the North East, the BLOs are spending around &pound;3.6 million on start-up programmes (such as BL Tees Valley's &quot;Start Right in Business&quot; programme), and are contributing around &pound;1.7 million to supporting incubation projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1079W.2/2">Support programmes vary in content between sub-regions, but essentially offer a programme of advice and assistance in key areas where new businesses require help, eg producing business plans to help access finance; developing marketing programmes, managing finance and cash flow, etc. They may be able to offer subsidies directly, or secure funding through other partners.</p>
	<p pid=".1079W.2/3">Help for start-up businesses does not end with the start-up programmes. LSC-funded workforce development, DTI-funded TPUK activities, and DTI's new products such as the R&amp;D) grant are part of the wider range of services available via BLOs which may be appropriate for young businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1079W.2/4">Access to Finance initiatives, such as the SBS-funded Regional Venture Capital fund (Capital North East) and Investor Readiness programmes (operated by Northern Enterprise and Entrust respectively), and the BL Tyne and Wear-operated regional Micro Loan fund can also benefit businesses in the early stage of operation, and lead to a more mature approach to business finance being inculcated into new businesses in a region where a grant culture has persisted. This is essential for the future growth prospects of businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1079W.2/5">Start-up programmes in the North East are becoming better co-ordinated, with closer working between BLOs, Enterprise Agencies and other partners. Examples include the new start-up consortium in Tyne and Wear, closer working relationships in County Durham, and the &quot;Start Right In Business&quot; programme in Tees Valley. The on-going RDA-led review of business support process will develop these co-operative approaches further.</p>
	<p pid=".1079W.2/6">An RDA-led initiative &quot;Strategy for Success&quot; should lead, through the creation of centres of excellence and an DPR exploitation company, to the spin out of more businesses through the HEI sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1079W.2/7">At national level, SBS is co-ordinating the development of a cross-Government national strategy for start up businesses. This will draw on the experience and research from partners around the country to create a consistent, evidence-based start-up proposition, to which local variations may be added. It will also develop a co-ordinated between DWP, DFES and other Government Departments which will result in easier access and interface with entrepreneurs. An early result of such co-operation is the &quot;No-nonsense Guide&quot; to Government rules and regulations for setting up your business.

	<p pid=".1080W.2/8">The RDA, ONE North East, has embarked on an ambitious programme to encourage more start up businesses by encouraging would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start their businesses with the help of support programmes and agencies in the region, and in which the BLOs provide a key delivery role. This is using the flexibility of single programme funding to prioritise the entrepreneurship agenda in the NE to raise the relative start-up rate and encourage entrepreneurs to stay in the North East. Initiatives include:</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.2/9" class="indent">A major event last April, organised by BL Tyne and Wear and funded by the RDA and SBS, in which the regions' BLOs and Enterprise Agencies ran Start up shows in Tyne and Wear and Teesside and which would-be entrepreneurs could speak directly with advisers, other entrepreneurs, etc.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.2/10" class="indent">This was followed by several local outreach events earlier this year supported by a regional enterprise PR campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.2/11" class="indent">The &quot;Enterprise Island&quot; programme in which progress of 10 would-be entrepreneurs was charted in a film.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.2/12" class="indent">Initiatives are also being developed to boost graduate enterprise (building on programmes the universities have developed through HEFCE funding), and to further promote enterprise in schools building on &quot;Enterprise Insight&quot;, Young Enterprise, and other programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.2/13">At national level, SBS is co-ordinating the development of a cross-Government strategy to encourage an enterprise culture. Emerging ideas for this will be closer co-operation with Job Centres and the benefits system (including ideas pioneered by Inbiz, a Teesside company), and with careers services to encourage self-employment and business start up as a career choice. The strategy is also expected to develop ideas for reducing risk to individuals contemplating business start-up.</p>

	<p pid=".1081W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.3/2">Union Learning Representatives are a key component of the Government's new Skills Strategy. In developing the strategy we consulted widely and met with trade union representatives on a number of occasions to discuss the vital role that unions and their learning representatives have to play. The TUC is, of course, a key member of the Skills Alliance which will bring together Government, employers and trade unions to oversee the future development and delivery of the Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.3/3">Union Learning Representatives have already proved to be highly effective in helping to encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly workers with low skills and those with literacy and numeracy problems&mdash;the very people who so often miss out on learning opportunities. That is why we introduced legislation to give them statutory backing and rights to time off with pay which came into effect at the end of April 2003. This will help to reinforce the invaluable role that Union Learning Representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote workforce development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.3/4">There are currently around 6,500 Union Learning Representatives. The new statutory rights will help their numbers to grow and we look forward to seeing a national network of over 22,000 trained Union Learning Representatives in place by 2010, helping over 250,000 workers a year into learning.</p>

	<p pid=".1093W.2/15">The estimates represent the reduction in tax liabilities from investment in ISAs. They do not indicate the yield from abolishing ISAs since in practice this could result in significant and uncertain changes in taxpayers' behaviour because of the range of alternative investment options. Therefore, no estimate is available of this yield.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/16">There is no available estimate of the effect of ISAs on total savings. Overall, ISAs have attracted a wide range of individuals of different ages and income, whose savings experience will vary widely. They have attracted more younger and lower income savers than TESSAs and PEPs.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.2/17">The relief in any particular year is derived from subscriptions built up over a number of years, including the current year. In 2000&ndash;01, the latest year for which estimates are available, contributions in excess of half of the current limits represented around 40 per cent. of the total. Assuming a similar distribution of contributions in every year since the introduction of ISAs would imply that the costs of relief given in the table would have been 40 per cent. lower each year.</p>

	<p pid=".1095W.6/1">Since my announcement in April 2003 regarding employer's national insurance contributions for mariners engaged through offshore manning companies, I have received letters from shipping industry representatives and employers affected.

In the light of the evidence they presented concerning the likely effect of the proposals on the competitiveness of UK shipping in territorial waters, I have decided to restrict the changes I announced to mariners who are employed in inshore waters classified as A, B, C or D under the Merchant Shipping (Categorisation of Waters) Regulations 1992.

	<p pid=".1096W.11/5" class="indent">Results for 2001&ndash;02 and earlier years are also published in 'Economic Trends', which can be obtained from the House of Commons Library. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS), formerly the Family Expenditure Survey (FES). For the data that you have requested, sample sizes are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by quintiles of income distribution and not by decile.</p>
	<p pid=".1096W.11/6" class="indent">Tables 1 to 6 show for each year between 1996&ndash;97 and 2001&ndash;02 the requested direct and indirect taxes paid as a proportion of gross income for all households in the UK, and for each income quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and discounts. The tables also show the equivalised disposable income quintile point boundaries, which have been calculated separately for each year. For example, the 1st quintile point is the income below which one fifth of all households are estimated to lie. The quintile point boundaries differ between each year as shown in the tables.</p>

UK personnel trained the first battalion of the ANA in April 2002 and have been providing NCO training since March 2003. The ANA decree signed by President Karzai in December 2002 refers to training up to 70,000 personnel but does not specify a completion date. We do not have access to exact figures for personnel who have completed the US training program, or for the retention rate. But the ANA currently consists of eight battalions and as of late June around 4,500 soldiers had undergone basic training.</p>

It would be inappropriate for us to second-guess the outcome of this review and any possible effect it might have on the ISAF mandate or the number of troops required for any additional tasks.

	<p pid=".1114W.9/3">The precise powers taken in legislation will depend upon the scope of the sanctions regime against that particular state. However, legislation will generally create a criminal offence of providing assistance and training to prohibited territories or individuals without a licence from an appropriate authority, and this will apply to all individuals within the territory to which the legislation applies, and also to all categories of British citizen wherever they may be. Legislation will also generally provide ancillary powers to enforce the prohibition, for example, powers for the obtaining of evidence and information, and provisions for criminal proceedings and penalties. Penalties on summary conviction will generally be imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding &pound;5,000 or both, and on conviction on indictment, imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or an unlimited fine or both.</p>

	<p pid=".1117W.5/1">The Bonn-Berlin process (a German initiative involving the UN Secretariat and supported by the UK) on the design and implementation of arms embargoes and travel and aviation related sanctions in 2001, considered the question of whether the UN Security Council should adopt lists of military goods to which UN arms embargoes would apply. The participants concluded that it was important to agree a list of goods prior to the introduction of a UN resolution with the assistance of the UN Secretariat. If there were divergent views on the list, arbitration should be provided by the UN Secretary-General.</p>
	<p pid=".1117W.5/2">However, due to lack of consensus among Security Council members, these proposals were never adopted. UK sanctions policy focuses upon and encourages the use of sanctions that are appropriately targeted and effectively implemented and enforced. The UK therefore continues to support the adoption of lists of military equipment to which UN arms embargoes would apply.</p>

	<p pid=".1118W.2/1">The UK and France drafted a joint proposal in 2001 for an independent sanctions monitoring mechanism to improve the Security Council's capacity to monitor targeted sanctions regimes it has established. After considerable discussion among Council members, the proposal stalled as some members were opposed to it. The Government are currently considering whether we should re-initiate discussions on this proposal again in the near future.</p>

For 2003, this will include a performance indicator on child protection review conferences. It will also use the audit of child protection services. Where inspectors judge that the audit has revealed that a council's child protection services are only at best, serving some people well, then the overall assessment of children's services will not be higher than &quot;serving some people well&quot;, with a consequent effect on the maximum star rating that a council can achieve.</p>

	<p pid=".1126W.2/1">CAFCASS's target is that at least 95 per cent. of requests in a month should be allocated 10 weeks before a report is filed at court. A benchmark of 10 weeks is used because this is the timescale required for an officer to complete relevant inquiries and meet the deadline for filing the report with the court. It also enables the service to be flexible when dealing with urgent cases that arise with shorter filing dates.</p>
	<p pid=".1126W.2/2">In July 2003, CAFCASS dealt with 3,200 private law cases. Of these, 385 cases were unallocated less than 10 weeks before a report was filed at court. This is 4.7 per cent. of the caseload and achieved the target. 1,236 private law cases were unallocated more than 10 weeks before a report was filed at court.</p>

	<p pid=".1126W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-19">19 May</phrase>, my hon. Friend the then Health Minister, Jacqui Smith launched a booklet for practitioners who have concerns about the welfare of children. &quot;What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is Being Abused&quot; was published jointly by six Government Departments and is aimed at all practitioners who come into contact with children, parents and/or families in the course of their work.</p>
	<p pid=".1126W.5/2">The booklet contains a short section on sharing information. This steers practitioners through the process of deciding whether to share information, and if so, what to share and with whom. It explains in a clear and concise way the issues involved in making decisions about sharing information. Copies of the booklet are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1126W.5/3">The Green Paper Every Child Matters and Keeping Children Safe&mdash;the Government's response to the Victoria Climbie Inquiry Report and the Joint Chief Inspectors' Report Safeguarding Children were published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-08">8 September</phrase>, and copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1126W.5/4">The Green Paper sets out proposals for new information sharing systems to enable concerns to be registered at an early stage and flagged up to relevant staff working with children. The Green Paper also explains how front-line workers will become more closely integrated through arrangements such as Children's Trusts.</p>
	<p pid=".1126W.5/5">To take forward such information sharing systems, the Government provided &pound;1 million to 10 'Identification, Referral and Tracking' (IRT) trailblazers involving 15 local authorities to test out approaches. We are putting in place a central team to learn lessons and develop a national framework for local information sharing systems. We will have early lessons from the trailblazers by December 2003, and more detailed information by late summer 2004. By the end of 2004, we aim to set out how the lessons from the trailblazers can be reflected across the country. As part of this, the Government will examine the potential benefits and risks of introducing ICT-based information sharing systems at local authority level.</p>

	<p pid=".1127W.8/2">The EU Open Method of Co-Ordination on Youth Policy relates exclusively to devolved policy issues&mdash;youth participation, local information services for young people, youth volunteering and youth research.

In the case of devolved policies (for example, health and social services, education, participation policy), the Devolved Administrations are responsible for observing the convention when making devolved policy decisions. In the case of reserved policies, the relevant Whitehall Department is responsible for observing the convention when making reserved policy decisions, and for consulting the Devolved Administrations as necessary. Examples of reserved policies covered by the convention are: asylum and immigration (Home Office), international development (DfID) and defence policies (MOD). The CYPU is responsible for co-ordinating the UK's approach as a whole across all policy leads (including the Devolved Administrations on devolved matters) and for reporting to the UN on UK implementation.</p>

	<p pid=".1130W.2/1">Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) teaches pupils about social and moral differences, including aggressive behaviour. Specifically in primary schools, pupils are taught how to get help, to realise the consequences of anti-social and aggressive behaviour, and to resolve differences by looking at alternatives. There are opportunities for schools to address violence, including domestic violence, through the framework of PSHE and Citizenship. In Citizenship, for example, pupils can discuss the impact of domestic violence and challenge the belief that domestic violence is inevitable and acceptable.</p>

Instead, it has taken a number of steps to extend autonomy across the school system more generally. In relation to teachers' pay and conditions, specific new freedoms have been introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September</phrase> this year which mean that schools have a greater degree of flexibility in relation to certain pay decisions. Changes to the curriculum at Key Stage 4 set out in the strategy document 14&ndash;19: Opportunity and Excellence will enable schools to respond more flexibly to the needs of their pupils. We have established the Implementation Review Unit&mdash;a Panel of serving head teachers and other school staff to identify areas where schools can be freed from bureaucracy and red tape. The Power to Innovate offers all schools the chance to apply for innovative projects that would otherwise be blocked by education legislation. The Government is keeping under review whether to introduce an Earned Autonomy scheme as provided for in the 2002 Act.</p>

	<p pid=".1132W.3/1">The Department is working closely with ODPM on actions required to implement the European Directive on energy performance. ODPM believe that many of the requirements of the directive can be implemented through changes to the Building Regulations and to Approved Document Part L2 (the next revision being due in 2005). As schools are required to comply with building regulations, any changes in energy performance requirements will apply to schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1132W.3/2">The Department already encourages energy efficiency and management in schools through a number of measures. The Departments guidance on design of new school buildings promotes a carbon performance rating of 5kg C/m <sup>2</sup> per year or better, which is in line with current building regulations requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".1132W.3/3">Further Education colleges will be responsible for compliance with the Directive in relation to their own premises and the Learning and Skills Council is updating its guidance to colleges on estate management to reflect the directive's requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".1135W.3/2">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) funded research, commissioned to the Child Poverty Action Group, into the reasons children fail to take up their free school meal entitlement. The findings were published in a research report (RR270) entitled 'Improving the Take-Up of Free School Meals' in May 2001. The study identified a number of good practice strategies that could be adopted to encourage more parents and pupils to take up their entitlement. It also suggested that every effort should be made to ensure that pupils receiving free school meals are not easily identifiable. For example, this could be achieved if schools that operate a cafeteria system introduce cashless systems such as swipe cards.</p>
	<p pid=".1135W.3/3">The report is published on the DfES Research and Statistics Gateway website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/">www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/</a> Alternatively, copies of the report can be obtained from DfES Publications by telephoning: 0845 6022260 quoting reference RR270.</p>
	<p pid=".1135W.3/4">The Department of Education and Skills has no plans at present to provide incentives for schools to increase the take-up of free school meals.</p>

The campaign promoted the benefits of the internet to key groups such as the unemployed, lone parents, those with disabilities and the elderly. People were encouraged to visit UK online centres throughout the country that offered free internet starter sessions. Evaluation of the campaign, particularly its impact on economically disadvantaged groups, will be completed shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".1140W.5/1">The Department does not offer incentives to students to study any particular A-level subjects. Students should choose those subjects which are the most appropriate for their individual skills and aspirations. The independent Post-14 Maths Inquiry is due to publish its final report by the end of October and has received evidence from a wide range of interested organisations, including Filtronic. The inquiry is expected to make recommendations on the curriculum, qualifications and pedagogy for those aged 14 and over in schools, colleges and higher education institutions to enable students to acquire the mathematical knowledge and skills necessary to meet the wide-ranging needs of employers and of further and higher education. In view of this, consideration of local initiatives and schemes such as Filtronic's should rightly take place once we have had the opportunity to consider the inquiry's final report.</p>

We are bearing down on parentally condoned truancy through national implementation of the Fast Track to Prosecution initiative.

	<p pid=".1144W.2/2">The Department for Education and Skills is working in partnership with LEA and school representatives to identify changes that need to be made to the funding system for 2004&ndash;05 so that all schools can expect to receive a reasonable per pupil settlement in that year. We have been discussing how best to ensure sufficient funding increases for every LEA; the right balance between support through general grant and through ring-fenced and targeted grant; how to give confidence that schools and pupils will receive the money intended for them; the right balance between school and LEA central provision; how to ensure that that variations in the budget increases received by different schools within each LEA are appropriate and fair; and how work force reform, in line with the National Agreement, can be sustained. We will aim to ensure that changes are in place in good time to allow LEAs and schools to plan for 2004&ndash;05 and so provide increased predictability and stability in school funding.</p>

In 2003&ndash;04 assumed total funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council has increased by 6 per cent. in real terms compared with 2002&ndash;03. The funding allocated to the Learning and Skills Council also assumes there will be year on year real terms increases in total funding for further education of 7 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05 and 5 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06. Sixth form colleges are independent organisations. It is for them to determine the level of pay increases for their staff in negotiation with the trade unions within the resources available.</p>

	<p pid=".1145W.2/1">We do not have any specific estimates of the possible change to the pattern of student number enrolments as we do not know which universities will be charging the variable fees and which will be charging controlled fees. However initial analysis suggests that we can expect enrolment to continue to rise over the course of the decade. We continue to monitor enrolment through a number of sources such as UCAS, HESA and HEFCE.</p>

	<p pid=".1145W.5/1">The opportunity costs incurred by students participating in higher education (HE) comprise the earnings they could have earned had they not been studying net of the income they receive through working during their studies. Both these income streams vary between individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".1145W.5/2">Individuals with two or more A-levels who have been in the labour market for up to three years have average net annual earnings of around &pound;8,300 <sup>1</sup> . Over a three year, full-time HE course this would be equivalent to around &pound;25,000 in foregone earnings.</p>
	<p pid=".1145W.5/3">However, many students also work while studying. Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) data indicate that full-time first-degree students typically earn around &pound;5,000 <sup>2</sup> over the duration of their course. This means that an overall opportunity cost for full-time first-degree students who enter with two or more A-levels is on average around &pound;20,000. However, this average figure will vary widely between individual students.</p>

	<p pid=".1147W.8/2">Testing of all pupils at the end of each key stage of education provides objective evidence, against a national standard, of what children have learned in the core subjects. Teacher assessment is an important part of the overall statutory assessment framework and covers the full range and scope of the programmes of study, taking into account evidence of achievement in a range of contexts, including that gained through discussion and observation.</p>
	<p pid=".1147W.8/3">The evidence from both types of assessment, together provides, valuable information to support the future learning of each pupil.</p>
	<p pid=".1147W.8/4">The results from teacher assessment and tests are broadly consistent, but they are derived from different sources of evidence of a pupil's attainment.</p>

	<p pid=".1149W.2/1">The Teenage Pregnancy Unit was established in 1999 with a cross Whitehall remit to manage implementation of the Strategy. The first independent evaluation report of the Strategy, published in 2002, commended the joint working between the Teenage Pregnancy Unit, Regional Teenage Pregnancy Co-ordinators based in Government Offices and Local Teenage Pregnancy Co-ordinators who lead the implementation of strategies in each top tier local authority. The second annual report of the national evaluation will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".1149W.2/2">The report acknowledged the success of these arrangements as a major factor in wielding influence at local level. The effectiveness of joint working was also recognised in the first annual report of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy, published in 2001. The importance of joint working was reinforced in the second annual report of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy, published in July 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1149W.2/3">There are very encouraging signs that the Government's overall teenage pregnancy strategy is working. Data for 2001 published in February by the Office for National Statistics shows that conceptions among under 18-year-olds in England fell by 3 per cent. and represents a total reduction of 10 per cent. since 1998. For under 16s, the rate is 4 per cent. lower than in 2000 and represents a 10 per cent. reduction since 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".1150W.8/2">The Department allocated &pound;199 million of Capital Modernisation Funding (CMF) to fund around 2,800 UK online centres specifically to provide ICT access to the disadvantaged. One main target group centres were set up to reach people with disabilities. Centres are expected to demonstrate that they comply with current requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act and other legal requirements around Equal Opportunities. This element is scrutinised as part of the contract monitoring process.</p>
	<p pid=".1150W.8/3">One way that my Department is looking to improve accessibility for the disabled and visually impaired in UK online centres is a package of 811 Assistive Technology kits. These kits have been made available to help some centres meet the immediate, basic, access requirements of a wide range of disabled people. For example, for visually-impaired users the package includes a large keyboard with big keys as well as magnification and screen reading software.</p>
	<p pid=".1150W.8/4">The Department also has contracts in place with key organisations such as AbilityNet, Direct Support and Becta to ensure that there is adequate support and guidance for UK online centres and centre staff on a wide range of issues including people disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".1150W.8/5">I am afraid I am unable to advise you on Online Centres in Wales as the DfES are only responsible for centres in England. May I suggest you speak to National Assembly for Wales, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff CF99 1NA, Tel: 029 20 825111.</p>

No other surveys have been conducted by any of the Services specifically targeting Commonwealth or Fijian families.

	<p pid=".1156W.5/1">There are currently no plans to provide discounted air fares or discounted telephone calls for personnel from Commonwealth countries, whose Terms and Conditions of Service (TACOS) are the same as for all other personnel. However, under the &quot;Leave to Countries Abroad&quot; (DOMCOL) scheme, a Service individual normally domiciled abroad may accumulate part of their Annual Leave Allowance each year over a period not exceeding five years for the purpose of visiting the country of their domicile. Under the scheme, which is subject to specific qualifying conditions, personnel are entitled to travel at public expense once in five years after five years service to the country of normal domicile. Requirements for the DOMCOL scheme include that the individual be single, but married personnel whose family are resident abroad and have been separated from their family for the whole of the five-year qualifying period may also register under the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1156W.5/2">The Ministry of Defence is aware that current TACOS vary between the Services and consequently do not offer all Commonwealth personnel the same opportunities for compassionate leave and travel arrangements as for those ordinarily domiciled in the United Kingdom, and is reviewing TACOS accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".1156W.5/3">For those personnel on deployed operations the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) provides 20 minutes of publicly funded telephone calls per week for all personnel, regardless of nationality or country of origin and allows them to maintain telephone contact with their families and friends overseas.</p>

	<p pid=".1158W.11/1">The Department's estate strategy was set out in 'In Trust and On Trust', published in 2000. The aim is to create a defence estate of the right size, shape and location through corporate management of the estate. The implementation of this strategy has informed our active engagement in the Independent Review on Public Sector Relocation&mdash;the Lyons Review&mdash;and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1158W.11/2">In recent years the Department has relocated a significant amount of defence activity from London. The reviews and evaluations that inform these decisions have generally been undertaken internally, rather than commissioned from external consultants. We evaluated the relocations of the Defence Procurement Agency, and the Meteorological Office as part of our submission to the Lyons Review, which generally welcomed the actions taken by the Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p pid=".1159W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence and the United States Army have been working together on a collaborative research programme into the Electro-Magnetic gun at Dundrennan range, in Kirkcudbright, since 1993. In December 2002, we jointly signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US to continue this long-standing project agreement until 2009.</p>
	<p pid=".1159W.5/2">Extensive tests have proven that the electro-magnetic radiation from the gun is negligible and that it has no effect on the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1159W.5/3">The safe operation of defence ranges is of paramount importance. Safety procedures at Dundrennan have been tried and tested over the last 10 years without incident. Risk assessments are conducted prior to each series of firings and strict operating procedures are followed. Safety procedures are constantly reviewed and updated in line with the progress of the trial, and all safety procedures are independently audited.</p>
	<p pid=".1159W.5/4">We have received a limited number of representations from the local community regarding the possible dangers associated with the Electro-Magnetic gun testing at Dundrennan. The correspondence received specifically focuses on the perceived use of depleted uranium, but also reflects some general concerns, which have been generated by articles in the press. The Electro-Magnetic gun's projectiles do not contain depleted uranium, nor do they contain any explosives.</p>
	<p pid=".1159W.5/5">The high velocity of the projectile round generates the penetrative effect, not the projectile's mass or density.</p>

Although fast jet low flying has not been employed in all of these conflicts, I can confirm that a number of fast jet sorties were flown at low level during the recent operation in Iraq.

Foreign aircrew are bound by the same restrictions as those that apply to UK aircrew, but additionally are not generally permitted to operate under more favourable conditions than those applied to our forces in the country concerned. All foreign aircrew receive a face to face brief from an appropriately qualified member of British forces before they can operate in the UK Low Flying System.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-01-15.698"><i>Official Report,</i> column 698</phrase>, we are satisfied that the upgrade of the radar at RAF Fylingdales for missile defence purposes will also be in the national interest. The Ministry of Defence is negotiating an annex to the recently signed Ballistic Missile Defence Memorandum of Understanding with the United States to cover the upgrade, and is discussing with the US the operational arrangements for its use in missile defence. These agreements will ensure that UK interests are protected.</p>

	<p pid=".1171W.17/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Trainee pilots in the Royal Air Force undertake a minimum of 62 hours Elementary Flying Training (EFT) during their first year, before being streamed for fast jet, rotary wing or multi-engine pilot training. Flying hours will then depend on which aircraft type their training has undertaken. For example, fast jet trainees normally undertake 130 hours Basic Fast Jet Training, 70 hours Advanced Flying Training and 52 hours Tactical Weapons Training following completion of EFT, over a further two-year period. All students undertake relevant ground school training prior to each flying phase.</p>

	<p pid=".1174W.8/1">Data from the Farm Business Survey have been used to assess the level of agricultural assistance going to farms of different sizes. The sample for the Farm Business Survey covers only those farm businesses that are over a minimum size threshold, representing around 70,000 out of a total of around 180,000 holdings in England. Within the sample there were 1,570 farm businesses in the survey in receipt of subsidy payments in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".1174W.8/2">Agricultural assistance has been defined as all crop and livestock subsidy payments and agri-environment scheme payments. Farm size is defined in European Size Units, an economic measure of farm size in terms of the value added to variable inputs. The analysis shows that around a third of these subsidy payments are received by the largest 10 per cent. of farms and around 2 per cent. is received by the smallest 10 per cent. of farms covered by the FBS in England. Estimates for the other UK countries are a matter for the Devolved Authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".1175W.2/1">The Government's policies on improving air quality are set out in detail in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000 and its Addendum published in February 2003. The Strategy sets standards for the pollutants of main concern and target dates for their achievement between 2003 and 2010. It also explains the measures that are in place to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants from all sectors. Copies are available via the Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1175W.2/2">We are on course or have already met the targets for five of the nine pollutants in England, namely benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide, lead and sulphur dioxide. Significant progress has been made towards meeting the air quality objectives for nitrogen dioxide, particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ozone. This is as a result of the measures that have been implemented to reduce emissions of these pollutants, and their precursors, particularly from road transport and industry.</p>

There has been a long term decline in the number of air pollution days, largely because of a reduction in particles and sulphur dioxide, but fluctuations from one year to the next can occur because of differences in weather conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".1175W.5/3">In rural areas, the figure for 2002 was 30 days on average per site, compared with 34 in 2001. The number of days has fluctuated between 21 days in 1987 and 50 days in 1990. The series can be volatile from one year to the next, and there is no clear trend. This reflects the variability in levels of ozone, the main cause of pollution in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1178W.2/1">The Government recognise the valuable role that community composting groups can play in delivering more sustainable waste management.</p>
	<p pid=".1178W.2/2">We are taking various measures (that do not relate to community groups alone) to increase the amount of waste that is composted. For example, we have set targets to increase the level of recycling and composting of household waste to 17 per cent. by 2003&ndash;04 and 25 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06. We are primarily looking to local authorities, as the statutory waste collection and disposal authorities, to deliver these targets. Some authorities are working with community groups to do this and the Government encourage this partnership-working.</p>
	<p pid=".1178W.2/3">We are also supporting the Composting Association with a grant of &pound;272,000 over three years to raise awareness and increase the understanding of composting and uses of composts.</p>
	<p pid=".1178W.2/4">In addition, funding of &pound;35.2 million is available until September 2006 specifically for community waste schemes in England under the New Opportunities Fund's Community Recycling and Economic Development Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".1180W.0/2">The Energy White Paper details the steps being taken to encourage greater energy efficiency in the UK, and sets out an ambitious strategy for energy efficiency up to 2010 and beyond. Energy efficiency is expected to deliver about half the carbon savings needed to meet our goals for 2020. This will mean roughly doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement of recent decades.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.0/3">Households account for around 5MtC of the expected savings by 2010. The Energy White Paper sets out measures which have the potential to deliver 3.5MtC by 2010, in addition to the savings of 1.5MtC from measures already in place. It is estimated that by 2020, a further 4&ndash;6MtC of annual savings can be realised in the household sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.0/4">Key measures proposed in the White Paper that would provide a statutory basis for improvements in energy efficiency in households include extension of the Energy Efficiency Commitment beyond 2005 at possibly twice its current level of activity; improvements in building standards through revisions to the Building Regulations, which we aim to bring into effect in 2005; and faster improvements in the standards of new household appliances.</p>

	<p pid=".1180W.3/1">The Energy White Paper details the steps being taken to encourage greater energy efficiency in the UK, and sets out an ambitious strategy for energy efficiency up to 2010 and beyond. Energy efficiency is expected to deliver about half the carbon savings needed to meet our goals for 2020. This will mean roughly doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement of recent decades.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/2">Key measures proposed in the White Paper include extension of the Energy Efficiency Commitment beyond 2005 at possibly twice its current level of activity; improvements in building standards through further revisions to the Building Regulations; faster improvements in the standards of new household appliances; and consultation on economic instruments to improve household energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/3">Already established are a wide range of policies and measures to encourage energy efficiency across the economy. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/4" class="indent">Climate Change Agreements, where companies can gain an 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy for eligible processes by entering into Agreements and meeting energy efficiency targets;</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/5" class="indent">the work of the Carbon Trust, which takes the lead on energy efficiency for business and the public sector, and supports the development of a low carbon economy in the UK. The Trust was launched in April 2001 as part of the CCL &quot;package&quot;;</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/6" class="indent">the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which will generate significant emissions reductions and is the first economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. The UK Government is also working towards implementing the European ETS, due to start on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/7" class="indent">funding for the Energy Saving Trust to run a number of programmes to promote the sustainable and efficient use of energy in homes. The Trust also facilitates the Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes, which brings together key stakeholders to support and promote domestic energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/8" class="indent">encouraging improvements in product standards so that energy-using appliances operate more efficiently;</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/9" class="indent">the Building Regulations, updated in 2002, which are already delivering significant energy efficiency improvements in new and existing buildings.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.3/10">The Government intend to publish an Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan within a year of the White Paper's publication, which will provide further detail on all of these policies.</p>

	<p pid=".1181W.8/1">Expenditure on food in Defra is generally limited to official hospitality provided by Defra and canteen subsidies. Records of spend on food provided at some external conferences and like events are not kept centrally and so will not be included.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.8/2">In 2001&ndash;02 Defra recorded expenditure of &pound;139,984 on hospitality and &pound;395,277 on canteen subsidies. The figures for 2002&ndash;03 were &pound;202,029 and &pound;409,179 respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.8/3">Information made available by canteen service providers indicates that on average 67 per cent. of the food they procured was produced in the UK. Therefore, the monetary value of UK produced food supplied to Defra as official hospitality and indirectly through subsidies is estimated to be &pound;357,509 in 2002&ndash;02 and &pound;408,287 in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.8/4">Defra has published a &quot;Guidance and action Sheet for buyers and their internal customers&quot; that includes guidance on local sourcing and in particular how to remove obstacles to tendering faced by local and UK suppliers. It can be seen on our website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/index.htm</a>. Defra has also produced a model food procurement action plan with guidance for completion that includes an objective concerned with opening up opportunities for local providers to compete for business. The guidance takes account of the Government's policy of achieving value for money in public procurement, and its commitment under the EC rules to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. We are also taking a number of other steps to integrate sustainable development into the public procurement of food and catering services. We have had bilateral meetings at Ministerial and senior management level (including with representatives of local government) and have published a number of case studies. A national conference on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-26">26 November</phrase> will raise awareness still further and that will be followed by regional workshops next year. Within Defra we are discussing with our catering service providers the scope they have for purchasing local and UK produce.</p>

	<p pid=".1184W.0/1">In 2001, 2,332,000 tonnes of hazardous waste were disposed to landfill in England and Wales. Projections for future years are affected by a range of factors, including the likely increase in costs of treatment and disposal as a result of requirements in the Landfill Directive, and the impact of these changes in costs on producers efforts to minimise waste. Changes to the hazardous waste list are likely to increase the amount of hazardous waste to be consigned. These and other factors are currently being investigated in support of work on possible scenarios for the hazardous waste forum, which is due to report in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".1184W.3/1">A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the Landfill Directive in England and Wales was published with the Second Consultation Paper on Implementation of Council Directive (1999/31/EC) on the Landfill of Waste. This is available on the Defra website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a>). The RIA points out that increasing disposal costs will provide greater impetus to minimise, recycle and re-use waste and hence move the management of waste up the waste hierarchy. This outcome is a major objective of the Government's environmental policy and is supported by business, non-Government organisations and Select Committees of this House.</p>
	<p pid=".1184W.3/2">The RIA indicates that at the extreme, waste producers will face an additional cost in the range of &pound;97 million to &pound;696 million. Part of this increased cost relates to landfilling hazardous waste; this fell into the range of &pound;15 million to &pound;87 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1184W.3/3">The RIA recognises that many of the potential benefits cannot be quantified but believes that a number will be of local significance where they result in a reduced impact of existing landfills. These benefits relate principally to reducing health and environmental risks and by promoting more sustainable options as set out above. The RIA also draws attention to benefits from investment in treatment technologies and rising landfill standards that could result in new opportunities for business.</p>

For animal diseases a working group which Defra set up with representatives of the insurance and livestock sectors met several times last year. The group has completed its initial task and we are now working on proposals for the livestock sector to bear a greater share of the cost of animal diseases. While there is no cost to taxpayers from crop diseases, wider discussions on crop insurance generally were held last year by a joint Defra/HM Treasury working group on farm risk management, with representatives from the finance and arable sectors.</p>

	<p pid=".1189W.0/1">It is unlikely that we will be able to determine exactly how long Phytophthora ramorum has been present in rhododendrons and related plants in this country. However, surveys are currently being conducted to establish how widespread the disease is and this may give an indication of how long it has been present.</p>
	<p pid=".1189W.0/2">In addition, the literature has been reviewed for records of Phytophthora species on rhododendrons in the UK. The established authority &quot;Pathogens of Trees and Shrubs&quot; by Pearce, published in 1963, states that at that time there was no evidence of any Phytophthora on rhododendrons. The first record of a Phytophthora species on this host was in 1968. Phytophthora ramorum was first described as a new species in October 2001 and first found in the UK in April 2002.</p>

The update will be supported by practice advice. The update addresses a number of matters including the provision of affordable housing in rural areas. The proposed changes give greater flexibility to local authorities to seek affordable housing on smaller sites where this is justified. It is also envisaged that in rural areas affordable housing provision may be supported by allocating sites solely for affordable housing, on land within or adjoining existing villages, which would not otherwise be released for housing and where this would contribute to the attainment of mixed communities.</p>

	<p pid=".1193W.5/28">While a change in sea temperature could affect stock distribution, spawning, migratory patterns and survival of very young fish, the effect of long term temperature trends on fish stocks is not easy to predict. Increased sea temperature has been linked to reduced recruitment (the numbers of young fish entering the population) in cold-water species such as cod, and improved recruitment in other species such as bass, but the factors influencing the survival of fish are complex and in many cases still poorly understood. For heavily fished species, fishing pressure remains the primary control on stock size but recruitment success also has a significant impact.</p>

	<p pid=".1194W.2/65" class="indent">The purpose of inward secondments from the private sector is to allow CSL to seek specialist expertise which cannot be provided by existing staff and for which recruitment to permanent posts is not appropriate. Modified rules on fair and open competition apply. CSL would ensure that the best candidate has been selected and the candidate's qualifications and experience qualify them to undertake the duties required. The secondee would continue to be paid and formally employed by the organisation that seconds them and the organisation invoices CSL for the salary costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1194W.2/66" class="indent">A posting from another Government Department is classed as a loan and can be for up to 2&ndash;3 years. Payment of salary is taken over by the importing department.</p>

	<p pid=".1197W.8/2">Sustainable forms of energy are at the heart of the Government's energy policy&mdash;as set out in this year's White Paper, &quot;Our Energy Future: Creating a Low Carbon Economy&quot;. This encompasses renewable energy, cleaner coal technologies, and fuel cells.</p>
	<p pid=".1197W.8/3">To take forward the commitments made in the White Paper, we have established the Sustainable Energy Policy Network (SEPN) of departmental policy units, regulators, Devolved Administrations and delivery organisations that are involved in delivering the White Paper's commitments. The network is overseen by a Ministerial Group chaired jointly by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Ministerial Group will be provided with independent advice by the creation of a Sustainable Energy Policy Advisory Board (SEPAB), made up of senior independent experts.</p>
	<p pid=".1197W.8/4">For renewable energy, we have already been working hard to create a comprehensive framework to meet our target that 10 per cent. of electricity should be sourced from renewables by 2010, and our aspiration that this should be doubled by 2020. Licensed electricity suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales are subject to the Renewables Obligation&mdash;requiring them to supply a specified and growing amount of their sales from electricity generated from a range of eligible renewable sources. The Obligation is backed up by a package of funding worth nearly &pound;350 million. This is divided between: capital grants, which are available to help kickstart a range of new and emerging technologies, for example, offshore wind, wave and tidal power and solar photovoltaics; and the New &amp; Renewable R&amp;D programme.</p>

The Government recognise that some organisations responsible for the management of waterways in England may encounter difficulties in disposing of liquid dredged material, particularly when the ban on landfilling of liquid wastes comes fully into force. (The decision on when the ban will start will be taken following consultation with interested parties).

	<p pid=".1200W.7/1">The Government do not collect figures on the cost of credit card fraud but the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimates the cost of all plastic card fraud in the year to August 2002 to be &pound;424.6 million. A majority of these costs will be borne by businesses. As with all expenses the costs of card fraud will have an impact on business's operating costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.7/2">APACS figures up to July 2003, which have not yet been published, suggest a year on year decline in card fraud of around 5 per cent. This follows a number of initiatives both within government and in partnership with the private sector to combat this type of fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.7/3">In April 2002, the Government launched a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit (the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit&mdash;DCPCU) based in London, which works closely with the banking industry to reduce organised card and cheque fraud, using intelligence largely provided by the card industry. DCPCU has had significant success in its first year including recovery of more than 4,000 cards and 524 cheques, resulting in 59 arrests and six convictions with potential savings of &pound;13.35 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.7/4">The Government are actively supporting the introduction of 'Chip and PIN', a major finance and retail industry initiative to reduce card fraud. This involves the introduction of microchips into payment cards to help authentication, combined with the use of PIN codes in place of signatures. The banking industry anticipates that by 2005 the new Chip and PIN technology will eliminate over half of the predicted level of plastic card fraud in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".1201W.5/1">The Home Office is actively supporting the finance and retail industry's 'Chip and PIN' initiative and maintains regular contact with the Association for Payment Clearing Services and the British Retail Consortium (BRC). 'Chip and PIN' involves the introduction of microchips into payment cards to help authentication combined with the introduction of PIN codes in place of signatures. The banking industry anticipates that by 2005, the new Chip and PIN technology will eliminate over half of the predicted level of plastic card fraud in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1201W.5/2">Since my appointment to the Home Office in June I have provided forewords for the two reports on the public trial of 'Chip and PIN' which took place in Northampton between May and August this year. I shall shortly be meeting with APACS and the BRC to receive a progress report on the 'Chip and PIN' project. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> also discussed the 'Chip and PIN' initiative with the BRC and APACS.</p>
	<p pid=".1201W.5/3">The Home Office has frequent and regular contact with law enforcement agencies. In addition, in April 2002 the Government launched a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit (the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit&mdash;DCPCU), which is funded jointly by the Home Office and the card industry. The DCPCU is based in London and works closely with the banking industry to reduce organised card and cheque fraud, using intelligence largely provided by the card industry. DCPCU has had significant success in its first year including recovery of more than 4,000 cards and 524 cheques, resulting in 59 arrests and six convictions with potential savings of &pound;13.35million.</p>

We are supporting the development of retail crime partnerships in major town and shopping centres.

The Agency has also successfully raised awareness of the new powers in the Act by hosting a series of conferences and presentations; and by the issue of a monthly newsletter which publicises successes in recovering the proceeds of crime.</p>

	<p pid=".1209W.11/2">CS is currently the only chemical irritant authorised for use by police forces in the UK. The CS is available in a number of different delivery systems.</p>
	<p pid=".1209W.11/3">The Police Service retains a tactical option to use CS agents to disperse a riotous assembly in life-threatening situations; subject to prior authorisation by the relevant chief officer. The CS is pyrotechnically discharged in the form of a cloud of smoke from a hand-thrown or weapon-launched grenade. The option has only been used once in a public disorder situation in Toxteth, Liverpool, in 1981. A small stock of such devices is retained by some forces.</p>
	<p pid=".1209W.11/4">CS in the form of an incapacitant spray is also issued to individual officers by the majority of police forces in the UK as a piece of personal defensive equipment for routine carriage. The method of delivery of CS in this case is by a discriminate aerosol spray with a range of up to four metres. Recording of the use of the spray is the responsibility of each individual force.</p>
	<p pid=".1209W.11/5">CS is also available to police forces in the form of 'barricade penetrating rounds' fired from a shotgun. These rounds rapidly disperse micronised CS in a cloud form within enclosed premises; the tactic is used, in extremis, to create a distraction or to encourage individuals to leave the premises. The rounds are only deployed on the authority of a senior officer for use by specially trained firearms officers in firearms/siege type situations.</p>

	<p pid=".1210W.2/1">The Government are committed to tackling child pornography on the internet. We are determined to ensure that there are effective measures to combat this exploitation of children. In January 2001, we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children to 10 years (from three years), and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months). There are proposals in the Sexual Offences Bill currently before Parliament that these offences should apply to photographs and pseudo-photographs of children up to the age of 18.</p>
	<p pid=".1210W.2/2">We have made substantial investment in law enforcement to enhance the capability of the police to investigate serious and organised crime committed via computers or computer networks, such as the internet. In April 2001, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was established, within the National Crime Squad, to investigate or support the investigation of such serious criminal activity, including the production and distribution of child pornography.</p>
	<p pid=".1210W.2/3">In March 2001, the then Home Secretary established a Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet. The Task Force includes representatives from internet service and communication providers, PC and software retailers and manufacturers, child welfare organisations, the main opposition parties, law enforcement agencies and academics. The Task Force has brought forward proposals for legislation to tackle paedophile 'grooming' activity on and off-line. In addition, sub-groups of the Task Force are looking at a range of issues including the evaluation of rating and filtering systems, and the impact of 3G mobile telephones.</p>
	<p pid=".1210W.2/4">Officials and members of the Taskforce have also produced a single document covering separate models of good practice relating to chat services, instant messaging and web services, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-06">6 January 2003</phrase>. We consider that these models are a significant step forward in making the internet a safer place for children. We will be reviewing the models and their impact in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".1210W.2/5">Internationally, the Government actively support efforts within the European Union, and more widely, to combat child pornography on the internet. In November 2001, we signed April 2001, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was established, within the National Crime Squad, to investigate or support the investigation of such serious criminal activity, including the production and distribution of child pornography.</p>

	<p pid=".1211W.2/1">It is a tragedy for any child to become involved in prostitution. Children involved in prostitution are primarily victims of abuse and adults who take advantage of them, whether by exploiting them as pimps or by buying sexual services from them, are child abusers.</p>
	<p pid=".1211W.2/2">The Government issued guidance for law enforcement agencies and other agencies working with children entitled &quot;Safeguarding Children in Prostitution&quot; in May 2000. This was followed by &quot;The National Plan for Safeguarding Children from Commercial Sexual Exploitation&quot;, which was published in September 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".1211W.2/3">The key message of both documents is that those under 18 who engage in prostitution are almost invariably victims and must be treated as such. A further key message is that wherever possible criminal justice action should be pursued against those who abuse children through prostitution or seek to exploit them as prostitutes.</p>
	<p pid=".1211W.2/4">The Sexual Offences Bill currently before Parliament proposes new offences to tackle the sexual exploitation of children, which will carry severe penalties. The proposals cover the exploitative and abusive activities associated with child prostitution and the involvement of children in pornography.</p>
	<p pid=".1211W.2/5">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 introduces a new offence of trafficking persons to control them in prostitution. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The Sexual Offences Bill includes more comprehensive trafficking legislation to re-enact and replace these provisions, again carrying a maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment. We have also developed and published a 'toolkit' on victims of trafficking, which is a guide for immigration officers, police and others potentially dealing with trafficking victims. We hope that the toolkit will raise awareness of the difference between trafficking and smuggling, and help them to treat trafficking victims fairly.</p>

The offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation carries a tough maximum penalty of 14 years. In addition to this, the Bill also introduces a new offence of commercial sexual exploitation of a child, which will protect children up to 18. It covers a range of offences, including buying the sexual services of a child, (for which the penalty ranges from seven years to life depending on the age of the child); and causing, facilitating or controlling the commercial sexual exploitation of a child in prostitution or pornography, for which the maximum penalty will be 14 years imprisonment.</p>

The average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders in England and Wales was 64 days for the second quarter of 2003&mdash;the eighth consecutive quarter at or below the 71 day target. Current Persistent Young Offenders (PYO) performance for each Local Criminal Justice Board is set out in the table (Table A) and further details are available at <a href="http://www.youth-justice-board.gov.uk/PractitionersPostal/PracticeAndPerformance/Performance">www.youth-justice-board.gov. uk/PractitionersPostal/PracticeAnd Performance/Performance</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.2/2">Locally, since April 2003 when the Boards were formally established, each Board has set itself individual adult and youth targets for improving general timeliness in the magistrates courts, with separate Crown court targets for different types of cases. These have been set in the context of the overall delivery of the Criminal Justice Systems (CJS's) Public Service Agreements and in the magistrates courts are expressed in terms of charge to completion. Targets for each area are set out in the table (Table B). Performance data from April-June 2003, is due to be published in October 2003.</p>

We detailed our plans in the national strategy for victims and witnesses, published in July. Among the proposals highlighted in the strategy was new legislation, to be brought forward as soon as Parliamentary time allows, which will include the first statutory Code of Practice for victims. The Code will list the minimum services which criminal justice agencies should deliver, and give victims the right of complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman if they are not received.</p>

The CRB expects to process the checks for new care home workers within this service standard. In July 2003, the average turnaround was 93.1 per cent. for Standard Disclosures and 93.5 per cent. for Enhanced Disclosures.

The NCSC does not identify the voluntary sector payments separate from payments made by the statutory and private providers of care services. It is therefore not possible to provide separate figures for the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1223W.2/4"><i>(c)</i> The Department of Health has informed us that as far as they are aware, there are no medical checks, as such, required by legislation. There are requirements in the various care regulations that providers, managers and staff must be physically and mentally fit for the purpose of the work they are to do. However, the regulations do not specify how these people are to prove they are fit. It is for the NCSC to decide whether the evidence of fitness is satisfactory.</p>

	<p pid=".1223W.5/1">The Report of the joint Cabinet Office/Home Office Review of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/pacereview2002.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/pacereview2002.pdf</a>) published in November 2002 recommended that the existing maximum detention period of 24 hours without charge for an arrestable offence was insufficient and should be extended to 36 hours. The police provided the Review with supporting evidence on difficulties associated with the 24-hour detention period. The extended period would enable investigations being completed more effectively and avoid the investigative process to be rushed to the detriment of either the suspect or the criminal justice system or both. The provision is included at Clause 5 to the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".1224W.5/1">We have already made significant progress towards meeting our target of reducing domestic burglary by 25 per cent. between 1999 and 2005. Figures published in the most recent British Crime Survey (BCS) show that there has been a 23 per cent. reduction in burglary since 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/2">We recognise the importance of driving down burglary still further, and a wide range of work is in progress to this end. Some initiatives are continuing from previous years. For example:</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/3" class="indent">All police authorities have agreed targets for reducing domestic burglary by 2005. The Police Standards Unit is working with police forces to help them meet these targets and is offering specific support to those forces at greatest risk of not meeting their burglary targets.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/4" class="indent">Minimum sentences of three years have been introduced for those convicted of burglary on a third separate occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/5" class="indent">Targets for reducing burglary are included in over 80 per cent. of the strategies developed by the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/6" class="indent">&quot;Stretched&quot; burglary targets have been included in over one third of Local Public Service Agreements (LPSAs) between local authorities and central Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/7" class="indent">Work is continuing with universities, student unions, the police and other relevant agencies to reduce crime against students.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/8" class="indent">We are working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) on an Approved Code of Practice for landlords, which will promote better standards of security in Houses in Multiple Occupancy (HIMOS) and improve landlord management practices.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/9">Initiatives taken forward for the first time during 2003 include:</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.5/10" class="indent">Developing a targeted publicity campaign in conjunction with brand partners to reinforce burglary prevention messages targeted at specific at-risk groups such as holidaymakers and home-movers.</p>

In addition, a series of concise reports, which will be aimed at promoting good practice to a range of practitioners, will start to become available from the end of 2003. These guides will help local authorities and others improve the way in which they deal with domestic violence cases.</p>

Another portion of that funding is being used to fund a three-year project by the Local Government Association aimed at supporting local authorities in tackling domestic violence.</p>

This is a national programme, launched in February 2003 and endorsed by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The training includes a knowledge of the various drugs that may be used and their effects; evidential and forensic considerations; and issues concerning victim care and evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/2">The training of uniformed officers who deal with sexual offence investigation (variously known as SOIT, SOLO or chaperones) is not currently delivered to a national programme. However, forces deliver a range of appropriate local training, including sexual offence training and drug induced rape issues. Numbers of forces providing such training are not currently known, but it features in a wide range of force training programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.3/3">Training for those officers, to agreed national standards, is currently being developed within the Sexual Offences Training Project at the Centre for Investigative Skills, National Specialist Law Enforcement Centre (NCPE). This is part of the response to the Home Office Action Plan to implement the recommendations of the HMCPSI/HMIC joint investigation into the investigation and prosecution of cases involving allegations of rape.</p>

	<p pid=".1226W.6/1">Victims of drug rape currently have access to all the support services available to victims of any type of sexual offence. These include local GP and hospital services, Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs), Victim Support and NHS Direct, all of which will support victims of any sexual crime, whether or not they intend to report the matter to the police.

One of the issues identified in the strategy is the need to ensure that there is better support for victims of sexual offences, including increased access to Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) and rape crisis centres.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.6/3">As well as supporting the further roll out of Sexual Assault Referral Centres and improving access to other forms of support, the Home Office also intends to set up a national helpline for victims of sexual offences.</p>

	<p pid=".1227W.2/1">Government funding for drug treatment has more than doubled since 2000 to over &pound;500 million pounds in 2003&ndash;04 and will rise further to &pound;573 million by 2005&ndash;06. The number of problematic drug misusers entering treatment has also steadily increased over the last five years as treatment services have improved and become more widely available. The Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO) is the main criminal justice disposal for drug addicts who commit crime and require treatment. The order can last between six months and three years and currently over 53 per cent. of DTTO offenders have either successfully completed their order or are still engaging positively with their treatment. Last year 6,140 DTTOs were made.</p>

	<p pid=".1230W.6/1">I have not received recent studies. In developing our approach to gun control we pay broad regard to aspects of controls in other countries and to our European Union and international obligations. But ultimately United Kingdom legislation has to be framed in the context of domestic requirements. We have one of the toughest frameworks of control in the world, and we consider it right that we should. However, although controlling legal firearms is important in helping to prevent guns falling into the wrong hands, it does not obviate the need for other measures to deal with armed crime. This needs to be addressed in the context of all violent crime and other activities such as drug dealing, as well as the emergence of a gang culture in some areas, and in the light of what we can learn from police best practice, both here and abroad.

	<p pid=".1231W.0/2">British overseas citizens do not have right of abode in the United Kingdom and are subject to immigration control. There is no provision within the immigration rules for dependants of members of the armed forces to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. Under a concession outside the rules dependants are normally granted leave for the duration of the principal member's posting, up to a maximum of three years, on conditions permitting employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1231W.0/3">Gurkhas are discharged in Nepal and Gurkhas often return to Nepal, with their personal possessions, six months prior to their official discharge in order to undertake pre-retirement courses and take leave. During this time, the basis of any leave in the United Kingdom granted to the dependant wife of such a Gurkha no longer exists, as the Gurkha is no longer in the United Kingdom, and she may be refused entry.</p>
	<p pid=".1231W.0/4">An application for a visa to enter the United Kingdom may also be refused for the same reason.</p>

	<p pid=".1231W.6/1">The Government set out its position on these issues in its response, published in March 2003 this year, to the 2nd Report of the Home Affairs Committee (Session 2002&ndash;2003) Criminal Justice Bill:</p>
	<p pid=".1231W.6/2" class="indent">In relation to the admissibility in criminal proceedings of confessions made to third parties, judges already have discretion to exclude evidence if it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it. When considering exercising this discretion the court would have regard for all the circumstances of the case, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained. [Ref: Section 78 Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)].</p>
	<p pid=".1231W.6/3" class="indent">Judges also have the discretion to exclude evidence where its prejudicial effect would outweigh any probative value. [Ref: Section 82(3) of PACE].</p>
	<p pid=".1231W.6/4">More specifically, where evidence is obtained in circumstances such as confessions made in custody cells, it is also open to the judge to draw the attention of the jury to these circumstances in his summing up.</p>
	<p pid=".1231W.6/5">The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice considered this issue in 1993 and made no recommendation for change. It was considered again by the Law Commission as part of its review of the hearsay laws in 1997. It concluded that confessions should continue to be admissible against their makers, subject to the discretions in PACE and in common law to exclude them. This view was supported on consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".1233W.2/1">The Department of Trade and Industry commissioned research to look at the viability of a potential drug detecting device, such as a &quot;swizzle stick&quot;, that could be unobtrusively used by people in pubs and clubs to detect drugs in drinks. Unfortunately, the prohibitive costs involved, and the difficulty of producing a satisfactory device, led to the project's discontinuance.</p>
	<p pid=".1233W.2/2">In general, we would urge people to exercise care with any product that claims to provide a complete solution to this problem, not least because of the reported widespread use of alcohol itself as a substance to facilitate the overpowering of a victim. Any device that provides only a partial screen is potentially dangerous to the extent that it may offer false reassurance.</p>

	<p pid=".1239W.5/2">The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis advises me that the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) does not have a specific 'Operation Ore Child Protection Unit'. The MPS Child Protection Group manages all child abuse investigations including all Operation Ore subjects. The Group is led by a Detective Chief Superintendent and has an establishment of 418 specialist police officers and 150 civilian support staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1239W.5/3">The MPS Child Protection Group's health and safety strategy has required that a small number of officers who have served a long time within the Paedophile Unit be rotated to other duties. This has been misreported in the media as the disbanding of the Paedophile Unit. However the unit is in fact being expanded and made ready for the new legislation, including the Sexual Offences Bill, currently passing through Parliament.</p>

The PSU is also leading the development of the Policing Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF) which aims to provide a broader balanced score approach to performance assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".1244W.8/1">Prison overcrowding is carefully managed within agreed operating capacities at each establishment. Operating capacities are the total number of prisoners that an establishment can hold taking into account control, security and the proper operation of the planned regime. Prison Service area managers determine such capacities on the basis of operational judgement and experience.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/2">No specific research projects have been undertaken into the effects of overcrowding on prisoners. However, we do keep under careful review the impact of population pressures, including overcrowding, on prisoners and staff in all prisons. There are a number of measures that can be used to assess the effects, for example, by the monitoring of regime performance, we know that population pressures are not yet significantly affecting the provision of rehabilitative schemes in prisons. It is inevitable though that at times of high population pressures, such provision may become disrupted.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/3">The Prison Service is taking steps to ensure the safety of prisoners and to mitigate against the effect of overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/4">For example, The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year safer custody programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and self-harm in prisons. The programme includes a series of inter-related projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and the learning from investigations into deaths in custody. Over the next few months the outcome of this programme will be reviewed taking into account an evaluation of these projects and emerging research findings.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/5">The Prison Service also keeps under review the distance between where prisoners are accommodated and their home areas. The Prison Service aims to hold prisoners in establishments that provide the degree of security they require; are suitable to their gender, age and legal status; provide special facilities appropriate to prisoner needs or are near to their homes or the courts dealing with their cases. High population levels throughout the prison estate can lead to prisoners being transferred from their home area to establishments where there are vacancies. However, evidence shows that over the last two years there has been little change in the proportion of prisoners held either under or more than 50 miles from their home area.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/6">There is, however, no evidence to suggest that population pressures compromise public security. Since 1992&ndash;93, the number of escapes from prison has significantly fallen from 232 in 1992&ndash;93 to five in 2002&ndash;03. This is despite an increase of around 50 per cent. in the average prison population over the same period.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/7">The number of assaults across the Prison Service fell in 2001&ndash;02 in comparison to figures for 2000&ndash;01. There was an increase in assaults in 2002&ndash;03, but early indications are that there may be a slight decrease in the number of such incidents for 2003&ndash;04. Minimising the number of incidents is essential to the safe custody of prisoners and to the protection of prisoners and staff. While it is expected that the number of incidents will increase as the prison population rises, it should be recognised that the majority of incidents other than escapes, assaults and deaths are quickly and safely resolved through the use of good contingency planning and incident resolution procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/8">While there has been no research into effects of overcrowding on Prison Service staff, an annual staff survey asks staff, as part of a range of questions, and as an indication of motivation about job satisfaction, whether they feel safe in their working environment. 67 per cent. of staff that responded to the 2002 survey said that they felt safe in their working environment. The survey itself does not directly research the effects of overcrowding on staff attitudes and morale. It cannot, therefore, identify whether the reasons for this response rate can be directly attributed to overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.8/9">A copy of the surveys and their outcomes are held in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1249W.11/2">The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme was launched in 2001 to provide the courts with a tough community based programme designed to tackle persistent young offenders. It currently provides for approximately 3,500 young offenders a year at an annual cost of &pound;21.5million. Additional funding of &pound;2 million has been made available for national roll-out, providing for a total of 4,200 persistent young offenders annually from January 2004. The programme is being fully evaluated by Oxford University; the final report with an analysis of reconvictions is due in March 2004. It is not possible at present to provide a comprehensive answer to my hon. Friend's question.</p>

This is one of a number of tools which enable them to protect the public more effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1251W.3/2">We have received no specific representations on the effectiveness of the register. However, we receive a large number of letters on the Sex Offenders Act, which sometimes raise, among other issues, the effectiveness of the register as it applies in individual cases.</p>

	<p pid=".1252W.8/3">The 26 Crown Courts and 44 magistrates courts have been collecting and providing data to the Department on a monthly basis and the monitoring of the throughput of cases continues. Street crime cases are not fast tracked but special attention is given to them to avoid unnecessary delay. The latest data presented to the Prime Minster's Street Crime Action Group Meeting in July revealed that street crime cases were disposed of, on average, within 135 days, compared to 178 days in respect of non-street crime cases proceeding in the same courts. All courts were well within the Department for Constitutional Affairs' target for the Crown Court, which is that 78 per cent. of cases sent to them should be listed within 182 days.</p>

In the last 12 months 38 per cent. of people aged 16 and over in England and Wales engaged in civic participation (e.g. signing a petition, contacting public officials or elected representatives, attending a public meeting or rally or taking part in a public meeting or protest). This is equivalent to 15.9 million people. In the last 12 months 67 per cent. of people aged 16 and over in England and Wales volunteered informally (as individuals) at least once. This is equivalent to approximately 27.8 million people. In the last 12 months 39 per cent. of people aged 16 and over in England and Wales volunteered formally (through groups, clubs and organisations) at least once. This is equivalent to approximately 16.2 million people.</p>

	<p pid=".1256W.0/1">The Home Office has commissioned a consortium of researchers to conduct an evaluation of special measures for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses (VIWs). The aims of the research are: (1) to evaluate how well the special measures have been implemented throughout the criminal justice system (CJS); and (2) to examine the experience of VIWs before and after the implementation of special measures in Crown Courts. The latter was addressed using pre and post-implementation surveys. The pre-implementation survey was conducted in 2000 and published in 2001 (Home Office Research Findings 147). This report can be found on the Home Office website at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r147.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r147.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".1256W.0/2">The post-implementation survey was conducted in 2003 and is currently being written-up. The survey work will help determine: whether the introduction of special measures has been accompanied by an increase in VIWs' satisfaction with the CJS, to what extent provisions for VIWs have changed with the implementation of special measures; and VIWs attitudes to the special measures. Home Office Research and Development Statistics expect to publish a full report next year.</p>

	<p pid=".1266W.2/1">The main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC has large current portfolios on neurological disorders and genetics. However, none of this research is specifically into Batten's disease. Nevertheless, this work includes a considerable amount of underpinning research that may be of relevance. The MRC has funded some research on Batten's disease in the past and currently carries out work on the main symptoms of the disease.</p>

Climb is currently in receipt of a project grant for &pound;63,220 over the period from 2002&ndash;03 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".1271W.5/3">We are, however, taking steps to improve services for patients with this condition. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-12">12 May</phrase>, we announced funding of &pound;8.5 million that will be used to develop services for people with CFS/ME. In July, health organisations were invited to bid for development funds to set up centres of expertise to develop clinical care, support clinical research and expand education and training programmes for health care professionals and to establish satellite community multidisciplinary teams. The first phase of development will start in April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1273W.0/1">We plan to regulate the sale of non-prescription cosmetic contact lenses to ensure that outlets selling them have professional optical supervisory arrangements to ensure that advice is available to purchasers, whether adults or children, on use of these lenses. A public consultation is due to take place this year as part of the parliamentary process. Detailed rules for the professional optical supervisory arrangements will be developed to implement the regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".1273W.0/2">Although the Department has made no specific assessment of the links between certain eye conditions and the use of non-prescription contact lenses, it is widely recognised that prescription contact lens wearers are more at risk of eye infections if they over-wear their lenses, adopt poor hygiene or smoke. It is reasonable to assume that similar risks apply to people wearing non-prescription lenses and that the lack of professionally supervised advice may put them at greater risk.</p>
	<p pid=".1273W.0/3">For prescription contact lenses, the Contact Lens Rules 1988 require that they be provided by General Optical Council registered opticians who also provide the necessary instruction and information to the person fitted on the care, wearing, treatment, cleaning and maintenance of such lenses and also provide the clinical management and adjustment of the fitting of the lenses for a period of six months from the date of first fitting.</p>
	<p pid=".1273W.0/4">Powered contact lenses are classified as medical devices but plano lenses have no corrective function or medical purpose and are not considered to be a medical device. There are no plans to reclassify them as such.</p>

	<p pid=".1274W.5/2">The priorities and planning framework for 2003&ndash;06 includes targets for reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease. One of these requires practice-based registers for patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes, with systematic treatment regimes, including advice on diet physical activity and smoking. This covers the majority of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30.</p>

This included practical advice for air passengers on long haul flights. It also identified certain groups which may be at a higher risk of DVT and advised them to seek medical advice before travelling and described simple in-seat exercises that should be recommended to all air passengers.</p>

	<p pid=".1279W.11/2">The purpose of National Health Service treatment centres is to provide additional capacity to treat more patients more quickly, in a modern streamlined environment. Treatment centres were not set up with the express aim of saving money, although evidence from other countries shows that they are likely to be a cost-effective and safe way of undertaking many operations. They have, however, already begun to make an important contribution to cutting waiting times for treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".1286W.2/1">We are committed to expanding the numbers and the role of general practitioners with a special interest (GPwSIs) and have already met the NHS Plan commitment to have 1,000 such GPs. These GPs will help expand the range of services offered by primary care in settings more convenient for patients than hospital-based care. It is important, however, that the services offered by these GPs address local priorities and needs. The decisions on which specialties to develop locally are therefore for primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid=".1286W.2/2">We are supporting the GPwSIs' development with guidelines which we have commissioned from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) on a range of specialities. Drug misuse is among these and we are funding a RCGP training programme on this. In the first year, 440 GPs attended the training and there were over a 100 on the waiting list.</p>

This is available on the FSA's website at <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fdscg-strategy-revised.pdf">http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fdscg-strategy-revised.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".1291W.2/49">A detailed strategy, which aims to reduce the presence of Campylobacter in United Kingdom-produced chicken on retail sale significantly, was published for consultation in June 2003. This can be found on the FSA's website at <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/consultations/completedconsultationscompleteduk/campylobacterstrategycons">http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/consultations/completed consultationscompleteduk/campylobacterstrategycons</a></p>
	<p pid=".1291W.2/50">As part of a nation-wide food hygiene campaign, the FSA is currently developing material to promote awareness of Campylobacter among poultry farmers. Earlier phases of this campaign have been targeted largely at raising awareness and promoting good hygiene practice in the catering industry. Messages about thorough cooking and the avoidance of cross-contamination are particularly relevant to prevention of Campylobacter infection. Further high-profile activity to increase awareness of cross-contamination in the kitchen is planned for early 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1291W.2/51">Good progress is being made towards reducing foodborne disease by 20 per cent. Provisional data for 2002 suggest there has been just over a 13 per cent. reduction in the number of cases of foodborne illness due to the target organisms, compared with the baseline figure for 2000.</p>

A programme is under way aimed at moving up to 400 patients from high security hospitals to more appropriate accommodation by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1305W.0/2">It is intended that the patients concerned should move to less secure hospitals or other suitable settings rather than to prisons. The programme has been initiated to address the problem of patients remaining in high security hospitals for longer than safety and security considerations dictate, which is an infringement of human rights and wasteful of scarce resources. The movement out of inappropriately placed patients will also facilitate the admission of people who do need high security care and treatment, including prisoners requiring transfer.</p>

	<p pid=".1308W.5/2">The CSM has advised that, for short-term use of HRT for the relief of menopausal symptoms, the benefits outweigh the risks for many women. However, for longer-term use of HRT, prescribers are advised that each decision to start HRT should be made on an individual basis and that women should be made aware of the increased risk of the adverse effects, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Each treatment decision should take into consideration the known risks and benefits of HRT, the contraindications for use and each woman's individual circumstances. In addition, the need to continue HRT treatment should be reappraised at least once yearly.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.5/3">Product information is being updated to reflect fully the new information and will additionally advise prescribers that, for the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms, the lowest effective dose of HRT should be used and that treatment should only be continued as long as the benefit in alleviating severe symptoms outweighs the risks.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.5/4">As with all licensed medicines, the CSM keeps the safety of HRT under close review, and would take appropriate action if further evidence relating to its safe use became available.</p>

	<p pid=".1311W.0/1">Two key initiatives which aim to improve the standards of information management in the national health service focus on the better recording and exchange of information to national standards and the development of health informatics skills.</p>
	<p pid=".1311W.0/2">All national standards for the recording and transfer of information across the NHS now have to be approved by the independent NHS information standards board. This ensures that data are collected using agreed common standards so that NHS information can be used consistently across the NHS. When approved, these standards are included within the NHS data dictionary which provides the core reference manual on information standards for the NHS. Part of the approval process of the information standards board is to ensure compatibility with the design authority of the national programme for information technology. This Design Authority is responsible for the design of the future NHS IT infrastructure through which much patient-related information will be collected in future.</p>
	<p pid=".1311W.0/3">The management of information to support the delivery of patient care and healthcare service planning and performance is undertaken by a range of people within the NHS. This includes clinicians, managers and specialist information analysts working in a range of local and national NHS organisations. For effective use of information, skills in health informatics are vital to ensure that information is not misinterpreted or misunderstood. The National Health Informatics Development Programme run by the NHS Information Authority is developing a range of products and services which aim to improve these across the NHS, so that the analysis and interpretation of information is undertaken to clear professional standards.</p>

	<p pid=".1317W.2/1">Posts held by staff on maternity leave are not available to be offered permanently to new staff. However the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital NHS Trust (which is responsible for the maternity unit at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital) has been involved in a number of initiatives to help address the current situation. These include: advertising in the nursing press; and midwifery recruitment stands at the national health service careers fair in Telford and at the Shrewsbury flower show.</p>
	<p pid=".1317W.2/2">In addition, all midwifery bank shifts available in Shropshire have been used and part-time staff have been asked to work extra shifts. The Trust has also approached two agencies in the area.</p>

	<p pid=".1319W.8/2">The Mersey Regional Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust has an action plan with the central commissioning group (CCG), which represents the 15 primary care trusts across Cheshire and Merseyside.</p>
	<p pid=".1319W.8/3">The immediate actions agreed with the CCG include:</p>
	<p pid=".1319W.8/4" class="indent">additional resources to provide an intermediate patient transport service whereby out-patient transport staff will be provided with additional training and resources in order to assist with the response to emergency demand;</p>
	<p pid=".1319W.8/5" class="indent">introducing additional solo operated rapid response vehicles;</p>
	<p pid=".1319W.8/6" class="indent">extending the hours of the existing solo operated rapid response vehicles; and</p>
	<p pid=".1319W.8/7" class="indent">introduction of a community paramedic.</p>
	<p pid=".1319W.8/8">The Mersey Regional Ambulance Service NHS Trust and the CCG are assessing further action needed to ensure the Trust achieves a headline performance of 80 per cent. from April 2004. The Trust will present these plans by October 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1320W.2/15">In 2000, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) made an appraisal of the use of Methylphenidate in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NICE estimated that approximately 1 per cent. of all school-aged children&mdash;about 69,000 of 6 to 16-year-olds in England met the diagnostic criteria for Hyperkinetic Disorder, the more severe type ADHD, of whom some 45,000 might benefit from Methylphenidate were not receiving this treatment. A review of the appraisal is planned for this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1320W.5/1">Methylphenidate (sold in the UK as Ritalin, Equasym and Concerta XL) is licensed for use in children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, where remedial measures alone prove insufficient.</p>
	<p pid=".1320W.5/2">The most common short-term adverse effects generally occur at the beginning of treatment, and include central nervous system effects, such as nervousness and insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.</p>
	<p pid=".1320W.5/3">The long-term safety and efficacy profiles of methylphenidate are not fully known. This is reflected in the product information of Ritalin provided to prescribers which advises that patients requiring long-term therapy should be carefully monitored. It warns of the risk of moderately reduced weight gain and slight growth retardation with the long-term use of stimulants in children and that careful monitoring of growth is recommended. It also recommends that blood tests should be performed periodically during long-term use.</p>

	<p pid=".1336W.2/2">The Department's report provides an analysis of 2001&ndash;02 reference cost data. This shows that the variation in unit costs across NHS trusts, measured by the standard deviation, fell from 21.2 in 2000&ndash;01 to 16.9 in 2001&ndash;02.</p>

We have consequently no way of relating back any measure of activity relating to the care sector with any change to insurance costs. However, overall activity levels in the care sector have increased over this period: since 1997 the number of older residents supported by local authorities in care homes has increased by 3,000, and the number of households receiving intensive home care, ten hours or more and six plus visits, increased from 72,300 in 2000 to 81,500 in 2002. We cannot, however, determine any relationship between this increase in overall activity to either voluntary sector providers or to any change in liability insurance costs.</p>

	<p pid=".1339W.6/2">The decision taken to import FFP from the United States for young babies and children born after I January 1996 will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable group, who will not have been exposed to BSE through the food chain. The National Blood Authority is currently involved in negotiating for supplies of FFP for this group of patients. This FFP will be virally inactivated and its planned availability is later this year. A commercially produced virally inactivated FFP product, sourced from the United States, is also available for the national health service to purchase.</p>

	<p pid=".1343W.3/2">A national cancer patient survey took place in 2001. Over 65,000 cancer patients discharged between July 1999 and June 2000 responded, including almost 11,000 men with prostate cancer. The outcome of the survey was published in July 2002 and it is available at: <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/nhspatients/cancersurvey">http://www.doh.gov.uk/nhspatients/cancersurvey</a>. It provides a baseline measurement of cancer patients' experience of care in the national health service against which improvements can be monitored.</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/3">Overall the survey showed patients reporting:</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/4" class="indent">confidence in the doctors responsible for their care;</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/5" class="indent">being treated with dignity and respect;</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/6" class="indent">understanding the explanation of their diagnosis; and</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/7" class="indent">being involved in decision making as much as they wanted.</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/8">However it also pointed to areas where improvements needed to be made, for example:</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/9" class="indent">the provision of written information;</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/10" class="indent">being informed about support/self help groups.</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/11">The results of the survey were shared with, among others, cancer networks and NHS Trusts who should have studied their local results and taken action to respond to them.</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/12">Responsibility for the national survey programme has now moved to the Commission for Health Improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".1343W.3/13">In September 2002, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) published improving outcomes guidance for urological cancers, including prostate cancer. This guidance included the need for providers to carry out surveys of patients experience to assess the adequacy of each component of patient-centred care. This guidance is informing the development of urological cancer standards for inclusion in the Manual of Cancer Services Standards against which cancer networks will be peer reviewed.</p>

	<p pid=".1345W.14/1">The Government's strategy document, &quot;Building the Information Core&mdash;Implementing the NHS Plan&quot; published in 2000 set the target of March 2003 for all radiology reports between hospital and general practitioners to be sent electronically. This target was based on the use of messaging technology. Work in this area has been superseded by the national programme for information technology in the national health service and the development of the integrated care records service (ICRS). Electronic transfer of radiology reports forms one element of phase 1 that will be implemented by December 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1345W.14/2">It was decided to suspend roll out of the message based technology for radiology reports as a more modern, reliable and cost effective set of technology options are available within the development of the online database system, for the ICRS. This will provide a more reliable arrangement with lower unit costs and increased flexibility for clinicians.</p>

	<p pid=".1347W.11/1">The Department recognises that additional investment in sexual health services is required to tackle poor sexual health. This is why we have already invested &pound;15 million to improve access to genito-urinary medicine (GUM) services and reduce waiting times; &pound;9.5 million in chlamydia screening, and &pound;5 million in termination of pregnancy services. In response to concerns expressed by the health committee and others about sexual health services, an additional &pound;11 million will be allocated this year. This will comprise &pound;5 million for GUM services; &pound;5 million to improve chlamydia testing, and &pound;1 million for contraceptive services. In line with the health committee's recommendations, the Department is also actively exploring the introduction of a 48-hour waiting time performance indicator for GUM services.</p>

	<p pid=".1348W.2/2">A number of different measures are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;Don't Give Up Giving Up&quot; advertising campaign. These include prevalence surveys, quarterly tracking research, monitoring calls to the national health service smoking helpline, evaluation of media coverage and helpline referrals to local services.</p>

Over 22,400 of these calls can be attributed to the introduction this year of the new starker health warnings on cigarette packets, one of which gives the NHS helpline number.</p>
	<p pid=".1348W.2/9">The Department is extending its campaign this year by informing people about the risks from second-hand smoke, the risk of less publicised diseases caused by smoking, and through funding charities, starting with Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation, to run hard hitting campaigns.</p>

The most comprehensive source of information is the national sentinel stroke audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the national health service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at <a href="http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit01-02.pdf">http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit01&ndash;02.pdf</a>. The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts who participated had a stroke unit compared to 56 per cent. three years earlier. The audit shows that 80 per cent. of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services.

	<p pid=".1353W.3/2">Our major vehicle for further improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework which sets specific milestones for improvement by 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts, specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, &quot;Improvement, Expansion and Reform&quot;, which sets for the national health service a priorities and planning framework for 2003&ndash;06, makes clear that implementation of the older people's national service framework is a top priority, and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.</p>

The first formal measurement of achievement against this indicator will be March 2005, and practices will be working to develop their stroke registers over the next 18 months.</p>

Initially, the Department will contribute &pound;5 million and the MRC and the Wellcome Trust will each contribute up to &pound;28 million, making a total of &pound;61 million, of which &pound;33 million is from government sources.

Initial funding is for the piloting and recruitment phases (approximately seven years), but the funders recognise that additional funding (at a lower level) will be required for the follow-up phase.</p>

Responses to the consultation will inform the exact timescale for the creation of the council and its composition, but the funders want to establish this body as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1356W.0/2">The vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme have been thoroughly assessed for safety prior to being licensed. As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the independent expert advisory Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>
	<p pid=".1356W.0/3">No vaccine or medicinal product is without potential side effects and these are clearly listed in the product information that is available to health professionals and patients. The CSM has reviewed the safety of vaccines containing the preservative thiomersal (which contains ethyl mercury) on a number of occasions. In 2001, the CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has considered new data as it has come to light in 2003. A statement was placed on the MHRA website at <a href="http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk">http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk</a> in February 2003, summarising the latest evidence on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1356W.0/4">The advice of the CSM remains that, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions (that typically include skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection), there is no evidence of harm from thiomersal contained in vaccines and that the benefits of immunisation with thiomersal-containing vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation.</p>
