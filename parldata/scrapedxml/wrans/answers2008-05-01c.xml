	<p pid="c.573W.7/1">The Ministry of Justice has published two annual reports containing statistical information on freedom of information requests received by monitored bodies (including central Government Departments) in 2005 and 2006. These reports can be found at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/3">The 2007 annual report is currently being drafted for publication in June 2008. However, statistics on requests received in each quarter of 2007 have been published and can be found via the MOJ website:</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (i.e. meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007 was 83 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.7/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the Department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied. For 2007, the number of such requests was nine, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

The Processing and Marketing Grant scheme is an important element in the Rural Development Plan for Wales 2007-13. It is designed to assist in the achievement of improved competitiveness by boosting productivity, creating enhanced added value and applying innovative technology. It is aimed at Welsh farmers, growers, foresters, food and drink manufacturers and processors. Assistance aimed at providing their English counterparts with the same benefits is provided under Axis 1 of the Rural Development Programme for England, which includes a range of measures designed to increase the competitiveness of the agriculture and forestry sectors. The budget for the whole of Axis 1 is some &pound;250 million over the Programming period 2007-13.</p>

The DLW project trialled the use of systematic data collection techniques to fulfil the Government's aim as set out in the 2000 Rural White Paper, of recording of such rights before 2026.</p>
	<p pid="c.585W.2/3">Natural England, the successor body to the Countryside Agency, has now reviewed the DLW Project. Its investigations found that even this systematic research approach could not remove the requirement for further detailed research into cases by the highway authority, and for a public inquiry to be held whenever the recording of such a right was opposed. As a result it considers there is no prospect of processing of the evidence collected by the 2026 cut-off date and accordingly Natural England is terminating the research contract. I do not consider any further investigation to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.585W.2/4">Natural England is preparing to convene a Stakeholder Working Group to consider the scope for an agreed package of the reforms in this area. The Government have endorsed this as an appropriate way forward, and will consider any recommendations from the Group in due course, although this does not mean that the Government are, at this stage, committing to further legislative reform. We have written to stakeholders indicating that we will not bring section 53 into effect at least until we know the outcome of this Group's work.</p>

	<p pid="c.590W.3/1">The Government have introduced a number of measures since 1997 to help older people out of poverty. These include the introduction of the minimum income guarantee and its successor pension credit. We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit by earnings in every year since its introduction. For 2008 we raised the standard minimum guarantee to &pound;124.05&mdash;an increase of 4.2 per cent.&mdash;more than keeping pace with earnings and prices. The value of the safety net we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by over a third in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.590W.3/2">In addition we have introduced winter fuel payments for those aged 60 or over, with a higher amount for those 80 or over. And we will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &pound;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &pound;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. We have also introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over and made above inflation increases in the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.590W.3/3">Between 1996-97 and 2005-06 the number of pensioners in poverty in the UK, after housing costs, has fallen by over a third from 2.9 million to 1.8 million (measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs.) Once housing costs are accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.590W.3/4">Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next parliament, will help secure these gains into the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.592W.18/1">To the end of April, over 323 Welsh businesses have registered on CompeteFor. The names of individual businesses registered on CompeteFor cannot be placed in the public domain, as the CompeteFor terms and conditions provide confidentiality for users. Of the 323 businesses, over a third have five or less employees, and approximately another third have between five and 30. The remaining have over 30 employees. Most of the registered businesses are limited companies, but there have also been registrations from charities, not-for-profit organisations, sole traders, and partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="c.592W.18/2">The CompeteFor system and the wider 2012 London Business Network have been developed to give businesses up and down the country access to opportunities in the 2012 supply chains. So far the level of take up by Welsh businesses has been low: the 323 figure above represents only 2 per cent. of the total registrations. I would encourage as many Welsh businesses as possible, alongside those in the rest of the UK, to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="c.597W.7/2"><i> </i>I have not held meetings with Members of the National Assembly for Wales about cross-border concessionary travel between England and Wales, nor has the Secretary of State. The Government's priority has been the implementation of the new England-wide bus concession which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Concessionary travel is a devolved policy area so the schemes in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland differ from the arrangements in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.7/3">Regarding correspondence about cross-border concessionary travel between England and Wales, in August 2007 I wrote to the Deputy First Minister (Minister for the Environment and Transport) of the Welsh Assembly Government about plans for the commencement of the Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.7/4">Officials in the Department for Transport corresponded with their counterparts in Wales during the development of the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill, which received Royal Assent in July 2007, and at this time held discussions with the Welsh Assembly Government about reciprocal arrangements for concessionary travel. There are considerable financial implications which would need to be resolved before mutual recognition could be pursued, although local authorities may continue with any current cross-border arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.598W.0/1">The Ministry of Justice has published two annual reports containing statistical information on freedom of information requests received by monitored bodies (including central Government Departments) in 2005 and 2006. These reports can be found at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/3">The 2007 annual report is currently being drafted for publication in June 2008. However, statistics on requests received in each quarter of 2007 have been published and can be found via the MOJ website:</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (i.e. meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007 was 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.0/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the Department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied. For 2007, the number of such requests was 205, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

	<p pid="c.602W.5/1">We continue to encourage train operators to carry bikes on trains where possible. The Department for Transport's Cycling Policy document and the rail strategy White Paper published last year set out our policy: train operators should facilitate the carriage of cycles on off-peak services and accept the folding cycles at all times. However, during the peak hours, where capacity is under pressure, it can be in the interests of the majority of passengers not to permit non-folding cycles on board. It is for individual train operators to determine which services cannot accommodate non-folding bicycles and of course to determine the number of bikes which can be carried at other times.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/2">We want all TOCs to take into account the wider benefits of cycling when considering both investments in cycle facilities and their own rules for carrying cycles. This is particularly important when procuring new rolling stock where space for bicycles must be considered.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/3">The White Paper also announced the setting up of a Task Force to look into how bike and rail journeys can be better integrated. The Task Force which includes ATOC, Network Rail, Passenger Focus and Cycling England have begun their work and I look forward to hearing about their progress.</p>

	<p pid="c.604W.5/1">The Department has not assessed the effectiveness of commercially available speed camera detection systems. However, the Road Safety Act 2006 gives the Secretary of State the power to prohibit by regulations a vehicle being fitted with, or a person using a vehicle carrying speed assessment equipment detection devices. The Government have always made clear that they do not intend to prohibit the use of purely GPS-based devices which identify the location of cameras through publicly available information. They do however wish to prevent the carriage and use of devices which detect or interfere with the operation of speed measuring equipment through other means. The actual devices to be covered by the ban will be the subject of full public consultation before the associated secondary legislation is laid before Parliament.</p>

For the years 2003-04 to 2005-06, the figure for Suffolk is a combination of the figures for Central Suffolk PCT, Ipswich PCT, Suffolk Coastal PCT, Suffolk West PCT and Waveney PCT.<br/> For the year 2006-07, where PCTs were reorganised in October 2006, the figure for Suffolk is a combination of the figures for the old PCTs listed above and the new Suffolk PCT. For the financial year 2007-08, the figure is for the new Suffolk PCT alone.<br/> 2. The figure for 2006-07 does not include prescribing in the area of the former Waveney PCT after October 2006, when the PCT joined the former Great Yarmouth Teaching PCT to become Great Yarmouth and Waveney PCT.<br/> 3. The figure for 2007-08 includes prescribing for 11 months only (April 2007 to February 2008). Data for the remaining month are not yet available. This figure also excludes prescribing from the former Waveney PCT area, which now forms part of Great Yarmouth and Waveney PCT.<br/> 4. The PACT system covers prescriptions by general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists and others in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, &quot;Central Nervous System&quot;, has a proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community&mdash;these prescriptions are not included in PACT data.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Information Centre for health and social care&mdash;Prescribing Analysis and CosT tool (PACT)</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.616W.2/11">The increased MHS net operating cost in 2007-08 resulted from an MHS Transformation Programme that will implement service delivery changes for all MHS customers. This transformation is continuing into 2008-09 and will reduce future costs. During 2007-08, exceptional transformation costs of &pound;10.8 million were incurred mainly relating to redundancy and redeployment costs. In addition to the projected net operating cost of &pound;32 million in 2008-09, we expect further exceptional transformation costs of up to &pound;8 million.</p>

The Department for International Development (DFID) has supported these reforms through nearly &pound;1 million of assistance to civil society to work with political representatives at all levels. We have also contributed &pound;6 million to the United Nations Development Programme in support of women's empowerment, including the establishment a women's political school that has trained over 20,000 female Councillors. In addition, we have provided extensive support for training and promoting voter awareness during the recent elections.

	<p pid="c.645W.2/1">During the year 2006-07 there were 4,285 offenders subject to Post Release Licence (offenders serving 12 months or more and those under 22 years of age). Of these 246 (5.7 per cent.) were recalled following an allegation of a further offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/2">The Home Detention Curfew Scheme (HOC) began in 1999. It is applied to prisoners serving sentences of between three months and under four years who meet the eligibility criteria. It allows prisoners to live outside prison providing they do not breach the rules of their curfew. Approximately 148,000 prisoners have been released on HDC since the scheme began. 85 per cent. complete their curfew successfully. About 4 per cent. are reported to re-offend during the curfew period.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/3">The End of Custody Licence Scheme (ECL) came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase>. Prisoners serving sentences of four weeks or more but less than four years who meet the eligibility criteria are released under licence up to 18 days earlier than they would otherwise be released. Between <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> about 23,700 prisoners have been released under the scheme. Of those released NOMS have been notified that about 3 per cent. have been recalled and just 1 per cent. have been notified as allegedly offending during the ECL period.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/4">All prisoners who are subject to HDC/ECL including those who are not subject to Post Release Licence are liable to recall if they are reported to have misbehaved during the HDC/ECL period.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/5">During the HDC/ECL period offenders who are subject to Post-Release Licence are required to meet their Offender Manager after release and to have regular contact after that in line with Probation Service National Standards. During the HDC/ECL period prisoners are encouraged to seek employment and training and to engage with relevant community resources. These measures apply only to those who have accommodation to go to.</p>

	<p pid="c.664W.5/4">Local authorities have always had the ability to turn down applications for inappropriate housing development in back gardens. PPS3, which came into force in April 2007, has strengthened that ability further. In particular, local authorities have now been given the ability to put in place local policies that specifically protect gardens and to separate gardens out from their wider brownfield development targets. The policy also makes clear that there is no presumption that land is suitable for housing simply because it is brownfield, stressing the need for sites to be suitable for housing development, and in suitable locations that will contribute to the creation of sustainable, mixed communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.665W.8/1">Housing associations (RSLs) are independent not-for-profit organisations responsible for their own lettings policy, governance and management of stock. However, under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, it is unlawful for service providers (including housing associations) to treat someone less favourably because of their disability, and they must make 'reasonable adjustments' for them, such as giving that person extra help or changing the way they provide their services.</p>
	<p pid="c.665W.8/2">Further, the Housing Corporation, which invests in and regulates RSLs, also has statutory duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Through its regulatory code, it requires that RSLs operate according to the law, their constitutions and regulatory requirements. The code requires that they demonstrate when carrying out all their functions commitment to equal opportunities, work towards the elimination of discrimination, demonstrate an equitable approach to rights of all individuals, and be responsive to the individual circumstances of residents. RSLs should have an equalities and diversity policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.665W.8/3">The regulatory code requires that RSLs have lettings and sales policies which are flexible, non-discriminatory, responsive to demand, and which contribute to the need to be inclusive and ensure sustainable communities. Section 170 of the 1996 Housing Act requires that RSLs co-operate with local housing authorities to enable the latter to fulfil their duties to the homeless, the vulnerable, people in priority housing need and those covered by the Government's Supporting People policy. Where a local authority so requests, and to such an extent as is reasonable in the circumstances, RSLs must co-operate in offering accommodation to people with priority on the authority's housing register. In addition, section 106(2) of the Housing Act 1985 requires that RSLs maintain a set of rules determining priority between applicants in allocating housing accommodation and the rules governing the procedure.</p>

	<p pid="c.681W.9/2">Cogent has a sector skills agreement (SSA) with the nuclear industry, Government, trade unions and other stakeholders. This identifies the skills needs of the sector and the recruitment, training and education solutions needed to address skills gaps. One important solution is the launch of the National Skills Academy for Nuclear (NSAN). NSAN is a subsidiary company of Cogent and, responding to employer demand in the sector, its focus is UK-wide with responsibilities for assuring training provision to agreed standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.9/3">To address the specific skill needs of the nuclear waste industry, Cogent is working closely with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the National Skills Academy for Nuclear and employers. The initiatives include a web-based career pathways service and development of apprenticeship/modern apprenticeship frameworks, a nuclear industry training framework and national occupational standards along with the associated Scottish/national vocational qualifications, and foundation degrees. The career pathways scope the skills to deal with current nuclear waste volumes and the requirements of a future national nuclear waste repository.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.9/4">Through the Alliance of SSCs, Cogent works with related SSCs as well as with other skills bodies, such as the Engineering Construction Industry Trade Board, to ensure the full range of skills required to deal with nuclear waste are available.</p>

	<p pid="c.683W.2/11">Part-time students need to be studying at 50 per cent. of the intensity of a full-time student to apply for both a fee and course grant. This Government was the first to introduce statutory support for part-time students, in 2000/01. In 2006/07, we introduced the most generous package of financial support ever for part-time students in England. This included increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and an above-inflation increase in the income threshold for receiving this support.</p>
	<p pid="c.683W.2/12">Mature full-time students are generally eligible for the same student support package as other students but maintenance loans are only available to those under 60. They can also access targeted support including the Adult Dependants' Grant, Parents Learning Allowance, Childcare Grant and Disabled Students Allowance. Students may also qualify for a bursary from their higher education institution.</p>
	<p pid="c.683W.2/13">From 2008/09, we are increasing the income thresholds for the means tested maintenance grant so many more full-time students, including mature students, will receive grant support. This will mean that one third of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008/09 are expected to be entitled to a full non-repayable grant worth &pound;2,835 and another one third are expected to be entitled to a partial grant.</p>

	<p pid="c.689W.0/1">There were 13 Wider Opportunities pilot authorities: Barking and Dagenham, Croydon, Devon, Haringey, Hertfordshire, Kirklees, Manchester, Newham, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Portsmouth and Staffordshire. All of the pilot authorities have learnt from their experience and are continuing to address the objectives of giving as many pupils as possible access to free instrumental tuition during key stage 2 care, which Ofsted<sup>(1)</sup> recommended should last for at least one year.</p>
	<p pid="c.689W.0/2">In 2003-04 each local authority received an additional &pound;10,000 in its Standards Fund allocation for music specifically to support activities linked to wider opportunities at key stage 2. These additional payments of &pound;10,000 were also made in 2005-06 and 2006-07. In 2006-07 a further &pound;3 million was allocated nationally to support wider opportunities work, with &pound;23 million allocated for this purpose in 2007-08. These allocations were shared on a formula based on the number of key stage 2 pupils with a weighting for social disadvantage. For 2008 to 2011 the Standards Fund Music Grant still includes a formula based sum (&pound;23 million a year) to enhance access to instrumental and vocal opportunities at key stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.689W.0/3">Since 2006 &quot;Wider Opportunities&quot; has come to be used to describe not a single model but rather a number of models which deliver instrumental and vocal tuition across whole class and year groups. Guidance for schools on instrumental and vocal tuition at key stage 2 was produced in March 2006 and updated<sup>(2)</sup> in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.689W.0/4">We continue to support the objectives of widening musical opportunities for children and young people, and announced a record &pound;332 million investment for music in schools on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>. Our aspiration, as set out in the Standards Fund guidance sent to directors of Children Services in December 2007, is that by 2011 programmes will be in place that will result in every child having the opportunity to learn a musical instrument for free, normally in a large group or whole class setting, for at least one year.</p>

	<p pid="c.698W.2/1">Levels of literacy and numeracy in primary school leavers are most commonly measured by the proportions of children gaining National Curriculum level 4 and above in English and mathematics, since these represent the expected national standard. Children who reach Level 3 of the National Curriculum are assessed as having effective skills in English and mathematics and can demonstrate a good standard of reading and mental addition and subtraction. They are able to read a range of texts accurately independently, tackle unfamiliar words, discuss their mathematical work and begin to explain their thinking. Children achieving Level 4 have access to more complex forms of language and more complex ideas. They develop their own strategies for solving problems and are using these strategies both in working within mathematics and in applying mathematics to practical contexts.</p>
	<p pid="c.698W.2/2">Achievement of the target Level 4 provides children with a solid foundation in learning from which to access the full secondary curriculum&mdash;79 per cent. of pupils who achieved Level 4 (in a combination of English, Mathematics and Science) at Key Stage 2 in 2002 went on to get five or more good GCSEs in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.698W.2/3">The Department's new Public Service Agreements published as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2007 have a dual focus on ensuring that pupils reach the levels expected for their age in both English and mathematics (threshold targets) and improving the rates of progress made by pupils from ages 5-16 (new progression targets) with increased attention to achieving faster progress for underachieving groups such as children in care and minority ethnic pupils. The progression targets will be a major factor in helping all pupils&mdash;regardless of their background and circumstances&mdash;to realise their potential in English and mathematics in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.698W.2/4">Information on the attainment of pupils in Key Stage 2 English and mathematics tests since 1994-1995 is shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="c.701W.0/1">The available information is contained within the tables. There are two breaks in the time series because of changes to data collection: 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the CLG (formally ODPM) to the section 52 form from the DCSF (formally DFES). 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank columns. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990s and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.</p>

	<p pid="c.706W.2/1">The current school inspection cycle began in September 2005. Ofsted is required to inspect each maintained school by <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August 2009</phrase> and, following that inspection, to inspect each such school within three school years from the end of the school year in which the last inspection took place.</p>
	<p pid="c.706W.2/2">Within the cycle, the frequency of inspection is determined by Ofsted. Schools that are judged to require significant improvement are subject to a monitoring visit, which takes place between six and eight months after the relevant inspection, followed by a full inspection after a year. Those schools judged to require special measures receive termly monitoring visits until they are removed from this category. However, if they remain in special measures for two years they will be re-inspected at that point. In addition, some schools that are judged by Ofsted to be satisfactory overall but with underperformance in some areas of their work receive a monitoring visit between 12 and 18 months after the inspection.</p>
	<p pid="c.706W.2/3">The inspection cycle and other aspects of the school inspection arrangements from September 2009 are currently under review by the Department and Ofsted.</p>

	<p pid="c.708W.12/1">Iran's overall human rights record is poor. We have a number of concerns about human rights violations in Iran, including the increasing use of the death penalty (and its continued use for juvenile offenders) and the growing restrictions on any form of dissent or organised protest. Human rights defenders, women's rights activists, trade unionists, non-governmental organisation workers and students continue to face pressure including intimidation, questioning, arrests and sentences on charges of 'acting against national security' or 'propaganda against the system'. Newspapers and magazines are regularly closed down and websites blocked for criticising the Government or crossing red lines. Iran's failure to live up to its commitments under the international human rights conventions it has signed up to is particularly disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="c.708W.12/2">We remain committed to supporting international human rights standards in Iran and regularly raise our concerns with the Iranian authorities. We usually raise human rights issues with the Government of Iran through the EU, in order to maximise impact and emphasise that our concerns are shared across a range of countries. So far this year the EU has raised human rights issues with the Iranian authorities at least seven times in meetings and made public statements on a number of issues including individual death sentences, the treatment of members of the Baha'i faith, detained human rights defenders and students, and the draft Islamic penal code. We also discuss human rights issues bilaterally with Iranian officials. Most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-06">6 March</phrase>, I issued a statement calling for the release of two detained trade unionists in Iran, and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> I called in the Iranian ambassador to raise our concerns about articles of the draft penal code that would make apostasy punishable by death.</p>

Second World War veterans who served in Greece may receive campaign medals from the Greek Government (Greek War Medal and War Star) but permission has not been given to wear the medals.

	<p pid="c.711W.3/1">Two countries (the US and Canada) have recently awarded medals to British service personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unrestricted permission to accept and wear foreign awards can be granted to British service personnel on exchange, attachment or loan to a foreign state, who are involved in a military operation or emergency on behalf of that state. The same applies to British service personnel serving in a UK unit in a bilateral force under the command of another country, who render special service to that country's forces in a military operation or emergency. This is consistent with both the five-year rule and the double-medalling rule, which are important in the British honours system.</p>

	<p pid="c.713W.5/2">We endorse the recommendations made by the EU Election Observation Mission (EOM) in its report of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-16">16 April 2008</phrase> which stress the need for increased participation of minorities in the election process. A comprehensive and well-harmonised plan of action to support democratic institutions in Pakistan will flow from these lessons, taking full account of the EOM recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.713W.5/3">The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is undertaking a Universal Periodic Review on the human rights records of a number of countries including Pakistan in May. The UK is participating in this dialogue and will raise the treatment of minorities during the process.</p>
	<p pid="c.713W.5/4">We will continue to encourage Pakistan to fulfil commitments under the UNHRC. We welcome Pakistan's decision to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. We look forward to early implementation of these instruments which we believe should safeguard the rights of minorities in Pakistan.</p>
