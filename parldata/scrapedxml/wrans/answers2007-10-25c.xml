	<p pid="c.445W.3/1">In July the Commission agreed to fast track several areas of the Tebbit Review as detailed in my answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-24">24 July 2007</phrase> (HC Deb 925W). Following the debate in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase> and comments from the Finance and Services, Administration and Audit Committees, the Commission approved the following changes on <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/2">A new Management Board replaced the existing Board of Management with immediate effect. The Management Board consists of the Clerk, as Chief Executive and Chairman, four director generals with functional responsibilities, and up to two external advisers. The six House Departments other than PICT will be merged into four new Departments broadly aligned with the Director Generals' responsibilities. These will be:</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/3" class="indent">Department of Chamber and Committee Services&mdash;incorporating Clerk's Department, <i> Hansard</i> and core elements of the Serjeant's Department;</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/4" class="indent">Department of Information Services&mdash;incorporating the Library and allied information services;</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/5" class="indent">Department of Resources&mdash;incorporating Finance and Administration;</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/6" class="indent">Department of Facilities&mdash;incorporating Estates and Works, Accommodation Services and Refreshment Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/7">These new Departments will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>. A recruitment exercise to fill the new post of Director General of Facilities will be put in place. Pending an appointment, the Commission has agreed that the Director of Catering Services will lead the work to create the new Department of Facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/8">PICT will be formally vested as joint Department of the two Houses early in 2008. Pending a review in 2009 of the working of the Parliament (Joint Departments) Act 2007, the Director of PICT will attend the Management Board as one of its external members.</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.3/9">The aim is to create a fully unified House Service that will provide Members and others with the highest standards of service. The changes are consistent with the approach recommended in the Tebbit report, but also address a number of issues on which the report did not reach a firm conclusion. The intention is that the changes will be cost neutral and there are no planned redundancies. I understand that consultation has begun with both staff and trade unions on how best to create the new Departments.</p>

All referrals from the police to The Border and Immigration Agency relating to the overseas missing scouts have been investigated and all individuals continue to have valid entry clearance and are in the United Kingdom legally. As such, this is an ongoing police matter.</p>

	<p pid="c.458W.0/1">We have asked HEFCE to phase out the support it gives to institutions for students doing a second degree at an equivalent or lower level in order to redistribute around &pound;100 million a year by 2010/11 towards our priorities. While there may be some benefit to individuals, and their employers, in them retraining for a second qualification at the same level, it is generally fairer to both students and the taxpayer to give priority to those either entering higher education for the first time, or progressing to higher qualifications. All of the &pound;100 million will be redistributed to support our priorities, including the challenges posed by Sandy Leitch around the proportion of the work force with graduate level skills from under 30 per cent. to over 40 per cent. by 2020. At the same time, we also published details of these changes and the rationale for them so that prospective students both with and without existing Higher Education qualifications can plan ahead in the knowledge of our priorities.</p>

It requires all such laboratories to satisfy themselves that their facilities and procedures address all the issues identified by Professor Spratt and the HSE. DEFRA and the HSE will also undertake a programme of inspection at all SAPO Category 3 and 4 laboratories. SAPO licences for those laboratories have also been amended to make clear their responsibilities towards biosecurity.</p>

	<p pid="c.465W.2/25">A great deal of work is being taken forward across Government to build on this success. Reducing re-offending is a key element of the new Home Office Crime Strategy &quot;Cutting Crime: A New Partnership 2008-11&quot;. The new &quot;Make Communities Safer&quot; Public Service Agreement sets a target both to reduce adult and youth re-offending, and to reduce the level of serious re-offences. NOMS and DIUS will be producing an overarching Strategic Plan in spring 2008 to set out how the Government intend to meet this challenge and a consultation paper will be published shortly. Alongside this consultation, we will also be consulting on an Offender Health and Social Care Strategy and a NOMS Third Sector Action Plan. While these will focus on specific elements of work to reduce re-offending, they will support the overarching Strategic Plan, and underscore the Government's commitment to tackling re-offending holistically.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.2/26">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is working to reduce youth re-offending. The YJB has a scaled approach to youth justice interventions to ensure that youth offending services focus on those children and young people most likely to re-offend. The YJB has developed the assessment tool &quot;Asset&quot; which is used by all Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) to identify the risk factors driving offending behaviour and the protective factors that will support desistance. Asset is used to design a &quot;multi modal&quot; package of interventions to reduce risk factors and build up the protective factors. The Wiring-Up Youth Justice Programme is providing YOTs with the latest technology to improve the speed and quality of information transfer between YOTs, secure establishments and other key service providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.2/27">The new local government performance framework which contains six specific youth justice indicators (out of total of 197) provides YOTs with an excellent lever to encourage local authority chief executives to prioritise young offenders' access to services.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.2/28">The reducing re-offending agenda also makes important contributions to a number of other cross-Government PSAs including, PSA 16: Increase the proportion of socially excluded adults in settled accommodation, employment, education or training; PSA 25: Reduce the harm caused by Drugs and Alcohol and PSA 24: Deliver a more effective transparent and responsive Criminal Justice System for victims and the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.2/29">We are introducing new ways of measuring progress on reducing re-offending, which will include reducing the reporting time lag in the adult results from two years to one year and producing a metric to provide a more detailed understanding of the volume and seriousness of re-offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.468W.2/1">The Department for Transport (DFT) plays a key role in negotiating ever-tighter air quality standards for vehicles at EU level. The European Council recently voted for the latest set of Euro standards (Euro 5 and 6 for light duty vehicles), negotiated by DFT. Euro 6, due to come into force in 2015, will deliver a 68 per cent. reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel cars and vans, in comparison to the Euro 4 levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/2">DFT requires local authorities to produce local transport plans (LTPs). Local authorities submitted their five-year LTPs in 2006, which cover all of England outside of London. In its guidance, DFT emphasised the importance of air quality by making it one of four shared priorities in the LTP.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/3">The UK's new Air Quality Strategy, published in July 2007, recommended that the Government further consider three new transport measures: incentives for the early uptake of new Euro standards; increased uptake of low emission vehicles; and reduced emissions from ships. Discussions have already begun across Government as to the possible implementation of these measures.</p>

	<p pid="c.468W.5/1">We commissioned the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to evaluate evidence submitted by the British Air Lines Pilots Association (BALPA) in relation to cabin air &quot;fume events&quot;. The COT received extensive information from oil companies, airlines, engine manufacturers, independent scientific experts and campaign groups. The COT also reviewed previous studies of cabin air. The COT reported on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-20">20 September 2007</phrase>. The report is published on COT's website at <a href="http://www.advisorvbodies.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/index.htm">www.advisorvbodies.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/index.htm</a> where there is a mass of material.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.5/2">The committee considered that it was not possible to conclude whether cabin air exposures (either general or following incidents) cause ill-health in commercial aircraft crews. It recommended further work, in particular and as a priority, to ascertain whether substances in the cabin environment during fume events could potentially be harmful to health. COT considered that this work should be designed to detect any potentially harmful substances, rather than focus on named substances.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.5/3">In keeping with its commitment to promoting healthy flying, the Department for Transport accepts this priority. We have recently been testing equipment which may be capable of capturing substances released during fume incidents. Subject to the results of this testing, the Department hopes to begin a study later this year or early next year.</p>

Under the housing prime contract, a survey is underway on SFA which will inform future upgrade plans. It would be premature to predict at this stage how many properties will be at a particular standard in 2017. The upgrading of properties is, however, proceeding and at present some 95 per cent. of SFA is at the top two standards for condition. This includes increasing the condition of properties at the top Standard from 40 per cent in 2001-02 to 59 per cent. now.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.2/3">So far as single living accommodation (SLA) is concerned, the current programme extends to 2013 and by then we anticipate that 52 per cent. (70,000 bed-spaces) will be at the highest standard (Grade 1), with a further 14 per cent. (19,000 bed-spaces) at Grade 2.</p>

	<p pid="c.475W.2/2">The Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force have done a great deal in recent years to promote racial equality and continue to work hard to develop an organisational culture that welcomes racial diversity and places the highest priority on tackling racism. The armed forces respect and value every individual's unique contribution regardless of race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, social background or sexual orientation. The goal is to create a working environment free from harassment and unlawful discrimination, in which all have equal opportunity to realise their full potential. From 1997 to 2006, the armed forces worked in formal partnership with the Commission for Racial Equality to improve racial equality.</p>
	<p pid="c.475W.2/3">The MOD published a race equality scheme (RES) in 2003 and subsequent reports about the scheme detail the range of measures that the armed forces have undertaken to improve racial equality. The RES was superseded in June 2006 by the Department's overarching equality and diversity scheme. The armed forces achievements in promoting racial equality were recognised when all three services finished in the top 10 in Business in the Community's annual Race for Opportunity annual benchmarking report for 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.486W.0/1">Government seeks the most cost-effective IT solutions. It tries to avoid mandating particular technologies so that suppliers can manage technology risks.</p>
	<p pid="c.486W.0/2">Although Open Source can be cheaper to purchase it can also entail higher support and other costs. The additional costs or savings depend on the individual business requirement. This is supported by external studies which have not shown a consistent advantage to open source in these terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.486W.0/3">The Government's policy on Open Source is to consider such solutions alongside proprietary ones in IT procurements and award contracts on a value for money basis; only use products for interoperability that support open standards and specifications in all future IT developments; seek to avoid lock-in to proprietary IT products and services; and consider obtaining full rights to bespoke software code or customisations of commercial off the shelf software it procures wherever this achieves best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.486W.0/4">The Government have no targets to promote the use of Open Source except where it is the most cost-effective way of meeting its needs. Information on the total use and value of Open Source in government is not held centrally and could not be obtained except at disproportionate cost. However it does play an important role in major applications including websites such as Directgov; Electronic Vehicle Licensing; and Jobcentre Plus's system to help people to obtain jobs.</p>

	<p pid="c.497W.11/1">This is an operational matter for Royal Mail. The company introduced Sunday collections a few years ago to enhance their service, but there has been very little take up from the public. Sunday postings are very low, but add a huge amount of cost to the business. Royal Mail have to have regard to their costs and are therefore looking to stop Sunday collections.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.11/2">The Government considers the maintenance of a universal postal service throughout the UK to be of the highest importance. That is why the obligation is enshrined in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act 2000 and why Postcomm has the primary statutory duty to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff.

	<p pid="c.498W.5/68">New VAT registrations exceeded de-registrations in the UK (and in all regions) between 2001 and 2005. The stock of VAT registered businesses rose by 4 per cent. during the period.</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.5/69">VAT registrations do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which was &pound;60,000 at the start of 2006. Similarly, businesses that de-register may not have closed. Only 1.9 million out of 4.5 million UK enterprises (41 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.5/70">Although data on the number of VAT de-registrations are routinely collected and monitored, there is currently no general information on the impact of business closures at regional and national level. However a study commissioned for the London Development Agency in 2005<sup>(l)</sup> showed that out of the 790,000 jobs lost through SMEs closing down in London between 2001 and 2003, 88 per cent. found immediate employment elsewhere, 8 per cent. went in self-employment and 1 per cent. into training. Only 3 per cent. went into unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="c.498W.5/71">At appropriate levels, business closures are a necessary part of the productive churn process, creating space for more productive and innovative firms to expand, and therefore an important step in boosting regional and national productivity. Data on closures, including data at a regional level, are routinely collected and monitored.</p>

Milestone 1, relating to production of detailed plans and designs by the contractor, was achieved in March 2007, six months later than originally planned. This was largely due to the need to ensure the contractor's basis for project implementation was robust, and had the support of the Fire and Rescue Service. Sign off of Milestones 2-4, which relate to the installation of the network infrastructure is currently being withheld to ensure that the contractor's proposed schedule for implementation is realistic. There are no other overdue Milestones at present. The overall target date for completion of Firelink with voice functionality is 2009, and this remains unchanged since contract signature; and as each brigade migrates to their regional control centre they will obtain full functionality including data transmission.</p>

	<p pid="c.509W.2/1">The Integrated Clothing Project operates under the principles of the Prince2 project management method and is subject to Gateway reviews by the 4ps (Public Private Partnerships Programme) who are the local government procurement experts. Firebuy Ltd. works with the Chief Fire Officers Association, as the professional voice of the Fire and Rescue Service, in the setting of national technical specifications. The testing methodology utilised by Firebuy Limited, for Personal Protective Equipment, has become the benchmark process and is now contained within European Standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.509W.2/2">There have been recent <i> (a)</i> discussions and <i> (b)</i> representation from both (i) Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) and (ii) suppliers to the industry on when the Integrated Clothing Project will be let as this kit is required urgently by some FRAs. It is too soon to comment on the (A) procedures and practices, (B) conclusions and (C) overall performance against objectives as the project has just completed the Stage 3 Gateway Review, which looked at the investment decision.</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.5/1">Decisions on the level of council tax are a matter for individual authorities. To date the Government has made available a significant package of over 46 million to support areas affected by the flooding of June and July 2007. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.5/2" class="indent">&pound;17,390,000 in Flood Recovery Grant released to local authorities affected by the floods to support their work in helping those in greatest and most immediate need.</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.5/4" class="indent">An initial &pound;3 million for local authorities to repair damage to the local highway</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.5/5" class="indent">Over &pound;11 million from Regional Development Agencies for businesses affected in their regions</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.5/6" class="indent">&pound;1 million for use by Jobcentre Plus to support additional demand for Social Fund Community Care Grants</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.5/7" class="indent">&pound;1 million to support rural tourism in England through promoting rural destinations and visitor attractions and a targeted marketing campaign.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.5/8">This is additional money to that available under the Bellwin scheme which provides emergency financial assistance from Government to local authorities, to help meet the uninsurable costs of immediate action to safeguard life or property or prevent severe inconvenience to inhabitants in the case of an emergency or disaster. In recognition of the exceptional nature of the recent flooding we have made it easier for local authorities to claim back additional costs from Government through the Bellwin scheme by significantly extending the period for which authorities can claim and increasing the proportion of costs they can receive in support grants to 100 per cent. above threshold.</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.8/1">Yes. In keeping with the established principals of the Bellwin scheme we take the view&mdash;as have previous Administrations&mdash;that it is reasonable to expect authorities to cover costs themselves up to a certain level. Every authority is required to maintain reserves, one of whose main purposes is to meet unexpected costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.8/2">The threshold above which an authority is eligible to claim Bellwin funding is 0.2 per cent. of its annual budget and is only applied once in the financial year. Therefore, if an authority exceeded its threshold in June and was hit by floods again in July it would not be required to spend up to the threshold in July before qualifying for grant. For the recent flooding, expenditure above the threshold will be eligible for 100 per cent. assistance from Government, and the Bellwin scheme announced for the recent flooding was, alongside that for the floods in 2000, the most generous ever announced.</p>

	<p pid="c.514W.2/2">The thematic paper identified an increase in private investor activity within pathfinder areas since the implementation of the housing market renewal strategy. The emergence of this group of investors has had the impact of diversifying the structure of ownership within pathfinder areas. Commitment to the area has remained strong with the Association of residential Letting Agents (ARLA) reporting in 2004 that nearly two-thirds of respondents expected to hold their stock for at least 10 years and less than 10 per cent. would sell if house prices were to fall.</p>

These representations were considered and amendments to those sections are proposed in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill.

It is clear from RPA's advice that trying to make early payments now would undermine efforts to that end and introduce unacceptable disallowance risks, particularly as there is no EU legal basis for SPS 2007 partial payments. With this in mind, Ministers have agreed that RPA should instead work towards making more full payments to farmers earlier than last year but not set any arbitrary deadlines for the start of payments.</p>

	<p pid="c.525W.0/1">The control of dredging operations depends upon the type of dredging involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.0/2">Port and harbour authorities generally have provisions under their local powers (granted by means of Harbour Orders) within their jurisdiction to carry out or to license others to conduct dredging activities&mdash;primarily for the purpose of securing or maintaining a safe navigation depth. Other dredging operations which may cause or be likely to result in obstruction or danger to navigation require consent under the Coast Protection Act 1949 (part II). Any disposal or beneficial placement of dredged arisings at sea is subject to licence control under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (part II). In certain cases, dredging activity may also require consent under the Land Drainage Act 1991.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.0/3">Regulatory authorities, in dealing with such applications to dredge, have a duty to consider if the proposed project, because of its nature, size and location will have a significant environmental effect. If so, the application must be accompanied by an Environmental Statement and its determination will be subject to an environmental impact assessment&mdash;normally in accordance with the Marine Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2007. Environmental Statements are scoped to address all the aspects of the project which may be affected by the project, including, typically in the case of dredging:</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.0/4" class="indent">i. impacts on the physical environment, including coastal and estuary morphology, hydrodynamics, sediment transport, water quality and the fate of disposed materials</p>

	<p pid="c.525W.0/7" class="indent">iv. impacts on birds&mdash;especially to those dependant on inter-tidal areas and disturbance to marine mammals</p>

	<p pid="c.525W.0/9" class="indent">vi. the in-combination and cumulative effects of other works.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.0/10">Many potential dredging areas also lie within or adjacent to the boundaries of designated European conservation sites. If the regulating authority consider that the dredging project is likely to have a significant impact on such a site, an appropriate assessment of the possible risk to the integrity of that site must be carried out in compliance with the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c) Regulations 1994.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.0/11">The commercial exploitation of sand and gravel (aggregate dredging) is regulated under the Environmental Impact Assessment and Natural Habitats (Extraction of Minerals by Marine Dredging) Regulations 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.526W.8/1">Most cross-year swaps between the UK and other member states are not agreed until the end of the current year or the start of the following one. They are usually completed to settle small overfishes by the UK or other member states. These swaps can allow extra fishing opportunities to be found for UK fishermen including the inshore sector. Additional quota for several valuable species was obtained by this means for 2007, and we will look to do the same in 2007-08. At the moment, only one cross-year swap has been finalised which has gained Channel cod in 2007 for the inshore sector by which, as part of a package, eight tonnes of VII anglerfish in 2008 has been given up.</p>

Until then, there was no indication that there was a risk of effluent escaping from the drainage system, although it was recognised that the system was old and some concerns were brought to DEFRA's attention over the possibility of water leaking into the drains via the manhole covers.</p>
	<p pid="c.528W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-17">17 August 2007</phrase>, the HSE informed DEFRA Ministers that leaks could have occurred from the system and DEFRA immediately contacted the Institute for Animal Health (IAH). That afternoon, IAH put into effect a plan controlling access and strengthening biosecurity measures around the movement of people and vehicles. Work also began immediately on restoring the integrity of the drains and manholes concerned. Further inspections of the site have shown that the work had been completed quickly and to a high standard.</p>

	<p pid="c.530W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the reasons are for the time taken to produce the Child Support Agency's Annual Report for 2007; and if he will make a statement.</p>

	<p pid="c.530W.2/7" class="indent">National Audit Office (NAO) decided before summer recess that they needed to undertake further work on the Child Support Agency's Client Funds Account. This has resulted in a delay in these accounts being finalised. As a result, the Agency was not in a position to lay the Annual Report and Accounts for 2006/07 in the House of Commons, or publish them before recess as planned.</p>
	<p pid="c.530W.2/8" class="indent">The Agency's Administration Account was finalised with an unqualified audit opinion before recess. This ensured that the Department's resource accounts could be finalised and published.</p>
	<p pid="c.530W.2/9" class="indent">The Agency has continued to work with NAO over the summer. They have now concluded their work, which has allowed the Agency to complete the Client Funds Account. The NAO have prepared a draft report for inclusion in the Agency's Annual Report which is currently under consideration. Once the NAO Report has been finalised the Agency will arrange for the Annual Report and Accounts for 2006/07 to be laid in the House of Commons and for their subsequent publication. I am afraid I am unable to give a definitive date for publication at this stage.</p>

Although a great deal of work has already been carried out to improve the stability of the new computer system and operational performance has improved, the Agency plans to make a major IT upgrade within the second year of the OIP, which ends in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.2/6" class="indent">This upgrade will primarily provide system support for the Agency's new operating model, which introduced client lifecycle segmentation, enabling the Agency to better target its resources to make more difference for more children. The Agency has also developed a new training programme, which will better support its people to make the best use of the improving IT system. This programme will ensure that training can be delivered where and when it is required.</p>

	<p pid="c.533W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the energy industry, and the voluntary sector to tackle fuel poverty in the UK. Warm Front grants, benefit entitlement checks and the reduction of VAT on fuel has helped many customers not only have an increase in benefit, but also more energy efficient homes which result in lower fuel bills.</p>
	<p pid="c.533W.3/2">The Department is responsible for the winter fuel payment which pays most households &pound;200 where someone is over 60, and &pound;300 if the household includes someone aged 80 or over. In addition, Pension credit is playing a major roll in delivering substantial increases in income to pensioners with only modest savings or occupational pensions. The Pension Service Local Service carry out a benefit check as part of their interviews and refer customers to Warm Front if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.533W.3/3">The Department is also assisting in the reduction in fuel poverty through its work in tackling child poverty. By promoting the Government aim to provide employment opportunities for all, with work for those that can and support for those who cannot, Jobcentre Plus has assisted in the significant reduction of children in low-income households.</p>

	<p pid="c.534W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the right hon. Gentleman with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about whether an investigation was conducted into the performance of Jobcentre Plus districts against their Job Outcome Target (JOT) profiles. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus maintains a close watch on all of its targets and is acutely aware of the importance of JOT as a measure of its performance in helping customers move into work. Jobcentre Plus has made significant efforts to improve its understanding of how to manage JOT and has taken a number of steps to address the shortfall in performance both at national and district levels. It may be helpful if I explain some of these initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/5" class="indent">Together with DWP, Jobcentre Plus developed Key Management Indicators (KMIs) to help ensure that staff deliver required work focused interviews for our key customer groups at the right time. These KMIs were subsequently reviewed and, for 2007-08, developed into a new Interventions Delivery Target (IDT) to give an even sharper focus to the timely delivery of work-focused support. In addition, an adviser achievement tool was developed to help ensure interventions were the right quality and properly targeted, with appropriate job submissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/6" class="indent">Recent research published on the national evaluation of JOT<sup>(1)</sup> concluded that, JOT is largely working as intended. In particular, JOT was seen as supporting the trend of encouraging the use of self help channels among customers who were closer to the labour market, and therefore enabling resources to be concentrated more intensively on providing assistance to 'harder to help' groups. JOT was also viewed as influencing more efficient working practices (for example through more effective use of the Adviser Discretionary Fund), an increased willingness of staff to refer customers to provision and improved team working. This research did not specifically look at performance against JOT profiles.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.2/7" class="indent">Other performance management actions include establishing a standing JOT Key Performance Group, chaired by a senior operational Director, to review and direct performance management activities. More recently, steps are being taken to develop Local Employment Partnerships (LEPs), expand the use of work trials, and further up-skill advisers and managers in managing JOT performance.</p>

Consequently such estimates should be treated cautiously.</p>

	<p pid="c.552W.0/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is responsible for food supplements issues and for negotiations relating to the European Commission (EC) Food Supplements Directive. No recent meetings have been held between Health Ministers and the European Commissioner concerning setting maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements under this directive. Meetings will be held with stakeholders in early 2008 to discuss this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/2">The bilateral meeting between the FSA and the EC on <phrase class="date" code="">12 September</phrase> was held principally to gain insight into the Commission's intentions as regards the process by which maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements would be set. The Commission indicated that an orientation paper on setting maximum and minimum levels which it had issued in late July would be the starting point for discussions at working group level, which began on <phrase class="date" code="">24 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/3">The aim of the first working group meeting of <phrase class="date" code="">24 September</phrase> was for the Commission to obtain member states' initial views on the orientation paper. We have been advised by the FSA that general discussions on the orientation paper in the working group revealed that many member states are yet to establish views on many issues. The Commission has asked member states to consider some of the issues presented in the orientation paper in preparation for more detailed discussions at the next working group meeting which has provisionally been scheduled for November and will be attended by FSA officials. We have been informed by the FSA that the Commission intends to produce draft amending legislation with respect to permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements by January 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/4">We have been advised by the FSA that their officials met with their counterparts from the Republic of Ireland and other member states during, and in the margins of, the working group meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">24 September</phrase>. The next working group meeting will provide further opportunity for bilateral discussions. The FSA currently has no additional meetings arranged to meet their counterparts in other member states outside working group meetings.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/5">The Government consider that the approach to regulation of food supplements should be safety-based and that consumers should have the right to make an informed choice unless their safety is compromised. Good progress has been made in promoting work carried out in the United Kingdom in establishing upper levels for vitamins and minerals and reference has been made to this in the Commission's orientation paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/6">We have been advised that the FSA is continuing its work on determining the potential economic impact of setting maximum levels to support future negotiations. In the absence of proposals from the Commission, a range of possible options is being considered. Until proposals are received and this work completed, the impact on small and medium sized enterprises of setting levels is unknown. We cannot, therefore, comment on the matter of compensation.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/7">There are no plans for Health Ministers to visit a specialist health food retailer to discuss the possible impact of setting of maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/8">The FSA wrote to the Governments of Jersey and Guernsey on <phrase class="date" code="">10 September</phrase> concerning the trade in food supplements between these respective Crown Dependencies and the UK and suggested a collective meeting with representatives of these governments. Copies of the letter sent by the FSA to the Bailiwick of Jersey have been placed in the Library. The release of the letter sent by the FSA to the Bailiwick of Guernsey is currently under consideration by the FSA under Section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 which precludes copies being placed in the Library at this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.0/9">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) believes that herbal remedies from the Channel Islands are subject to the Traditional Herbal Medicines Directive 2004/24/EC. The MHRA has already begun discussions about this with the Government of Guernsey and wrote to the Government of Jersey to open discussions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June 2007</phrase>. Copies of the MHRA's recent letters to the Bailiwick of Guernsey and letter to the Bailiwick of Jersey have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.554W.5/1">Funding of most primary medical care practices is largely dependent on the number and characteristics of the patients registered with that provider. In addition, quality and enhanced service payments are also usually based on delivery of care to the patients registered with that practice. Therefore, any system of dual or multiple registrations would fund more than one provider to deliver care and services to the same patient&mdash;doubling the costs, while at the same time complicating the care management and co-ordination of care to such patients. This would have consequences for the continuity of patient care and ensuring a single comprehensive and up to date patient record. There would also be complicating factors in determining allocation of resources for the provision of hospital and community health services to primary care trusts should patients be registered with different practices in different primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/2">Following the publication of Lord Darzi's &quot;Our NHS our future&quot; interim report for the NHS next stage review, the Department is currently considering what other new models might enable patients to switch GPs more easily and register with GPs outside where they live.</p>

Undertaking deep-clean is just one of a number of approaches trusts may take in tackling healthcare associated infections, and isolating the contribution of any one approach to assess its effectiveness would require activity in all others to cease.</p>

The level of administrative fine will be based on the Ministry of Justice's standard scales, and any income will go to the Consolidated Fund. But, we do not intend to take large sums of money away from front-line health services.

	<p pid="c.569W.2/1">Patient Safety Direct is an opportunity to make it easier for front-line staff to report patient safety incidents. Currently the main line of reporting incidents is though the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) reporting and learning system. Patient Safety Direct will strengthen this reporting line by adding a new and more accessible portal for national health service staff and ultimately patients to use. The NPSA is scoping the work with all the various organisations which need to be involved. Plans will be developed in phase two of Lord Darzi's NHS Next Stage Review and, following piloting, we expect to move to implementation by the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.576W.8/1">Since completion of the single market in 1993, persons travelling between EU member states have been able to bring with them unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco, provided that the product is bought duty paid in the member state of purchase, is for their personal use, and is transported by them. HM Revenue and Customs (formerly HM Customs and Excise) publishes guidance on this in Public Notice 1 &quot;A Customs Guide for Travellers Entering the UK&quot;, copies of which are available at all UK ports and airports, on the HMRC website, or by calling the HMRC National Advice Service. It is also contained in the Customs Allowances posters displayed at all UK ports and airports.</p>
	<p pid="c.576W.8/2">Exceptions to these arrangements were agreed at EU level in 2004 and 2007 as part of transitional arrangements for countries joining the EU at those times. Existing member states were given the option to apply certain quantitative restrictions on personal importations of tobacco from accession countries for as long as those countries' excise duty rates were below minimum EU levels. The UK applies these restrictions, which are identical to those applicable to travellers from non-EU countries, and has publicised this fact widely by amendments to the aforementioned guidance and publicity materials. Additionally, posters were placed in major airports of the accession countries concerned, and adverts were placed in a number of in-flight magazines.</p>
	<p pid="c.576W.8/3">Once the duty rates of the accession countries rise to minimum EU levels, the UK has committed to disapply these restrictions, and has already done so in the case of certain categories of tobacco products from two accession countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.577W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles employment statistics for local areas from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.

	<p pid="c.577W.2/5" class="indent">For unitary and local authorities, the ONS produces estimates of total unemployment, following ILO definitions, from a statistical model. Annual estimates for other areas are compiled from the annual local area LFS and the APS following ILO definitions.</p>

The table also shows the numbers unemployed and the unemployment rates for the two areas for the same periods.</p>
	<p pid="c.577W.2/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.

Table 2, attached, shows the average numbers of young and adult males and females resident in the Glasgow East constituency, claiming JSA between April 2006 and March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.583W.5/8" class="indent">Table 2 also shows the numbers of young and adult males and females claiming JSA in September 2007 (the latest period for which data are available). For JSA claimants, youth is defined as those aged 18 to 24, and adult refers to those aged 25 or more.</p>

	<p pid="c.587W.5/1">The UK has so far made one claim to the UN Commission on the limits of the continental shelf (CLCS) for the extension of the continental shelf under Article 76 of the UN convention of the law of the sea. We are also considering lodging up to four more claims before the right to do so expires in May 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.587W.8/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported an increase in poppy cultivation in Burma of 29 per cent. in 2007, from 21,500 hectares to 27,700 hectares. This follows six years of decrease. Cultivation is concentrated in South Shan State, which accounts for 90 per cent. of opium grown in Burma. Most of the poppy-growing areas are outside government control.</p>
	<p pid="c.587W.8/2">The UK has not made any assessment on the impact on peace and security in the region. However, UNODC assess that where drug-growing areas and insecurity overlap, the activity of criminal groups can add to instability by trying to control poppy farming and using drugs to fund their operations. The need for sustained alternative development programmes for the poor communities to help them turn to a legal income is therefore essential to ensure that cultivation in Burma is reduced.</p>
