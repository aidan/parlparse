Since the Budget, my Department has met representatives from Sport England, the Central Council of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association on a number of occasions to discuss these issues. I will continue to work with these organisations and with governing bodies to agree the best way forward for helping these clubs.</p>

	<p pid=".887W.5/1">I announced new arrangements for support for tourism in the English regions on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-13">13 May</phrase>. Since then I have agreed with the Regional Development Agencies that they are ready to implement this, corporate planning guidance has been issued about how the RDAs should plan for the new tourism responsibilities and further planning work is in hand.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/2">I also proposed changes for the English Tourism Council and to improve the co-ordination of marketing activity for England. I have decided to achieve this by a radical reform of the existing support structures, and there are two aspects to the announcement that I make today.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/3">The first will result in a strengthening of the marketing of Britain in overseas tourism markets. This will be of direct benefit not only to England but also to Scotland and Wales. I had already asked the new Chief Executive of the British Tourism Authority, Tom Wright, to carry out a fundamental review of strategy and structure of support for British tourism overseas. The emerging conclusions point to increasing effectiveness with a structure based on dedicated new hubs for each major market and less emphasis on central services. More resource will be concentrated where it is needed most, that is in the overseas markets served by the BTA. I will also improve the accountability arrangements for BTA in co-operation with other GB Tourism Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/4">The second aspect of my announcement concerns the need for better co-ordination of the marketing of England as a tourism destination in the GB market. We wish to combine some of the day-to-day operations of the English Tourism Council with the BTA. These two organisations have served tourism well, but combining their resources and strengths allows us to develop more quickly the marketing team for England we need. This will also enable us to put more resource into direct support for tourism and less into overheads. We will take this opportunity to develop more effective partnerships with private industry investors to support tourism. We will pursue our commitment to the sustainable development of tourism, particularly in rural areas, some of which are still in recovery following the foot-and-mouth outbreak.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/5">Accordingly, I am today asking Tom Wright to broaden the BTA reform programme and to draw up detailed plans for a further unit to lead and co-ordinate the marketing of England, promoting destinations to customers within our own country. Funding for this activity, and other activities of the relaunched national organisation in support of English tourism, will be accounted for and reported to Parliament separately from action in overseas markets on behalf of all three parts of Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/6">In England, I see a major leadership role for both the private sector and the Regional Development Agencies in developing a coherent marketing agenda across the industry. The new marketing team for English tourism within the relaunched national organisation will be guided by a slimmed down English Tourist Board, drawing on support from the private sector and regional and local government. The broad remit for its work has been drawn up by a group drawn from the private and public sectors, which was fully endorsed at a meeting I chaired of a wide range of tourism bodies at the beginning of August. The team will have responsibility for working closely with RDA and other partners to make the most of the public funds available to support marketing and promotion.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/7">I have asked Alan Britten and David Quarmby, the chairs of the existing boards, to work closely together to ensure the new arrangements are implemented quickly and effectively. Staff from both organisations will be treated on an equal and fair basis, taking full account of their own skills and experience and the requirements of the new arrangements. I have asked them to make recommendations about the new name when they have made further progress on the reforms.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.5/8">I am also announcing additional funding for tourism services in England. #10 million over three years is available, but will only be released on the effective implementation of reform, on industry rising to the challenge by coming together with matching funds, and the delivery of increased productivity we are looking for in the tourism industry.</p>

	<p pid=".889W.3/1">In keeping with long-standing medical practice, immunisation against anthrax for the Armed Forces and other Ministry of Defence personnel is voluntary and on the basis of informed consent.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.3/2">Up to and including September 2002, the period for which most recent figures are available, approximately 46 per cent. of personnel offered immunisation against anthrax had accepted. Broken down by the categories requested this equates to <i>(a)</i> Royal Navy 28 per cent. (<i>b)</i> Army 78 per cent. <i>(c)</i> Royal Air Force 46 per cent. and <i>(d)</i> other Ministry of Defence Personnel 61 per cent. Thus far, immunisation against anthrax has been targeted at a small number of personnel in the most readily deployable units. As approximate proportions of their total strengths, excluding reserves, this equates to <i>(a)</i> Royal Navy, 0.7 per cent. <i>(b)</i> Army 0.4 per cent.; <i>(c)</i> Royal Air Force, 4.5 per cent.; and <i>(d)</i> other Ministry of Defence personnel 0.2 per cent.. Information concerning individuals' current anthrax immunisation status is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".889W.3/3">Earlier this year we announced a decision to expand the programme so that all service personnel, including reserves, and those essential civilians who are likely to deploy on operations are routinely offered immunisation against anthrax. We plan to expand the programme gradually over the next few years, beginning with those units that are held at the highest readiness. I refer the hon. Member to the answer my hon.

	<p pid=".890W.2/2">Exports of arms and other goods controlled for strategic reasons are subject to export licences issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. All individual licence applications are assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Exporting Licensing Criteria. Criterion 1A of the consolidated criteria makes clear that the Government will not issue a licence if approval would be inconsistent with the UK's international obligations and its commitments to enforce UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes, as well as national embargoes observed by the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.2/3">The Government focus their efforts on assessment of potential end-use at the export licensing stage. This includes checks made by our posts overseas where necessary. Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way of preventing arms from falling into the wrong hands. In addition the Government remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring of exports in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable. Our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on allegations of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment. We take these reports into account in our assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.2/4">Officials from across Whitehall co-operate to pursue possible breaches of sanctions in the UK and abroad. Breaches involving the sale of UK arms and components sold abroad are thoroughly investigated by the relevant authorities.</p>

The need to call-out reservists is kept under review as part of contingency planning. If reservists are called out, we would select the most suitably qualified individuals for mobilisation by taking into account their relevant skills, fitness and training, and their professional and domestic circumstances. The Ministry of Defence would work closely with the NHS Trusts concerned to minimise disruption as far as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".894W.2/1">The EU is committed to the fullest possible involvement of the non-EU European Allies and the EU accession partners in the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). A supplement to the Helsinki Force Catalogue has been drawn up, detailing offers of contributions made by these states with a view to their participation in EU-led operations. The Nice European Council agreed at substantial set of provisions governing consultation with these countries and arrangements for their participation in EU-led operations. As a result, they now attend regular ESDP meetings at a number of levels. In the event of a crisis, this dialogue and consultation will be intensified. In particular, it was confirmed at Nice that Xupon a decision by the Council to launch an operation, the non-EU European NATO members will participate if they so wish in the event of an operation requiring recourse to NATO assets and capabilities. They will, on a decision by the Council, be invited to take part in operations where the EU does not use NATO assets. Other countries who are candidates for accession to the EU may also be invited by the Council to take part in EU-led operations once the Council has decided to launch such an operation&quot;. More detailed modalities concerning non-EU European NATO members were agreed at the European Council in Brussels last weekend. <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-31">Thursday 31 October 2002</phrase>PQ Ref No 5558M</p>

	<p pid=".901W.2/2">The Government do take the issue of fireworks seriously. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-14">14 October 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-10-14.890W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 890W</phrase>, my hon. Friend the Minister for Consumer Affairs announced a package of measures which the Government are introducing to address the problems that fireworks can pose to humans, to the environment and to wildlife.</p>
	<p pid=".901W.2/3">In terms of air pollution, a burning firework may produce particulate matter, organic compounds (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans), and a variety of metal fumes and aerosols, depending on its contents. The effects of bonfire night celebrations can certainly be detected in local air quality, but is very dependent on local atmospheric conditions at the time, and the most significant source of emissions is likely to be bonfires rather than fireworks.</p>
	<p pid=".901W.2/4">In relation to wildlife, there is little research evidence on the immediate effects of bonfire night on wildlife. Fires and loud noises can have a disturbing effect on animals of any kind, but bonfire night celebrations are short-lived and relatively localised in nature.</p>

	<p pid=".902W.3/1">In my Parliamentary Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase> on sustainable communities I announced the Government's intentions for tackling the housing shortage in London and the South East. The Statement explained that the Government expects the housing numbers already agreed in regional planning guidance for the South East to be delivered, working within the presumption of making better use of land by improving design, increasing densities and using brownfield sites to the full. In the Statement, I announced I would intervene in planning applications for housing that involve a density of less than 30 dwellings per hectare net. 1 am publishing today the Town and Country Planning (Residential Density) (London and South East England) Direction 2002 which gives effect to this announcement. From <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase> local planning authorities in London and the South East will have to consult me before giving planning permission for low density housing developments.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.6/1">Mobile phone mast development close to residential properties, schools and hospitals is subject to the normal telecommunications planning arrangements in place throughout England, set out in Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO). Following publication of the Stewart report on mobile phones and health in May 2000, these arrangements were significantly strengthened and include improved requirements for consulting local people about mast proposals. The changes to the GPDO were underpinned by revised guidance, set out in planning policy guidance note 8, telecommunications, published in August 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".903W.6/2">The Stewart report did not recommend that the erection of mobile phone masts should be restricted in such areas and we have no plans to introduce specific restrictions. However, in respect of masts near schools, PPG8 advises that before an operator submits an application for planning permission or prior approval for a mast near a school or college they should discuss the proposed development with the relevant body of the school or college.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.8/1">My right hon. Friend will tomorrow lay before Parliament five statutory instruments to improve the handling of planning enforcement appeals under each of the three main procedures: written representations, hearings and inquiries. These are the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement Notices and Appeals) (England) Regulations 2002; the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement Appeals) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2002; the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2002; the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002; and the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/2">A departmental circular (ODPM 02&ndash;2002), XEnforcement Appeals: Procedures&quot;, which explains the new procedures, is to be issued to accompany the new statutory instruments. Copies are to be placed in the House Libraries. The changes implement the conclusions of a consultation exercise announced in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/3">The new arrangements, due to come into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-23">23 December 2002</phrase>, implement the Government's commitment to improve the Planning Inspectorate's service to its customers, and to increase the efficiency of the enforcement appeals process by reducing both the cost and time taken. In introducing these changes, the Government recognise that it is vital to maintain a system which ensures that there is fair and open decision-making and that all parties have the opportunity to put their case, resulting in decisions that are legally sound and of the highest possible quality.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.8/4">We have already set tough targets for the Planning Inspectorate to turn round enforcement appeals more quickly, and they have made a good deal of progress in improving their own performance. However, improving service to the benefit of all concerned is not just the responsibility of the Planning Inspectorate. All parties to the enforcement appeal process have a responsibility to meet the deadlines set and to co- operate with the inspectorate in agreeing dates offered for hearings and inquiries. The new procedures will put in place a regime of discipline for all parties involved in the process by setting clear timetables and deadlines for the various stages. In future, representations sent after due dates will normally be disregarded. We intend to monitor the impact of the changes, and will review their effectiveness to help us decide whether any further action is needed.</p>

	<p pid=".908W.0/1">The auditor's investigation leading to his decision in 1996 that six individuals had caused a loss, through wilful misconduct, of some 31million to Westminster City Council, and to issue surcharge certificates against those individuals, cost approximately 3 million. Those costs were met by Westminster City Council.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.0/2">The auditor's costs in the subsequent litigation (during which the Divisional Court set aside the auditor's surcharge in respect of four of the six individuals) leading to the decision of the House of Lords in December 2001, to uphold the surcharge against Dame Shirley Porter and David Weeks, were met by the Audit Commission. The total of the auditor's litigation costs to this point was around 4.5million. Westminster City Council is currently taking legal action to recover the amount of the surcharge and costs. The final costs of the investigation and litigation will not be known until the outcome of those proceedings.</p>

Grade boundary ranges for each subject, including mathematics, are established making reference to candidates' work from the previous year, grade descriptions, past papers and statistical data. Each boundary is set by individual awarding bodies using both professional judgement and key statistical evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.3/1">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase>. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Development also attended.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/2">The Council considered three proposals on food safety, covering the monitoring and control of zoonoses and genetically modified food and feed. Some clarification of positions emerged but it was not possible to reach agreement on this occasion. Further work will be undertaken by officials before Ministers reconsider these dossiers.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/3">The Council assessed the agricultural priorities flowing from the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and agreed conclusions accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/4">The Council continued its consideration of the mid-term review of the CAP with a discussion concentrating on the proposals concerning rural development, farm audits and three commodity sectors: nuts, rice and milk. My hon. Friend was supported by a number of other Member States in stressing the importance of a shift from production-linked support under the CAP to rural development programmes and he recalled the importance of a fair distribution of funds between Member States. On the commodity proposals, he opposed the introduction of new market measures for nuts and supported the Commission's proposals on rice which would complement improved access to the EU market for third countries. On milk, he reiterated UK support for action that would eventually enable milk quotas to be phased out, and indicated that we would be prepared to consider favourably the possible acceleration of certain measures agreed in the Agenda 2000 package.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/5">Ministers also discussed the agricultural aspects of the WTO round negotiations. My hon Friend strongly supported Commissioner Fischler in emphasising the importance of CAP reform in general and decoupling in particular if the EU is to participate constructively in the round.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/6">Under other business, the Commission dealt with enquiries about olive oil promotion, aid to Greek cotton producers and negotiations with third countries over grain imports.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/7">On fisheries, the Council held a further debate on the Commission's proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, this time covering access to waters and resources, enforcement, and the Commission's proposals for Regional Advisory Councils: the presidency noted the various views expressed and reiterated that its aim is to conclude this dossier at the December Agriculture and Fisheries Council.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/8">The Council also debated the Commission's proposal for a cod and hake recovery plan based on limitations on days at sea, which was originally submitted to the Council in December 2001. There was a divergence of view on the desirability of a plan, with one significant group of member states, including the UK, supportive of the need to act, and another group markedly less so. For the UK, my hon. Friend recognised the seriousness of the state of the stocks and emphasised that all possible approaches, including days at sea, warranted consideration. He stressed also that it would be important, when determining what measures to adopt, to recognise the varying structures and circumstances of national fleets.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/9">Commissioner Fischler gave a first presentation to the Council on his proposed action plan for Mediterranean fisheries. The Council will discuss this substantively at a later date.</p>

	<p pid=".917W.8/1">I welcome the European Commission's proposals for reform of the CAP which are a good basis for discussion. The Government supports the proposed shift in support from production-linked payments to wider agri-environment and rural development measures as well as the proposal to remove the link between production and support. In a number of key areas we would have liked the proposals to go further, notably by offering real budgetary savings and firm proposals for reform of the dairy regime. We will need to ensure that the reforms offer a fair deal for UK producers.</p>

	<p pid=".920W.5/1">The Government take very seriously the possibility of the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans as a result of the use of antibiotics in animals. They are satisfied that the four remaining antibiotic growth promoters are not related to any therapeutic antibiotics currently used in human or veterinary medicine but will keep the issue under review. Government policy will continue to be informed by the advice of their specialist committees.</p>
	<p pid=".920W.5/2">There is currently a proposal before the European Commission for a regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition. The proposal aims to rationalise existing measures and introduce new controls. One of the effects will be to withdraw the use of antibiotic growth promoters by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2005</phrase>. The intended withdrawal is based on a precautionary approach taking into account the impact that antimicrobial-resistant microbes can have on human health. This time scale includes a phasing out period, allowing time for the development of new husbandry methods and for industry to develop alternative products.</p>

	<p pid=".923W.2/1">In March 2001 during the foot and mouth outbreak, the proposal to ban swill feeding was the subject of a full public consultation and Regulatory Impact Assessment. We received over 350 responses to the consultation letter. Subsequently, Minister's have received 51 letters and 33 questions from MPs with regards to the ban on swill feeding. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-20">20 November 2001</phrase> I met with representatives of the Associated Swill Users.</p>
	<p pid=".923W.2/2">Before the ban on swill-feeding, only a small proportion of catering waste from restaurants and other catering establishments was fed to pigs as swill. The vast majority was already disposed of to landfill or incineration. As the additional waste was going to landfill under the same conditions as before, no specific assessment was made as to the environmental and animal health impacts from the use of landfill to dispose of material that would otherwise have been fed to pigs.</p>

General revenue grant to local authorities is up by an average of 3.9 per cent a year after inflation. The Government's general revenue provision for most aspects of public space, including provision for street cleaners, is allocated via the Environment, Protective and Cultural Services grant block, which is up 1.3 per cent. after inflation.A litter abatement order may be applied for if a local authority does not carry out its statutory duty to keep its land free of litter and debris, so far is practicable. This is done through the Magistrates' Court. If successful in obtaining the order it means that the offending authority must clean the area.</p>

	<p pid=".925W.5/1">The Government are committed to improving standards of environmental protection in agriculture, and are pressing for a shift in Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) expenditure from production-linked payments towards rural development and agri-environment measures.</p>
	<p pid=".925W.5/2">In 2001, the Government introduced modulation, re-directing a proportion of CAP payments into schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Scheme and Environmentally Sensitive Areas, both of which aim to safeguard and enhance wildlife habitats.</p>
	<p pid=".925W.5/3">These schemes form part of the England Rural Development Programme, under which #1.6 billion will be invested in the countryside between 2000 and 2006, including #1 billion on agri-environment measures. The Government have committed an additional #75 million to introduce a new entry-level agri-environment scheme in 2005, following successful pilots. This scheme will be available to as many farms as possible.</p>

I condemn all attacks on press freedom, and call upon the Turkish Cypriot authorities to ensure full respect for the right to freedom of expression of Shener Levent and all Turkish Cypriots. I made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-04">4 September</phrase> and the British Government made official representations when Shener Levent and Memduh Ener were imprisoned in August.

We used our Presidency of the Security Council in July to host an open debate on conflict, peacekeeping and gender.

This will involve close partnership working with a number of local agencies including police and emergency services, local authorities, the national health service and voluntary sector, railway authorities and coroners.

The modernising hearing aid services project is being extended so that by the end of this financial year there will be 50 sites involved, with at least a further 15 equipped to supply digital hearing aids from next April. A new, more streamlined patient process will be introduced at these second wave sites from the outset and at first wave sites over the next few months. In addition we are in the middle of a pilot which is looking at the role the private sector can play in reducing waiting times for supply of digital hearing aids.

All of these responses have been placed in the Library, with the exception of those respondents who indicated they did not wish their responses to be published.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.3/2">We also received representations fromthe Refugee Council following our announcement to end the concession.</p>
	<p pid=".942W.3/3">We did not consult directly with other organisations immediately prior to announcing abolition of the concession. Improved timeliness of initial decisions by the Immigration Nationality Directorate had made the concession largely irrelevant in practice so wider consultation would have added no real value.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.6/1">The Government believe that the key to improving public perception of crime and criminal justice is to continue to deliver reductions in crime and improvements in the way the criminal justice system operates.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.6/2">The recently published White Paper, Justice for All, set out what needs to be done to modernise and improve the Criminal Justice System (CJS). The Home Office has been set targets for reducing crime and the fear of crime, improving the delivery of justice and increasing confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.6/3">The Government are committed to improving the prevention and detection of crime, convicting the guilty and rehabilitating offenders so they do not offend again. Reform will also ensure that justice is seen to serve and protect the interests of the community, and especially victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.6/4">The presentation of statistical information about crime has been made clearer and more comprehensive by combining publication of recorded crime statistics and information from the British Crime Survey. An objective in all our communication activity is to work with our partners to close the gap between the public perception that crime is rising against the reality of long term falls in crime. The media make an important contribution to public perceptions of crime, and efforts are being made to encourage responsible reporting of crime. We are also exploring alternative ways to provide accurate information about crime to the public.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.6/5">The Government have made a commitment to increase the number of crimes that result in the perpetrator being brought to justice, an initiative called 'Narrowing the Justice Gap'. A co-ordinated strategy based on: tackling weaknesses in the criminal justice process; targeting types of offender, particularly persistent offenders; and targeting specific types of offence, aims to bring 1.2 million offences to justice by 2005&ndash;06. Narrowing the justice gap not only reduces crime but also demonstrates that the criminal justice system is effective and responsive to the needs and concerns of victims and witnesses. The perception that criminals are Xgetting away with it&quot; is hugely damaging to confidence levels. The Government have made improvement in this area their key aim for the CJS.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.6/6">We also have a responsibility to promote confidence in the CJS and we are actively working on a programme of work in this area. This will be based on ensuring that the public are aware of the impact of reform and improvements in the delivery of justice.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.0/1">There have been regular discussions with the Governments of Uganda and Rwanda at both ministerial and official levels since the first UN panel report on exploitation of resources in the DRC was published. We have urged both Governments to work openly and constructively with the panel team and take seriously any allegations of exploitation. The final UN panel report was issued on <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>. The Government of Uganda have already established a judicial enquiry into the allegations in a previous report, and this report is due on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>. The Government of Rwanda have rejected this report, as they did earlier ones, on the grounds that it is politically motivated and lacking in corroborative evidence. While we share many of the Government of Rwanda's criticisms of the report, we will continue to encourage the Government of Rwanda to take action to address the panel's accusations in an open manner. We believe the most important focus for future work is achieve peace and work to help the DRC and other Great Lakes countries put trade and the exploitation of mineral resources on to a well-regulated, transparent basis.</p>

An ECOWAS mediation team has succeeded at establishing contact with the rebels and gaining commitment from both parties to a ceasefire and the start of negotiations. It is also proposed that an ECOWAS monitoring force be established to replace the French troops currently providing a buffer force between the two sides. The plans for this force are still under discussion. The UK has provided a military adviser to assist ECOWAS in their efforts.</p>

He and his team co-ordinate with the mediators and other observers at Machakos so that we can complement each other's efforts to deliver the best results. We carry out intensive consultations with the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in Khartoum and elsewhere. We ensure that UK policy and the peace process are fully understood by other interested Governments and co-ordinate with international partners, including the EU; our collective approach to implementing an eventual peace agreement.

	<p pid=".951W.6/1">My Department has closely monitored developments regarding the investigation by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) into allegations of sexual exploitation of refugee women and girls by humanitarian aid workers and peacekeepers in refugee camps in West Africa. While the OIOS report found no involvement by UNHCR staff in acts of sexual exploitation, from a total of 43 cases of possible sexual exploitation investigated by the OIOS team 10 cases were substantiated by evidence. This finding confirms that the issue of sexual exploitation is a significant one and that it is not just confined to West Africa&mdash;but wherever refugees find themselves in similarly desperate and vulnerable circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.6/2">The report crucially identifies several factors which contribute to sexual exploitation in refugee communities including aspects of refugee camp life, camp structure, camp security, food and services distribution, employment opportunities, profiles of camp workers, and the quality and quantities of food and other relief items distributed.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.6/3">UNHCR has, in partnership with other concerned UN agencies, instituted a number of remedial measures and preventative actions to enhance the prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence. Specifically, in West Africa these include: increasing the accountability of humanitarian workers through the design of country-specific standards, applicable to all UN agencies and international and local NGOs; raising awareness of rights and entitlements in refugee communities through education and advocacy campaigns; increases in-field presence and improved training in sexual training and gender-based issues for UNHCR staff; improved reporting and monitoring procedures to speed up the identification of victims; building on existing programmes to better facilitate equal access and control of material resources as well as strengthening support to victims and groups at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.6/4">There exist additional measures which extend to the rest of Africa which, in turn, complement UNHCR's efforts on a global front, specifically the UNHCR Code of Conduct which aims to guide the behaviour and attitude of all UNHCR international and local staff in terms of the standards of conduct that are expected to be adhered to in the UN Charter and the Staff Regulation and Rules.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.6/5">We will, through our close relationship with UNHCR in the field and through our participation at the Standing and Executive Committees in Geneva, continue to monitor progress on all these fronts.</p>

	<p pid=".954W.9/1">Many employers view service as a magistrate as a valuable contribution and allow their employees paid time off to undertake their duties. Where magistrates do not receive paid time off they can claim a financial loss allowance linked to average gross earnings. The LCD is working with the Magistrates Association, with whom it has produced a guide for employers, and through local Advisory Committees, who are in touch with businesses in their area, to encourage employers to support staff who wish to serve the community in this way</p>

	<p pid=".957W.2/1">From next April, working women will benefit from the enhanced maternity pay and leave; and mothers, as well as fathers with children under the age of 6, or disabled children under 18, will have the right to apply for flexible working arrangements. Their employers will have a statutory duty to consider their requests seriously. The Government's Work-Life Balance Campaign also encourages all employers to follow best practice and offer flexible working arrangements to the benefit of all working women.</p>
	<p pid=".957W.2/2">By 2003&ndash;4, annual investment in the Government's National Childcare Strategy will have increased to over #200 million, a three-fold increase on the #66 million in 2000&ndash;1, to benefit 1.6 million children in England.</p>
	<p pid=".957W.2/3">Two new tax credits will be introduced next April, the Child Tax Credit, income related and paid directly to the main carer in the family; and the Working Tax Credit paid to low income working people with or without children. These will replace the existing tax credits, and simplify the system to ensure that people get financial support when they most need it.</p>

	<p pid=".959W.11/1">As the Human Organs Inquiry observed, it was never anticipated that the records of post mortems would come under such scrutiny so many years after being written. They are not generally computerised and some of them have been lost over time. The inquiry report drew attention to the inadequacy of record-keeping systems, including difficulties in identifying and tracking organs once they were removed. An inquiry into the loss of these particular records is not considered necessary, and my Department has established a steering group to see that improvements in record keeping will be identified and implemented. The method of record keeping previously used within the Royal does not allow for information on the numbers of organs disposed of in clear-outs at the hospitals organ and tissue store to be collated.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.11/1">Since January 2000, we have put in place a number of measures to reduce the burden of regulations on small businesses, including:</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/2">employers with four or fewer employees, exempted from requirement to provide access to stakeholder pensions and deduct pension contributions; increased the statutory audit threshold for companies from #350,000 to #1 million. This will relieve up to 150,000 small firms from the burden of a statutory audit, saving them up to #180 million a year; exempted small shops from the new EU unit pricing requirements; exempted employers with 20 or fewer employees from trade union recognition procedures in the Employment Relations Act. The Small Business Service has also: secured a 12-week period between regulations being agreed and implemented, allowing SMEs time to adapt to new regulations; secured the right to be consulted on all new regulations, so impact on SMEs is not disproportionate. Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) have to be produced for regulations setting out costs and benefits;produced clear guidance on a number of complex regulations; published the Regulatory Reform Action Plan&mdash;setting out over 250 proposals for better regulation and reform; regularly brought together groups of SMEs to express their views to officials, e.g. for Patrick Carter's review of payroll administration; set up an independent office to represent the views of small firms to the European institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/3">The Business Link Website is now attracting 80,000 users per month&mdash;businesses can register to receive alerts about regulations automatically.Further to these measures: around 900,000 SMEs benefit from measures announced in Budget 2002, including 485,000 businesses whose corporation tax bill is cut or abolished, and 700,000 are benefiting from flat rate VAT scheme; regulatory challenge function within the DTI strengthened. A new team created to consider how we challenge existing and future legislation and to ensure all policy makers fully consider alternatives to regulation at the outset of the policy-making process. The UK is not over-regulated compared to other countries: A survey jointly published by Anderson and GrowthPlus benchmarks the business environment in nine EU countries, plus the USA. In this report the UK comes out in first place, for providing the most entrepreneur-friendly environment scoring consistently high in all measured categories.</p>
	<p pid=".963W.11/4">The Economist Intelligence Unit (E.I.U.) studied the business environment, including regulation, in 60 countries. Results published in the Economist in August 2001, showed the Netherlands, the USA and Britain in the top three places. Recent OECD report into UK regulation concluded the environment is particularly supportive of market openness and competition. The report noted British entrepreneurs face better business and regulatory conditions than in most other OECD economies, it also highlighted support that SBS gives to SMEs and its role in fostering an enterprise culture in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".968W.10/1">I share my hon. Friend's desire to see a very substantial increase in renewable energy generation to help us mitigate the impacts of climate change and to create a more diversified energy market. The aim when setting any target must be to ensure that it is realistic and achievable. Our current target for renewables is that, by 2010, 10 per cent. of electricity sales within Great Britain should come from sources eligible for the recently introduced Renewables Obligation. This will represent a substantial but attainable expansion over the course of the decade.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.10/2">The Performance and Innovation Unit's report on energy policy which was published last February recommended that the target for the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources should be increased to 20 per cent. by 2020. In the light of the report the Government are carrying out a review of future energy policy with a view to issuing a White Paper in the new year. The review has included extensive consultation and is including consideration of the possibility of introducing an increased renewables target for 2020.</p>

Sir Richard and his team are currently about half way through their work and a great deal of effort, from industry, Government and other organisations, is being put into the process.

Decisions on whether to extend coverage further are a commercial matter for the cable company concerned, as network expansion is no longer dictated by the build milestones in a cable operator's Telecommunications Act licence. Cable franchises, when originally granted, contained a balance of exclusivity and build milestones. Since 1998, the exclusivity of the franchises has been progressively removed to enable greater competition in the provision of communications services. This process was completed on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>. In recognition of this, cable operators' licences are no longer subject to build milestones.</p>

	<p pid=".984W.6/2">All relevant export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for internal repression or external aggression. The outbreak of the intifada, continued Israeli incursions in the Occupied Territories and the Israeli breach of its assurance that UK originated equipment would not be used in the Occupied Territories have all been factored in to the Government's current export licensing policy.

	<p pid=".988W.8/1">The policies and measures in the Government's climate change programme should deliver our Kyoto emissions commitment. The climate change programme includes policies and measures impacting on all sectors of the economy and society, which seek to reduce emissions attributable both to the production of energy, and to its consumption.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/2">Measures to reduce emissions attributable to energy production include the Renewables Obligation, which places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source a rising proportion of their total sales from eligible renewable sources. Our target is that 10 per cent. of licensed electricity supplies will be generated from eligible renewable sources by 2010. Wind power will make an important contribution to this target, as will other renewable sources of electricity. Achieving this target could result in an estimated saving of around 2.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/3">This expansion of renewable energy is however just one part of the Government's wider climate change programme. Other initiatives include for example the climate change levy on conventional fuels and the UK emissions trading scheme which affect the business sector. In the domestic sector, the new Energy Efficiency Commitment places new obligations on gas and electricity suppliers to make energy efficiency improvements; there are also new requirements on local authorities to make proposals to achieve energy efficiency gains; and the #600 million home energy efficiency scheme provides grants for home insulation and heating improvements to improve energy savings. On transport, there is the EU-level agreements with the car manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency in new cars, backed by changes in UK vehicle taxation through company car tax and vehicle excise duty, together with the infrastructure investment in the 10-year plan to tackle congestion and pollution.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/4">As my hon. Friend may know, energy efficiency was one of the key areas highlighted in the PIU review of energy policy. The Government support an increasing role for energy efficiency and is formulating a response to be published in the White Paper around the turn of the year. The role of renewables will also be included in the White Paper.</p>

In the financial year 2000&ndash;01, some #271,000 was awarded for schemes containing a rural element. In 2001&ndash;02 the figure was just under #1.1 million. The projected figure for 2002&ndash;03 is some #2.3 million.</p>

	<p pid=".995W.5/1">Estimates of capital investment by the private sector in support of PFI projects (both signed and those at preferred bidder) are published in the Financial Statement and Budget Report each year. Tables C17 and C18 of Budget 2002 include the latest projections of capital expenditure by the private sector under the private finance initiative, broken down by department, for 2002&ndash;03 to 2004&ndash;05. In line with past practice, I expect to update these figures shortly.</p>
