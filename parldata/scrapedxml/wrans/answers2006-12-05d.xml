	<p pid="d.214W.2/1">Recent consultancy work, carried out on behalf of DEFRA, estimates that 24,850 tonnes of household batteries were sold in the UK in 2003. The great majority of these were alkaline manganese and zinc carbon varieties. There has been no legislative requirement for waste household batteries to be separately collected and detailed statistics have not therefore been kept. However, we estimate that various local voluntary schemes have resulted in a capture rate of less than 2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.2/2">The Batteries and Accumulators Directive (2006/66/EC) came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-26">26 September 2006</phrase>. Member states have two years to transpose this measure into national law. This is a &quot;producer responsibility&quot; directive and, as such, the onus on collection and recycling will fall on battery producers in the first instance. However, local authorities are also likely to play a role given their current involvement in the collection of household waste. The exact form this may take will not be decided until the completion of formal domestic consultation with all parties concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.2/3">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently working in partnership with a range of local authorities and not-for-profit organisations which already run recycling collection services on a number of pilot battery collection schemes.</p>

	<p pid="d.214W.5/1">Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally. The sector accounts for 36 per cent. of methane and 67 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions in the UK, but only 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide. About 80 per cent. of this methane comes from enteric fermentation in the digestive system of animals (sheep, pigs and bovines), and 20 per cent. from animal waste. Methane emissions from agriculture have declined by 12 per cent. since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.5/2">Recent research suggests that substantial methane reductions could be achieved by changes to feed regimes. Improving the longevity of dairy cows will also result in decreased methane production as a result of a reduction in the total number of animals needed to produce the same quantity of milk.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.5/3">Defra is exploring the role of anaerobic digestion in reducing methane emissions in agriculture, both domestically and internationally. For example, we are taking a leading role in the Methane to Markets Partnership, an international initiative that advances cost-effective, near-term methane recovery and its use as a clean energy source.</p>

	<p pid="d.215W.5/2">DEFRA is taking the lead on offsetting emissions associated with the UK's presidency of the G8 in 2005, to help ensure that the presidency is carbon-neutral. All of last year's G8-associated meetings, including the G8 summit, were included in the DEFRA-led carbon offsetting initiative. The calculations included the emissions associated with air travel, local transport, energy use at venues and accommodation, and waste production.</p>
	<p pid="d.215W.5/3">To offset these emissions, the Government have agreed to purchase 10,000 Certified Emission Reductions from the Kuyasa low-income housing energy upgrade project in Cape Town, South Africa. This is the first Clean Development Mechanism project to be registered in Africa, and the first Gold Standard project to be registered anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="d.215W.5/4">DEFRA is also responsible for administering the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, which offsets all official and ministerial air travel of all central Government Departments (except the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which have their own offsetting schemes). Proceeds from the Fund will be used to purchase Certified Emission Reduction credits from energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that are based in developing countries and accredited under the Clean Development Mechanism. The organisations and specific projects that will be involved will be finalised soon and more details will be included in an announcement to be made shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.216W.2/1">While carbon sequestration by forestry is a useful tool for offsetting some greenhouse gas emissions, sequestration in cropland and pasture through new management practices is less certain. This is because new management practices have to be followed for a substantial period of time in order to record additional carbon storage. Also, several years of stored carbon could be released by a change of practice in just one season.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.2/2">A more important issue is protecting the 10 billion tonnes of carbon held in UK soils, especially upland peat soils, from release through soil erosion and inappropriate management practices such as over-grazing. For example, allowing the peat soils of the High Peak to dry out would alone release carbon equivalent to 270 million vehicle miles.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.2/3">Defra is undertaking research to understand fully the issues on sequestration and protection of carbon stores.

	<p pid="d.216W.5/1">European Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004 lays down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries. The Regulation makes the use of acoustic deterrent devices (&quot;pingers&quot;) mandatory for vessels over 12 meters in length, involved in fixed-gear fisheries in the Celtic Sea Channel and Western Waters. It also sets up mandatory observer schemes to increase our knowledge of by-catch in fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="d.216W.5/2">Unfortunately, there has been a delay in implementing pingers because studies of their effectiveness, costs and availability indicate that there are currently no devices suitable for use. A discussion was held at a Council Working Group on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-27">27 September</phrase> which recognised that, because of deployment problems in certain fisheries, some member states could not currently implement pingers as required. However, the group recommended that member states should continue work towards developing a suitable pinger.</p>

	<p pid="d.220W.5/1">Responsibility for cross-compliance inspections is divided between the Rural Payments Agency (RPA), the state veterinary service (SVS) and the Environment Agency (EA).</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.5/2">The RPA employs over 260 multi-skilled farm inspectors who carry out livestock identification checks which involve physical ear-tag reading in the presence of the livestock handler. Veterinary training is not required. However, all RPA inspectors have had training and experience in working safely with livestock, and animal welfare issues form part of their training.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.5/3">The SVS has over 200 qualified veterinary surgeons and a similar number of technical staff. Technical staff carry out cross-compliance inspections regarding restrictions on the use of substances that have a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists on farm animals. Responsibility for cross-compliance inspections on the control of animal diseases lies mainly with veterinary staff, although they are assisted by technical staff. Inspections for animal welfare requirements, which come into force in 2007, will be carried out by veterinary staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.220W.5/4">The Environment Agency is responsible for carrying out inspections in relation to groundwater, sewage sludge and nitrate vulnerable zones. Approximately 170 appropriately trained inspectors have undertaken work on cross-compliance as part of their duties.</p>

	<p pid="d.228W.0/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) recently published an Achievement Report. This included details of progress made on minimising waste through composting, reusable nappies, and in the retail sector. Progress made included:</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/3" class="indent">(i) signing up 92 per cent. of UK grocery retailers to the Courtauld Commitment to reduce packaging and food waste</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/4" class="indent">(ii) recruiting an additional 335,000 households as home composters</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/5" class="indent">(iii) diverting 22,954 tonnes of biodegradable nappy waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/6">The Report is available from the WRAP website at:</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/wrap_corporate/about_wrap/wraps.html">http://www.wrap.org.uk/wrap_corporate/about_wrap/wraps.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/8">As WRAP's work on reusable nappies started in 2003, it is too early to say what long-term changes there have been in consumer behaviour. The challenge in relation to reusable nappies, because of the convenience of disposable nappies, was recognised from the outset. I understand that WRAP will be preparing a report on lessons learnt from the campaign in the spring of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.228W.0/9">Each of the elements of WRAP's work on waste minimisation has produced valuable experience of how to influence consumer behaviour in making choices which reduce the amount of waste created.</p>

	<p pid="d.233W.2/1">The Highways Agency is continuing to develop the option to widen the M6 between junctions 11a and 19 following the announcement in July 2006 that further work should focus solely on this rather than the Expressway concept. As part of this development work, further evaluation of the environmental and economic effects of the plans is being undertaken to enable the scheme to be considered for programme entry. Statutory environmental organisations will be consulted in due course as part of this process.</p>

However, the Department and the Highways Agency monitor trends in road construction costs and take account of them in planning the forward programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.4/2">Unlike conventional road improvement contracts, the costs associated with DBFO contracts are not just for the construction work but also cover the maintenance and management of the associated road network over a typical period of thirty years. The actual cost of construction is a matter for each DBFO Company.</p>
	<p pid="d.236W.4/3">The following table gives the expected total cost of Unitary Charges for each contract and the year in which the payments end. These payments cover the cost of constructing the road improvements and also maintaining the road network covered by the contract over the contract period.</p>

	<p pid="d.239W.5/2">Ofsted, the official body for inspecting schools, has not found any evidence that creationism is being taught in science lessons. The Department has not made an estimate of the number of schools or academies teaching creationism or intelligent design in religious education lessons.</p>
	<p pid="d.239W.5/3">The national curriculum for science clearly sets down that pupils should be taught: how uncertainties in scientific knowledge and scientific ideas change overtime; the role of the scientific community in validating these changes; variation within species can lead to evolutionary changes; and, similarities and differences between species can be measured and classified. To meet the requirements of the national curriculum for science teachers have to teach about scientific theories. Neither intelligent design nor creationism is a recognised scientific theory and should not therefore be taught as part of the science curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="d.239W.5/4">Creationism and intelligent design can be explored in religious education as part of developing an understanding of different beliefs. It is up to the local SACREs (Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education) to set the syllabus for how this should be done. The guidance for schools on collective worship states that every school must provide a daily act of collective worship for its pupils. There is no specific reference to creationism or intelligent design. The Department does not produce guidance on what should be discussed at scripture unions or religious clubs.</p>
	<p pid="d.239W.5/5">The Department is currently working with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to communicate this message to schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.241W.2/2">The Department does not set aside funding specifically for the installation of sprinklers in schools. It is for local authorities to decide what they do with the funding they are allocated. They can use it to install sprinklers where their need is demonstrated by a risk assessment, or where they represent value for money. Where a local authority has a general policy of installing sprinklers in schools, and need or value for money is not demonstrated in a particular project, it can of course provide additional funding to cover sprinklers.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.2/3">The Department is preparing a new publication on fire safety in schools&mdash;Building Bulletin 100, &quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;. This includes guidance on sprinklers but, following public consultation, we saw the need to do more work in this area. We therefore commissioned consultants to analyse case studies of school projects where sprinklers have been installed. They are establishing reliable figures for both installation and maintenance costs, and developing these into a full cost benefit analysis. This work will be completed in January and then integrated into the final version of Building Bulletin 100, which we expect to publish several months later.</p>

	<p pid="d.249W.2/22" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/23" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/24" class="indent">You asked how many inspectors were employed to inspect the (a) performance, (b) quality standard and (c) guideline compliance of further education colleges in each year since 1997, broken down by inspecting body.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/25" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Act 2000 gave Her Majesty's Chief Inspector the responsibility for the inspection of further education colleges from 2001. It also required that these inspections be carried out jointly with the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI) where colleges also provided for education of learners who were 19 and over - which is the case for nearly all such colleges. This responsibility covers the inspection of sixth form colleges, tertiary colleges, colleges of further education, independent specialist colleges, and other specialist colleges such as those dedicated to agriculture and horticulture and art and design.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/26" class="indent">Before 2001, the inspection of further education colleges fell within the Further Education Funding Council. I am afraid Ofsted does not hold the records of that body.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/27" class="indent">Ofsted is required by the 2000 Act to inspect in accordance with a common inspection framework. Inspectors must report on the effectiveness of the educational provision, achievements and standards, leadership and management. It is not possible to separate the contribution of inspectors towards the inspection of performance and quality standards. The responsibility for guideline compliance primarily falls to the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/28" class="indent">Each of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools carries out a range of inspections so that it is only possible to provide approximate information to that requested and on a 'full-time equivalent' basis for inspectors directly employed by Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/29" class="indent">This number of inspectors on a 'full-time equivalent' basis directly employed by Ofsted and deployed on the inspection of colleges (by financial year) is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/30" class="indent">2001-02: 26 HMI</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/31" class="indent">2002-03: 26 HMI</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/32" class="indent">2003-04: 26 HMI</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/33" class="indent">2004-05: 22 HMI</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/34" class="indent">2005-06: 18 HMI</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/35" class="indent">In addition, Ofsted has deployed the services of 'additional inspectors' on a contractual basis as and when they are needed.</p>
	<p pid="d.249W.2/36" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Bill Rammell MP, Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.252W.5/31">The figures are for the average number of staff employed by the LSC each year and include temporary staff and agency staff. A rise in staff numbers occurred between March 2002 and March 2003 as the LSC began to build up the organisation, and took on significant new responsibilities, including the funding of school sixth forms. During 2004 the LSC undertook a re-shaping exercise which resulted in a fall in numbers in March 2005. Staff numbers subsequently increased slightly, reflecting the further work which was transferred by the Department to the LSC during 2005, including education maintenance allowances. However, we anticipate a reduction in the average number of staff in post between 2006 and 2007 as a consequence of the announcement in September 2005 by Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, of proposals for a new structure for the organisation. This new structure aims to make the LSC more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. This process is now nearing completion, and will achieve estimated savings of up to &pound;40 million, which could be released to the front line for the further benefit of learners. As a result, the LSC will have a strong regional and local capacity, spending less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders.</p>

It aims to help raise standards in classrooms by helping to share good practice, support continuing professional development, offer classroom resources, and provide education news and information.</p>
	<p pid="d.258W.2/3">The channel is editorially independent (as required by the Communications Act 2003) and robust protocols are in place to ensure that, while the Department is able to identify the channel's objectives and strategic direction, it is not able to influence programming decisions. An independent Board of Governors ensures that editorial independence is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="d.258W.2/4">The Department has a pre-agreed form of contract which it obliges the supplier to use with all TV production companies. The Department has the right to reject any contracts entered into that are not on this agreed basis. However, it does not have the right to veto specific programme commissioning contracts in order to ensure editorial independence.</p>

Consistent with that policy, I do not intend, except in entirely exceptional circumstances, to retrospectively amend any year's settlement.

	<p pid="d.264W.3/2">For the 2006-07 settlement the best available population projections were the Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2003-based sub-national population projections. Because 2007-08 is the second year of a multi-year settlement, the provisional 2007-08 settlement also uses the 2003-based sub-national population projections. The Government are currently consulting on the 2007-08 provisional settlement and will take into account all relevant representations made during the consultation period before making the final settlement.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.3/3">The next multi-year settlement period calculations (for the three financial years 2008-09 to 2010-11) are due to be made in late 2007. In preparing for these calculations, the methodology will be reviewed and data used in the formulae to determine the 2008-09 to 2010-11 settlements will, consistent with the Secretary of State's policy on multi-year settlements, be updated to the best data available at that time.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.3/4">As there have been no changes made to the formulae for 2007-08, and in order to treat all authorities consistently, I am not able to meet individual local authority delegations during consultation. I will of course meet with hon. Members representing Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>

The bid document included contingency and preliminaries of 23.5 per cent. in main venue costs. It also included a contingency for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games. The bid did not include provision for an Olympic Delivery Partner. This proposal was made following the establishment of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The use of a delivery partner will help to ensure the highest levels of programme management and cost control.</p>

	<p pid="d.272W.8/2">Guidance on the use of the Simple Caution for adult offenders is set out in Home Office circular 30/2005. The police (and CPS where appropriate) will consider whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances. If the suspect has previously received a caution, a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), a caution can be used.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.8/3">In the case of those aged 10-17 cautions were replaced by the Final Warning Scheme under Sections 65 and 66 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which introduced reprimands and final warnings. Depending on the seriousness of the offence, a reprimand is normally given for a first offence and a final warning for a second offence. If a young person who has been given a final warning commits a further offence he or she must be charged (the only exception is where it is at least two years since the previous warning and the offence is not so serious as to require a charge, in which case a further warning can be given).</p>

This scheme provides safe accommodation and a range of support services, such as counselling, health checks, translation and interpretation services and access to legal advice for female victims who have been trafficked into prostitution, provided the victims are willing to come forward to, and actively assist the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.285W.2/2">In April this year we extended the funding for the scheme to &pound;2.4 million over the next two years. As well as funding the 25 crisis spaces this funding will allow for 10 additional &quot;step-down&quot; places, the introduction of a specialist national outreach service and the development of a resource information pack for victims, service providers and law enforcement agency staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.285W.2/3">Additionally on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-03">3 October</phrase> I launched the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre which will become a central point for the development of police expertise and operational co-ordination as part of the delivery of an end to end victim-centred strategy to combat human trafficking. As part of its work the centre has begun to develop close links with those non-governmental organisations focused on providing support for victims.</p>

	<p pid="d.296W.2/1">In the current recruitment exercise for probation board chairs and members we have sought to attract applicants from across the public, private and not for profit sectors. We have particularly sought to attract individuals with 'business acumen' in whichever sector such skills have been obtained. During the present process we have written directly to the Magistrates' Association, and the LGA, as well as to such organisations as Lions and Rotary Clubs, to encourage applicants with diverse experiences. This has been supported by considerable additional activity to encourage applicants from BME and other traditionally under represented groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.296W.2/2">The skills, abilities and business acumen we are seeking during the current recruitment campaign are the same as we would wish to see represented on probation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="d.296W.2/3">The remuneration for trust chairs and members has not been yet been determined although presently, depending on the size of the area, probation chairs are paid between &pound;15,400 and &pound;27,500 and are asked to commit up to two days a week. Board members are paid at an hourly rate of &pound;15.40 with a commitment of up to five days a month.</p>

	<p pid="d.307W.5/1">Along with England and Wales, the Violent Crime Reduction Act (&quot;the Act&quot;) made three changes to the law in Northern Ireland with regard to knives. The Act raised the age at which knives can be legally purchased from 16 to 18 years of age; created a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon, which includes specified knives and bladed weapons, with a penalty of up to four years imprisonment; and reduced the threshold for a constable to exercise his power of entry and search of a school and a person on school premises for weapons including knives.</p>
	<p pid="d.307W.5/2">The Government recently concluded a public consultation exercise including a major conference taking views on a series of proposals to improve further Northern Ireland's laws on knives. The proposals included increasing the penalty for possession of a knife in a public place; extending the list of &quot;offensive weapons&quot;; and increasing penalties for the illegal sale of knives. The consultation also sought views on a knife licensing scheme. I am currently considering the way forward in light of the consultation and the conference.</p>

	<p pid="d.314W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding how many residents parking schemes are under consideration by the Department for Regional Development in each Northern Ireland council area. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.2/4" class="indent">By way of background, I should explain that the Department took powers in the Road Traffic Regulation (NI) Order 1997 to permit the introduction of residents' parking schemes in Northern Ireland. However, one of the key success factors for residents' parking schemes is effective enforcement. At that time, the Police Service of Northern Ireland was responsible for the enforcement of parking restrictions, but indicated that they could not provide resources to carry out this enforcement. No schemes have therefore been implemented to date.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.2/5" class="indent">You will be aware that, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase> parking offences were decriminalised and Roads Service took over responsibility for the enforcement of parking restrictions. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-17">17 November 2006</phrase> we launched a draft policy consultation on residents' parking, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-09">9 February 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.314W.2/6" class="indent">While we have received a number of enquiries in relation to residents' parking schemes, none of these will be considered in detail until the consultation has been completed and a policy developed. However, I can advise that following publication of the residents' parking policy, it is intended that the first residents' parking schemes will be implemented towards the end of next year.</p>

The funding for such township-level interventions would be channelled through UN agencies.</p>

Furthermore, the donor consortium has agreed with the Burmese authorities that implementation of the Three Diseases Fund will be consistent with the international humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. These principles rule out any implementation by organisations with a political nature such as the Union Solidarity Development Association.</p>

	<p pid="d.319W.9/1">The closure of the field offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Burma means that ICRC will be unable to carry out its vital assistance and protection work with civilians affected by conflict between the Burmese Army and the ethnic armed groups. We are extremely concerned that this will increase the vulnerability of these civilians. We are also very concerned that since December 2005, ICRC has had to halt its programme of prison visits because it has been unable to carry them out according to its standard operating procedures. We believe that the ICRC's transparent, neutral and principled approach to aid delivery is the right one: respect for the humanitarian principles by donors, implementers and the authorities is crucial for the effective delivery of aid. The Burmese authorities' treatment of ICRC is a cause for profound concern for all agencies supporting humanitarian assistance in Burma.</p>

This approach is currently being used to assess the Department's human resources policies.

	<p pid="d.323W.0/1">The eruption of Mount Nyamulagira in North Kivu, DRC has been anticipated for some time. Fortunately for the population of this troubled region, this volcano is situated within the Virunga National Park, which is largely uninhabited. Lava flows are being monitored by the Goma Volcano Observatory, and while it is still possible that lava may reach the Sake-Goma road, the speed of the flows has reduced considerably. To date the impact on inhabitants of the area has been minimal, but the situation will continue to be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="d.323W.0/2">The volcano Nyiragongo, however, is only 18 km from Goma town and is also very active. DFID is providing support to the Goma Volcano Observatory to increase its technical capacity to monitor the status of these two volcanoes and to establish a risk management unit to carry out contingency planning and emergency response preparation. The Observatory is funded through the UN and works closely with local authorities in North Kivu and Rwanda, other UN agencies and NGOs. If it becomes necessary to evacuate people from the area, support will be provided through the rapid response mechanism (RRM)&mdash;a contingency fund established in DRC to ensure emergency assistance is provided as quickly as possible, supported by the UK and other partners.</p>
	<p pid="d.323W.0/3">The recent fighting in Sake (25 km west of Goma) and surrounding areas between combatants loyal to renegade army commander General Nkunda and MONUC/FARDC forces has caused considerable disruption in the area, with approximately 15,000 people displaced. The area is now quiet again, but people are delaying their return home, fearing looting. A joint UN/NGO assessment mission has reviewed the situation and made a first distribution of food and other essential items to those in need, using RRM resources. The humanitarian agencies on the ground will continue to monitor and respond to the needs of the population until they can safely return home.</p>

	<p pid="d.323W.3/1">DFID has been following closely the debate around this legislation. We agree with the assessment and statement by the European Union which reiterates member states' commitment to supporting transparency, accountability and efficiency in aid programmes in Peru. It also requests that specific articles of the Bill be clarified to ensure that they are not used to limit constitutional rights, or limit the work of non-governmental organisations in the area of human rights and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.323W.3/2">The Bill is currently being reviewed at the request of President Garcia and a number of amendments have been proposed. DFID will continue to monitor this process and work with the European Union to ensure that the legislation promotes transparency and co-ordination and does not adversely affect the work of non-governmental organisations in Peru.</p>

	<p pid="d.331W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking which (a) full time and (b) part time Jobcentre Plus offices have been closed in each of the last four years. This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/4" class="indent">I enclose a list of the offices that were closed and have indicated in each case whether the office was open full-time or part-time prior to closure. I have placed a copy in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/5" class="indent">Firstly, as part of the rollout of the new Jobcentre Plus network we have rationalised our estate. We inherited around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, several of which were unsuitable for the new processes, or were in the wrong place or in a poor state of repair. Often, the former agencies had offices situated at either end of the High Street and, in some instances, neither was suitable for conversion to Jobcentre Plus so we closed one or both of them. In each District we undertook detailed service delivery planning exercises in consultation with local stakeholders, identifying the sites which we would convert to the new standard and those, which needed to close. We also explained how, particularly in more rural locations, we would offer outreach services (&quot;flexible service delivery&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/6" class="indent">Secondly, as a result of our programme to centralise benefit processing we have identified sites which will no longer be viable once processing work has been taken away from them.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/7" class="indent">Thirdly, we have been looking very closely at the need for public-facing sites in a number of locations. The increased availability of new channels means that Jobcentre Plus customers can access services directly by telephone or Internet rather than needing to call into one of our offices. Reducing expenditure on our office network is part of our wider strategy for focusing resources more effectively on frontline advisory services to help our customers move into work.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/8" class="indent">The list of closures should also be set against the 837 offices that we have rolled out to date under our restructuring programme, plus over 150 locations where we have installed flexible service delivery arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/9" class="indent">I would emphasise that the closure of any of our offices involves consultation with local stakeholders, including MPs, and putting in place suitable alternative arrangements for delivering services to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.331W.2/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.333W.8/1">Carers already have access to a wide range of support to help them back to work depending on whether they are, for example a lone parent or a disabled person, and the type of working age benefit they receive, such as income support or incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.8/2">In taking advantage of this support, carers may be able to attend a work-focused interview where they can get advice from a personal adviser on the programmes available to help them search for work or on training to update their skills. When making the transition into work, the personal adviser will also give advice on the financial assistance available to them.</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.8/3">We have also listened to the considerable public support for carers in drawing up proposals in the Health and Social Care White Paper when a commitment was made to improve respite care. In addition, the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, promotes co-operation between authorities and requires councils to inform carers of their right to an assessment which takes into account their outside interests including work, or the desire to work.</p>
	<p pid="d.333W.8/4">Flexible working practices are good for business, employees and their families. In April 2003, we introduced a new right for parents of children up to the age of six and disabled children up to the age of 18 to request flexible working and put a duty on the employer to consider their request seriously. From April 2007, this right will be extended through the Work and Families Act to carers of adults. This will support carers who wish to remain in or return to work and will particularly help those aged 45 to 64, around one quarter of whom are carers.</p>

We also made 8,745 visits (5,278 to those detained and 3,467 to those hospitalised). Some of the visits were multiple visits to the same person, and would incur disproportionate cost to measure individual cases.

	<p pid="d.348W.4/1">Under the current law, legal proceedings seeking civil damages for child abuse are usually brought as actions for trespass against the person in relation to intentionally inflicted injuries and as actions for negligence in other cases. The limitation period for trespass against the person is six years from the date on which the cause of action arose, although this period will not start to run until the child reaches the age of majority. In relation to actions for negligently inflicted injuries, the period is three years from the cause of action or from the date of knowledge (if later) of the person injured. The court has discretion to allow certain actions for negligently inflicted personal injuries to be brought even though the limitation period has expired.</p>
	<p pid="d.348W.4/2">In its 2001 report &quot;Limitation of Actions&quot; (Law Com 270), the Law Commission recommended that the general law of limitation should be reformed. Under its proposals, a child abuse claim for trespass against the person or for negligence would have to be brought within three years from the date on which the claimant knew (or ought reasonably to have known) the facts giving rise to the cause of action, the identity of the defendant, and that any injury, loss or damage was significant. As now, time would not run while the claimant was a minor. In addition, the court would have discretion to disapply the limitation period if it would be unjust not to allow the claim to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="d.348W.4/3">In July 2002, the Government announced their acceptance, in principle, of the Commission's recommendations, subject to further consideration of several issues. In relation to child abuse cases, as announced in the Home Office publication &quot;Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System in Favour of the Law Abiding Majority: cutting crime, reducing re-offending and protecting the public&quot; (July 2006), we intend to consult on whether limitation periods are fair to people who have been injured as a result of crime. When the work on the outstanding issues is complete, we will seek an opportunity to introduce a Bill to reform the law.</p>

	<p pid="d.351W.5/1">We want to improve outcomes for children involved in court cases by ensuring that their wishes and interests are at the heart of the family justice system. The DCA commissioned research from Cardiff university which suggests that children involved in family court proceedings often feel excluded and unheard in the process. Our aim is to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.5/2" class="indent">Young people in proceedings feel that the information given to them is clear;</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.5/3" class="indent">They are able to understand what is happening and why;</p>

	<p pid="d.351W.5/6" class="indent">They are able to access information, if they choose to, when they reach 18 or thereafter, about the decisions made in their case.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.5/7">We are consulting about whether and how children could ask questions, attend court and talk to the judge or the magistrates directly. We are also discussing how judges might speak to children and account to them for the decisions that they have made about them. We are considering how we might keep a record of the court's judgment, so that, if the child wishes to, they are able to find out about their case when they grow up.</p>
	<p pid="d.351W.5/8">We will announce in early 2007 the detail of how we intend to proceed following the consultation and we will also publish the responses to the consultation papers.</p>

	<p pid="d.358W.5/1">For the last three years the Department has funded Defence Schools Presentations Teams (DSPT) which tour secondary schools giving a half day interactive presentation about defence to 14 to 16-year-olds. There are five such teams covering different areas of the country, and over the last year they visited about 460 schools (about 10 per cent. of the total number in the country serving this age group). These presentations are generally well received and do allow us to get some of our messages over about the importance of defence. The investment here is about &pound;2.1 million a year and we have reviewed our approach.</p>
	<p pid="d.358W.5/2">The Department will be introducing a new schools e-learning product. Through creating an educational website called &quot;Defence Dynamics&quot;, our main focus will be to provide Secondary School teachers of 14 to 16-year-olds with pre-packaged electronic lesson plans with Defence themes. Defence Dynamics will start with the delivery in September 2007 of 40 plus lesson plans with audio-visuals in Science, Maths and English based on scenarios that reflect the professional work of the MOD and the armed forces worldwide. The material will be developed to support the requirements of the school curriculum and across a range of subject areas in the longer term. MOD will be working closely with DfES and the devolved Government education Departments in the UK. Initially the Defence Dynamics programme will run for two years with the aim to develop this for the long-term. A similar e-learning approach has been used successfully in Australian schools for three years (&quot;Defence 2020&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="d.358W.5/3">The intention is to disband the touring DSPT in July 2007 (the end of this academic year) and launch the new schools e-learning product in September 2007. The Department will be maintaining its engagement with schools and switching to an approach that will enable us to reach many more children than are visited by the touring DSPT, and at a significantly lower cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.358W.5/4">The armed forces engagement with youth activities continues&mdash;each service of the armed forces has a presentation team and these remain in place. There is also a wide range of single service youth activity.</p>

	<p pid="d.359W.2/1">File WO208/3548 and extract WO208/3654, were originally reviewed in accordance with the terms of the Public Records Acts 1958 and 1967. They were assessed as being suitable for permanent preservation at the Public Record Office (now The National Archives) but were judged then to be too sensitive for release. They were therefore retained in the Department in accordance with section 3(4) of the Public Records Act with the approval of the Lord Chancellor. Their sensitivity would routinely have been re-reviewed every 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.359W.2/2">These items were retained with similarly sensitive material in the central Ministry of Defence archive, which, in 2003 was found to have been contaminated by asbestos. WO208/3654 has since been re-constituted, re-reviewed and released to The National Archives. Unfortunately a search of the list of material removed from the contaminated archive has shown that WO208/3548 is not recorded. Further searches will be made for this file as the scanning project to recover contaminated files proceeds.</p>

	<p pid="d.364W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence has adopted a unified philosophy to equality and diversity issues at a strategic level which is reflected in our Unified Diversity Strategy (UDS). The UDS ensures the development of equality and diversity action plans throughout the organisation which are relevant to and reflective of the respective requirements of the armed forces, civilians, MOD police and executive agencies. This strategy is underpinned by clear and robust equality and diversity policies covering all aspects of the Department's work.</p>

A major requirement of our scheme is the obligation to undertake diversity impact assessments of the Department's functions, policies, procedures and services, subject to relevance and proportionality. This is also supported by a Training Management Framework to ensure that our entire workforce, uniformed and civilian, are properly trained, that their awareness is raised and that they are sensitive to diversity issues. There are several levels of training from our initial induction courses through to specialist training for specific posts.</p>

This includes reinforcements and additional training for enquiry centre staff, and particular emphasis has been placed upon specialist pay and allowances issues during testing.

There are no current plans to change the use of RAF Halton, with the exception of a small element which may be affected by the Defence Training Review Rationalisation Programme. A review of officer and airmen development is also under way and this may affect a number of units at RAF stations, including some at RAF Halton. No decisions have yet been taken.</p>

	<p pid="d.376W.5/1">The 18 weeks target focuses on hospital consultant pathways. Over time, patients with hearing problems who do not need to see a hospital consultant have increasingly been referred direct to audiology services, enabling services led by ear, nose and throat consultants for example to focus on more complex cases. Direct access services should be quicker for patients because they cut out a stage of the potential pathway, and it would be perverse to reverse this. Nevertheless there are currently long waits for direct access audiology services and the action plan for publication in early 2007 will address this.</p>

Under the previous NHS system there were about 3,400 review requests a year; the Healthcare Commission expected that it might receive up to 5,000 requests.

	<p pid="d.380W.3/7" class="indent">it has commissioned a national audit of complaints handling at local level which will feed into the annual healthcheck process in 2006-07 to encourage best practice by trusts in complaints handling and to focus efforts on local resolution of cases.</p>
	<p pid="d.380W.3/8">The Department has introduced new regulations which extend the flexibility for local NHS organisations to respond to patients. This should reduce the number of complaints reaching the Healthcare Commission. The Department is also looking at common areas of complaint to see whether further advice could be given to the NHS which might lead to fewer people having cause for complaint.</p>

The primary responsibility for the provision of fertility services, and the implementation of the clinical guideline produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 2004, rests with the NHS at local level. We have no plans to ask primary care trusts (PCTs) to restrict the availability of IVF and we are working with the patient support organisation Infertility Network UK to help PCTs engage with fertility patients in the planning and prioritisation of services.</p>

	<p pid="d.381W.5/1">None. As far as licensed medicinal products are concerned, mannitol is available as an intravenous infusion and is a prescription only medicine which means that pharmacists may only dispense it against a prescription issued by an appropriate practitioner. Mannitol is also used widely as an excipient (i.e. an inactive ingredient) by the pharmaceutical industry in the manufacture of other medicinal products.</p>
	<p pid="d.381W.5/2">There are no specific measures in place to prevent illicit use. Adulterants and bulking agents mixed with controlled drugs are not usually controlled where they are not psychoactive themselves or precursors to psychoactive drugs of misuse.</p>
	<p pid="d.381W.5/3">There are no plans for further restrictions on availability. There is an established mechanism to allow proper consideration of making drugs of misuse controlled. The advisory council on the misuse of drugs (the expert body that advises Ministers) is made aware of problems posed by specific drugs, or where they are requested by Ministers to consider a specific drug, they will undertake a detailed assessment of whether or not a substance ought to be controlled and make appropriate recommendations to Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="d.389W.5/2">The introduction of a national tariff relies on national standardised data sets and robust cost and activity data collection. For this reason the implementation of a national tariff has begun with hospital-based care, where the data are available. There are limited data available on activity levels and the associated cost of services delivered in the community. As a result there is no tariff for speech and language therapy in the community.</p>
