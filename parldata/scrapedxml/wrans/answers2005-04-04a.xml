For each year, the percentage of learners studying engineering apprenticeships in the West Midlands from the trainee database has been applied to the total number of learners in the West Midlands from the TEC Ml to estimate the volume of learners studying engineering apprenticeships in the West Midlands.

	<p pid="a.1080W.6/1">Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS), the Government's centre for learning and development, has run short programmes on sustainable development for civil servants for some years with a largely estates management and procurement focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.6/2">In autumn 2004, as part of a broader partnership in the sustainability area, CMPS and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) co-designed two one day pilot workshops for senior civil servants which took a strategic and practical view of sustainable development. Parts of the workshop were delivered by Jonathon Porritt, chair of the Sustainable Development Commission, senior Defra officials and Forum for the Future. Jonathon Porritt also spoke recently on the Top Management Programme and sustainable development will be given dedicated coverage on all future runs of the Top Management Programme. Two further workshops for senior civil servants are planned for June and November 2005, and more will be offered if there is demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.6/3">CMPS is currently developing an internal project to integrate sustainable development thinking and practice into a wide range of programmes and will be giving much greater emphasis to sustainable development in professional and policy skills and leadership development programmes. More programmes will be developed which directly address sustainability issues and links are being made to emerging areas of work such as the Egan Skills for Sustainable Communities Review.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-04a.222616.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-04a.1082W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1111" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="1082W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050404/text/50404w02.htm#50404w02.html_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/1">The Government are acutely aware of the link between agriculture and the environment and agreed the role of farmers as custodians of the countryside to be basic. The strategy for sustainable farming and food was launched in England in 2002 and sets out the basis for a new relationship between Government and the farming industry in England. At its heart is a drive to enable farmers to focus on their market, rather than on subsidies, while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/2">The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform deal of 2003 is central to the strategy. Farmers are now encouraged to meet the demands of the market, and there is no incentive to over-produce, because the link between subsidies and production has been broken. This will benefit society as a whole by reducing the negative environmental and animal welfare impacts of intensive farming.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/3">The cross compliance element of the CAP single payment scheme provides a new basis for agricultural subsidies, by linking them to delivery of important environmental and animal health and welfare standards. This will contribute to a number of strategy objectives by protecting soils, wildlife habitats and the landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/4">Further to this is the launch of environmental stewardship this spring which builds on cross compliance and replaces existing agri-environment schemes (environmentally sensitive areas, countryside stewardship and organic farming schemes). The aim of environmental stewardship will be to tackle countrywide environmental problems such as diffuse pollution, loss of biodiversity and landscape character, and damage to the historic environment. For the first time every farmer in England will be eligible to earn payments for undertaking environmental management on the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/5">Environmental stewardship has three elements:</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/6" class="italic">(i) Entry Level</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/7" class="indent">A whole farm scheme open to all farmers and land managers who agree to carry out basic environmental management. Farmers will be able to earn up to 30 per hectare annually for delivering straightforward, yet effective, work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/8" class="italic">(ii) Organic Entry Level</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/9" class="indent">A similar whole farm scheme, which offers organic management options to farmers with land registered as fully organic or in conversion to organic farming, with an organic inspection body approved by Defra. It provides payments of up to 60 per hectare annually for land entered into the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/10" class="italic">(iii) Higher Level</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/11" class="indent">Rewards more ambitious environmental management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/12">Together with the new CAP single payment scheme and cross-compliance, the new scheme will mark a watershed in the way England is farmed, and will continue to improve and build on the successes achieved through almost two decades of experience with the countryside stewardship, environmentally sensitive areas and organic farming schemes. There are a number of wide-ranging objectives, which go beyond those of the earlier schemes and include the protection of water and soil and flood management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.8/13">The Department is also committed to encouraging greater production of organic food, and has set out its strategy for achieving this in the action plan to develop organic food and farming in England, published in July 2002, and the Two Years On report, published in August last year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1086W.2/1">The Government are working with the industry on practical measures to reduce food miles in a way which is sustainable. The industry, particularly food retailers, has a crucial role to play in helping to reduce food miles. There are encouraging signs, notably in development of logistics planning and preparation of advice, but more could be done. Defra has commissioned research that is due to report this spring, analysing available data and making recommendations for indicators for measuring improvement.</p>

We do not envisage formal co-ordination in the Council on the issue of counter-terrorism in the G8 ahead of the Summit. However, the UK, as G8 presidency, maintains a dialogue on G8 counter-terrorism work with EU partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.1089W.7/2">In October 2003, the FCO and European Commission jointly organised the Europe United&quot; football tournament as part of the plans to celebrate EU enlargement. In early 2004 the FCO produced with Commission support booklets explaining the benefits of EU enlargement that were sent to the nine English regions and the devolved administrations. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April 2004</phrase>, there was 'Europe Day&mdash;Meet the Neighbours'&mdash;a jointly organised FCO-Commission project which celebrated EU enlargement.</p>

In addition, the European Parliament hired an Exhibition Space at the Europe Day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089W.7/4">The FCO and EU institutions also jointly fund a number of development projects aimed to assist accession states prior to their joining the European Union, under the 'Action Plans' scheme, which started in 1999 and the Global Opportunities Fund which started in 2003. The Global Opportunity Fund also has a broader focus beyond Europe. I will write to my hon. Friend with further details of joint funded projects under the Actions Plans the Global Opportunities Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089W.7/5">No jointly-funded projects are currently planned for this year, with the exception of the Action Plan and Global Opportunity Fund programmes.</p>

Another priority is to promote co-ordination between governments and international organisations to counter the threat of bioterrorism. At the same time, we are working to ensure that the commitment of both G8 partners and other countries to the Global Partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction leads to the continued effective implementation of collaborative projects to address legacy proliferation risks in partner countries in the Former Soviet Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094W.8/17">The drop in registrations between 1997 and 2004 is mostly attributable to the reduction in the re-registration period for patients from two years to 15 months. The figures also exclude patients treated in dental access centres (DACs) who are not registered. In 2004, there were some 375,000 episodes of treatment in the 48 DACs then in operation in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.8/18">During 2004, there was a large switch to personal dental services (PDS) in the PCT area. For patient registrations (or for where registration does not apply, patients seen in the past 15 months), the PDS number rose from 1,900 at the end of December 2003 to 47,200 at the end of December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.8/19">The Government remain determined to improve access to NHS dentistry and has introduced a number of initiatives which will help bring about improvements nationally and more locally. PCT funding for dentistry will increase by 19.3 per cent., from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Consequently, over &pound;250 million of additional resources will be provided by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.8/20">A NHS support team has been created to work with those PCTs which are experiencing most difficulty in terms of access. PCTs across East Lancashire, including Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale are benefiting from theefforts of the support team. The Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale PCT has so far received &pound;540,000 recurrently from the support team. &pound;28,000 has also been provided to the PCT as part of the dental access moneys provided to the Cumbria and Lancashire strategic health authority (SHA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.8/21">The PCT has facilitated some dental access sessions as part of the work of the four PDS schemes in the area. The PCT also has robust plans in place, which will also help to improve access levels over the next three years resulting in an additional 32,000 places for patients on dental lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.8/22">Although the PCT has so far not recruited any international dentists, it is participating in the SHA-wide scheme which is working towards boosting recruitment from this source.</p>

In 1994, the committee on medical aspects of food and nutrition policy recommended that the population average salt intake should be reduced by a third to six grams per day as an achievable target. This was endorsed by the SACN in 2003 and the Government set a target to reduce the average population intake to six grams per day by 2010 in line with the recommendation.</p>

The evidence of a causal link has also strengthened, although there is not a full consensus on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.11/2">The Department monitors all the key research in this area and has a range of expert advisers to inform policy. The Department is currently commissioning an academic 'expert topic review' of research on cannabis and mental health, with the aim that its findings will inform mental health promotion regarding cannabis and will also help us ensure our advice to mental health patients, their families and professionals continues to be comprehensive and up-to-date.</p>

Additionally, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend formally asked ACM D to review the recent research studies in this area and to advise on this. The Department will support this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.11/4">There is a range of current health promotion materials and drugs advice approved by the Department, which is aimed particularly at young people, that already draws attention to the important mental health risks of cannabis, including the risk that use can trigger serious mental, health problems. This will continue to be updated in the light of the emerging evidence.</p>

This is a formal process, but is used only as a last resort to meet high readiness operational commitments, and only where the demanded items are not available from other sources. Because of the impact on a given facet of the donor ship's capability, this is considered only when the donor ship is either reducing in readiness towards upkeep or disposal, or is already in upkeep.</p>

	<p pid="a.1115W.8/1">Sonar 2170 is a sonar system designed to provide anti-ship torpedo defence.

	<p pid="a.1115W.8/2">Surface ships whose military tasking is not assessed as exposing them to a high risk of torpedo attack will continue to be deployed without Sonar 2170. Those units assessed as facing lower levels of risk will continue to be protected by other measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.8/3">Sonar 2170 is a system which is designed for transfer from ship to ship. The system will be removed from ships if they are alongside for any length of time, for example during refits.</p>

If the claimant meets the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Refugee Convention, they are granted asylum. If they do not qualify for asylum, but there are other circumstances that make them particularly vulnerable and engage our obligations under the ECHR, they are granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave. If an application is refused, and any appeal is unsuccessful, then we expect the individual concerned to leave the UK voluntarily. If they do not, we consider that it is reasonable for us to enforce the return of that individual.</p>

The child poverty review highlighted the strong associations between youth crime, parental crime and child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.3/3">In order to tackle the poor outcomes associated with child poverty, and to improve the life chances of poor children, the Home Office has invested in a number of prevention programmes for children at risk of involvement in crime or substance misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.3/4">To break the cycle of youth offending and deprivation, the Home Office strategic plan includes a commitment to increase youth crime prevention programmes. This includes multi-agency youth inclusion and support panels, targeting high risk children and their families, providing them with support and improving their access to mainstream services. It also includes the youth inclusion programme, which targets the 13 to 16-year-olds most at risk of crime in 72 of the most deprived neighbourhoods. The numbers of both will be increased by 50 per cent. by 2008. We have also increased the coverage of intensive supervision and surveillance programme (ISSPs).</p>

Positive Futures aims to</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-04a.223021.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-04a.1125W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1084" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" colnum="1125W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050404/text/50404w15.htm#50404w15.html_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1125W.3/1">Home Office quantitative polling research included four questions about holocaust memorial day (HMD) in the August 2004 and February 2005 surveys. The February 2005 research findings show a significant increase in awareness with 77 per cent. of those interviewed having heard of HMD (compared with 53 per cent. in August 2004) and 66 per cent. agreeing that events like HMD have an important part to play in combating racism and discrimination (compared with 51 per cent. in August 2004).</p>
	<p pid="a.1125W.3/2">To give a comparison, in February 2004 a BBC survey revealed only 55 per cent. of the UK's population had ever heard of Auschwitz. A new BBC survey conducted in January 2005 has shown that now 94 per cent. of the population in the UK has heard of Auschwitz. This awareness is not just superficial, with half of the UK population feeling that they now know quite a lot about the holocaust, compared to only 30 per cent. last year. In establishing HMD the Government wanted to drive up awareness and understanding of the holocaust. The televised national event in January, preceded by a reception for survivors at St. James's Palace in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen and supported by other media programming about the holocaust, has succeeded in this aim. Understanding the continuum of hatred and marginalisation that led from racist abuse to mass genocide will help new generations to stand up to anti-semitism, racism and intolerance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1125W.3/3">The 2005 commemoration provides an excellent basis for the work of the new Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, which will shortly be launched and will assume responsibility for the delivery of HMD from now on.</p>

	<p pid="a.1131W.2/1">I hope to have the opportunity to visit staff at the three prisons on the Isle of Sheppey in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131W.2/2">We are announcing one competition relating to prisons at this time. No decision has yet been taken about the future programme. If the public sector Prison Service is successful in its bid for running prisons on the Isle of Sheppey, there will be no changes to terms of employment of prison staff as a result of the competition. Should the public sector Prison Service be unsuccessful in its bid for running prisons on the Isle of Sheppey, then management of the undertaking&quot; will transfer to the private sector bidder.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131W.2/3">All staff will form part of the undertaking&quot; and will therefore transfer to the new employers under the protection of TUPE (Transfer of Undertaking; Protection of Employment Act). TUPE provides that staff will transfer on such existing terms and conditions as those provided by the previous employer and thereafter changes in such terms and conditions will be negotiated directly between the new employer and the employees/recognised trade union as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131W.2/4">Pension arrangements for such staff have to be broadly comparable&quot; and within guidelines established by the Cabinet Office entitled Fair Deal on Pensions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131W.2/5">Additionally, the recent establishment of the Code of Practice on Two-Tier Workforce, agreed by both the TUC and CBI, now makes provision that any new staff joining the transferred undertaking after the date of transfer must be employed on comparable terms and conditions as the existing workforce, hence creating a level playing&quot; field in terms of competition between bidders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1132W.2/1">The use of operational techniques in police investigations is an operational matter for the police. The Association of Chief Police Officers have advised that dip-sampling&quot;, also referred to as trawling&quot;, is rarely used during the course of police investigations. The use of dip-sampling&quot; is invariably limited to investigations involving allegations of historical sex abuse in care or residential homes, where the police need to identify any corroborating evidence relating to the allegations under investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1132W.5/2">Ihave no current plans to revise the current Statutory Code of Practice on the duty to promote race equality under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. The Statutory Code encourages public authorities to use the same ethnic classification system as the one used in the2001 census, but it does provide public authorities with a degree of flexibility to add extra ethnic categories to fit their particular circumstances, providing these fit in with the census categories. This approach ensures consistency, allowing comparisons to be made over time and across different areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133W.6/1">According to figures from the British Crime Survey (BCS), which are the most reliable indicator of long-term trends in violence in England and Wales, there were an estimated 2.52 million violent incidents in the 12 months to September 2004. Levels of violent crime are now stable after significant falls since the latter part of the 1990s&mdash;36 per cent. down from a peak in 1995 and 26 per cent. down from 1997. The fear of violent crime has also fallen steadily since 1998, with the proportion of adults with a high level of concern about violent crime down from 21 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 16 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.6/2">Half of all violent incidents reported to the BCS in 2003&ndash;04 did not result in injury to the victim. However, this does not mean that public concern about violent crime is unjustified or that the ordeal of victims is not traumatic, even if injury has not occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.6/3">Recorded violent crime has risen since 1997, reaching 1.1 million incidents in 2003&ndash;04, but these data are affected by changes in reporting and recording practices. The Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime were amended in 1998 to include a large number of offences particularly in the less serious violence categories. The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 also resulted in an increase in recorded crime. The effect of the change on the reported level of violent crime was estimated to be an increase of 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.6/4">In addition, more violent crimes are being recorded by the police as public tolerance of violence in the family or by acquaintances diminishes. Along with a more proactive response from the police, more crimes that would have previously been unreported are finding their way into the official figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1135W.3/1">No recent research has been commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister into the availability of glacial gravels and aggregate resources in Northamptonshire. However, the British Geological Survey, funded through the Sustainable Land-Won and Marine Dredged Aggregate Minerals Programme, which is administered by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair's Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund, is currently researching aggregate resource availability in the Milton Keynes and South Midlands Sub-Region, an area that includes Northamptonshire. One of the objectives of this project is to collect new data on the sand and gravel resources, including those of a glacial origin, which occur in the study area. The project is expected to report in November 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137W.0/1">It is for Brentwood borough council to assess the need for Gypsy and Traveller sites in its area. The Housing Act 2004 will require that local authorities, when assessing local housing need should include the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers, and that they should develop a strategy on how to meet the needs identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.0/2">Assessments of housing need are co-ordinated at the regional level and provide input to the revision of regional spatial strategies (RSS). Guidance in the draft circular Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Sites&quot; proposes that where there is an assessment of unmet need for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation in the area the regional spatial strategy and development plan documents at local level should allocate land to meet those needs. The RSS should set out how the required number of pitches for Gypsies and Travellers might vary between constituent authorities. Development plan documents at local level should then allocate land to meet those needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.0/3">In advance of provision in revised regional spatial strategies local authorities have a range of information available to them to inform the development of local policies and plans, including the twice-yearly caravan count, waiting lists for public sites and incidents of unauthorised encampment, and their own assessments.</p>

It also sets out plans to reduce homelessness further and halve the use of temporary accommodation by 2010.

	<p pid="a.1145W.5/1">Within a local strategic partnership (LSP), individual partners will remain responsible and accountable for decisions on their own services and the use of their own resources. Accountability to the partnership, therefore, cannot override these individual commitments. The LSP partner organisations already have established lines of accountability, to their own customers and the wider community. LSP accountability arrangements need to build on these frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.5/2">While local authorities are legally required to prepare community strategies, in the community strategy guidance they are encouraged to see LSPs as the vehicle to determine and deliver these.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.5/3">For the 88 areas receiving neighbourhood renewal fund (NRF) resources, although the local authority remains the accountable body, ultimately it is the responsibility of the LSP to determine their allocation with the aim of meeting the partners' strategic priorities, improving public services in the most deprived neighbourhoods, and contributing to the achievement of public sector agreement (PSA) targets to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest.</p>

	<p pid="a.1145W.8/1">A local strategic partnership (LSP) is a non-statutory, non executive organisation which brings together public, private, voluntary and community interests to work together more effectively to improve the quality of life in their area. There is no one model for the structure of a LSP nor is an area obliged to set one up; what works in one area may not work in another. As such this information is not held centrally by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister but the Government Offices (GOs) would have this information.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146W.5/1">Local strategic partnerships (LSPs) are voluntary bodies and have no statutory responsibilities. They rely on the goodwill of their partners to operate. Therefore they are not required to develop any formal performance management mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146W.5/2">However, LSPs in receipt of neighbourhood renewal funds resources have all now developed performance management frameworks. This is primarily a self-assessment process. To ensure the process is robust, since 2004 Government offices have undertaken an annual review, with the outcomes of performance management forming the basis of these reviews. Government offices provide the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with a report on each of the 88 LSPs in September each year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1152W.2/1">The Teacher Training Agency's commitment to increase the recruitment of trainees from minority ethnic backgrounds to 9 per cent. of the allocated training places has been a priority since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/2">In 2004, the provisional figures for entry to initial teacher training show that 2,934 trainees (9.1 per cent.) were from a minority ethnic background. This is an increase of 759 (35 per cent.) additional trainees recruited since 2002. Despite meeting the 9 per cent. target, it remains a priority for the agency to further increase recruitment of trainee teachers from a minority ethnic background.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/3">There are approximately 350,000 school governor places at maintained schools in England. 12 per cent. of serving governors are from a minority ethnic background.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/4">Responsibility for the recruitment and appointment of school governors is shared between local authorities, schools themselves and any relevant body&mdash;such as a faith organisation&mdash;for schools with foundations. These local organisations are best placed to identify the most successful ways to recruit good quality, suitable candidates. The Department supports the recruitment activities of schools and LEAs by providing the generic Help Schools Help Children recruitment leaflets, available in 11 minority languages, and a recruitment toolkit. Additionally, since November 1999, the Department has funded the School Governors' One Stop Shop (SGOSS) to recruit school governor volunteers with transferable skills from the business world. Since their establishment SGOSS have identified 6,437 candidates. Of these candidates 3,047 have already been appointed to governing bodies, with 18 per cent. coming from a minority ethnic background.</p>

DfES, the Food Standards Agency and People 1st are developing the content of a school catering qualification that will provide basic knowledge of this subject, and we envisage the recently announced School Food Trust will consider this and other issues related to training school kitchen staff in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1174W.5/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> there will be a facility for pension scheme members to commute trivial pensions and take the pension as a lump sum, where pension benefits have a total capital value of less than 1 per cent. of the lifetime allowance. The lifetime allowance will be &pound;1.5 million at its introduction in April 2006, rising to &pound;1.8 million by 2010. So, at the introduction of the simplified tax regime, the trivial commutation threshold will be &pound;15,000. People in this position will be able to choose a year falling between their 60th and 75th birthdays in which all trivial pensions may be commuted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.5/2">The trivial commutation rules ensure that members will not be forced to purchase an annuity with very small amounts of pension savings which could prove to be uneconomic and disproportionately bureaucratic for both schemes and members.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.5/3">The rules are the result of extensive consultation prior to legislation. As part of this consultation the Government published Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing flexibility for all&quot; (December 2002) and Simplifying the taxation of pensions: the Government's proposals&quot; (December 2003).</p>

	<p pid="a.1177W.0/16">Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week, where the head of the household is not disabled, and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177W.0/17">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &pound;2,500, disregarding the first &pound;2,500 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177W.0/18">As a result of the Government's reforms, around half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children. The number of heads that face an excess of 70 per cent. has fallen.

	<p pid="a.1190W.11/1">Regulations introduced under Part5 of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) require that all new public service vehicles used on local and scheduled service with a carrying capacity of more than 22 passengers, and all new rail vehicles, have to be accessible to disabled people. In addition, duties under Part 3 of the DDA require service providers to take reasonable steps to provide access to transport infrastructure such as bus and railway stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.11/2">Prior to July 2000 the Government provided funding to improve access to public transport through the Transport Policies and Programme (TPP) system. Local authorities were allocated funding for individual schemes on an annual basis. This system was replaced by the Local Transport Plan (LTP) process which takes a more strategic approach. Local transport authorities in England outside London produce 5-year LTPs, and report on progress against these plans in Annual Progress Reports (APRs). The first 5-year plans were submitted in 2000. The following table details the funding for bus grant schemes since their introduction in the 1998&ndash;99 financial year, allocated nationally and to the Central Leicestershire Local Transport Plan area, which includes Leicester, South. Decisions on how to target funding towards specific projects and initiatives such as those to improve public transport accessibility are made at local level.</p>

The duty of Best Value, as laid down in legislation, requires authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which they exercise their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Best Value recognises that successful procurement strategies are likely to be based on whole life cost considerations that include subsequent revenue implications, and not simply the lowest initial tender price.</p>

	<p pid="a.1195W.3/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's recently published Five Year Plan, 'Sustainable Communities: Homes for All' set out our proposals for housing, including expenditure plans for the next two years, in the context of our longer term Sustainable Communities Plan. This takes a co-ordinated approach to the provision of affordable housing, including not only additional financial resources&mdash;expenditure of &pound;2billion in 2007&ndash;08, more than double the 1997 level, for new social rented housing and home ownership initiatives, plus more for PFI&mdash;as well as changes to the planning system so that it can help authorities deliver more affordable housing. All these policies apply fully to rural areas, where we are committed to addressing housing needs and have already more than doubled the provision of affordable housing in small settlements funded through the Housing Corporation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.3/2">The provision of affordable housing in high demand areas, including rural areas and market towns, is one of the priorities identified in the current Regional Housing Strategy for Yorkshire and the Humber and its accompanying Investment Framework. The Regional Housing Board's current two year investment plan for affordable housing delivered by the Housing Corporation includes 45 dwellings in the Vale of York. The board is also helping to fund the extra care housing scheme at Easingwold, Hambleton district council's Young Single Homeless scheme and affordable housing initiatives in the 'Golden Triangle' high demand, high price area including north Leeds, Harrogate and York. These priorities continue into the board's revised draft strategy, which is currently out for consultation. Sub-regional housing partnerships are currently working on their investment proposals for 2006&ndash;08 for submission to the board and subsequent approval by me later this year, and I would expect to see them appropriately reflect the needs of the Vale of York. Recently completed research into 'Rural Housing in the Yorkshire and Humber Region' for the Housing Corporation and the Countryside Agency will help in addressing rural housing needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.3/3">However, it is important to make full use of all opportunities to provide additional affordable housing where it is needed. There are already good achievements by Vale of York authorities in using the planning system to deliver affordable housing, and I hope that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's recent changes to Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 will help them to do more. I was also pleased to recently give approval to North Yorkshire county council to implement an affordable housing scheme using their share of the proceeds from the flexibility that we gave local authorities to reduce the council tax discount for second homes. The first phase comprises a proposed county-wide programme with an investment of almost &pound;12 million, including 15 dwellings in the Vale of York.</p>

	<p pid="a.1198W.8/1">The Bretton Woods institutions confirm that most areas of off-budget spending in Angola decreased in 2004. However, much more progress has to be made to eradicate this practice completely. The next mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Angola is expected in early April. The purpose of this mission is to conclude negotiations on the start of a Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) which will, among other things, focus on bringing all revenue and expenditure into the annual budget process in a transparent fashion. Fiscal discipline is another area which the Ministry of Finance itself has identified as a national priority. DFID, working together with the World Bank, is planning to fund a training programme in budgetary processes including fiscal discipline for line ministry staff at both the central and provincial levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1198W.8/2">As regards transparency of oil revenues, including taxes from the oil industry, Angola has taken several significant steps forward. These include full annual financial audits of Sonangol, the state oil company, and publication of up-to-date oil revenues by production blocks on the website of the Ministry of Finance. The UK continues actively to encourage the Government of Angola to make progress on the remaining components of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). One other important issue which the IMF will be raising during its forthcoming mission is how the Government intends to use the windfall resulting from higher than expected oil prices. The first step will be to declare how much additional revenue has accrued and then to ensure that these funds are incorporated transparently into the annual budget system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1200W.8/1">DFID has had no recent discussions with either the Cuban or US Government concerning Cuban humanitarian assistance to South and Central American countries, nor a multilateral approach to humanitarian aid between Cuba and the EU and US. Representatives of HMG have had wide-ranging discussions with the Cuban authorities, including on their relations with South and Central American countries. Cuba provides technical assistance to a number of countries in the region, most notably Venezuela, but no assessment of its effectiveness has been shared by the Cuban Government or been made independently. Following Hurricane Ivan DFID contributed &pound;50,000 to Cuba through the Regional Appeal of the International Federation of the Red Cross.

	<p pid="a.1201W.2/2">Animal husbandry is dominant in the rural economy of much of Darfur. Animals are raised for sale outside the state, traded and consumed locally, used as beasts of burden and, less frequently, to provide traction for farm equipment. So livestock is central to prospects for economic recovery in the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.2/3">In Darfur, DFID support includes &pound;1 million to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), who provide veterinarian support for livestock. This includes the provision of feed and health care to donkeys, small ruminants, and chickens both in camps and outside. In addition the programme includes provision for the training of community animal health monitors. We are continuing DFID support of these projects into the next financial year 2005&ndash;06 through a $4.5 million (approximately &pound;2.3 million) contribution to the FAO under the UN Workplan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.2/4">However, before there can be any economic progress in Darfur, either livestock-based or otherwise, there will need to be an end to the conflict. The crisis in Darfur is caused by the conflict between the Darfur rebels and the Sudanese Government and can end only through a political, negotiated settlement in line with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in January this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.2/5">The UK is pressing all parties to abide and implement the ceasefire and humanitarian and security protocols which they have signed, and is supporting the on-going African Union-mediated Abuja Peace Talks. DFID has also provided &pound;14 million in support to the African Union observer mission that is there to monitor the ceasefire agreement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1201W.5/2">The latest UN's Humanitarian Needs Profile covers a conflict affected population of 2.1 million people and indicates that 93 per cent. of this population is not receiving assistance for agriculture and livestock.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.5/3">This gap is explained by the fact that funding is prioritised against immediate needs such as food, water, primary health care, and sanitation. In Darfur, assistance towards medium-term concerns is compromised by the scale of emergency needs and the degree of armed insecurity on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.5/4">The poor security situation hampers access to arable land and progress on community development programmes. These include agricultural and livestock assistance. The situation is further exacerbated by the onset of severe drought in the region, with the most immediate concern being the provision of food.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.5/5">To this end, of the &pound;70 million in humanitarian assistance that the UK is providing to Sudan for the financial year 2005&ndash;06, &pound;40 million is being channelled through the UN Workplan which is being disbursed based on recommendations by the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Sudan. 59 per cent. of the Workplan is for food aid in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1201W.5/6">In the long-term, it is only through a political process to which both sides are committed that the situation in Darfur can be resolved and crucial assistance given towards key needs, including the re-development of agriculture and livestock.</p>

	<p pid="a.1202W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-24">24 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/2">The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) undertakes the implementation of its Emergency Assistance Programme through International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs). The FAO has been in Darfur for four years, but has worked previously with its implementing partners in other areas of Sudan. As such they have built up a good professional relationship based on mutual trust and responsibility. From previous reporting by the UN, as well as from my officials following monitoring visits and discussions within Sudan, I have confidence in the FAO's capability to implement their project proposals in this very difficult environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/3">The UK has already funded the FAO project 'Emergency Assistance (Agriculture and Livestock)' with a contribution of &pound;1 million (2004&ndash;05). This was agreed on the basis of in-depth dialogue with the FAO in Sudan. DFID has supplemented this with an additional contribution of $4.5million (&pound;2.3 million) to the FAO, as part of DFID's contributions to the UN Workplan. Timely disbursements of funds are of especial importance to the FAO, as it needs to plan ahead so it has inputs available at the key points in the agricultural calendar.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/4">This year DFID is piloting in Sudan some of the reforms to the International System that I have proposed on humanitarian reform supported by the Organisation for Co-ordination Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), notably empowering the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator (UNHC). The aim is for the UNHC to take the lead on responsibility for needs assessments, planning, and resource allocation. DFID funding to UN agencies this year is being channelled through the UNHC who is responsible for allocating funds to UN agencies against priority needs. This most recent FAO contribution from-DFID (of $4.5million) forms part of his prioritised allocations for the first tranche of money (&pound;14 million) we have made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/5">In the Emergency Assistance project cereal seed is being procured locally (59.5 metric tons), some of which has already been delivered. The FAO is responsible for delivering the seed to the three regional capitals of the Darfur region where it is handed over to the INGOs. INGOs have identified a number of specific vulnerable groups totalling 261,000 families who have access to land at the moment. This equates to over 1,000,000 direct beneficiaries. These INGOs are then responsible for delivering directly to the families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/6">Overall monitoring and evaluation is the responsibility of the FAO who have to ensure appropriate performance of their implementing INGO partners. Co-ordination of these activities is carried out by the Food Security Co-ordination meeting, which is held bi-weekly in each of the Darfur regional capitals. The FAO will be reporting on their performance this year to both DFID and the UNHC. In addition, through DFID's humanitarian and livelihoods advisers in Khartoum and London, we will be undertaking monitoring of this programme during the course of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/7">The FAO has stressed that there still remains a considerable shortfall in the amount of seed required (855MT), but there still remains sufficient time to purchase and distribute as the rains will not be expected until a further two months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/8" class="italic">Veterinary Equipment:</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/9">This has been purchased in Sudan and distributed to the three Darfur capitals. The equipment is dispatched to the INGOs who then distribute it to selected Community Animal Health Workers (CAHW). This cadre of staff has been selected by the community and trained by the INGOs. They are paid a small stipend by the INGO which is reimbursed by the FAO. Again, all activities are monitored and evaluated by the INGOs. Pertinent issues can and are raised in community dialogue in formal and informal manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/10" class="italic">Medicine/Vaccine:</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/11">These have been purchased in Khartoum and distributed through the same mechanism as above.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/12" class="italic">Food/Fodder:</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/13">A supplementary feed (concentrate pellets) for feeding is purchased in Sudan. Again, this is distributed by the INGOs direct to the beneficiaries with monitoring carried out by the CAHW.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.2/14">The FAO has a Letter of Agreement (LOA) with each of its INGOs to purchase fodder in the local market. The implementing partner then agrees a sub-contract with a private contractor to deliver the fodder to them, which is then distributed direct to the beneficiaries and again monitored by the CAHW. This component is strongly linked to issues on protection. Women are usually required to go out and gather fodder, but have been subject to rape and violence when moving outside of camps. This intervention will help to minimise the risk.</p>

However natural resource management has been identified in our country engagement plan as one of the key areas of possible future UK support to the DRC. We are developing a DRC natural resources strategy, due later this year, which will indicate the nature of any likely support, including the forestry sector amongst others. DFID also keeps in regular touch with the World Bank and non-governmental organisations on forestry issues in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.3/1">The UK Government are fully committed to a framework of rules for world trade that is fair as well as free, that works in the interests of the world's poor, and provides developing countries the opportunity to trade themselves out of poverty. This can only be achieved through the multilateral system, particularly the world trade organisations (WTO) and the current round of negotiations, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA).</p>

For example during negotiations between the EU and African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries over Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) we are working to ensure EPAs are designed to deliver long-term development, economic growth and poverty reduction in ACP countries. The UK Government also works closely with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international bodies such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to ensure developing countries receive support to engage in trade negotiations and integrate progressively into the global trading system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1205W.0/1">Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa with 90 per cent. of a population of over 8 million people earning their livelihoods from the land. Most families operate at the level of subsistence agriculture, producing almost entirely for their own consumption. Tenure of some 90 per cent. of the arable land in Rwanda is currently based upon customary rights, with no formal written title. Rwanda faces the challenge of trying to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in an economy largely dependent upon unsustainable, low productivity subsistence agriculture, while at the same time addressing a historical legacy of land disputes in the interests of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/2">Rwanda's Draft National Land Policy (June 2004) has the overall objective</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/3" class="indent">to establish a land tenure system that guarantees tenure security for all Rwandans and give guidance to the necessary land reforms with a view to good management and rational use of national land resources&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/4" class="italic">Safeguards for the Livelihoods of the Rural Poor</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/5">The draft policy and land law include provisions that contribute to safeguarding the livelihoods of the poor in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/6" class="indent">Prohibition of any discrimination in land ownership or rights</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/7" class="indent">Preservation of existing land rights</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/8" class="indent">Limiting to an absence of 10 years on the right of refugees to claim back previously owned land now occupied by others</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/9" class="indent">Assertion that water is a public good to which everybody has access</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/10" class="indent">Provision of a land reserve, for allocation to landless people</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/11" class="indent">Local consultation for all proposed schemes for plot consolidation and compensation either financially or in kind where appropriate</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/12" class="indent">Administration of land belonging to genocide orphans under 18 years of age on their behalf until they come of age, and assistance to vulnerable orphans above 18 and widows in developing their land.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/13">However, the draft land law gives the government and its officials considerable administrative powers in order to achieve its policy objectives. Protecting the livelihoods of the rural poor will depend upon the way in which these powers are exercised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/14" class="italic">Likely impact upon security in Rwanda</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/15">A lack of consistent policy and an absence of procedure for dealing with land was a contributory factor in the conflict in Rwanda that culminated in the genocide in 1994. The land reforms seek to remedy this and hopefully make an important contribution to achieving long-term peace and security in Rwanda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/16" class="italic">How the UK will engage with Rwanda on the issue of land reform</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/17">DFID has been providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Land in Rwanda since August 2002 and supported the development of the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation in Rwanda&quot;. From this engagement we judge that the Government of Rwanda are sincere in their intentions of taking forward land reform in the best interests of all Rwandan people. The Government have noted that the land reform process will take at least 10 years and that the procedures envisaged in the policy and law will need to be carefully tested before they are implemented across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1205W.0/18">DFID's Rwanda programme is planning to provide support to produce a road map&quot; for the implementation of the land reform proposals. The support will focus on consultation with those affected by the land reform proposals; will test approaches to land reform based upon local priorities and provide the required, structured training for the Ministry of Land and other key Government of Rwanda staff involved in land reform.</p>

There is of course a process that has to be gone through in which the views of developing countries are important. It is the Bank's board which makes the decision, and it is important that this is a transparent process. The UK Government are interested in Mr. Wolfowitz's vision for the future of the World Bank in reducing international poverty at a time when the need to make much faster progress has never been clearer.</p>

The report, which was published in February 2005, addresses concerns on the part of the microgeneration community (which includes domestic consumers who install microgeneration technologies) about access to the benefits of these schemes. The report makes recommendations on bulk processing of applications, meter data provision and sell and buy back&quot; contracts as well as recommendations to streamline the schemes and make them more user-friendly. Jade Energy's report is available on the DGCG's website (<a href="http://www.distributed-generation.gov.uk">www.distributed-generation. gov.uk</a>).</p>

In developing the Government's strategy on microgeneration, I will be assessing the usefulness of various measures including improving access to ROCs, LECs and REGOs, taking account of, among other things, the Jade Energy report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1221W.8/2">Plants which handled plutonium waste drums at Sellafield operate under safety cases. These define the level of reliability required from instrument systems measuring the waste. Reliability varies according to the nature of the operations being conducted, but in all cases in instrument systems the required reliability levels. Both the safety cases and the substantiation process comply with industry standards and are subject to inspection by industry regulators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1221W.8/3">It is normal for safety cases to require instrument systems to add to the reported plutonium figures an allowance for reasonable measurement uncertainties. The margin by which the results are overestimated depends on the specifics of the particular instrument system and upon the physical properties of the waste within each drum. In some cases this margin can be a significant fraction of the reported figure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1222W.6/1">We do not have estimates for the number of wild bird deaths from each wind turbine in the UK. However, we are not aware of any UK wind farms that have been associated with substantial adverse impacts on birds. As part of the planning process for wind farms in the UK, developers have to provide environmental assessments of their proposals which consider impacts on a range of factors, including those related to birds. The assessments are considered by the nature conservation agencies (English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales) and are made available for public scrutiny so other organisations such as the RSPB and local bird clubs can offer comments on the suitability of wind farm locations. The DTI advises wind farm developers to make early contact with these organisations as part of their preparatory planning for wind farm projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1222W.6/2">Experience from other countries shows that badly sited wind farms can have impacts on birds, for example, Altamont Pass in California where there is extensive wind development and also a high year-round raptor use which has led to high bird mortality rates. This should be kept in the context of the existing background bird mortality from collision with, for example, buildings and vehicles which is far greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.1222W.6/3">I understand that research from Denmark suggests that birds, by day or night, tend to change their flight route some 100&ndash;200 metres before a turbine and so pass above it at a safe distance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1223W.5/1">The Government, together with their European partners, are playing a positive role in supporting WIPO's work on the development-related aspects of IP. Our efforts build on commitments given in our response to the 2002 report on the subject by the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights. Specifically, the Patent Office is engaged in making and discussing proposals with WIPO officials, developed and developing countries aiming towards an IP system which enables developing countries to make best use of their innovative and creative activity so as to achieve social and economic progress. We must also ensure that the legitimate interests of those holding intellectual property are properly protected to facilitate wider international investment in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1223W.5/2">In November 2004, the WIPO Standing Committee on copyright and related rights considered a proposal by Chile that the committee should address the subject of exceptions to rights for the purposes of education, libraries and disabled persons. A constructive exchange resulted in full support from those present, including the United Kingdom, for further discussion at the committee's next session planned for later this year.</p>

We remain deeply troubled by all abuses carried out against the ordinary people of Nepal, both by the state and the Maoists, and remain committed to improving the human rights situation in Nepal. We are seeking to do this through a number of means, including by continuing to fund human rights organisations and remaining engaged with the Nepalese National Human Rights Commission. We are also seeking to effect change through the UN Commission for Human Rights and are currently working with our international partners to find the best way to take this forward. Unless radical progress is made in the short term, we will be looking to secure a robust statement calling for the release of all political prisoners, the restoration of fundamental rights and an appropriate mechanism for human rights monitoring.

The Government's defence interest in LSD began in the early 1950s because of its perceived potential as an incapacitant and/or interrogation aid. The 1953&ndash;54 LSD tests were but a small part of the continuing Porton Down volunteer test programme.

In addition, the UK has taken a leading role in a Europe wide review of this issue. Having reviewed all the available evidence, CSM has advised that selective COX-2 inhibitors should not be used in patients with heart disease or previous stroke, but should remain an option for other patients, with whom the balance of benefits and risk may be favourable.

	<p pid="a.1242W.3/1">Information on the incidence, changing levels of head louse infestation or acquired immunity to insecticides in lice is not collected centrally. Advice on tackling infestation, and thereby reducing incidence, has been issued by the Department. Further assistance is available from the primary health care team, which includes health visitors, school nurses, general practitioners and community pharmacists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1242W.3/2">A number of lotions are licensed for the safe and effective treatment of head lice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency keeps the safety and efficacy of treatments under review and will cancel or restrict the licence of products which fail in terms of safety and/or efficacy. The Department also funds a voluntary group, Community Hygiene Concern, which promotes the Bug Busting approach to controlling infestation, which does not rely on lotions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1244W.8/1">The procurement of pork and bacon within the English national health service has to comply with the European Union Procurement Legislation, as the value of meat and poultry consumed by the English NHS is in excess of the threshold values contained within the legislation. The framework agreements covering these products, developed by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (NHS PASA), influence approximately 70 per cent. of the requirements of the NHS in England and aim to deliver best value for money in terms of price, quality and service from contracted suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.8/2">The specifications employed by NHS PASA were created with the Meat and Livestock Commission and Louchry College in Ireland. For the pork and bacon products, the specifications call for all suppliers to comply with the NHS code of practice for the manufacture, distribution and supply of food, ingredients and food related products; additionally, along with a wider range of criteria, the specifications call for pigs to be slaughtered and processed on European Commission, or equivalent, approved premises and the labelling must include the country of origin. Provided that it satisfies the NHS code of practice, NHS PASA would purchase pork, bacon and ham carrying the British Pig Executive's quality standards mark if it represented value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.8/3">Over the past 12 months, in excess of 86 per cent. of the pork joints, chops, mince, loin steaks etc. procured against NHS PASA's framework agreements were sourced from pigs originating from the United Kingdom. In terms of bacon, approximately 50 per cent. of the bacon sourced from NHS PASA's contracted butchers was of UK origin. The remaining countries of origin were mainly Holland and Denmark.</p>

	<p pid="a.1245W.3/5">However, it has in fact delivered 2,776 additional patient registrations as at the end of February 2005. It is estimated that this figure will increase by approximately 600 within the next six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1245W.3/6">Chesterfield PCT is keen to increase dental services in North Derbyshire. The Department has encouraged PCTs to be proactive in establishing early entry into the personal dental service (PDS). Orthodontic PDS will allow development of orthodontic services in the community and thereby reduce the waiting list for secondary care services. The PCT has pursued this goal and has developed good relationships with practice owners. It already has six early PDS practices and one more due to go live in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.1245W.3/7">North Derbyshire PCTs have the following access agreements: four sessions per week with a practice in Clay Cross (in North Eastern Derbyshire PCT) and out of hours service for registered and non-registered patients for three hours during the evening on weekdays and three hours per day weekends and bank holidays at Scarsdale (within Chesterfield PCT).</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.8/1">The recent visit made by staff from the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) was to New Zealand, rather than Australia and the Far East. The purpose of the visit was to attend the International Institute of Mental Health Leaders conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.8/2">The visit to NZ is part of an international initiative to promote effective leadership of mental health services sponsored by the Department in England and the equivalent bodies in the United States of America, NZ and Australia.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.8/3">The NIMHE paid for 11 people to visit NZ, which included a national service user (and his carer) and a national carer representative. All air travel arrangements were made following guidance issued by the Department. The total cost NIMHE was &pound;24,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.8/4">Examples of learning by involvement in the International Initiative Mental Health Leadership exchanges and conference encompassed seeing how NZ is taking a leading role internationally in tackling issues of direct relevance to services in the United Kingdom, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.8/5" class="indent">Engaging the voluntary and independent sector in playing a major role in providing mental health services&mdash;30 per cent. of services in NZ are delivered by this sector compared to less than 10 per cent. in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.8/6" class="indent">Developing innovative models of mental health service delivery for a complex multicultural society (35 per cent. of the population), which reflects the key role of families and local communities in supporting recovery.</p>

	<p pid="a.1250W.2/1">The Human Tissue Act 2004 makes clear that where an adult has, while alive and competent, given consent for one or more of the scheduled purposes to take place following their death, then that consent is sufficient for the activity to be lawful. In these circumstances, therefore, a relative of the deceased person may not refuse permission for the deceased's organs to be donated, but there may be cases in which donation may not be practicable. The Human Tissue Authority will be responsible for preparing codes of practice that set out what is lawful and the procedures to be followed to implement the Act.

	<p pid="a.1253W.12/1">The information is not available in the form requested. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>, there were 16,215 households (19,615 individuals) in the Coventry local authority area in receipt of pension credit. Information on numbers of households or individuals eligible for pension credit is not available at local authority or constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.12/2">This Government's priority when we came to office was to tackle the legacy of pensioner poverty. We continue to do this by targeting help on today's poorest pensioners and by encouraging all pensioners to receive the benefits they are entitled to. At the same time, the Government believes that empowering individuals to make real and informed choices about working and saving for retirement is fundamental if they are to make sure people get the income in retirement they expect. Pension credit rewards those who have worked hard to provide modest incomes for themselves in retirement. Income-testing of benefits has existed since before and after the creation of the Welfare State in 1948. With the introduction of pension credit, and the ease by which it can be applied for, we have moved away from the stigmatising weekly means tests of the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.1257W.2/1">The table shows the number of calls about pension credit made by staff in the pension credit application line between April 2004, when such calls were first made, and February 2005. These calls were not made 'cold' but were either to pensioners who were judged likely to be eligible for pension credit to ask if they wish to apply, or to those who had been sent a completed application form to sign and return but had not yet done so. All those who receive a telephone call would already have received at least one letter about pension credit, including one informing them that a call might be made. It is not possible to break down the figures by constituency or the time at which they were made. Some calls about pension credit have also been made by departmental staff outside the pension credit application line. Figures for these are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257W.2/2">The Pension Service uses a range of data to identify those who are potentially eligible for pension credit, including age, gender, marital status, receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit and an affluence measure based on postcode. Information on the number of people who received a telephone call and went on to make a successful or unsuccessful application for pension credit is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257W.2/3">The Pension Service issued 807,000 letters about pension credit between <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1263W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. David Willetts dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the number of offices we have and the number that will close due to the roll-out of the new service and the centralisation of benefit processing. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/4" class="indent">When Jobcentre Plus was formed in 2002 we inherited the infrastructure of the former Employment Service and those parts of the Benefits Agency delivering services to people of working age. The estate comprised some 1,100 Jobcentres and 450 social security offices and was entirely unsuitable for delivering the new service and operating the new processes. Over a four year period we are introducing the new, integrated service across the country and we are acquiring, building and refurbishing premises to enable us to deliver the new service. Once the roll-out is completed nationwide the total number of outlets from which our services can be accessed is likely to be around 1000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/5" class="indent">A full list of sites already closed or planned for future closure as part of the Jobcentre Plus rollout programme can be found in the Library. This list includes a number of sites which are closing through merging with co-located offices. While the majority of these sites will be disposed of in due course, a number will be retained by Jobcentre Plus to accommodate non-customer facing activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/6" class="indent">I should stress that this is a snapshot of our plans based on the best information available. The list of offices will inevitably change as we progress through rollout of the new, integrated service and continue to refine our plans for centralising benefit processing in Jobcentre Plus. For example, a significant number of the site closures are dependent on construction of new buildings or acquisition of new premises and these are often subject to delays and other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/7" class="indent">We continue to review the plans for our network, and will ensure that local stakeholders are kept informed of progress and any changes to our plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1268W.5/2">Currently, crime reduction funding is allocated directly to local crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) through the building safer communities fund and to basic command unit (BCU) commanders through the BCU fund. These funding streams finance a variety of interventions, including CCTV, to tackle local crime priorities. Funding allocations are local decisions and are the responsibility of individual CDRPs and BCUs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1270W.3/1">Home Office rules provide for the reimbursement of extra expenses necessarily&quot; incurred in carrying out official duty and in certain other specified circumstances. The overriding principle is that: where no extra expense is incurred no reimbursement is due. Overall expenditure on travel and subsistence is controlled through devolved budgets that enable managers to keep under review both the need for official travel and the economy of the travel arrangements. Managers are required to satisfy themselves that, for instance, regular travel commitments or programmes cannot be curtailed or reorganised, that meetings involving costly travel are really necessary, that the venue is appropriate, that only the necessary numbers of staff attend; and consider the desirability of requiring their staff to declare their forward visit proposals for prior approval. Where staff undertake necessary official travel, managers are required to ensure that they do so by the most efficient and economic means, taking all costs into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.1275W.11/1">The Youth Justice Board has invested in HMP and YOI Parc in order to enhance the care and accommodation that is offered to juveniles. Service improvements have included three discrete inpatient beds, together with a small day room, dedicated for use solely by juveniles. This facility opened in October 2004. In addition, since December 2004, a dedicated Juvenile Support Nurse has been in post and based within the Juvenile Unit. The Youth Justice Board has also funded a substance misuse manager and worker, in order to ensure implementation of the YJB's National Specification for Substance Misuse. As a direct result of the YJB's investment, there should be a significant reduction in transfers of juveniles from Parc as a result of health needs.</p>

The Identity Cards Bill currently before Parliament includes a new offence of being in possession or control of false identity documents, including a genuine document that relates to someone else, without reasonable excuse. The proposed maximum penalty for this offence is two years imprisonment. It will also be an offence for a person to possess these documents with the intention of using the document for establishing registrable facts about himself, or allowing or inducing another to use it for establishing, ascertaining or verifying registrable facts about himself. The proposed maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1279W.0/2">Section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002, which came into effect in January 2003, gives the police a power to seize vehicles being driven off-road without authority or on-road inconsiderately or without due care and attention if they are at the same time causing alarm, distress or annoyance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.0/3">The police welcomed the new provision in principle. They have been gradually developing policies and practices to ensure its best use, and we are aware of a number of instances where it has been employed effectively. With the Association of Chief Police Officers and practitioners on the ground we have been looking at whether there is any need for further clarification of the power, guidance on its use or amendments to the secondary legislation governing its technical aspects.</p>

	<p pid="a.1280W.3/1">Before an offender is released from prison on parole licence, the local probation officer prepares a risk management plan to facilitate the resettlement of the offender into the community and to minimise the risk to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280W.3/2">The plan may contain conditions to constrain the activities of the offender, relating for example to employment restrictions, residence, treatment for addictions, a curfew, or exclusion from certain places. The probation officer will manage the components of the plan in conjunction with other agencies. If there are curfew or exclusion conditions, these can be electronically monitored by private contractors who will work closely with the probation officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280W.3/3">In three areas of the country (Greater Manchester, West Midlands and Hampshire), management of the exclusion conditions can be enhanced by satellite tracking using global positioning by satellite (GPS) technology. This will provide the probation officer with evidence of any breach of the exclusion zones. This is a one year pilot which began in September 2004 and is being independently evaluated. A total of 94 offenders have been tracked in the pilot, and two of them have been subject to parole licence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1289W.2/1">In the case to which the hon. Member refers, the teacher concerned pleaded guilty to assault of a pupil but not, I understand, a sexual assault. I am told by the South Eastern Education Board that, having considered a range of options and looked at what was in the best interests of the child, the decision was taken to secure a place in a privately operated school. The Board is paying the fees for the pupil's attendance at the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.2/2">While the teacher will not receive compensation, I can assure the hon. Member that his rehabilitation was a major consideration and that the Terms of Settlement of this dispute contain a section relating specifically to the teacher and his needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.2/3">As a matter of principle I acknowledge the need to protect teachers from false allegations made against them. While we must of course listen to children and give primacy to their needs and welfare, the position of teachers also needs to be given due consideration in any investigative process. I am very much aware of the hugely damaging and lasting effect that false allegations can have on a teacher's professional and personal life. Our procedures must recognise teachers' rights to be heard, and to be protected against false allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1289W.2/4">In the coming months my Department will be undertaking a review of the way precautionary suspensions currently operate, with the aim of issuing fresh guidance to schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.1296W.5/4" class="indent">The screening plant at Briggs Rock originally comprised two automatic rotating screens which removed most solids and materials from the sewage before the effluent liquor was discharged to sea. Over the past two to three years, due to difficulties in sourcing replacement parts, the screens became increasingly difficult to maintain and repair, and more expensive to operate. The condition of the screens continued to deteriorate and they were removed in late 2004. As an interim measure, pending the provisions of a new automatic screening plant, the screens were replaced by fabricated bar screens. These screens have to be cleaned manually twice per day and are not as effective as the automatic rotating screens.</p>

	<p pid="a.1298W.9/1">As the new post-primary arrangements will largely be developed at local level, it is not yet possible to estimate the implementation costs in the three years following the ending of academic selection. Over the next three years &pound;24.7 million has been made available to support the preparation for, and the phased introduction of key elements of, the new arrangements in advance of the last transfer tests in 2008.</p>
