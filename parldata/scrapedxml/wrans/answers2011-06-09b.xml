	<p pid="b.403W.9/1">It is important that children and young people from across the UK are actively encouraged to participate in the wide range of opportunities created by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.9/2">Over 17,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for LOCOG's education programme Get Set, 790 of those are in the north-east&#8212;61.1% of the total number in the region. Through the Inspire Programme, over 1,200 cultural and sporting programmes across the UK have been awarded Inspire Marks, including 50 in the north-east. Projects such as &#8216;Kite Mark&#8217; and &#8216;Northern Design Competition&#8217; will assist in engaging young people with London 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.9/3">The north-east has secured &#163;1.53 million from the Legacy Trust for the region's &#8216;Generation 2012&#8217; project. This initiative provides opportunities for regional cultural organisations and young people to work together to develop up to 10 high quality, aspirational 2012 projects in the region, bringing people together for community activities of all kinds.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.9/4">In November I launched the &#8216;Places People Play&#8217; programme, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring all to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy.

	<p pid="b.406W.2/1">The Department for Transport is currently consulting on amendments to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, to implement the renewable energy and fuel quality directives.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/2">We do not propose to make any changes to the current obligation levels that are set out in the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 as amended. However, we propose a legal obligation on the Secretary of State for Transport to keep the level under review and to consider what additional measures will be required to ensure that the UK delivers the requirements of the renewable energy and fuel quality directives in the period 2014 to 2020. This will enable us to establish a stable biofuel policy that will allow industry to robustly plan for the period 2014 to 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.2/3">The consultation proposes to introduce mandatory sustainability criteria. These include that biofuels, with some exceptions, must deliver greenhouse gas savings of at least 35% when compared to fossil fuels and that biofuels must not be sourced from areas of high biodiversity, or from high carbon soils (e.g. rainforests or wetlands). All biofuels will have to meet these mandatory sustainability criteria in order to be counted towards meeting the targets in the renewable energy and fuel quality directives, and therefore receive rewards under an amended Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.408W.10/1">Retailers and apple grower trade associations are working together to meet growing consumer demand for English apples. All fruit and vegetables are required by law to have their country origin on the item, shelf or the package. In many grocery stores, British apples can be recognised by the Union Flag on the packaging or the liner for boxes of loose apples. The Fruit and Vegetable Taskforce on increasing consumption and production brought together the whole supply chain to identify and unblock barriers; they reported in summer 2010 and agreed an action plan in October 2010. The action plan was divided into production, supply chain and consumption: Most recommendations, which are fairly technical, have made significant progress and we are looking to produce an updated progress report later in the year.</p>

Entry clearance staff work to a service standard of concluding 90% of visit visa applications within 15 days (performance was 95% in 2010-11), so the outcome of a second application will be known much sooner than the outcome of an appeal. We have not carried out an assessment of whether all those who currently appeal would reapply, were the appeal right in this category removed.</p>

	<p pid="b.418W.3/1">We have no plans to amend the entitlement conditions for attendance allowance to introduce a mobility component. It is normal for pensions and benefit schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives. Disability living allowance, which has a mobility component, is intended to focus additional help with the extra cost of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled earlier in life and who as a consequence have less opportunity to work, earn and save compared to non-disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.3/2">If a person claims disability living allowance, including the mobility component, before their 65<sup>(th)</sup> birthday, it can remain in payment beyond age 65 as long as the conditions of entitlement remain satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="b.418W.3/3">Attendance allowance provides help with the disability-related extra costs of people who experience the onset of disability after age 65. Based on the need for personal care, this help is part of the wide range of support that the Government make available to older people so that they can have a decent and secure income in retirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.423W.5/1">The first national child poverty strategy fulfils the Government's obligations under the Child Poverty Act 2010 and sets out our plans for tackling child poverty from 2011-14. The strategy also provides a comprehensive framework for ending child poverty in the longer term and clearly demonstrates how Government Departments must work together to address and overcome the key drivers of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/2">The publication of the strategy was set against the backdrop of a huge deficit that this Government inherited and a challenging spending review that placed a high priority on improving the life chances of children and protection of vulnerable families while also making crucial progress in reducing the nation's fiscal debt.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/3">The Government's new strategic direction will dismantle the powerful barriers that keep most disadvantaged families stuck in cycles of poverty. Failure to do so will condemn some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of our society to repeatedly finding themselves on one or more of the established pathways to poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/4">We are resolute in our determination to tackle these key drivers of poverty and as such the Government have:</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/5">Set aside &#163;2 billion of Department for Work and Pensions spending review settlement over the next four years to fund the implementation of the universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/6">Established the Work programme, which will offer people seeking employment targeted, personalised help, delivered by contractors drawn from across the private, public and voluntary sectors, as well as social enterprises. Work programme contractors are paid for results, so the cost of the programme will depend on performance, but is expected to be between &#163;3 billion and &#163;5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/7">Introduced a number of initiatives specifically targeted at the most vulnerable children and families in our society:</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/8">the Fairness Premium worth &#163;7.2 billion over the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/9">the Pupil Premium worth &#163;2.5 billion a year to 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/10">the Early Intervention Grant worth &#163;2,222 million in 2011-12 and &#163;2,037 million in 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/11">the 16-19 Bursary Fund which guarantees the most vulnerable 16 to 19-year-olds bursaries of &#163;1,200 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/12">DWP will support further investment in innovative action from local partners which have the scope to improve children's and families' outcomes.

ECGD considers defence and fossil fuel related exports in accordance with its risk standards and its international obligations (e.g. those relating to anti-bribery and corruption and environmental, social and human rights standards) to determine whether or not it can provide support for individual transactions.</p>

	<p pid="b.442W.8/1">The evidence linking salt consumption and health was evaluated by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) in 2003. This concluded that the evidence that high salt intakes led to high blood pressure had strengthened since the issue was last considered in 1994. SACN also stated that, as high blood pressure was a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, reducing average population salt intake to 6 grams (and less for children) would proportionally lower population average blood pressure and confer significant public health benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.8/2">Officials continue to review published studies and, since 2003, there has been no new evidence that would alter the scientific consensus reported by SACN.</p>

	<p pid="b.444W.0/1">The Government are looking to publish prescribing data at practice level subject to an evaluation and impact assessment by the NHS Information Centre. The Information Centre has begun this process; this is a high level review of the implications of publishing practice-level prescribing data, reflecting the fact that there are different interests involved. It is important therefore that the impact assessment is seen to be objective.</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.0/2">In line with the broader strategic approach to information, the results of the Information Centre's impact assessment will be a vital first step to ensure that aggregated data can be made available without the risk of sensitive, personal or patient-identifiable information being made public. The Department will consider how best to take forward this proposal in due course, in the light of the findings of the Information Centre's impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.0/3">The Information Centre is drawing on information from a range of sources, reflecting the different perspectives including policy and research, pharmaceutical professionals and industry. The process will be especially mindful that the interests associated with transparency and economic growth, with patient choice, and with confidentiality of patient and professional must be considered in the final decision, and the impact assessment will help inform that decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.0/4">The NHS Information Centre is not consulting on the review, and so has not sought formal representations. While, apart from a letter to the Prime Minister, from the hon. Member himself, the Department is not aware of any formal representations specifically on this issue, the Department will consider whether there is such a need to consult, based on the decision that it reaches about what will be made available, and in what format.</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.0/5">We are clear that any decisions about publishing this data must not compromise patient confidentiality.</p>

The Department's five other allocated cars have been given up and Ministers now use a pool car service on demand provided by the Government Car and Dispatch Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.448W.8/2">Sharing back office functions and improving procurement are key ways that fire and rescue authorities can deliver sensible savings, while protecting the quality and breadth of frontline services offered to their communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.8/3">While each fire and rescue authority is responsible for their own policy on procurement, they should constantly search for the best value for money in delivering their services. Outsourcing the provision of capital equipment can be one such way, provided the precise terms and conditions of the contract represent value for money in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.8/4">I know that the hon. Member has an ongoing interest in the contract between London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) and AssetCo.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.8/5">As you will expect, we have been in close contact with LFEPA over the financial situation regarding AssetCo. LFEPA have given us their assurance that appropriate arrangements are in place to meet their statutory duties, and ensure a continued service to the people of London, irrespective of AssetCo's particular financial circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.448W.8/6">Notwithstanding, I would note that these outsourcing arrangements have previously been beneficial for Londoners by strengthening resilience and business continuity. Indeed, the level of investment provided by the contractor as part of the private finance initiative contract has meant that the current fleet and equipment is more modern and effective than could have been achieved by LFEPA if they had procured directly themselves. During the industrial action last year, AssetCo deployed 27 fully crewed fire appliances, from 27 strategic locations across the London Fire Brigade area.</p>

	<p pid="b.458W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-09">9 February</phrase> the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a new commitment by the UK's biggest high street banks on lending expectations and capacity. As part of this commitment, the banks intend to lend &#163;190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from &#163;179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more. &#163;76 billion of this lending will be to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is a 15% increase on 2010 lending of &#163;66 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.6/3">The Bank of England reported the banks' first quarter performance against the Merlin commitment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-23">23 May</phrase>. The banks lent an aggregate total of &#163;47.3 billion in the last quarter; within which, &#163;16.8 billion was to SMEs. The Government are encouraged that the banks are broadly on track to meet their overall commitment, but the banks must do more to lend to SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.6/4">The Treasury does not hold a regional breakdown of lending to SMEs in Scotland in the first quarter. However, in response to the Government's Green Paper on business finance, the BBA published the outcomes of their Business Finance Taskforce, which was written in conjunction with the six major UK banks. The Taskforce banks have committed to improving customer relationships through a new Lending Code, ensuring better access to finance and promoting better understanding. As part of these commitments, later this year, the banks will publish a regular cross-industry dataset that will show regional lending on an annual basis.</p>

In primary schools, education about relationships should focus on friendship, bullying and building self-esteem. Education about relationships in secondary schools should build on existing skills and knowledge and provide young people with opportunities to explore deeper issues around relationships, such as how relationships change over time and how to deal with a breakdown in relationships. Within the context of talking about relationships, pupils should be taught about the nature of marriage and other stable relationships, and their importance for family life and for bringing up children.</p>

	<p pid="b.463W.0/1">In December 2010, the Prime Minister announced a dedicated fund of &#163;30 million over the next four years to support couple relationships. The majority of this funding will be allocated to the voluntary and community sector. Prior to this there was no dedicated funding for relationship support services.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.0/2">From April 2006 to March 2011, some funding was granted to voluntary and community sector organisations to deliver relationship support services as part of the Children, Young People and Families (CYPF) Grant programme. This funding was awarded as part of support for families more generally, so cannot be separated out in detail for the whole of this period, but the funding to organisations delivering a range of relationship support over the period 2009-11 was &#163;10 million. In addition, across the period 2009-11 funding of &#163;4.5 million was made available to fund child poverty pilots which specifically focused on supporting parents through separation.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.0/3">The CYPF grant was replaced by the VCS grant in April 2011 with the aim of increasing the take-up and availability of relationship support. Work funded under this grant covers all stages of relationships including those experiencing separation.</p>

	<p pid="b.465W.5/1">Under Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 42/2010, governing governors of prisons are required to ensure that an assessment of the risks to which their staff and others who may be affected by their undertakings are exposed, is carried out and that measures are in place to eliminate or control the risk.</p>

The audit focuses on the procedures in place for implementing the requirements of health and safety legislation, including arrangements for carrying out risk assessments. A report is prepared for governors which includes any deficiencies identified during the audit, the actions required to ensure compliance with legislation and prison service guidance and time scales for implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.474W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.474W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> It is estimated that the Youth Justice Board will make savings of approximately &#163;6 million by 2014-15 from its operating costs as result of the transition of some of its functions into the Ministry of Justice. The transition process itself will incur some costs which will reduce any planned savings in the initial year of transition. The Ministry of Justice and the Youth Justice Board are working together to identify the extent of the costs involved in the transition process.</p>
	<p pid="b.474W.2/3"><i>(b)</i> As announced in the written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>, changes to the coroners' services will be cost-neutral. Therefore the only expenditure incurred by the Department relates to staff costs for implementing part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. In the period between Royal Assent in November 2009 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-30">30 March 2011</phrase>, staffing costs were &#163;387,140. The decision to transfer Chief Coroner functions without fully establishing the office means that the estimated &#163;10.9 million set-up costs, and &#163;6.6 million running costs would no longer be incurred by the public purse.</p>

	<p pid="b.484W.2/1">Voltage optimisation can deliver significant energy savings when properly matched to the appropriate types of load, for example commercial office environments where voltage optimisation can be combined with spike protection and phase-balancing and/or where the local grid voltage is high. It is generally less suited to industrial processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/2">Two of the projects under Ofgem's Low Carbon Networks Fund are using new voltage control technology which will enable better network voltage control, system harmonics and allow increased network utilisation.</p>
