The first meeting on this was in fact instigated by the former chief executive of Post Office Ltd. (David Mills).

	<p pid="a.1842W.8/1">The Green Paper set out our proposed measures to significantly reduce the number of people claiming and receiving incapacity benefits.

More precise measures will be established in due course.</p>

This might include use of a text phone, or arrangements for a face-to-face meeting at the local Jobcentre when a fully trained face-to-face First Contact Officer will take the required details from the customer. Jobcentre Plus offices are equipped with induction loops to support our vulnerable customers. Alternatively, the customer could elect to be represented by a third party.</p>

	<p pid="a.1851W.2/1">Clause 46 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill seeks to amend section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as it applies within England and Wales. This would provide year-round protection for birds which re-use their nests, and which are listed on schedule ZA1. The schedule lists the Golden Eagle, White-tailed Eagle, and Osprey and there are no current plans to include additional birds. Should evidence come to light that other birds would benefit from being listed, a full public consultation would need to take place before any decision was taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1851W.2/2">Under section 1 of the 1981 Act all wild birds are protected against being killed, injured or taken, and their nests and eggs are protected against being taken, damaged or destroyed. In addition, peregrine falcons, barn owls and red-billed choughs, are protected against disturbance during their breeding season by virtue of being listed on schedule 1. There are signs that the populations of these three species are slowly increasing within the UK, and the current level of protection is therefore considered sufficient to ensure their continued breeding success.

The provisions in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 which banned media identification of sex offence defendants was repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1988. This was based on the Criminal Law Revision Committee's argument in its 1984 Sexual Offences report which was that there was no reason in principle for defendants in rape cases to be distinguished from those charged with other offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.1861W.5/1">The London Childcare Affordability Pilot programme is jointly funded by the London Development Agency (&pound;22 million) and the DfES (&pound;11 million) and will run from October 2005 to March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861W.5/2">The pilot is being evaluated carefully so that lessons can be learned about its effectiveness in order to inform thinking about how best to address in future problems of affordability of child care for lower income families. There has been no decision at present to extend funding to other areas. However, we recently announced the allocation of the Transformation Fund to every local authority. This will enable private and voluntary providers to improve levels of qualification among their staff while maintaining affordability for parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1861W.8/1">CWDC was launched in April 2005 with an overall aim to build the very best work force for children, young people and families. Since its launch, CWDC has been making good progress in building their capacity to deliver on the challenges set out in the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme. As part of this they have recruited a strong and committed board of employer and employee representatives from their sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861W.8/2">The first products of the council's early work will shortly appear. They will publish this month web-based advice for local planners on local work force strategies in support of their Children and Young People's plans. To complement this they will also offer local planners consultancy assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861W.8/3">With the Training and Development Agency for Schools they are working up proposals for developing professional roles within the early years and child care sector, as part of the implementation of the Government's 10-year child care strategy. These proposals will be published in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861W.8/4">The council is also taking a leading role in the Children's Workforce Network, a partnership of sector skills councils and similar bodies responsible for work force development across the full range of children's services in early years, education, social care, youth work, playwork, youth justice and health. With partners in the network the council has begun work to review relevant national occupational standards to embed a common core of knowledge and skills for all those working with children, young people and families and to develop an integrated qualifications framework to support service improvement and career opportunities for individual workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861W.8/5">CWDC is working with other organisations and Government to review recruitment and training and work force roles in social care as part of the recently-established 'Options for Excellence' Board. An initial report is due in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1861W.8/6">CWDC is working with Government on its response to the Children's Workforce Strategy consultation, and will be commissioned to implement major parts of the strategy during 2006&ndash;07. The precise role which CWDC will play in implementing the CWS will be made clear in their Business plan for 2006&ndash;07 which is currently being developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1862W.2/18">During the lifetime of CAP, a total of 24 referrals were made in relation to children living in Gloucestershire. 20 of these received support geared to their individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1862W.2/19">Information on application rates by area was contained in the independent evaluation of CAP, work undertaken by University College London in conjunction with the University of York. The report was published in October 2004 as DfES Research Report 580 and it confirmed that CAP had positive benefits for the children being assisted and those working with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1865W.3/1">We do not currently have any plans to revise the EMA criteria to include young people who are required to be in compulsory education. The purpose of the education maintenance allowance (EMA), is to provide an incentive to engage young people aged 16 to 18 in learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1865W.3/2">EMA is not based on the academic level a pupil reaches. It is targeted at those who have reached the end of their compulsory education, who have the option of dropping out of learning. People under the age of 16 are required to be in compulsory education.</p>

	<p pid="a.1867W.2/12">The statutory categorisation of Serious Weaknesses was introduced in September 1997 and that of Inadequate 6th Form in September 2001; underachieving was an Ofsted administrative category.

	<p pid="a.1867W.5/1">Pupils nationally have made excellent progress since 1997. At Key Stage 2 there has been a 16 percentage point improvement in English and a 13 percentage point improvement in mathematics up to 2005. The improvement in the proportion of 15-year-olds achieving five A*-C grades at GCSE and equivalents has been 11 percentage points. At Key Stage 3, there have been improvements in the core subjects of English, mathematics, science and ICT. The 2005 provisional results show increases of 17, 14, 10, and 19 percentage points respectively since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1867W.5/2">These improvements flow directly from the success of our National Strategies. At primary level the introduction of the daily literacy and mathematics hours mean that compared with 1997, 84,000 more 11-year-olds left school in 2005 with the necessary basic skills in reading, writing and numeracy. In the four years since the introduction of the Key Stage 3 strategy, now extended to the Secondary National Strategy, the model of support and challenge for teachers has been very effective. The Strategy has made great gains in improving the life chances of 14-year-olds&mdash;the greatest improvements have been in the areas of highest deprivation. Last year's results mean that approximately 103,000 more 14-year-olds achieved the target level for their age in English and 86,000 more did so in mathematics, than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1867W.5/3">The proportion of 11 and 14-year-old pupils achieving the expected levels in English and mathematics and the GCSE and equivalent achievements of young people, in 1997 and the latest available year, in the Hendon constituency are available on the 'In Your Area' website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/inyourarea/">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/inyourarea/</a>. 2005 figures are not yet available at constituency level for 14-year-olds but will be published on the 'In Your Area' website shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1872W.2/109">We believe that more people with the potential to benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so. Higher education leads to a range of benefits, not only higher earnings but reduced crime, better health, and wider social capital benefits. The new student support arrangements offer a better deal for students from poorer backgrounds. We have reintroduced grants for those from low income households; we have ended up front fees; and we have introduced the Office for Fair Access so that universities have agreements on outreach and funding help that they will offer poorer students. &pound;300 million is being offered in bursaries and other financial support. Alongside this, the Government and its partners support the Aimhigher programme, which enables partnerships of schools, colleges and universities to design and deliver a range of aspiration and attainment raising activities to enable young people from backgrounds currently under-represented in higher education to be able and willing to go on to HE. We are also determined to improve educational attainment so that more people are in a position to benefit from HE. Our proposals in the Schools White Paper, which is now the basis for The Education and Inspections Bill 2006, will help ensure that every young person has the opportunity to reach their potential, including, where appropriate, university education.</p>

	<p pid="a.1881W.6/1">Trusts will help create a long term, stable and sustainable relationship bringing in partners to support the school's governance and strategic direction with clear aims and outcomes agreed at the outset. A school can decide whether it wants to acquire a trust and whom they might want to work with. It will be easier to use the Power to Innovate, with the potential for flexibilities to be agreed centrally and made available to all schools supported by the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1881W.6/2">Specialist schools, such as Wolstanton High School and Sir Thomas Boughey High School, could join a network of schools working collaboratively to help raise standards and share best practice in a specialist subject. Schools will benefit from the different perspectives, experience and skills of different partners to provide opportunities for greater efficiency or workforce development. For example, they may like to work with a university or training provider as part of a trust to gain access to additional educational expertise or create links between staff and students that raise aspirations and motivate schools students.</p>

	<p pid="a.1883W.8/1">Lord Donaldson said in his report &quot;Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas&quot; that the Scilly Isles were an obvious candidate for MEHRA status. However he made it clear that the actual decision on which areas would be MEHRAs must be founded on criteria, based on both shipping patterns and environmental importance. Lord Donaldson did not prejudge the outcome of this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/2">Lord Donaldson also said that there may be a case for an Area to be Avoided (ATBA) or ATBAs, although he appreciated there is a need for the approaches to ports to be left unobstructed. Again, Lord Donaldson did not prejudge the outcome of these deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/3">Building on Lord Donaldson's report, the Department for Transport and the Department of the Environment (now Defra) worked closely with Devolved Administrations and statutory nature conservation advisors to develop the process for identifying MEHRAs through a robust and objective methodology. This included a parallel assessment of pollution from shipping risk and environmental sensitivity. Other environmental protection measures already in place at each location were also taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/4">Lord Donaldson's recommendation that the criteria should be set in such a way that not more than about a tenth of the UK coastline qualifies was also taken into account. Consequently, in accordance with this principle and the methodology, only those areas which scored highly both in terms of environmental sensitivity and in terms of risk from shipping qualified as MEHRAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/5">The environmental sensitivity for the Isles of Scilly was not in question in this assessment. This is already acknowledged through existing protective measures that reduce the risks to such an extent that all the qualifying criteria for MEHRA status are not met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/6">The proposal for an ATBA for the Isles of Scilly was discussed in detail at two UK Safety of Navigation (UKSON) Committee meetings. They decided that there was no evidence that existing routeing measures were ineffective and an ATBA would not necessarily enhance the measures currently in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/7">There are three traffic separation schemes, with associated inshore traffic zones, which have been adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in close proximity to the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/8" class="indent">(1) West of the Scilly Isles</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/9" class="indent">(2) South of the Scilly Isles</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/10" class="indent">(3) Off Land's End, between Seven Stones and Longships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/11">There is also an IMO-adopted Recommendation on Navigation off the Isles of Scilly which advises laden tankers over 10,000 gross tonnage using the traffic separation scheme between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly to keep at least three miles seaward of Wolf Rock and further advises such vessels not to use the scheme in restricted visibility or other adverse weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/12">Additionally, an IMO-adopted voluntary reporting scheme recommends that laden tankers using the Isles of Scilly route to report to Falmouth Coastguard when at least one hour from the Estimated Time of Arrival of entering the route and on final departure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/13">If, despite the routeing measures which are in place, a maritime incident occurs in the waters around Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, there are a number of safeguards in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/14" class="indent">A dedicated, Government-funded emergency towing vessel is on stand-by 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ready to respond to shipping incidents in the South Western approaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/15" class="indent">The Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP), provides overall command and control of operations during marine emergencies. The powers of direction invested in SOSREP are extensive and, as well as being an international first for the UK, the SOSREP role has proved very successful in a number of shipping incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/16" class="indent">The UK has a well developed National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations, which would be implemented in the event of a significant maritime incident (and it is worth noting that Cornwall county council has its own coastal counter pollution contingency plan which complements the National Contingency Plan).</p>
	<p pid="a.1883W.8/17" class="indent">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is well prepared to respond to a marine pollution incident. Counter pollution resources are stored on the Isles of Scilly and at Falmouth for response to small incidents. In the event of a larger incident, appropriate equipment from the major UK Counter Pollution stockpiles at Milford Haven, Huddersfield and Perth would be mobilised, and a sizeable stockpile of oil spill dispersants is located at Saltash. All counter pollution resources are maintained by private contractors, and strict contractual stipulations are in place for mobilisation anywhere within the UK within pre-determined timescales.</p>

The CPA was dissolved on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, and despite a search of its records, the United States Government have not been able to trace receipt of this letter or any action taken as a result of it.</p>

Diplomatic status is conferred on high commissioners of Commonwealth countries as representatives of sovereign states. BOTs are not sovereign states and their representatives are not, therefore, entitled to diplomatic status. As a courtesy, they are listed in the London Diplomatic List, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) publication, and, where they meet certain criteria, BOTs receive partial rating relief on their offices and residences based in London. Representatives of BOTs are also often invited by the FCO to attend official events to which high commissioners and ambassadors are invited, and they have full access to FCO officials.</p>

To ensure the widest possible participation in such a treaty, we believe this initiative should be taken forward through a UN based process. We are working with international partners to build support for the launch of such a process. In 2005, we secured EU and Commonwealth support. In 2006, we are continuing to build support, with the aim of securing the start of a UN process at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1904W.8/1">Iran's longest range in-service missile is believed to be the Shahab-3, which entered into service in 2003. It has a claimed range of 1,300 km, with a 750 kg warhead. This range would enable Iran to target Israel, Turkey and Cyprus, as well as large parts of Saudi Arabia. Iran has ambitions to extend the range of its missiles and develop longer range missile systems, which would give it the capability to target a number of European countries.</p>

But the barrier's route should be on or behind the Green Line, and not on occupied territory. Construction of the barrier on Palestinian land is illegal. The route is particularly damaging around East Jerusalem, as it risks cutting the city off from the West Bank and dividing the West Bank in two.</p>

The UK National Reform Programme (a copy of which is available in the Library of the House) details our policy response to these challenges.

	<p pid="a.1909W.2/1">The Business Case for Prism predicted &pound;10 million per annum savings by the end of the programme (January 2010). The Programme is aiming to ensure the full benefits of Prism are realised and has scheduled a 'Gateway 5 Review' by the Office of Government Commerce for the end of 2006. This will provide an independent assessment of the cost effectiveness of Prism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1909W.2/2">Prism brings major changes, it is not merely a new IT system. It establishes new processes and reinforces adherence to existing processes. This is a significant challenge, particularly for staff using Prism each day, including management officers, accountants and buyers. Their workload certainly increases during the first months of using the system. For many, this has been exacerbated by Prism's poor performance, particularly its speed. A concerted effort to improve this is beginning to pay dividends for a significant number of Posts. But many using satellite links continue to face slow performance. Despite this, our experience is that, once Posts get to grips with Prism, workloads start to return to normal. Posts with most Prism experience are beginning to see tangible benefits from the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1909W.2/3">The Prism Business Plan identified the potential to move staff from 'back office' to 'front line' functions throughout the network. 'Hub and spoke' pilots will take place in several countries during financial year 2006&ndash;07 to investigate providing 'shared services' from 'hub' Posts. Proceeding with 'hub and spoke' will need to be justified by a rigorous business/benefits case, validated through the pilots. It is too early to identify how this will affect staff numbers. Prism has not impacted staff numbers overseas to date.</p>

The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport's role is in relation to the conditions she attached in granting approval for the Digital Curriculum in 2003, which included a commitment that the service would be reviewed within two years of its launch.

	<p pid="a.1916W.14/2">However, based on early feedback from licensing authorities, and in particular the Department's work with the 10 scrutiny councils, we estimate the overall level of appeals under the new regime is small and less than 1 per cent. of all applications. The number of appeals specifically against a refusal to grant a licence by a local licensing authority will be even smaller.</p>

	<p pid="a.1917W.2/1">As stated in the answer to the previous question, there is no express provision in the Licensing Act 2003 or the councillors code of conduct which precludes a councillor who has made representations on his own behalf from attending and speaking at a licensing committee on that application either as a resident or as a representative of other residents. However, in the planning case of Richardson and Orme <i>v</i>. North Yorkshire county council and others [2003 EWCA Civ 1860], the Court of Appeal confirmed that it is a consequence of the code that, in circumstances where a councillor has a prejudicial interest in a matter, he is required to withdraw from the committee meeting at which that matter is discussed. This would not preclude the councillor from giving written representations to the committee or asking a colleague to speak on his behalf to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1920W.3/1">The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system and TV Licensing carries out the day to day administration under contract to the Corporation. I have therefore asked the BBC's head of revenue management to consider the questions raised by the hon. Member and to write to him direct. Copies of the reply will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1920W.9/1">Cultural and sporting tourism are vital elements of the UK's domestic and inbound tourism offers, and are prominent in the marketing and promotional material of organisations which support British tourism at national, regional and local levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1920W.9/2">At national level, cultural and sporting events are central to the work of VisitBritain, both in overseas markets, and in marketing England domestically under the guidance of the England Marketing Advisory Board. A wide range of cultural events are promoted in this way. VisitBritain estimates that 1.6 million overseas visitors to Britain either watched or participated in a sporting event in 2002, spending &pound;1.1 billion during their stays, and the high profile of sport in VisitBritain's marketing work reflects that economic importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1920W.9/3">The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in 2012, and the wide range of cultural events which will precede them, will of course provide further opportunities for the British tourism industry. Plans for making the best use of such events for the benefit of the visitor economy will form an important element of my Department's Tourism 2012 strategy. A wide public consultation on that strategy will commence shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1922W.0/1">The portable antiquities scheme plays a major role in supporting the Treasure Act through its network of finds liaison officers. It is largely down to their work that we have seen a substantial rise in the reporting rate of treasure finds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1922W.0/2">In areas where a finds liaison officer was appointed for the first time in 2003, there was an average fivefold increase in the number of treasure finds reported in the following reporting year. This has contributed to a continuing upward trend of a twofold increase for England and Wales as a whole since 2003.</p>
