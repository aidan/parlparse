	<p pid="a.11W.2/3" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many telephone calls to the Child Support Agency <i> (a)</i> were received <i> (b)</i> received an engaged tone and <i> (c)</i> were disconnected during the interactive response process for the period April 2002 to June 2006 for (i) all calls and (ii) calls relating to the cases being processed on the CS2 computer system.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.2/4" class="indent">The latest information is contained in the two following tables. Note that the CS2 computer system did not become operational until March 2003. Therefore it is not possible to provide data for the year 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.2/5" class="indent">Note also that point <i> (c)</i> has been interpreted as referring to the total number of calls abandoned (for example, where the client does not have a National Insurance number to hand and hangs up to go and find it before calling back) or lost during the automated part of the process, as the Agency cannot disconnect a call once it is in the IVR system.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.2/6" class="indent">Further information on the Agency's telephony performance is available in Table 16 of the latest edition of the Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics. A copy of this document is available in the House Library, as well as on the internet, at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.2/7" class="indent">The Agency has shown a significant and sustained improvement in telephony performance, with respect to waiting times and the percentage of calls answered. Specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.2/8" class="indent">In the quarter ending June 2006, the Agency answered 97% of telephone calls available to be answered, compared to 91% in the year ending March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.2/9" class="indent">In the quarter ending June 2006, average waiting time for all calls was 24 seconds, down from 59 seconds in the year ending March 2006.</p>

Given that the financial assistance scheme is funded by taxpayers, most of whom do not benefit from a defined benefit pension, we do not believe it would be appropriate or fair to extend the scheme to such an extent.</p>

	<p pid="a.23W.8/1">The White Paper endorsed the Pensions Commission's view that it is vital that communication with members of the new scheme is designed to enable them, as best as possible, to make informed decisions about their saving. However, it did not specifically identify a need for independent professional financial advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.8/2">Recognising the importance of information, the White Paper consultation asks for comments on what individuals would need in each proposed approach. The responses will inform the work we are doing in the period before implementation of the new system, when we are actively pursuing three distinct strands of work. Developing the information and communications strategy to support the introduction of personal accounts; continuing our work on improving public understanding of pensions; and working with the FSA and others on the broader financial capability strategy. This work includes testing the workplace as a delivery mechanism for financial information, in particular information about pensions.</p>

	<p pid="a.27W.6/1">During the oral statement I said that both the stock market fall of the late 1990s and rising longevity had cost UK pension funds &pound;250 billion. To clarify, between 1999 and 2002 the market value of occupational pension scheme assets reduced by a total of around &pound;250 billion. We believe this reduction was largely a result of the impact of the stock market fall. Rising longevity would have increased pension fund liabilities during this period, also leading to increases in scheme costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.3/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus does not directly employ staff to provide psychotherapeutic counselling. In Pathways to Work areas, Personal Advisers are able to refer their customers to a Condition Management Programme which can include access to psychological therapies. Although these services are funded by Jobcentre Plus, they are commissioned, and supplied, by local Primary Care Trusts. We are therefore not able to provide details of the number of staff involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.3/5" class="indent">In addition, Jobcentres have many local (non-contractual) partnerships with a variety of voluntary and community organisations that offer support to individuals on issues such as coping with life and substance or alcohol abuse. Although counselling is used by some of these organisations, we have no data on whether or not they specifically use trained psychotherapeutic counsellors.</p>

For others, particularly where complex analysis is involved or firm data on outcomes may be delayed (for example, in areas involving medical events), reporting may take a year or longer.

Stakeholder pensions are sold and marketed by the financial services industry. The suitability of a stakeholder pension for any individual will depend on their particular circumstances. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that around 2,880,000 stakeholder pension policies have been sold since their introduction in April 2001.</p>
