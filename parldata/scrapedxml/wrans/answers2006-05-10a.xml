	<p pid="a.234W.6/1">The successful delivery of alternative livelihood programmes is highly dependent on the ability of organisations doing the delivery on the ground, being able to operate safely. Security in many parts of Afghanistan is improving, particularly in central, northern and western areas and further progress can be made by strengthening the effectiveness of the Afghan police and criminal justice system. However security remains a particular challenge in the south and east of the country, where the insurgency is most active.</p>
	<p pid="a.234W.6/2">Continuing threats to the safety of Afghan and international staff have meant that some non-governmental organisations and international contractors are finding it increasingly difficult to operate in some parts of the country. The majority of DFID's livelihoods programme is channelled through the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This helps to reduce some of the security risks by using local contractors, but there have been a number of attacks on implementing partners of these national programmes. Although attacks have increased, so far they have not caused widespread suspension of alternative livelihoods programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.234W.6/3">Helmand province will be a particularly challenging place in which to deliver programmes that will support the development of alternative livelihoods. DFID is currently designing a large multi-year programme to support rural development in Helmand through the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This support will only be successful if implementing partners are willing to work in the province. The UK military deployment to Helmand should help to facilitate a greater Afghan Government presence in the province, and improve the capacity of the police and the Afghan National Army to provide the necessary security for development partners to operate effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.5/1">The Department is fully committed to equality and diversity. The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 places new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, 'the Disability Equality Duty.'</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/2">Through the Act, we, like many public bodies, have an obligation to publish a Disability Equality Scheme every three years. Our Equality and Diversity Unit has begun work on the Department's first scheme, to be published later this year. Policy officials will be undertaking a full departmental-wide examination of our policies and functions in relation to disability and other equality issues. Action plans will be produced to address all issues and these will be monitored and reviewed through the annual business planning process. The scheme will be published on the Department's website. This information will contribute towards preparations for the Secretary of State's report on progress, due in December 2008. My Department has also provided support on implementing the new duties to a number of other public authorities including schools and other public bodies. Further information on this and other support is shown as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/3" class="italic">Annex 1</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/4" class="italic">Examples of DfES support for other authorities include:</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/5" class="italic">Schools and early years:</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/6">The Department for Education and Skills is holding a series of events in May and June to launch the new resource &quot;Implementing the Disability Discrimination Act in schools and early years settings&quot; to help schools and local authorities implement the reasonable adjustments duty and planning duty they have under Part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act by providing:</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/7" class="indent">An explanation of the DDA duties and their relationship to the statutory SEN framework;</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/8" class="indent">a DVD resource filmed in over 40 schools&mdash;illustrating how schools have made reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination against disabled pupils and increase their access to education; plus supporting written materials;</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.5/10" class="indent">guidance for local authorities on increasing access to early years settings for very young disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/11">The resource will help schools and local authorities to make adjustments for their disabled pupils both in the short and longer term by improving access to all aspects of school life. The guidance identifies how schools and local authorities' access planning arrangements will help compliance with the Disability Equality Duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/12">The Disability Rights Commission will give a presentation at the events providing an overview of the duties schools and local authorities will have under the Disability Equality Duty. They will also make participants aware of the sixth section that will be added to the resource in the autumn as part of the non statutory guidance being developed for schools by the Disability Rights Commission on the new Disability Equality Duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/13" class="italic">DfES's work with DRC/LSC/FE/HE in preparing for implementation of the new disability duty:</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/14">DfES has been participating in a series of round-table workshops over the past year with the Disability Rights Commission (DRC), Learning and Skills Council, Higher Education Funding Council for England and external partners in the Further and Higher Education sectors, to prepare for the forthcoming public sector duty to promote disability equality. DRC plans to publish guidance for the FHE sector in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/15" class="italic">LSC's existing statutory duty to promote disability equality:</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/16">Section 14 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, requires the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), in carrying out all of its functions, to have due regard to the promotion of equality of opportunity in terms of disability, race and gender. In addition, section 13 requires the LSC to pay particular regard to the needs of young people and adults with learning difficulties and disabilities, when performing its duties to secure facilities and provide resources for education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.5/17">DfES are working with the LSC to run an equalities impact assessment across the skills strategy programme. This will include disability. We aim to complete this by the end of October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.241W.2/1">The key recommendations in the social exclusion unit's (SEU) report on 'Young Runaways' were that young people at risk of running away should know who they could talk to about their problems, that local services needed to work closer together to make sure young people got help, and that a safety net of community-based emergency accommodation was needed for those who did run away.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.2/2">The findings of the SEU report, which was published in 2002, influenced the wider Government strategy on children's services, which was set out in the Green Paper 'Every Child Matters' (2003). It is through the 'Every Child Matters: Change for Children' programme currently being taken forward by local authorities, and including the reforms set out in the Green Paper 'Youth Matters', that the Government are promoting measures that respond to the SEU report.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.2/3">'Change for Children' aims to help local services respond to the full range of children's needs&mdash;including their health, their safety and their economic well-being. It is particularly concerned with improving targeted support for those children most at risk of negative outcomes, such as those associated with running away or going missing from home. The programme, drawing on the Children Act 2004 reforms, is enabling local areas to improve integrated working arrangements by establishing multi-disciplinary teams, while adopting a lead professional model&mdash;someone who is a single point of contact for a young person who can co-ordinate a package of support when multiple needs are present requiring help from various sources. Improved integrated working at a local level is being accompanied by enhanced information sharing between services, leading to earlier identification of children's needs. This in turn allows young people to be referred to the right source of support, at the right time. New Joint Inspection Arrangements will judge the effectiveness and co-ordination of such local provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.2/4">We have also run six projects to test out how best to provide safe, flexible and responsive community-based services that can be easily incorporated into mainstream children's services. We will disseminate the lessons learnt from these to local authorities later this year.</p>

A key part of that work involves creating the conditions for the success of businesses that help to generate the UK's wealth.

These include a range of grants, funds, loan guarantee schemes and advice available through Business Link. In addition, we ensure that representative bodies of smaller retailers are involved with our key retail fora: Retail Policy Forum (better regulation); Retail Innovation Group (identification and exploitation of good practice); and have been invited to be part of the steering group for the fledgling Regional Retail Strategy that is exploring good practice in working with retail at regional/local level. We also ensure that the main trade associations representing small shops are notified directly about relevant public consultations.</p>

	<p pid="a.258W.2/1">The Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 1971 have been superseded by the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002. Recent representations in relation to those regulations have focussed on the release of information from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) vehicle register.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.2/2">Regulation 27(1 )<i>(e)</i> of the 2002 regulations require that DVLA release particulars held on its vehicle register to anyone who can demonstrate 'reasonable cause' for having the particulars made available to him. The term 'reasonable cause' is not defined in the legislation and each request is considered on its merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.2/3">These regulations consolidate legislation that has been in force and working efficiently for over 40 years. However, when the provisions were originally introduced they did not anticipate the introduction of electronic databases, the large number of vehicles on the roads, or the range of bodies now requesting access. Concerns have also recently been raised about the breadth of organisations that have access to the register. For these reasons, I announced a review of the regulations governing the release of information. A consultation paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase> which sought to address all aspects of the release of information from the vehicle register. The consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> and our conclusions will be published in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.274W.3/1">Royal Mail offer a range of products that provide bulk purchase and business mail discounts, but these apply only where there is a central point of posting and administration which enables Royal Mail to use their automation of bulk postings to reduce operational costs. As Parliament's pre-paid envelope service provides the ability to post in constituencies anywhere in the UK, often in small volumes, these services are not applicable. Given a background of increasing deregulation within the mail industry the House authorities keep the possibilities of alternative contracts under continuous review.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.3/2">A thorough evaluation of the external market through the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Commission was also carried out in 2005 in respect of Parliament's own mail service. Four firms were short-listed and Royal Mail won a new three year contract after they were able to convince the evaluation panel that they could deliver to a demanding specification and provide value for money.</p>

This triple approach aims to reduce drug taking in the Army as far as is possible in order to maintain the integrity of the force. CDT is a part of this approach by providing an active deterrent to drug taking. The Army tests 85 per cent. of the force annually for all controlled drugs and those who are caught are almost always discharged.

	<p pid="a.288W.5/32">Since 2001, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine has been the main receiving unit for patients aeromedically evacuated from an operational theatre. If a long stay is expected, patients can be transferred to a hospital local to their home for less acute treatment, enabling them to be nearer to their family. Indeed, a significant proportion of Service personnel requiring hospital treatment in the UK in general are treated, both as emergencies and electively, at other NHS hospitals. The decision to do this is based on relative waiting times and on convenience for the individual patient and the patient's family. Additionally, patients requiring more complex rehabilitation for musculo-skeletal conditions can be referred, where appropriate, to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court.</p>

	<p pid="a.289W.5/1">It is not possible to provide comprehensive and accurate details on Territorial Army (TA) recruiting spend alone nor break it down into the detail requested. Spending on TA recruitment is a multi-layer activity involving disparate formations, units and agencies spanning a number of different budget areas, which allocate funds over a financial year, not by quarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.5/2">The overall national marketing spend for financial year (FY) 2005&ndash;06 for the Army (both Regular and TA) was &pound;38.4 million and the national marketing budget for FY 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;25.8 million. This includes &pound;5 million and &pound;2.3 million specifically earmarked for TA activities. However, the TA also benefits further from many elements of the rest of the national Army marketing budget, which are aimed at both the Regular Army and the TA. These encompass television and press advertising, the production of DVDs, leaflets, pamphlets and brochures as well as the overarching production and design costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.5/3">In addition, &pound;12.9 million was spent on various TA recruiting (and in some cases retention) initiatives in FY 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;12.5 million is allocated for 2006&ndash;07. These initiatives include the establishment of additional posts to further improve TA recruiting hierarchy and infrastructure, the establishment of Brigade Recruitment and Advisory Teams, improvement of recruiting Reception Centres and other ad hoc recruiting drives.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.0/1">Territorial Army (TA) manning has been under pressure for a number of years and the Army faces a growing challenge in recruiting sufficient officers and soldiers of an appropriate quality for all branches of the TA. Particular areas for recruiting focus on increasing the number of young officers joining the TA, medical technicians, specialist trades in the Royal Logistics Corps, communications technicians and other more general trade soldiers in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Infantry and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. A major change programme, known as Project One Army Recruiting is under way to improve recruiting into the Regular and Territorial Army by integrating the recruiting operations of the two organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.3/2">There are many variables involved when determining the number of air defence ships required to defend a carrier or amphibious task group. These include the level of the threat, the various readiness levels of the ships, the level of multinational involvement and the scale of the operation. It is the capability provided by the ships, rather than their numbers, that determine the level of protection provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.6/2">No decision has yet been made on ordering the seventh and eighth Type 45 destroyers. When approval is sought, all factors, will be taken into account. In particular, any decision will be made in the context of our defence industrial strategy, a key element of which is to retain onshore the ability to deliver a number of strategic capabilities, including those required to build and integrate complex ships in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.290W.6/3">To that end, we are working with industry to develop a common understanding of the core load required to sustain the industrial capabilities we identified as important to sustain in the DIS. We expect industry to restructure itself to improve its performance and address the fundamental issues of affordability and productivity to deliver the equipment we need; to sustain onshore the industrial capabilities we require for national security; and to provide a sustainable and profitable industry, with clearer employment prospects.</p>

Only one company is able to provide transportation from Baghdad International airport. The IOM arranges for the returnees to be taken to Baghdad's main land transportation hubs where onward travel is organised either by taxi or bus. For enforced returns, there is clearly a difficult position in those parts of Iraq most affected by insurgent action, but it is not accepted that this applies to all areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.2/1">There have been some recent developments in respect of immigration detention in Northern Ireland. Until early 2006 it had been the case that where it was necessary to detain individuals in Northern Ireland men were accommodated in the Working Out Unit, Crumlin Road, Belfast and women were accommodated at HMYOC Hydebank Wood.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.2/2">It is now the case that individuals in Northern Ireland who are detained under Immigration Act powers are no longer held in Northern Ireland. Such individuals are transferred to a detention facility in Great Britain either on the day of detention or within 24 hours. In the majority of cases individuals will, initially, be detained at Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre. Individuals whose asylum applications are straightforward and capable of being decided quickly may be held at Oakington Reception Centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.2/3">While there are occasions when consultation with outside bodies is appropriate, there will be other occasions, of which this was one, where such consultation would delay changes to operational policy and practice that can and should be made quickly. In this case, consultation would simply have served to prolong the routine use of prison places in Northern Ireland for detainees beyond the point that it was operationally necessary to do so. This would not have been desirable.</p>

	<p pid="a.296W.2/1">Neither local authorities, police nor IND currently have specific requirements or associated standards and processes for such information to be collected at a local level. While some local recording may take place, it is not systematic. The Home Office is working in collaboration with DfES, local authorities, Local Safeguarding Children Boards and relevant voluntary organisations to address these issues. Among other steps we are establishing dedicated social work teams at ports and asylum screening units.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.2/2">These teams will benefit from additional training and close working relationships with the Police and Immigration Service. The teams will ensure that children who need safeguarding will be properly referred to statutory agencies, and the information about them will be captured on the National Register of Unaccompanied Children and in due course the DfES Information Sharing Index.</p>

	<p pid="a.296W.5/1">Information on the steps being taken to establish a system to collect information about children who have been trafficked or smuggled to the UK has been provided in answer to your related PQ 68551. The Home Office is working in collaboration with both the EU and G8 countries to combat trafficking and the following outlines current actions:</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/2" class="italic">(a) EU countries</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/3">The EU action plan on combating and preventing trafficking in human beings, which was agreed during the UK presidency, contains a number of specific actions focusing on children, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/4" class="indent">holding a seminar on sharing best practice regarding the identification of children at risk, in particular unaccompanied minors;</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/5" class="indent">improving the strategic and tactical intelligence picture on trafficking in human beings and enabling an intelligence-led approach;</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/6" class="indent">ensuring that Frontex (the EU's border agency) work on trafficking takes into account the particular circumstances of the most vulnerable victims, in particular children and women.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/7">The plan also commits member states to sharing lists of priority origin and transit countries and the most frequently encountered routes; as well as improving knowledge on the scale and nature of trafficking in human beings.</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/8" class="italic">(b) The rest of the world</p>
	<p pid="a.296W.5/9">The G8 are committed to tackling the threat of human trafficking and has recently accepted the UK's questionnaire and concept paper on human trafficking and smuggling which was proposed during our presidency. The concept paper and questionnaire will serve to add value to the G8's position on immigration crime and aims to highlight where a joined-up international approach on human trafficking will be most influential by looking at current trends, routings and areas of best practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.299W.5/1">In 2004 the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) undertook an exercise to evaluate the compliance of Registered Bodies with the Bureau's Code of Practice. This identified risks to the Disclosure service posed by an increasing and remote Registered Body network. Although the CRB and the Bichard Inquiry recognise the vital role of Registered Bodies in the Disclosure service, both share concern over the high numbers and proficiency of the existing Registered Body network.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.5/2">The CRB will consequently reduce the number of Registered Bodies to work with those that remain to make the network more professional and more experienced in the Disclosure process. This will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is fully proficient in the security and policies of the CRB. A minimum threshold of 100 applications per year, per Registered Body has been set. The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations that do not meet the volume criteria about how they can access the Disclosure service in the future before their registration is cancelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.5/3">The CRB has developed an alternative distribution network, through the Umbrella Body (UB) network to ensure cancelled organisations maintain full access to the Disclosure service. The CRB has been working closely with the existing UB network to ensure that they are able to provide an effective, robust and efficient service and have the capacity to absorb the increased volume of applications from new and cancelled organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.299W.5/4">The CRB have developed a 'controlled roll out programme' to ensure that UB's can manage any increased volume with ease. The CRB have also been encouraging those organisations that remain part of the Registered Body network to become UBs. The UBs are able to offer a great deal of experience in handling and processing CRB checks that can also pay dividends in ensuring that the check is completed as quickly as possible. In addition, improved UB web pages have been developed and implemented on the CRB website, which provides an enhanced search facility to enable eligible organisations to find a suitable Umbrella Body.</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.2/2">In England, resources previously held by the Home Office for the dental care of prisoners have been devolved to those primary care trusts (PCTs) that host a publicly managed prison. This forms part of their general allocation to commission appropriate healthcare services for prisoners. These resources are not ring fenced, and PCTs as part of their commissioning role are able to move resources from one healthcare service to another to meet their specific local needs. It is therefore not possible for us to identify centrally how much is spent on dentistry in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.300W.2/3">The dental services provided to prisoners are an integral part of primary dental services under the new contractual arrangements for national health service dentistry. PCTs are required to provide all dental services required to meet the reasonable needs of their resident population, including prisoners. In Wales, these resources have been devolved to local health boards. Arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland are a matter for the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland office respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.0/1">The importance of involving crime reduction partnership agencies in the resettlement of offenders is recognised in the NOMS regional strategies to reduce re-offending as well as nationally in the Government's Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan. In November 2005 Baroness Scotland launched three alliances, including the Civic Alliance which set out how NOMS can work with local authorities and local communities to reduce re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.0/2">These are now being rolled out across the nine regions and Wales by Regional Offender Managers (ROMs). The ROM in the East Midlands, along with the Local Government Association and Society of Local Government Chief Executives, is leading a demonstration project on how NOMS will work with local Strategic Partnerships and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) through local area agreements to reduce re-offending in local communities. To date no evaluation of the effectiveness of CDRPs' involvement specifically in the resettlement of ex-prisoners has been completed. However, work has recently begun in London to examine the operation of a scheme aimed at meeting the needs of prisoners resettling in eight London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.0/3">The scheme&mdash;the London Resettlement Pilot&mdash;forms part of the London Resettlement Strategy published in September 2005. The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in the eight boroughs (Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Brent, Barnet, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Harrow and Ealing) are working with Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London. They have nominated local strategic leaders who are working to develop enhanced and co-ordinated responses to the needs of resettling prisoners. An action research project has been commissioned which will report in summer 2006 on the resettlement pilot and will include an assessment of progress being made through working with local partnerships in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.0/4">An evaluation is also currently underway of the impact of Prolific and other Priority Offenders Programme (PPO), which is being implemented by CDRPs and local Strategic Partnerships. One strand of the programme is aimed at rehabilitating and resettling PPOs who are in custody or serving sentences in the community, through closer working between all relevant agencies and continued post-sentence support. A final report on this work is due in autumn 2006.</p>

Under tier 1 of the proposed points-based system high-skilled migrants will receive points for a number of attributes they can demonstrate, including their previous earnings. As with the current High Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP), salaries earned overseas will be converted at an appropriate rate so that we can equate the earnings of equivalent workers between countries which have different income levels. The precise details of the points-based system, including salary conversion rates, are being developed and will be announced in advance of our implementation of the points-based system.</p>

	<p pid="a.312W.5/1">The Home Secretary has regular meetings with the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. Recent meetings have not covered the effect of 'churn' specifically, but have focused on the establishment of the Offenders Learning and Skills (OLASS) project, which will introduce a new service of education and skills for offenders in both custody and the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.5/2">There have also been discussions about the Reducing Reoffending through Skills and Employment Green Paper launched in December 2005, which looks at strengthening the link between education and employability for prisoners. The Department for Education and Skills, the National Offender Management Service and the national probation directorate (NPD) are working closely to ensure that all prisoners have education opportunities in prison and in the community after release. The throughput of prisoners in establishments (i.e. numbers of prisoners received and discharged on a daily basis, also known as churn&quot;) has increased significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.312W.5/3">It has had some impact on establishment performance, particularly in hard pressed local prisons. However, since April 2002, over 150,000 basic skills qualifications have been achieved by learners in prison. (In the last year, the NPD in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council supported the achievement of just under 9,500 qualifications to offenders in the community).</p>

	<p pid="a.312W.8/1">The Prison Service already has a scheme at HMP Coldingley that pays prisoners market rates for their work. However any expansion of such a pilot is limited by finding sufficient work that generates income to support such schemes. Under present legislation prisoners cannot be required to contribute directly to the cost of their stay in prison. Section 51 of the Prison Act 1952 requires that all expenses incurred for the maintenance of prisons and prisoners are met from public funds. However some schemes do exist that enable prisoners to make voluntary contributions to a variety of charitable causes, including those for victims. The Prisoners' Earnings Act 1996, which would, if implemented, allow deductions to be made, is very complex and prescriptive and would cost substantially more to administer than it would raise in revenue.</p>

	<p pid="a.315W.2/1">The Home Office has had significant and regular contact with employers and employers' organisations to discuss the future changes to the immigration system since this increase in the minimum qualifying period for settlement was announced on seven February 2005. Between that date and the introduction of the change we received no views from employers on the substance of the policy, and the views that we have received since have been about the effect of the timing on individuals, not on sectors of business or employment. Most of the views we receive from employers in the normal course of events are that skilled workers do not stay with them for long enough, which, of course, is not affected by this change.

	<p pid="a.315W.5/1">The change does not affect anyone's right to remain and work in the UK; anyone with valid leave to remain and who is continuing in employment will qualify to remain as before and should have no difficulty in completing the fifth year. It will, therefore, have no affect on the employability of those on work permits since their employability is linked first and foremost to the skills that they possess, whether there is an employer who continues to require those skills, and whether the skills are still not available in the resident labour market. In some cases an employer may have to obtain renewal of a work permit and to pay a fee. We wish to maintain the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for investors. But our assessment is that the length of the qualifying period for settlement is of marginal importance in inward investment decisions compared with economic factors and the specific investment opportunities available. The discussions that we have had with representatives include those who represent individual overseas investors and these discussions have reassured us that the impact of this change on its own is likely to be neutral.</p>

	<p pid="a.316W.2/1">The Government looked closely at the merits of introducing transitional arrangements for those affected by the increase in the minimum qualifying period for settlement. In deciding not to introduce transitional arrangements the Government was took account, amongst other things, the following: this change does not prevent anyone from doing anything that they are currently doing; it does not limit anyone's time with any employer or reduce their stay in the United Kingdom in any way; and that to introduce transitional arrangements for those who arrived when the qualifying period was four years would mean that a desirable policy would not take effect until 2011.</p>

The SIA has consistently made this position clear since then. Incorrect advice was given to one company by the SIA's call centre in October 2005, which was corrected in February 2006.

	<p pid="a.319W.6/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about how many days it took to rate a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support and Incapacity Benefit in Alloa in the most recent period for which figures are available. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/4" class="indent">Our measure of the time taken to process a claim is the Actual Average Clearance Time. For 2005/06, the Jobcentre Plus Key Management Indicators for processing claims were 12 working days for Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance and 19 working days for Incapacity Benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus does not record separate information for Alloa. However, it is included with the whole of the Stirling area. The average clearance times for the Stirling area in March 2006 are set out in the table.</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.319W.6/12"> <td>March 2006</td> <td>18.3</td> <td>10</td> <td>14.3</td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/15" class="indent">Although the overall Actual Average Clearance Time for Income Support claims during 2005/06 is 11.3 days, the figure for March was 18.3 days. Action is being taken to reverse the recent increase in clearance times in Income Support.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/16" class="indent">A number of additional staff are currently undergoing intensive training and we anticipate an improvement in clearance times once they come into operation. Our management groups meet regularly to review local arrangements and performance issues, and this enables us to solve immediate problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.319W.6/17" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus gives a high priority to customer service and we are doing everything we can to ensure that we continue to deliver the high level of service our customers have the right to expect.</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.5/1">The peace process in Cote d'Ivo(r)ire is at a critical stage. The security situation will remain fragile and difficult to predict in the lead up to elections. The UN peacekeeping deployment, working closely with French peacekeepers, has played an important role in maintaining peace on the ground under difficult circumstances. Discussions in New York are currently under way on the UN Secretary General's call for additional troops and civilian police. We believe that an increase in troops is justified, but decisions on the precise modalities must be made on a careful assessment of need.</p>

Its members are known to wear stolen uniforms from other armed forces, which may have led to confusion as to the identity of those involved. We are following the situation very closely and continue to emphasise to all sides the need to deal robustly with the LRA while respecting the territorial integrity of the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.5/1">The UK is at the forefront of international efforts to bring peace to Darfur. In the absence of a peace agreement we have been a leading supporter of the African Union mission (AMIS) there, contributing over &pound;50 million. The African Union (AU) has done a good job in improving security in the region. But the situation is evolving and a more multi-disciplinary approach is now needed. We therefore support handover to a UN mission when AMIS' current mandate expires on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in constant contact at Ministerial level with the AU, UN and on a bilateral basis with those nations taking key roles in the peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.5/2">Only a political solution will bring lasting peace and security to Darfur. We fully support the AU-led peace talks in Abuja and are pressing the parties to reach a deal as soon as possible. We have had a permanent presence throughout the talks since March in the form of a high-level Special Representative. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development arrived in Abuja on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-02">2 May</phrase> to support the negotiations and help achieve a deal. We are urging the parties to reach an agreement without further delay, on the basis of the AU's draft peace agreement text.</p>

The next report will then be submitted, under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, no less than eight years and no more than 12 years from the date the current report is received by the Government.</p>

For transfers we have provided the amount of local authority debt repaid by Central Government. The list shows the one off payment that was made to discharge the Office's continued liability, through the Housing Revenue Account (HRA), to pay subsidy on an authority's housing attributable debt that remains after transfer. This option of paying off debt, as opposed to continuing to pay subsidy, was introduced in 1999 following consultation and is not an extra cost, it is largely a question of when the liability to meet the cost of HRA debt is discharged. There is no debt repayment for ALMOs as the local authority continues to be support through the HRA subsidy system.</p>

	<p pid="a.359W.0/1">The national bowel cancer screening programme will be rolled out nationally over the next three years. Funding for the first year of the screening programme is being transferred to the national cancer screening team in Sheffield and Wolverhampton will be the first local screening centre. We estimate that around &pound;10 million will be spent on the first stages of the national bowel cancer screening programme. Funding decisions have not yet been made for future years but we are committed to ensuring that the necessary funding is available to ensure the full implementation of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.0/2">NHS cancer screening programmes are taking all the necessary action to ensure that successful roll-out of the programme, including the procurement of testing kits. The kit supplier has been notified that the first order is for 100,000 kits.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.0/3">Five programme hubs across England will invite men and women to participate in the screening programme, send out the faecal occult blood (FOB) testing kits, interpret kits and send results out. 90 to 100 local screening centres will provide endoscopy services for the two per cent, of men and women who have a positive FOB test result.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.0/4">The pilot in Rugby will continue to run as planned to the end of March 2007. In addition, the first of the five programme hubs will also be established by March 2007, with announcements to be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.2/1">The service development guide 'Everybody's Business' was launched in November 2005 as the next step in the Department's strategy for improving mental health and care services for older people, including those with dementia. It builds on the existing service models outlined in the 'National Service Framework for Older People' (2001) and the principles promoted in 'Securing Better Mental Health for Older Adults' (July 2005). One of the main aims of the guide is that older adults with mental health problems and their carers have their needs met wherever they are in the system, including where possible being supported and enabled to live independently at home.</p>

	<p pid="a.373W.0/1">The Mental Health Act 1983 sets out the circumstances in which people with a mental disorder who are being treated compulsorily under that act may receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The act allows ECT to be given to patients who are under compulsory powers when a patient with capacity consents or if the patient's doctor prescribes it and a second opinion appointed doctor agrees to it. People can also receive ECT voluntarily. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on the use of ECT in 2003. The guidance is available on NICE'S website at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.374W.8/1">Information on expenditure by the national health service on mental health services in each year since 1992&ndash;93 is shown in the table. The table also shows the proportion of mental health expenditure as part of the hospital and community mental health services (HCHS) budget. The proportion of mental health spend has increased from 11.47 per cent. of the total HCHS budget in 1992&ndash;93 to 13.34 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.8/2">The data excludes social care spend on people with mental health problems, and expenditure concerning people treated in primary care for whom a specific diagnosis has not been reached. The figures therefore underestimate the total mental health expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.8/3">In order to gain a more comprehensive picture of mental health spend, the Department commissioned national surveys of investment in mental health services in each year since 2001. The reports of four surveys covering the period from 2000&ndash;01 to 2004&ndash;05 are available from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>. The survey covering the financial year 2005&ndash;06 will be placed on the Department's website shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.8/2">Calorie-free soft drinks contribute to consumer choice and current consumption levels of artificial sweeteners are within safe limits. The Government's healthy eating advice remains that consumers should drink plenty of water, or other fluids, daily, and to drink fewer sugary soft and fizzy drinks.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.8/3">The Food Standards Agency and Department have published guidance for schools on practical ways of developing approaches, which provide healthy drinks and snacks. This encourages schools to provide, in addition to drinking and bottled water, other drinks which provide a nutritional benefit to pupils, such as fruit juices and milk-based drinks.</p>

	<p pid="a.381W.2/1">The Department does not hold this information nationally or for individual local authorities. Council funding for adult social services is derived from a number of sources: a share of overall formula grant allocated by the Department for Communities and Local Government, specific grants distributed by the Department, revenue from council tax, income from fees and charges and local decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.381W.2/2">As most of the Government funding for adult social care is allocated without conditions, it is not possible to identify the proportion of that funding that may be attributable to residential care. Local authorities have a significant degree of flexibility to manage and direct their resources in accordance with local priorities and the needs of the communities to which they are accountable.</p>
