	<p pid=".2W.3/1">As set out in the recent consultation paper &quot;The use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way,&quot; I consider it inappropriate and unsustainable that historic evidence of use by horse-drawn vehicles or dedications for vehicular use at a time before the internal combustion engine existed can give rise to rights to use modern mechanically propelled vehicles. I have proposed that this should no longer be the case, but that a period of one year might be allowed for the recording of byways open to all traffic based on such evidence. I will consider carefully the responses to these proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/2">As explained in the consultation paper, we intend to revise the advice andguidance on managing the different sorts of traffic on vehicular rights of way in the publication &quot;Making the Best of Byways (1997)&quot;. In doing so, we will examine the Hierarchy of Trail Routes in the Lake District National Park and how a similar approach might improve the management of unsurfaced roads elsewhere. We will also look at various techniques for maintaining unsurfaced roads, including those used by Her Majesty's Royal Engineers, which have been applied with some success on the Ridgeway National Trail. The consultation paper invites views on any other ways in which &quot;Making the Best of Byways&quot; might be revised.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/3">Local highway authorities are responsible for maintaining rights of way, not the Highways Agency. Information on how much these authorities have spent on the maintenance of unsurfaced byways could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.3/4">We are currently conducting a year-long study of a representative sample of byways open to all traffic, to collect evidence of the level of use of these ways by mechanically propelled vehicles and their surface condition. What is important and what we want to establish, is not how much the volume of traffic has changed, but what it is now and whether it is sustainable.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.5/2">Proposals for a new Batteries Directive have only recently been seen and are yet to be negotiated in Europe. As a result, there is currently no EU law that stipulates a target for the collection of batteries. The proposals outline targets for collection of portable batteries of 160 grams per inhabitant per annum. For the UK, this equates to around 45 per cent. of batteries put on the market.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.5/3">At present, the UK is collecting less than 1 per cent. of household batteries. In anticipation of a collection target, both Defra and the DTI are in talks with those stakeholders affected by the proposal and are looking at ways to secure early participation. This will enable the UK to successfully meet a target for collection within a given timeframe. In addition, both Departments are fully involved in discussions with the European Commission and the European Parliament, to ensure that targets for the collection and recycling of household batteries are challenging but achievable.</p>

Table 2 also shows the number of cases in which a prosecution proceeded. These comprise cases in which the defendant was convicted after trial or guilty plea; and cases which resulted in an acquittal by the jury, or on the judge's direction.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.9/5">Table 2 also shows the number and proportion of cases resulting in a conviction at the crown court and those cases which resulted in an unsuccessful outcome, including cases that did not proceed and those which resulted in an acquittal.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.9/6">The Crown Prosecution Service holds no historical records showing why cases did not proceed: the information is held on individual case files, and could be retrieved only by examining every relevant file in each Crown Prosecution Service office.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.9/7">The decision whether to proceed with a case is taken in accordance with the criteria set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The code states that a case should only start or continue if there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and, if there is sufficient evidence, where it is in the public interest to proceed. Where there is sufficient evidence, a prosecution will usually take place unless public interest considerations against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour. The code is applied in every case. Where the criteria are not met, then the decision to discontinue is in the interests of justice.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.9/8">Together with its criminal justice partners, the Crown Prosecution Service is subject to a Public Service Agreement target of increasing the number of offences for which an offender is brought to justice. The service, therefore, seeks to reduce both cases which do not proceed and those which result in an unsuccessful outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.9/9">A number of initiatives contribute towards this aim. The Crown Prosecution Service has re-structured its front line operations by establishing co-located units in which prosecutors and caseworkers work in partnership with the police to prepare and strengthen cases, focusing resources on more serious cases and providing better support to victims and witnesses. In addition, the service is implementing the recommendations of Sir Robin Auld that they should assume responsibility for determining charges from the outset of the case. The implementation of the Compass Case Management system will provide the Crown Prosecution Service with better information on the progress and outcome of proceedings, allowing managers to identify areas of excellence and areas in which performance requires remedial action. Over time this will include information about the reasons underlying case failures.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.5/1">The objective of the Commission's programme of assistance to the Western Balkans (the CARDS programme) is to support the Stabilisation and Association Process in the region through reconstruction, work on democracy, human rights and the rule of law, economic and social development and promoting closer relations between recipient countries and between those countries and the EU.

	<p pid=".22W.5/3">In both CARDS and TACIS, programmes funded under the 2002 Budget will typically last for at least three years.

	<p pid=".22W.5/4">When considering Commission funding proposals, DFID took a wide range of factors into consideration, including likely cost-effectiveness and value for money. Any concerns about value for money were raised with the Commission. Many of the projects approved in 2002 are in the early stages of implementation.

A &pound;500,000 grant to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) strategy for empowering women in Iraq is strengthening women's groups at a governorate level and encouraging government to take proper account of the needs of women. Two DFID-funded advisers provide support and expertise to the Iraqi Governing Council, the Coalition Provisional Authority and to the newly forming women's groups.

Four projects that have improved access to potable water, sanitation and environmental health in some of the poorest communities have recently been brought to a successful conclusion. We currently fund two projects.</p>

Both projects are making good progress.</p>

DFID has supported the Palestinian Negotiations Affairs Department to research their position in preparation for negotiations on water access. While it would be possible to advance discussions immediately, the link between water rights and other issues such as borders and the separation barrier has so far led to a reluctance on both sides to engage on the issue outside the framework of overall final status negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.8/2">One of the most authoritative recent studies is the Nutritional Assessment and Sentinel Surveillance System, done in 2002 by Johns Hopkins and Al-Quds Universities.

In the Gaza strip these figures were 13.3 per cent. and 17.5 per cent. respectively. They found that 7.8 per cent. of children aged 6&ndash;59 months in the Palestinian Territory suffer from acute malnutrition, and 11.7 per cent. from chronic malnutrition. A normally nourished reference population would have 2.28 per cent. of population with global malnutrition, and 0.13 per cent. with severe malnutrition.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.6/1">At the start of the current financial year our agreed budget for support to Palestinians was &pound;24.5 million. This includes funding for both the Palestinian territory and for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), which provides services to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria as well as the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Planned allocations for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 are &pound;26.5 million, an increase of &pound;2 million over the budgeted figures for the current year. In 2003&ndash;04 and previous years since the intifada started in 2000, spending plans for the Palestinian territory and UNRWA have been supplemented by additional resources made available in-year in response to unpredictable events.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.6/2">We have increased our expenditure in 2003&ndash;04 to &pound;40.2 million in response to emergency needs and Middle East peace process opportunities. The 2003&ndash;04 figure also includes &pound;0.7 million allocated to DFID from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP), which is managed by the FCO on behalf of FCO, MOD and DFID. Figures for future years make no assumptions about additional resources from within DFID or the GCPP.</p>

Our support is delivered through a contract with ASI Ltd, who are accountable to us for the use of our funding. There are no specific conditions attached to the funding. We monitor the assistance NSU provides against an agreed budget and objectives.

UK funds have supported the NSU's advice to the Palestinian Authority in presenting their case on the Israeli separation barrier at the International Court of Justice.

	<p pid=".32W.5/1">The agreement in November 2003 between Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was part of a follow-up process to the Pretoria Agreement signed between the two countries on 30 July 2002. That agreement provided for the Government of Rwanda to withdraw all its forces from the DRC. It did this by October 2002 and the withdrawal was verified by MONUC (the UN Mission to the DRC). It also provided for the Government of DRC to cease all support for ex-FAR/Interhamwe and to encourage the voluntary repatriation of Rwandans from DRC, particularly combatants. The Government of DRC issued a declaration stating that the FDLR (Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda) were unwelcome in its territory and arrested two senior genocidaires in 2002. The UK Government fully supports this process as an important means of ending conflict in the region and achieving greater stability.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.8/1">Since 2002, DFID has supported the Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (RDRP) with a grant of &pound;5.5 million. The RDRP's mission statement is</p>
	<p pid=".32W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;to support successful social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants in their respective communities so as to realize national security, reconciliation, and development. This will be achieved through demobilizing ex-combatants and supporting their social and economic reintegration into communities of their own choice for a fresh start, thereby saving economic resources for investment in social and economic development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".32W.8/3">DFID judge that the RDRP has been well managed by the Government of Rwanda's Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission (RDRC).</p>
	<p pid=".32W.8/4">The DFID office in Rwanda has been engaged in working with the RDRC to ensure successful reintegration of ex-combatants. DFID has been particularly active in working to ensure that the RDRP addresses practical social and economic issues; including the perception and acceptance by communities of ex-combatants, the opportunities for skills training and employment of ex-combatants, access to counselling and medical services, and the particular needs of female and child ex-combatants in the reintegration process.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.8/5">The re-integration sessions that ex-Force Arm&eacute;es Rwandaise (ex-FAR) attend last up to two weeks. These sessions are voluntary and are the same as those attended by those demobilised from the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF). The sessions are focused on explaining the benefits available to the ex-FAR and ex-RDF under the RDRP, such as the recognition of service allowance, available medical services and counselling as well as whether they are eligible for extra funds if they are assessed as being particularly vulnerable. They are also given advice on how they can best utilise the allowances they receive, for example in how to establish income generating co-operatives and how to prepare project proposals to access loans and grants.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.8/6">It should be noted that the majority of ex-FAR soldiers have already settled in communities before they attend the RDRP sessions, sometimes for a number of years. Accordingly, their reintegration needs are often not as acute as other ex-combatants and the two week sessions are felt to be sufficient to help them access and utilise their benefits. When back in their communities, ex-FAR, like other demobilised ex-combatants, are able to use the services of the RDRP's Provincial Programme Officers to follow-up on advice and information on the benefits and services available under the RDRP and through other community-wide programmes of support.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.2/2">The UK supports the Uganda Government's Plan for Modernisation of Agriculture (PMA). The PMA is a framework for Government action in support of smallholder farming households. It directs public resources to ensure that markets operate effectively and provides farmers with access to both agricultural inputs and markets for agricultural produce. Government institutions charged with agricultural service provision have been restructured to ensure they respond effectively to the demands of farmers. PMA priorities include the provision of better information through agricultural research and advice from Government extension workers; the provision of financial services; and physical investment, for example on rural feeder roads, to improve access to markets. Smallholders are supported in accessing regional and international markets. DFID has been closely involved in the design and implementation of the PMA.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.2/3">Improved export opportunities will be particularly important in the development of Uganda's agricultural sector. We have funded a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening Uganda's trade policy and access to wider international markets.</p>

General food distribution is rarely the most appropriate intervention in urban environments, where commercial availability and affordability are the principal factors affecting access to food. However, DFID are working with WFP in Bulawayo and Harare to provide targeted feeding to growth-faltering children under five. Recent vulnerability assessments indicate a sharp rise in urban vulnerability levels. The humanitarian community are currently discussing the most appropriate interventions. WFP are extending their school feeding programme in urban areas.</p>

Our understanding is that those concerns were limited to part of the spending of the European Development Fund (EDF) that was converted into Zimbabwe dollars during 2002. Humanitarian aid, which is largely funded from the EU budget rather than the EDF, was therefore not affected. Humanitarian aid is in any case very largely used to procure food and other goods outside Zimbabwe and would not be converted into Zimbabwe dollars.</p>

In collaboration with our development partners, we operate a policy of zero tolerance towards political interference&mdash;including claiming credit for donor food distribution&mdash;in humanitarian operations. Procedures in place to reduce the risk of political interference have proved generally effective to date. Any such incidents are quickly identified, reported and followed up, including suspending food distribution where appropriate. We and other donors and agencies also use the media when appropriate to publicise our activities and to explain the extent of donor support to Zimbabwe during the present crisis. Looking ahead to the parliamentary elections anticipated early next year, monitoring of any political interference will be given even higher attention in coming months.</p>

	<p pid=".36W.9/1">When providing school meals, school authorities are currently required to comply with the nutritional standards produced by the Caroline Walker Trust. These aim to contribute to a better-balanced diet which contains more bread, cereals, other starchy foods, fruit and vegetables and which is rich in minerals and vitamins, and which has less fat, sugar and salty foods. Also, the Department of Education is about to initiate a pilot study for one calendar year from next March to determine how best to introduce new compulsory nutritional standards for school meals and ensure the best chance of success.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.9/2">Health education is a compulsory element of the curriculum for all pupils. They are taught to make responsible decisions about their diet, and to know and understand the contribution of food to growth, energy and health.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.3/1">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services (Conferences and Events) has organised 14 conferences for the FCO in the period in question, one of which was held overseas. Total costs were: travel: &pound;126,981.94; catering: &pound;71,818.69; accommodation: &pound;207,442.46; miscellaneous: &pound;320,742.21.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/2">The FCO's Executive Agency, Wilton Park, held 43 conferences in the UK on a wide range of international themes from March 2003 to February 2004. Costs are offset by conference sponsorship, both from FCO departments and from outside organisations. Total costs were: travel for speakers and participants &pound;324,112; catering &pound;125,000; accommodation &pound;265,000; miscellaneous (running costs of staff and premises) &pound;2,238,000.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/3">Additionally, five Wilton Park conferences were held abroad in that period. Local conference partners meet the in-country costs for food, accommodation and miscellaneous costs.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/4">FCO Directorates may opt to manage events from their own resources rather than ask FCO Services (Conferences and Events) to do so, but details of these events are not held centrally and can be collated only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The report identifies several factors as being responsible for delivery problems that occurred in theatre. These include the asset tracking systems in place and the short period of time available for preparation and planning of deployment. Specific items that suffered from delivery problems in theatre include some vehicle spares and personal kit such as, desert combat clothing and Enhanced Combat Body Armour plates. Where there was a lack of equipment, priority was given to those personnel on the ground whom commanders judged to have the greatest need. We have drawn lessons from this and other recent operations, such as improving our asset tracking capability, and are always looking for ways in which to enhance our logistics performance.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.6/2">The overall capability offered by the Type 45 destroyer's gun is not related simply to the calibre of the barrel, but to the ammunition which could be used.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.6/3">The standard 115 mm (4.5) gun is capable of delivering conventional munitions to a range of up to 27 km. 127 mm and 155 mm guns would be capable of firing munitions to a range of 75&ndash;80 km. They would also be capable of firing modern guided munitions and, in the case of the 155 mm gun, these would be considerably heavier than the 115 mm gun's conventional munitions.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.6/4">The design of the Type 45 includes space and weight margins which would allow for the fitting of an improved Medium Range Gun, should such a requirement emerge. There is no such requirement at present. In the case of a 155 mm gun, this would also depend on the maturity of its technology, as there are no such naval guns yet in service world-wide.</p>

	<p pid=".50W.5/1">The presence of wind farms in most areas of the UK presents no difficulty to low flying training providing pilots are aware of the existence and position of the developments. They are treated the same as any other obstruction; displayed on military low flying charts and published in the Military Aeronautical Planning Document Volume 3 Part 1. They are then taken into account during route planning and avoided by standard separation criteria, these vary according to the type of aircraft.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.5/2">The Tactical Training Areas and the Electronic Warfare Training Range at Spadeadam in the English/Scottish border region are critical to low flying training because aircraft are allowed to fly at much lower levels. Within these areas an accumulation of wind turbines, particularly if combined with other obstacles, could give rise to concerns and could affect our ability to conduct operational flying training effectively. We are therefore more likely to raise objections to proposals for developments in these areas.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.8/1">There are no plans for legislation to require radon testing of homes.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.8/2">(i) In the case of homes built without radon protection, successive governments have run a radon measurement programme to identify the extent of the radon problem. In the last eight years it has mainly focused on homes likely to be at most risk. In England, where the problem is estimated to be greatest, and in Northern Ireland, that has meant every home with a greater than 5 per cent. probability of having radon concentrations at or above the National Radiological Protection Board recommended level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre of air, has been offered a free radon test. The Government's current programme continues to offer free tests to the homes at most at risk. This targeting has encouraged the more at risk householders to undertake radon remediation. This is an approach that has been tested and shown that it can double the amount of remediation in homes where there is greatest risk from this naturally occurring radioactive gas.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.8/3">Under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's proposals for home information packs, the pack is likely to include information on whether the property is located within a radon affected area. Issues of practicality and cost suggest that it would not be appropriate to require radon testing as part of a statutory home information pack scheme. However, this will be considered further by specialist working groups that are being set up to consider the contents of the pack before any final decisions are taken.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.8/4">(ii) Post completion tests of houses that include radon measures had demonstrated that the level of protection is adequate and it would be uneconomic to test every house. Of the few houses where the radon levels have risen after occupation all but one were due to alterations to the house and the increase level in the remaining house was due to the use of a method of protection that is not recommended in official guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.8/5"><i></i><i>(b)</i> The revised questions in the searches form used in conveyancing are much more pointed in relation to radon and ask about radon tests and radon proofing. As the standardised procedures relating to house purchases address radon much more effectively than was the case in the past, there is no case to require test certificates through legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.2/1">Sam Younger, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, wrote to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in January about the timing of the Government's information campaign about elected regional assemblies. He suggested that the Government's information campaign should stop once the referendum period begins.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.2/2">In my reply, I have pointed out that during the course of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertook to deliver a leaflet providing information about the referendum issues to every household in the regions affected. It is not feasible for us to print or deliver that leaflet before the referendums have been called and the date of those referendums is settled. This commitment to Parliament could not be honoured if Mr. Younger's suggestion was followed.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.2/3">Section 125 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) requires the Government to stop providing information 28 days before the close of poll. However, we intend these referendums to be conducted by all-postal ballot, which means that voters will receive their ballot papers, and be able to vote, up to three weeks before close of poll. We have therefore indicated to the Chairman of the Electoral Commission our intention to stop our information campaign 28 days before the first day that ballot papers can be dispatched. This complies with both the letter and the spirit of the PPERA and enables our commitment to Parliament to be honoured.</p>

	<p pid=".67W.5/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Colin Mowl to Simon Hughes dated 15 March 2004</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/4" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question on levels of <i>(a)</i> manufacturing output and <i>(b)</i> employment in the manufacturing sector in (i) Greater London and (ii) each London Borough in each of the last five years. I am replying in his absence. (158452)</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/5" class="indent">The information given in the attached tables on employment and Gross Value Added (GVA) in the manufacturing sector is taken from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). Data on GVA are provided from 1998 to 2001, the most recent year for which estimates are available. Data on employment are provided from 1998 to 2002, although estimates for 2002 are provisional. Data have not been supplied prior to 1998 since this was the first year in which the ABI was carried out; 1997 data would be from a different data collection exercise and would therefore not be comparable.The Annual Business Inquiry samples businesses on a national level stratified by country (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) as well as by industrial classification and size band. Outputs are primarily produced at national level, with sub-national outputs (as shown in the tables) produced subsequently using a regression model to apportion the data to local units. All sub-national data should therefore be treated with caution. This particularly applies to borough-level data since small area estimates have greater sampling and modelling uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.5/6" class="indent">Approximate Gross Value Added represents the income generated by businesses, encompassing wages and salaries, the cost of capital investment and financial charges, and profit. It includes taxes on production (e.g. business rates) net of subsidies but excludes subsidies and taxes on products (e.g. VAT and excise duty). The estimates shown are at current prices and hence are not adjusted for inflation The estimates for the number of employees by area are based on the location of the employing company, but it must be emphasised that they are derived from a regression model and are not actual counts of employees.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.0/1">I attended the Telecoms Council held on 8 March 2004 in Brussels. There was a round-table debate on the state of the telecoms sector, in particular on two areas for action by governments; the transposition of the new regulatory framework and implementing national broadband strategies. There was broad consensus that the sector was recovering, that compelling content would be key in driving take-up of broadband and that e-Government was important as driver and exemplar in services. The rollout of broadband in under served areas was also discussed, including the importance of applying structural funding in a technology-neutral, market-led and competition-based way.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/2">I pointed out that in the face of increasingly stiffer international competition it was vital for the EU to make the most of its competitive edge from creating the largest single coherent telecoms market by implementing the new regulatory package in a timely, consistent and effective way. I emphasised the need for a vision and specific planning beyond 2005 to meet the Lisbon goal by 2010 of Europe becoming the world's knowledge-based leader. To achieve this, I stressed the importance of intensifying dialogue with industry across the whole value chain. The Presidency will submit the Conclusions of this Council discussion to the Spring European Council on 25&ndash;26 March.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.0/3">The Presidency will also submit to the Spring European Council the Council Conclusions on the following items, which were agreed without substantial debate; the e-Europe 2005 Mid-Term, unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes, or &quot;spam&quot; and on the following-up to the World Summit on the Information Society.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills has not conducted an assessment of special school outreach programmes which support pupils with moderate learning difficulties based in mainstream schools. Ofsted has responsibility for school inspections, including an assessment of any support that schools offer to other schools. In his annual report for 2002&ndash;03, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools noted that 'good support is provided by the special schools for pupils attending mainstream schools and colleges and this contributes significantly to the quality of the programmes. A small number of schools also provide outreach support and advice to staff in mainstream schools. However, the role of special schools in this respect is weak and developing slowly.'</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/2">The Government's new SEN Strategy&mdash;Removing Barriers to Achievement&mdash;launched in February 2004, encourages special schools to do more to share their expertise with mainstream schools in support of greater inclusion. While there is clearly scope for them to develop this aspect of their role, it is important that the quality of advice and support they offer is of a high standard. Some special schools already achieve this, but it is clear from HMCI's report that the quality overall is variable. The SEN strategy therefore includes the development of generic minimum standards for SEN support services which would extend to outreach offered by special schools. It is envisaged that these will be used for self-evaluation by local authorities and schools and in Ofsted inspections and will be a form of quality assurance for schools obtaining support from external sources.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.5/2">All SENCOs based in early years settings will have benefited from three days relevant training by 2004. We are currently in the process of evaluating how local authorities are delivering the new SEN training materials. We are also asking local authorities how they are ensuring that SENCOs based in yearly years settings receive the appropriate training to be able to deliver services to meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.5/3">SENCOs are based in private, voluntary and independent sector early years settings. It is a requirement that all publicly funded early years provision has a SENCO. These SENCOs are supported by approximately 850 Area SENCOs who have been employed to support early years settings. Encouragingly the assessment of LEA/EYDCP plans for 2002/03 revealed that 90 per cent. of local authorities had Area SENCOs in place. Figures for 2003/04 will be available later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 25 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".91W.2/2">The gross cost of abolishing the overlapping benefits rule for carers allowance is estimated at about &pound;330 million a year, or &pound;195 million after allowing for reduced payments in the income-related benefits <sup>1</sup> . Abolishing the rule only for those aged under 75 would be about &pound;270 million or &pound;160 million after offsetting adjustments. These figures do not take account of the behavioural effect of carers presently not claiming carers allowance who would be induced to do so by a change in the rules.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.2/3" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Estimates use benefit rates for 2003&ndash;04 and are based on a 100 per cent. extract of carers allowance claims on the carer's allowance computer system for May 2003, a 5 per cent. extract from the claims on the income support computer system in 2003 and a 1 per cent. extract of the housing benefit/council tax benefit claims of May 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.9/1">The original cost of &pound;340 million to &pound;375 million is the difference between the assets and the liabilities of the schemes taken over by the PPF in a year. We used the following assumptions to arrive at that cost:</p>
	<p pid=".92W.9/2">(i) Data on the MFR funding levels of just over 1,000 schemes that had an MFR valuation with an effective date between April 1997 and April 2000 were used. Adjustments were made for each scheme in the sample in order to estimate the up-to-date funding position. The results were scaled up to the total for all private sector occupational pension schemes. (ii) The value of the liabilities if such schemes were to fall within the responsibility of the pensions protection fund were estimated on a basis equivalent to midway between the current MFR basis and the full insurance buyout costs for the liabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.9/3">(iii) The cost will obviously depend on the number of firms going insolvent. Allowance was made for the possibility of normal, poor and extreme years as far as bankruptcies are concerned, but on average over a 20-year period, the probabilities of a scheme becoming a liability of the PPF were assumed to be between about 0.3 per cent. a year for large schemes and 1 per cent. a year for small schemes. This assumed level of bankruptcy is cautious, especially given that it is very rare for large companies to go bankrupt.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.9/4">(iv) Allowance was made for the impact of the suggested salary cap using data on the earnings of occupational schemes members from the Family Resources Survey.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.9/5">These costs were recently recalculated at &pound;300 million using the same methodology, but updated to take account of current market conditions and the decisions taken on the precise nature of the PPF compensation payable.</p>

At a local level, Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Advisers work closely with Remploy to ensure disabled people are referred appropriately for support from the company. In addition, Remploy recruit to the Workstep programme directly.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.2/3">Remploy is separately contracted to deliver other Jobcentre Plus programmes, including New Deal for Disabled People, Work Preparation and Work Based Learning for Adults. These contracts are paid for and organised separately from the grant-in-aid given to Remploy for delivery of the Workstep programme.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.2/4">In 2003&ndash;04, Remploy's target is that each employee should spend 5 per cent. of their time on learning and development activities; they are currently on course to exceed this. In addition, Remploy is currently developing a network of learning centres, to provide all their employees with access to learning opportunities.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.7/5" class="indent">In 1997 there were no registers exchanging information with NCAS. By 2001, NCAS received more complete information from four local congenital anomaly registers through multi-source ascertainment. As a result, numbers of notifications in England and Wales have increased since 1997. These registers cover all births in Wales and 24 per cent. of births in England. For the remaining areas NCAS relies solely on SD56 notification forms and is likely to be less complete. Up to eight malformations can be recorded on the system for each baby.</p>

All schools in England were made aware of the Department's &quot;Good Practice in Continence Services&quot; guidance (2000), which addresses measures for effective management. I understand the Department for Education and Skills requires schools to have toilet and medical facilities in accordance with the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999. It is for local assessment of need, on a case by case basis, to determine what additional facilities may be needed in schools. Individual provision in schools is not assessed centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.0/2">&quot;Good Practice in Continence Services&quot; indicates cost-effectiveness associated with specialist continence services and advises that each national health service primary care trust (PCT) should have specialist continence services in place which provide an individual assessment of needs.

	<p pid=".118W.2/1">People with learning disabilities have the same right of access to medical treatment as everyone else. The NHS Plan emphasised the Government's commitment to a person-centred health service that challenges discrimination on all grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/2">&quot;Valuing People&mdash;A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot;, includes an important chapter on improving health for people with learning disabilities. In July 2002, the Department issued good practice guidance on health action plans and health facilitation, two key elements of the &quot;Valuing People&quot; strategy for improving the health of people with learning disabilities. A health action plan is a personal plan detailing the actions needed to maintain and improve the health of an individual and any help needed to achieve this. The plan will usually be co-produced with them. Health facilitation involves casework to help people with learning disabilities access mainstream services. It also involves helping mainstream national health service services to respond to the needs of people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/3">The &quot;Valuing People&quot; support team produced &quot;All Means All&quot; in 2003. This explains how &quot;Improvement Expansion and Reform&quot;, the Department's planning and performance framework, relates to people with learning disabilities. &quot;All Means All&quot; discusses access to health care and identifies that primary care staff, for example, can ensure that all people with a learning disability are identified and known to all members of primary care teams.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/4">&quot;Discharge from Hospital: Pathway, Process and Practice&quot;, published by the health and social care joint unit and change agents team in January 2003 contains good practice guidance and guidelines for the acute sector when caring for someone with a learning disability. It talks about health action plans and emphasises the importance of liaison with the health or social care professional supporting the individual when making preparations for discharge from hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/5">We have undertaken to look into the possibility of annual health checks for people with learning disabilities during 2004 in our response to the recent choice consultation exercise, &quot;Building on the Best&mdash;Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS&quot;, which was published on 9 December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.2/1">An audit of potential donors has been undertaken by UK Transplant since April 2003. It captures information about every death in every intensive care unit in the United Kingdom and records whether the organ donor register was contacted to check the wishes of the deceased.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/2">A recent analysis of the audit data carried out by UK Transplant shows that 250 out of 545, suitable for donation became donors, 25 were contraindicated for medical reasons, 206 relatives refused and for 64 families there was no record of any discussion about donation. In total there were 270 suitable donors who for different reasons did not donate. For physiological reasons not all donors can donate all organs.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/3">UK Transplant will employ an education and training manager to follow up the best practice guidance issued in 2003. A national health service education programme will provide expert education advice on the training needs associated with organ donation and transplantation and produce an education strategy, including the development of an education pack for pre and post graduate use, to deliver raised awareness and knowledge among all relevant NHS staff.</p>

The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer that one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice; it is planned to achieve this by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.0/31">There is a series of staged milestones towards this goal: from 2001 new targets of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer and a maximum one month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for acute leukaemia, children's cancer and testicular cancer were introduced. From 2002, the target of a maximum wait of two months from urgent referral to treatment for breast cancer was introduced. By 2005, there will be targets of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers. Data on current targets are published quarterly on the Department's website for SHAs and trusts, at: <a href="http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/cancerwaits">http://www.performance.doh. gov.uk/cancerwaits</a>.</p>

Training in the United Kingdom complies with them in all cases and exceeds them significantly in many instances.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.3/2">We have in place 20 European working time directive pilot projects, four hospital at night pilots, as well as a significant development programme linked to reform of postgraduate medical training. A vital element of this on-going work is to assess the inter-relationship between implementation of the directive and current proposals to reform medical training to ensure that it is better managed, structured and able to respond to the needs of patients and the service.</p>

	<p pid=".124W.8/2">Measures in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill are designed to reduce abuse of the United Kingdom asylum system. We would therefore expect implementation of its provisions to reduce costs for central and local government in the long-term. Concerns have been raised over the potential impact of clause 8 of the Bill which proposes to withdraw support from failed asylum-seeking families if they refuse to co-operate with efforts to return them home. If, by putting themselves in this position, parents put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of their children should be protected under existing child protection legislation. The Bill does not change the grounds on which children may be taken into care. We do not believe that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position. We have made clear that local authorities would be reimbursed for costs incurred if a child did require assistance from a local authority as a consequence of the withdrawal of support.</p>

If the prisoner was convicted prior to 10 April 1995, there is no power to take a non-intimate sample unless he is a person to whom Section 1 of the Criminal Evidence (Amendment) Act 1997 applies. Section 63(3C) of the 1984 Act also provides that a non-intimate sample may be taken from persons who were detained on the order of the court, following their acquittal on the grounds of insanity or a finding of unfitness to plead.</p>

Of the 3,772 prisoners and patients sampled, 87 prisoners initially refused to be sampled. 77 of these prisoners subsequently agreed and only 10 had a head hair sample taken non-voluntarily. Patients were only sampled if their doctor gave consent and the patient agreed to provide a DNA sample.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.0/12"><sup>(29)</sup> In December 2002 new procedures for reporting self-injury were introduced in prisons in England and Wales, and much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from this rather than reflect an actual increase in incidence of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.0/13">The prison population, and particularly the women's estate, contains a substantial number of individuals who have experienced negative life events, all of which are identified as significant risk factors for suicide and self-harm. These include psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, as well as histories of self-harm and previous abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.0/14">The Prison Service recognises that self-harm is a particular problem among women prisoners, and is currently developing a range of interventions including: individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which is currently being trialled at Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in the Women's Estate; the development of a new, three-stage screening process to more effectively detect mental health problems; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well being of women prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.0/15">One million pounds from the Department of Health has been allocated to the Women's Estate to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses, and 11 out of the 17 prisons for women now have mental health in-reach facilities. A network of establishments (both male and female) has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice on the subject of self-harm, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to all establishments.</p>

It is also to educate about the dangers of anti-Semitism, racism and all forms of discrimination.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.2/1">The incorporation of advanced biometric information into identity documents and the development of an electronic national identity register were announced by my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, in his statement on a national identity cards scheme. These measures would provide a unique link between the identity card and the person to whom it was issued and help to ensure that fraudsters could not set up multiple identities. This should have a significant impact in reducing identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/2">Home Office officials have had detailed discussions with colleagues involved in the operation of identity card schemes in Italy, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands and comprehensive information has been supplied by each of the EU member states on the operation of their card schemes. Lessons have been learned and where appropriate they have informed the development of our policy for an identity cards scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/3">Many EU identity card schemes were developed with other specific aims and objectives in mind such as population registration and not specifically implemented for countering identity fraud. As such, many identity cards are issued locally after checking available information e.g. birth certificates, information relating to an applicant's parents. In most EU countries, it is not necessary to give biometric information when applying for an identity card or accessing services.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/4">The 'Identity Cards: The Next Steps' document (CM 6020) states that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks against other databases. These checks would confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years. This information is more difficult to forge than e.g. birth certificates and follows recommendations made in 'Identity Fraud: A Study' conducted by the Cabinet Office and published in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/5">Many card schemes in other countries have been in place for many years and use mainly paper cards, which do not hold biometric data. With the passage of time, there is an increasing risk that fraudsters could obtain access to modern printing technology and use it to produce forged paper cards for the purpose of committing identity fraud. The absence of a central electronic identity register in many EU countries, increases the risks as an identity card (or biometric data) cannot be checked against a centrally held record of that information. As such organisations checking a card are only able to make visual checks e.g. to check that the photograph on an identity card looks like the person presenting the card and to check for no obvious alterations to the card itself.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/6">In 'Identity Cards: The Next Steps' the Government stated that the National Identity Register will link each individual record to a biometric. This will prevent multiple identities being established and allow organisations to check a card at a level appropriate for that service.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/7">The National Identity Register will be a single highly reliable record of a person's identity and will provide a secure means to verify identity where a registered person consents that their information can be verified by that held on the National Identity Register.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.2/8">While a modern and effective card scheme would help to combat identity fraud, it does not mean that every card scheme, especially those that have been implemented some time ago, would have a similar or significant effect on countering this type of crime unless they have been regularly updated to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. It is therefore not possible to assess the effect that card schemes in other European countries have had on identity fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".135W.5/1">Identity fraud costs the economy at least &pound;1.3 billion every year. Terrorists use false and multiple identities to help undertake and finance their activities in the United Kingdom and abroad. False and multiple identities are also essential &quot;tools of the trade&quot; for organised crime to facilitate money laundering and also other crimes such as people-trafficking and drug-trafficking. The development of unique identifiers linked to the National Identity Register will help tackle these problems allowing the police and other organisations greater certainty in the identification of individuals and helping prevent multiple identities being used for such purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/2">There is the potential for an identity cards scheme to assist shops owners and licensees control the sale of age-related products. The Government's plans for a national identity cards scheme would provide a nationally accepted and secure way of proving and determining age. Our current best cost estimates would fund the issuing of cards free to all 16-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/3">We would also expect that improvements in identity verification through the use of the card and central database will free up police time and resources. For example, the police would be able to check the biometric/card of an arrested person where no match is found on police records. There would be no need to require a card to be carried or produced because of the ability to check biometric information directly with National Identity Register. There are also cases where people may voluntarily show a card or allow biometric information to be checked, for instance after a road traffic incident.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/4">Finally, while the police and other organisations will not have routine access to data stored on the National Identity Register, such access would be authorised in certain specific circumstances, for example the investigation of serious crime.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.5/1">Identity card schemes have existed in all EU countries for many years, with the exception of Denmark and Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/2">Home Office officials have had detailed discussions with colleagues involved in the operation of identity card schemes in Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany and lessons learned have informed the development of policy where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/3">In addition, comprehensive information has been supplied by each of the EU member states on the operation of their card schemes, including the benefits associated with the card scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/4">Identity cards in most EU countries are used widely in dealings with central and local government and private sector organisations to establish identity and entitlement to services more securely. Databases of identity card holders are often used to help plan for, and administer, services more efficiently, and ensure that services are accessed by those entitled to receive them.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/5">Many EU countries consider identity cards to be an important way of tackling illegal immigration and illegal working by reducing the 'pull factors' which attract illegal immigrants to their countries.</p>

	<p pid=".137W.2/1">There will be no new power for the police to stop someone and demand them to produce their identity card. There will be no new sanctions against a person who refuses to identify themselves to the police either by means of an identity card or otherwise. However, the police do have powers to take steps to identify a person who has been arrested.</p>
	<p pid=".137W.2/2">One of the key aims of the identity cards scheme is to ensure that free public services are only used by those entitled to them. As set out in &quot;Identity Cards: the next steps&quot; Cm 6020, production of a card to access public services will be in ways defined by those services. In the case of those services for which the devolved Administrations have responsibility, decisions on production of a card to access those services would be a matter for them. We are clear however that the use of the card for access to free public services would not prevent people without cards from accessing emergency services and a card would not be mandatory for verification of entitlement to other services until the appropriate further parliamentary decision on a move to compulsion.</p>
	<p pid=".137W.2/3">There is also the potential to check identity against the National Identity Register without the production of a card since each individual's record is linked to a biometric that is unique to that person. This means that even without a card being produced, it will be possible to check someone's biometric information directly with the National Identity Register to establish his or her identity. This could be done with the person's consent or without consent in certain limited circumstances such as establishing the identity of arrested persons.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.2/1">Copies of the Government's Consultation Paper on the proposals for what were then called entitlement cards were sent to all local authorities in England and Wales and to all 32 councils in Scotland. Responses were received from 45 individual councils and from the Local Government Association (LGA). A summary of their comments can be found in the document &quot;Identity Cards: A Summary of Findings from the Consultation Exercise on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud&quot; (CM 6019 of November 2003).

	<p pid=".138W.2/2">Local authorities, like other organisations which interface with the public and provide services, are responsible for deciding how, and in what circumstances, they need to check someone's identity. While we have no record of any problems connected with identity checks by local authorities being reported to the Home Office, many local authorities welcomed the more reliable identity checks which would be facilitated by our scheme. A national identity card would help all service providers, including local authorities, by providing a single, secure and verifiable identity for all citizens and for foreign nationals legally resident here for more than three months. It will be for service providers to decide how they will use the card in the context of access to their services.</p>

	<p pid=".140W.2/17">The Prison Service undertook a large-scale survey in March and April 2003 of sentenced prisoners nearing release. 29 per cent. said they did not have accommodation arranged on release, compared to 33 per cent. in a similar survey undertaken in November and December 2001. These surveys did not look separately at prisoners convicted of sex offences. However, Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) provide a framework within which different agencies work together to manage the risks posed by sex offenders living in the community, including those arising from the absence of stable accommodation. The resettlement of sex offenders posing a serious risk of harm to the public is jointly managed by the police and the National Probation Service within these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/18">Registered sex offenders are also subject to the notification requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. They are required to provide the police with their home address within three days of their release from prison. Where an offender does not have a home address (which is his sole or main residence in the United Kingdom), he is required to provide the police with an address of premises in the UK that he regularly visits.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/19">Provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will formalise this multi-agency engagement by imposing a duty to co-operate with the MAPPA on a number of agencies, including local housing authorities and relevant registered social landlords.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.2/2">The standard rates of discharge grant paid are &pound;46.75 (for prisoners aged 25 and older) or &pound;37 (for prisoners aged 18 to 24). A higher rate of discharge grant (&pound;94.40) is paid to prisoners on release only if there is a need to seek, obtain and pay for accommodation. It is only paid to prisoners with no accommodation arranged in advance if this arises through no fault of the prisoner. The current rates were set in 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.2/3">The Government are drawing up a National Rehabilitation Action Plan responding to the July 2002 Social Exclusion Unit report on reducing re-offending by released prisoners. The discharge grant is being reviewed as a part of this work.</p>

For males aged 21 or over the average custodial sentence length was 27.8 months in 2002. This compares with 26.0 months in 2001, 24.2 months in 1997 and 21.1 months in 1992.</p>

	<p pid=".146W.5/1">Restorative justice brings victims (who wish it) and offenders into a process of managed communication in order to repair the harm caused by the offence.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.5/2">It is an integral part of a number of interventions in the youth justice system. Final Warnings are increasingly administered restoratively and Referral Orders, rolled out nationally in April 2002, are based on restorative principles.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.5/3">In the adult justice system, several police forces facilitate restorative cautions and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will introduce the new conditional caution, planned for use later this year, which police will be able to administer restoratively. Work has also been carried out in a number of probation areas and in several prisons.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.5/4">The Government are keen to build on these developments.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.5/5">There is already strong evidence that victims benefit; studies suggest that at least 75 per cent. of victims who take part in restorative justice are glad they did so. Research into the Referral Order has shown that victims' experiences were &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.5/6">International studies and early evidence from the United Kingdom about the effects on re-offending is encouraging but inconclusive. There is a need for further research, in particular regarding the effects for different offence types. This is why, as part of the Crime Reduction Programme, the Home Office funded three pilot schemes to test the effectiveness of restorative justice for adults at various stages of the criminal justice system. The first report of an independent evaluation of these schemes is planned for Autumn 2004 with a final report in 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.5/7">The Home Office is also developing a research project to evaluate restorative justice as a diversion from prosecution. This is planned to commence in 2004.</p>

The Council's work will lead to greater consistency in sentencing , and to a rebalancing between the use of custody and community sentences. As early priorities, the Council will formulate guidelines on sexual offences and on the new generic community sentence. More consistent and effective sentencing should in turn lead to a reduction in re-offending.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.8/1">In order to have an impact on reducing re-offending, the disproportionately low skills and exclusion from learning among young people coming into custody must be addressed. The Prison Service aims to equip all offenders with the skills to enhance their employability&mdash;providing them with an alternative to crime&mdash;and to enable them to make a positive contribution to society.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.8/2">Additional money has been invested this year in learning for young offenders aged 18. The Prison Service is looking to Heads of Learning and Skills in each establishment to promote a culture of learning so that we can continue to widen access and improve quality.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">Every Young Offender Institution has an education department which is required to offer mainstream qualifications as delivered in community settings. Most of these are divided into modules enabling short-term prisoners to work towards a full qualification, which can then be completed upon their release. Literacy and numeracy are assessed using a national test that is available weekly.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2">This year, additional funding of over &pound;4 million has been provided to enable the Young Offender and female estate to buy in and support more teaching hours. Heads of Learning and Skills in each Young Offender Institute are helping to increase accredited learning opportunities across the range of activities such as vocational training, supported by &pound;20 million of capital investment through our &quot;learning to earning&quot; programme.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.5/1">The new adult Offender Assessment System, (OASys,) developed jointly by the Prison and Probation Services and currently being rolled-out, contains a question on budgeting that provides offenders with an opportunity to raise matters about financial difficulties related to gambling. In addition, OASys contains a self-assessment questionnaire for offenders that includes a question asking whether gambling is a problem for them and, if so, whether it is linked to their offending. Analysis of a sample of self-assessments in 2003 for 711 prisoners showed that 2 per cent. said that gambling was a problem and 0.4 per cent. said it was linked to their offending. A sample of about 2,200 offenders under probation showed that 2.3 per cent. said that gambling was a problem and 0.7 per cent. said it was linked to their offending.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.5/2">The Youth Justice Board uses a separate assessment system for juvenile offenders (aged under 18 years) called ASSET, which provides an opportunity to detail any problems that should be highlighted and this could include gambling.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.5/3">Treatment for offenders with gambling problems, whether adults, young offenders or juveniles, is left to the discretion of individual prisons, young offender institutions, probation areas and youth offending teams. A number have established links with organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous and GamCare to provide assistance for offenders with gambling addiction problems, by individual referrals or through groups. Probation areas may also make referrals to Gordon House, a specialist hostel for gamblers.</p>
