As part of support to develop a Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2011-14, DFID and other donors are helping the Government of Burundi put in place improved structures during 2011 to monitor and evaluate delivery. Because most Burundian refugees have now been successfully repatriated and reintegrated, DFID has recently phased out refugee assistance.

Our non-resident ambassador, based in Kigali, visits Burundi on a regular basis. The UK conducts much diplomatic activity through EU representation in Burundi, with our non-resident ambassador maintaining regular communication with other EU Heads of Mission in Burundi. Moving forward, one of the Government's priorities is to assist Burundi to integrate into the East African Community. The Government of Burundi have signalled that it intends to open an embassy in London, a move which we would welcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.447W.11/1">The UK has provided strong political and programmatic support to post-conflict reconstruction and the return of refugees in Burundi since the end of the civil war in 2003, including the work of the Department for International Development in the successful reintegration of over 500,000 refugees from Tanzania and other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.11/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has complemented this through working closely with the international community to support Burundi in its return to stability. Through regular discussions in the UN Security Council, in particular around the renewal of the mandate of the UN mission in Burundi, and through active participation in the Peace Building Commission, the UK has promoted the protection of the human rights of vulnerable citizens, including returnees, and emphasised the importance of instituting an effective transitional justice mechanism. Our offices in Burundi and our ambassador based in Kigali have also encouraged the Government of Burundi to take these and other steps that we believe are essential in enabling Burundi to complete its post-conflict recovery. The Anglican Archbishop of Burundi recently praised the support of the Government for their engagement.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.2/1">The UK drew the UN 1737 Sanctions Committee's attention to the discovery of a consignment of weapons in transit through Nigeria from Iran in late 2010. The Panel of Experts consequently travelled to Nigeria in January 2011 to conduct an investigation. It received full co-operation from the Nigerian authorities in the conduct of its inspections. The case remains under review until judicial proceedings in Nigeria are concluded. The UK strongly supports the work of the Panel of Experts, whose role is to investigate and report on the full and effective implementation of sanctions against Iran. This incident highlights the UK and the rest of the international community's concerns that Iran continues to defy multiple UN Security Council Resolutions and is seeking to foster instability rather than play a constructive role in regional affairs. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of the Panel of Experts' work in responding to such cases.</p>

The clauses will expand, while retaining the requirement for an application to a judge advocate, those premises the service police may enter and search, and will enable access to excluded material on premises other than relevant residential premises. These amendments will provide the service police with provisions that more closely reflect those that already exist for Home Department police forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.453W.9/1">Armed forces personnel are primarily catered for through outsourced Catering, Retail and Leisure (CRL) contracts which are being introduced across military bases in the UK, Germany and Cyprus. Some 65% of armed forces personnel are catered for under these arrangements, whereby individuals pay for the meals they consume. Contractors are required to offer a core meal, covering breakfast, lunch and dinner, with set calorific and nutritional standards, in line with the prevailing Daily Food Charge, which is currently capped by the Armed Forces Pay Review body at &#163;4.13 per day. Service personnel can, however, choose an alternative retail offering if they prefer.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.9/2">As part of a CRL contract, the contractor will customarily receive what is known as the Service Provision Payment (SPP), which covers the costs of the civilian labour required to deliver the service, which the Ministry of Defence would otherwise have to provide. SPP varies from contract to contract, the competitions for which are run at individual unit, or group of units' level.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.9/3">For armed forces personnel stationed in bases not currently covered by CRL arrangements, including those serving on operations and overseas exercises, Daily Messing Rates (DMRs) apply. DMRs are the cost of ingredients based upon bespoke ration scales; these rates are adjusted quarterly to reflect food cost inflation and are currently set as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.453W.9/6"> <td><i> Location</i></td> <td><i> Daily Messing Rate</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.453W.9/7"> <td>UK (&#163;)</td> <td>2.36</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.453W.9/8"> <td>Falkland and Ascension Islands (&#163;)</td> <td>2.88</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.453W.9/9"> <td>Afghanistan (Operation Herrick) (&#163;)</td> <td>3.89</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.453W.9/10"> <td>Germany (on exercise) (&#8364;)</td> <td>4.35</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.453W.9/11"> <td>Cyprus (on exercise) (&#8364;)</td> <td>4.30</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.453W.9/14">These amounts cover the provision of three meals a day but exclude the cost of logistics, which for locations such as Afghanistan is significant-for financial year 2009-10, the cost of food provided to personnel in Afghanistan was &#163;17.944 million while the associated Logistical Operating Costs excluding contractor's profit was &#163;46.595 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.9/15">The corresponding figures for non-deployed personnel not covered by CRL arrangements were &#163;50.440 million for food and &#163;15.994 million for logistical operating costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.455W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is currently examining 130 contracts relating to the strategic defence and security review (SDSR) decisions, which is expected to increase to some 500 contracts in due course. We expect the process of renegotiating these contracts to take around 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.455W.0/2">The MOD has made estimates of the cost savings that will accrue from contractual renegotiations, and from other measures in the SDSR, for the purposes of formulating policy. Some of these estimates have been published to help inform the public debate. Release of further detail may prejudice commercial interests. Final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trade unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety.

Where there are issues, parents can, and do, discuss them directly with the schools themselves and this often resolves the issue before a formal complaint is necessary. Where informal dialogue cannot resolve the issue, parents and others can object about admission arrangements to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator, who will independently review the matter. His determinations are binding on both parties. In future the Schools Adjudicator will consider complaints for all schools, including Academies and Free Schools, ensuring that the route of formal complaint for parents is simpler.</p>

	<p pid="a.457W.3/2">School sport partnerships are groups of schools that work together on physical education and sport; they do not have separate legal status. The Department pays an annual grant with 450 secondary schools who agree to act as 'hubs' for the schools in a partnership and who receive additional funding for a 'partnership development manager'. The Department is in the process of finalising the grant for the financial year 2010-11 with the hub schools. This agreement will cover expenditure of around &#163;114 million in 2010-11. The hub schools make subsequent agreements with the other schools in their partnership, on the basis of the Department's agreement with them. The Department wrote to the hub schools in October 2010 to say that the terms and conditions for this year would be changing, that schools would have new flexibility over how they spend the grant on PE and sport, and that funding beyond March 2011 was not guaranteed. The hub schools will have taken this into account in making further agreements with other schools. The Department has subsequently announced, in December 2010, that the final payment of school sport partnership grant in February 2011 will cover most costs through to the end of the summer term 2011. The additional flexibility that schools have in spending this considerable investment should mean that they can embed the good practice of the previous Administration's PE and sport strategy, as well as run more competitive sport for all pupils. The complexity, lack of transparency, and administrative demands on schools of this payment system set up by the previous Administration are part of the reason that we have decided not to continue with it. Schools will remain able to organise competitive sport in partnerships in future, if they wish.</p>

	<p pid="a.470W.5/1">The UK has been actively involved in EU negotiations on a new regulation for food labelling. Our aim has been to ensure there is clarity in food labelling for consumers, especially on country of origin labelling. A common position was reached on the text at the EU Agriculture Council in February. Discussions on this dossier are ongoing. Any changes to the labelling provisions would not be in place until early 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.475W.6/3" class="indent">1. Shared accommodation refers to households where there is no clear head, for example unrelated adults sharing a house or flat on an equal basis. This analysis therefore excludes other forms of sharing, for example lodging in an owner-occupied house, or adult children living with their parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.475W.6/4" class="indent">2. Housing benefit receipt has been analysed at household level, so some individuals not claiming housing benefit, but sharing accommodation with benefit claimants, have been treated as if they are in receipt. Only a small proportion of non-recipients share accommodation with claimants, so this does not have a significant impact on the estimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.475W.6/5" class="indent">3. &quot;Private renting&quot; includes both furnished and unfurnished tenancies, but excludes rent free cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.477W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to reply to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions regarding the criteria Jobcentre Plus applies in order to determine which cases are appropriate for further investigation and the factors considered by the Jobcentre Plus Decision Maker to determine entitlement and whether a sanction is appropriate. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/4" class="indent">Where an Employment Adviser considers a doubt has arisen regarding an act or omission of a customer which might affect their prospects of employment the advisor will investigate further and ask a Decision Maker, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, to consider whether any action is appropriate. This might include consideration of entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance or the imposition of a benefit sanction.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/5" class="indent">Doubts can arise for a variety of reasons and from a variety of sources including the customer, employers or training providers. Doubts include leaving a job voluntarily; being dismissed from employment due to misconduct; failing to attend an advisory interview; refusing employment; and failure to attend a training scheme or employment programme. The doubt will be discussed with the customer.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/6" class="indent">Where we have doubts there are distinct criteria to determine whether customer's entitlement has ceased or a sanction is appropriate. The criteria are set out in the Decision Makers Guide which is published and available on-line from the Department of Work and Pensions. This advice is also reflected in detailed staff guidance to ensure Jobcentre Plus staff are aware of the action to take when such doubts come to their attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/7" class="indent">The Decision Maker's role is to consider the specific circumstances of the claim in the light of all relevant legislation and case law, taking account of all the individual circumstances of the case and any available information and evidence including that provided by the customer. Where appropriate the Decision Maker will request further information on which to base their decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/8" class="indent">Examples of the factors used by Decision Makers include the customer's reasons for failing to apply for or accept a suitable vacancy; the requirements of a particular vacancy; a customer's religious or conscientious objection; and the impact of caring responsibilities. The Decision Maker will also give regard to the customer's comments in identifying whether the customer might have good cause for their action or omission. Similarly, the Decision Maker will consider whether a customer had just cause for leaving previous employment voluntarily (i.e. whether they acted reasonably in leaving that employment, or whether the circumstances of their departure justify reliance on public funds).</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/9" class="indent">I attach a link to the Decision Makers Guide which contains the advice to Decision Makers when dealing with questions of entitlement and sanction.</p>

	<p pid="a.478W.5/1">Like other forms of income and/or savings the value of private pensions can be eroded over time by inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/2">Legislation under the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995 provides a measure of protection against the effect of inflation on private sector occupational pensions by requiring schemes to increase benefits under defined benefit arrangements year on year, both for pensions in payment and for deferred members who have left the scheme but have yet to start drawing a pension from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/3">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is required to publish an order each year setting out the percentages to be used to calculate the minimum revaluation of deferred pensions and minimum increases to pensions in payment. By law, these percentages have to be based on the percentage increase in the general level of prices in Great Britain, as determined by the Secretary of State. The latest order was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase> and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/4">From this year increases going forward have been calculated using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Previous orders used only the Retail Prices Index (RPI) as the basis for calculating the statutory minimum increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/5">This legislation does not apply to personal pensions or defined contribution occupational pensions. In these schemes the individual member can choose the level of inflation protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/6">The impact of inflation on the pensions of individuals will depend on their exact circumstances, the amount of increase provided by the scheme and the level of inflation over the long term but for the purpose of illustration the occupational pension for a single pensioner in receipt of the median occupational pension of &#163;70 per week would increase to &#163;72.17 using CPI inflation as at September 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.497W.5/1">We do not believe that a freeze in incremental progression will have an effect on the training and career development of nurses. The proposal to freeze incremental progression for national health service staff, via a national enabling framework, was made by NHS Employers to the NHS Staff Council. Although NHS trade unions rejected the framework, we understand that NHS Employers have not withdrawn the proposal and that they are encouraging employers to discuss with trade unions the financial challenges they face locally, so they are able to make informed decisions about job security and the potential benefits of the framework for staff and patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.5/2">Ministers will of course consider very carefully any formal proposals that are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.5/3">Effective appraisals are an essential part of NHS employment practice, leading to improved staff performance, higher staff satisfaction and better patient outcomes. The NHS Constitution also commits the NHS to providing staff with clear roles and responsibilities, and personal development and 'line management support to succeed'.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.5/4">The NHS Knowledge and Skills Framework for staff subject to the Agenda for Change pay framework, provides a useful supporting framework to identify the knowledge and skills that staff need to do their job and their development needs. Such annual reviews should take place whether or not there is a pay or increment freeze.</p>

	<p pid="a.499W.2/1">It is for local commissioners to determine what services should be commissioned to meet the needs of their local populations, in the light of local and national professional advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/2">Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, is a complex and poorly understood condition. It seems to involve an excessive reaction to an injury, resulting in localised pain which is much more severe and lasts much longer than would normally be expected from the nature of the injury. It can occur at any age, although it appears to be more common between ages 45-60 and in women. The one available estimate of prevalence is some 21 cases per 1,000,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/3">CRPS can resolve spontaneously, but where this does not occur treatment is more likely to be effective if it is initiated quickly (within three months of the initial symptoms). Diagnosis can be difficult especially in the early stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/4">Treatment involves a combination of:</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/5" class="indent">1. pain relief with oral medicines or, less commonly, injections or spinal stimulation;</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/6" class="indent">2. physical therapy (exercises, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy) to restore normal functioning of the affected limb; and</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/7" class="indent">3. patient education, so that the patient is fully involved in the therapeutic aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.499W.2/8">Many patients suffer from psychological side effects (depression, anxiety) so good practice involves a psychological assessment and, where needed, psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy or relaxation techniques. A small number of centres in the United Kingdom can provide a specialist rehabilitation service for difficult cases.</p>
