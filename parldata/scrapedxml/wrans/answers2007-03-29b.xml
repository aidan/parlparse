	<p pid="b.1656W.9/1">Since 1999 Nicaragua (US$ 4.5 billion), Honduras (US$1 billion) and Bolivia (US$ 2.06 billion), have all received substantial debt relief through the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. In addition, since its implementation last year these countries have also benefited from the 100 per cent. cancellation of debt stock owed to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank under the multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI). Last year, the MDRI relieved debts of $968 million to Nicaragua, $1.3 billion to Honduras and $1.75 billion to Bolivia. DFID has monitored the spending of this money through our work with the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This helps to ensure that the money gets targeted to items in the budget that directly impact on the poor, such as health and education. We have cancelled all outstanding bilateral debt owed to the UK, including contributing to the debt relief provided under HIPC and MDRI.</p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.9/2">Despite good progress on multilateral debt relief, Nicaragua still has about $1.3 billion in outstanding debt from commercial creditors who are not part of either HIPC or MDRI. This debt hinders how Nicaragua can use other debt relief to address poverty, and is subject to 'vulture funds' which buy the debt when Nicaragua is least able to pay, and then press for repayment at several times the debt's face value, when economic prospects are looking better. DFID has just committed $3.5 million to the elimination of this debt, in a deal with the World Bank and other donors. The deal itself reduces the debt to $64 million. The Nicaraguan Government itself will contribute $3.5 million. With contributions from the Government of Nicaragua, World Bank, DFID and others, it is hoped that this will fully eliminate the outstanding commercial debt owed by Nicaragua.</p>
	<p pid="b.1656W.9/3">In addition, the Inter-America Development Bank has recently announced debt relief to the five poorest countries in the region. This amounts to $3.4 billion and $1.0 billion of future interest payments from its fund for special operations (FSO). This will provide immediate relief of $1 billion for Bolivia, $984 million for Nicaragua, and $467 million for Guyana among others. However, the UK has abstained from voting on this deal, along with several other European countries. This was because of concerns that the deal would hinder access of the poorest countries to concessionary IADB financing in the future. Access to continued flows of concessionary lending from the FSO of the IADB will be important to the achievement of the millennium development goals in countries such as Nicaragua. The UK is currently in discussions with IADB and other shareholders on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1657W.2/1">DFID, like other international donors, monitors the humanitarian situation in Nepal primarily through the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). UNOCHA provides leadership to and co-ordination of the international humanitarian community, and works with DFID and other international bodies to monitor and respond to emerging and ongoing humanitarian crises. In 2006-07 DFID provided &pound;700,000 to support humanitarian monitoring and co-ordination, and the provision of food aid in response to drought.</p>
	<p pid="b.1657W.2/2">Food security problems, particularly related to drought, are severely affecting more than 900,000 people. Health indicators remain at a critical level, with acute malnutrition among children under five having increased to 12 per cent. over the last five years. Protection remains a central issue, including for children directly affected by the conflict. Significant numbers of those displaced during the conflict have been returning&mdash;either spontaneously, or with facilitation, though many internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees continue to face protection concerns. 107,000 Bhutanese refugees remain dependent on international aid. In addition to the humanitarian challenges exacerbated by the conflict, Nepal's mountainous terrain means that it continues to be vulnerable to natural disasters including landslides, floods, and earthquakes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1657W.2/3">The UN has just launched a Common Appeal for Transition Support which provides a framework for a co-ordinated international response to these issues. The appeal focuses on issues of particular importance in the short term, including food security, health, displacement, disaster preparedness, and protection. DFID is currently examining the appeal document to assess which elements it might support, and will continue to monitor the humanitarian situation jointly with UNOCHA and other partners.</p>

	<p pid="b.1658W.2/1">The UK is one of the largest bilateral donors of humanitarian support to Zimbabwe, supporting over 1.5 million of the poorest people. DFID spent &pound;138.9 million bilaterally in Zimbabwe in financial years 2001-02 to 2005-06. Our funding prioritises HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and supporting orphans and vulnerable children. Our current programmes will help ensure that an additional 30,000 people receive anti-retroviral treatment, will provide health care for around 350,000 children, promote food security in both urban and rural areas and assist extremely vulnerable displaced people. The UK does not give direct funding to the Government of Zimbabwe. All DFID's bilateral funding is channelled through NGOs and UN agencies, much of it programmed jointly with other donors. We do not believe in cutting direct assistance to poor Zimbabweans and thus punishing them further for their unaccountable government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1658W.2/2">Through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, jointly funded by DFID, FCO and MOD, the UK supports civil society organisations to promote better governance and human rights. Allocations totalled &pound;2 million in 2006-07 and will be &pound;2.5 million in 2007-08. The British embassy in Harare also supports community groups with small grants (&pound;800,000 per year). The UK contributions to multilateral aid to Zimbabwe (United Nations, European Commission, World Bank and others) totalled &pound;37.5 million from 2000 to 2004 inclusive.</p>

However, we do see merit in establishing a central database for enforcers to access information such as details of convictions for offences relating to animals, disqualifications from keeping an animal, and certain records relating to previous licences. At present, there is no central record of those subject to disqualification orders and this is regarded as a significant handicap to effective law enforcement. The database could also contain a register of specialist experts, which would ideally be accessible to enforcers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1663W.3/1">The information in the TB Disease Report Form (DRF) is collated and used by local State Veterinary Service (SVS) Officers to manage TB incidents. At the present time, the majority of the information captured is not normally entered onto an electronic database. However, such information may be routinely captured by other means as part of normal SVS business. The SVS are currently updating their information technology (IT) systems and plan to capture such information electronically in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.3/2">Information relating to neighbouring farms and cattle movements is used by the SVS to identify cattle 'at risk' of spreading TB. This information is entered into IT systems to trigger TB testing for neighbouring animals or herds. Information such as TB testing results and post-mortem results are taken from other IT systems and added to the DRF.</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.3/3">SVS staff are instructed to initiate a DRF for each TB incident. Between the beginning of 2005 and the end of 2006 there were 7,103 new TB incidents. Records are held by the SVS, not the core Department. DRFs are retained for up to 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.3/4">SVS staff initially complete parts of the DRF with the farmer involved, then complete it later at the local office; this can take, in total, between three and four hours. The DRF is subsequently updated with case-related results as required.</p>

These applications resulted in the issue of one licence, which was to permit an animal hospital to euthanase rescued badgers testing positive to bTB.

	<p pid="b.1666W.11/1">There are strict controls on the management and disposal of all wastes, including waste chemicals, and producers of waste have a duty to ensure that it is lawfully managed. Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 makes it an offence to illegally dispose of waste and carries a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine, or five years imprisonment, or both. The Government have been developing and implementing its waste crime strategy for a number of years now. We will continue to do so as I believe that all forms of illegal waste disposal need to be prevented as far as possible. Where they do happen, incidents and offenders must be dealt with promptly and efficiently by the enforcing authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1666W.11/2">The Environment Agency (EA) has the leading role in the enforcement of waste regulation and works with local authorities to tackle the fly-tipping of waste. Over the last five years, the EA has been called out to 134 incidents involving organic and inorganic wastes which would include 'chemical wastes'. In 2006, there was a small drop in the number of incidents compared to previous years. At incidents, the EA take action to ensure that wastes are cleared up to prevent harm to human health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1666W.11/3">Flycapture, the national fly-tipping database, was set up in 2004 by Defra, the EA and the Local Government Association to record the number of fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the EA and local authorities. There are 15 categories of waste that are recorded on the database but none of these specifically record chemical wastes. However, one category records chemical drums, oil and fuel and, in 2005-06, there were 4,927 incidences recorded.</p>

	<p pid="b.1667W.2/2">Officials from DEFRA and the EA attended a recent seminar by the Commission's Joint Research Centre in Seville to discuss Commission-funded research into a methodology for developing end of waste criteria at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1667W.2/3">The EA is a member of the DEFRA project board which is steering the UK input to the negotiations on the proposed revisions to the Waste Framework Directive, under which the Commission has proposed a mechanism to set end of waste criteria for the EU. These negotiations are still in progress. The EA's experience in developing end of waste criteria for compost and other materials should help provide valuable input to future EU discussions.</p>

While we are grateful to the Japanese Government for trying to further discussions on issues of division in the IWC, we believe this initiative serves to further polarise and distract its members from the important conservation work that the IWC undertakes. Furthermore, the IWC is the only body mandated to discuss, at plenipotentiary level, issues relating to the conservation and management of whales. The UK therefore considers that the IWC is the only recognised forum in which to hold intergovernmental discussions on whaling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1670W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence constantly assesses the impact of operational pressures on the force structure and adjusts programmes accordingly. To accommodate the training for current levels of operational deployment, the focus of training across defence, particularly in the land and air environments, has shifted towards training for specific operations rather than for general contingencies. Training for general contingencies continues, however, to form a significant part of Commander Joint Operations' exercise programme, which ensures that the knowledge and experience required to command and control such operations is maintained over time.</p>

The position of the Council of Isles of Scilly is recognised in UK legislation where it applies to the Isles. On the question about stannary organisations, there are no valid Cornish stannary organisations in existence. It is noted that stannary courts were abolished under the Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.3/2">Cornwall has always been an integral part of the Union. There are no treaties today that apply to Cornwall only. With the exception of geographically limited matters such as Private Acts of Parliament for infrastructure works, Acts of Parliament, regulations and statutory instruments apply in Cornwall as they do throughout England, but do not always apply to the Isles of Scilly. There is no special status for legislation which applies to Cornwall or to Cornish localities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1676W.8/2">Other than previous debates in the House and representations made by individual MPs on behalf of their constituents, no specific representations have been made by the drinks industry or other stakeholders on the use of plastic in licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003 already provides for the police to apply for licence reviews and for conditions to be attached to licences. For example, that the licensed premises should use toughened drinks glasses and bottles. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 will in due course also provide a new fast track alcohol licence review process that could lead to such conditions being applied in cases of serious crime and disorder. We are also committed to reviewing the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England that was published in March 2004, later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1677W.2/1">We do not hold this information. However, extrapolating from data collected by the Department in November 2006 from a small sample of licensing authorities, we broadly estimate there were around 600 completed licence reviews in the first year of the new regime which resulted in approximately 100 licences being revoked. Sales or attempted sales to persons under 18 would have been a factor in a number of those cases.</p>

Neither does this figure include library usage by children and young people under 16.</p>
	<p pid="b.1677W.5/3">The Public Library Statistics, published annually by the Chartered Institute of Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) show that the following percentages of people in England borrowed at least one item from a public library (&quot;active borrowers&quot;) in the period 2001-02 to 2005-06:</p>

It does not take account of those people who used a library for other purposes such as reading a book or newspaper on the library premises, attending a reading or learning group or accessing information (whether in paper or online form).

	<p pid="b.1684W.6/1">The Department regularly discusses the provision it makes for children with special educational needs and disabilities through the SEN and disability frameworks with key stakeholders both in the voluntary sector and across Government, including support for visually impaired and dyslexic children. A central record is not kept of the approaches made to the Department on individual issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1684W.6/2">We continue to invest significant resources to support the education of children with SEN and disabilities&mdash;some &pound;4.5 billion in 2006/07. It is for schools and local authorities to plan to improve access to the curriculum and written materials for disabled pupils over time and the Disability Equality Duty requires schools them to promote disability equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1684W.6/3">To assist the provision of materials in accessible alternative formats for blind, partially sighted and dyslexic children specifically, the Government supported the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 which reduces delays in gaining copyright clearance to produce books and other printed materials in formats accessible to visually impaired people. The Department of Trade and Industry is also working on a feasibility study to look at opportunities for publishers to provide education material in accessible formats more quickly and this Department is involved in the process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1687W.6/3">We do not plan to consult on a general process for determining those interests. Rather, we recognise that the interests will depend on specific local circumstances. If the Secretary of State were to consider the use of section 38(4) in a specific case, we would expect a public consultation giving local authorities, amenity groups, the airport's Consultative Committee, other local interest groups and individuals an opportunity to make their views clear. Decisions following consultation would depend on the merits of the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1687W.9/1">The Department for Transport plans to introduce the new air travel service as early as possible, consistent with best procurement practice and the need to deliver value for money and appropriate levels of safety, security and reliability. The timetable for delivery will depend upon the contractual arrangements and the lead-in times needed by suppliers to meet the new requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1687W.9/2">Sir Peter Gershon's &quot;Independent Air Travel Review&quot; estimated that the new service would cost between &pound;104 million and &pound;107 million in net present value terms over a ten year period. This compares with a cost of &pound;98 million over the same period of continuing with the existing arrangements. Sir Peter Gershon's Review calculated that such an arrangement would add no further burden to the public purse.</p>

	<p pid="b.1693W.8/1">In 2004-05, as now, the funding for statutory concessionary fares in England was one of the services supported through formula grant, which comprises Revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and principal formula police grant. Formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant i.e. authorities are free to spend the money on any service. Because of the method of calculation, particularly floor damping (which guarantees local authorities at least a minimum percentage increase by scaling back increases for other authorities), it is not possible to say what has been given to each local authority for any particular service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1693W.8/2">Up to an extra &pound;250 million per year will be provided for the national bus concession from April 2008 (this includes Barnett consequentials which will be paid on this in line with statement of funding policy). Eligible residents of the Isles of Scilly will be entitled to national bus concession, and so the Isles of Scilly will be receiving a share of the extra funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1702W.6/6" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what percentage of child maintenance claims were cleared within 18 weeks during the last six months for which the Child Support Agency was accepting applications to the old scheme; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1702W.6/7" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. Any applications that have not yet been cleared can be regarded as outstanding. The amount of work required to achieve clearance and the elapsed time it involves varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the Agency. As such, the Agency holds only a negligible number of completely unprocessed applications.</p>

This differs from the definition of a new scheme clearance, which also includes further work in agreeing and setting up a collection schedule following the completion of a maintenance calculation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1702W.6/9" class="indent">68 per cent of child maintenance claims received on the old scheme in the period from 1st September 2002 to 28th February 2003, the last six months for which the Child Support Agency was accepting applications to the old scheme, were cleared within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1702W.6/10" class="indent">As you will be aware, the Agency has committed in its Operational Improvement Plan, published in February 2006, to improve performance in this area such that 80 per cent of new applications will be cleared within 18 weeks of receipt by March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1707W.0/4" class="indent">As part of handling agencies through our Employer Direct Contact Centre or via our Employer Direct on-line service there are a number of steps taken before we accept their vacancies. These include making sure we have a signed service level agreement with the agency, which, among other things, clearly states they must not use our services merely to compile lists of potential employees. Over and above this, we also require details of the specific job in question, for example terms, conditions and a reference number, and confirmation that a contract exists between the agency and the employer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1707W.0/5" class="indent">Once accepted, vacancies placed through an Employer Direct Contact Centre or Employer Direct on-line are also subject to a 48-hour follow-up call from the Labour Market and Recruitment Adviser to discuss and agree ongoing handling arrangements. If suspicions are aroused about the legitimacy of the vacancy, either at this stage or subsequently, for example by a customer complaint, this is investigated fully and could, ultimately, lead to the withdrawal of service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1707W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-29">29 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1707W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking about calls made to the 08456 088564 Jobcentre Plus number of the Department for Work and Pensions; the use of alternative numbers by Jobcentre Plus; and the circulation of telephone and fax numbers to Jobcentre Plus offices and Citizens Advice Bureau offices. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1707W.3/4" class="indent">The telephone number 08456 088564 relates to Exeter, which we are currently converting into a Benefits Delivery Centre. The current telephony system only gathers limited management information. The information we hold shows an increase in calls answered each month from 6,426 calls in December 2006 to 7,385 in January 2007 and 7,770 in February 2007. However, the current system does not provide data detailing the average time taken to answer calls or how many calls were terminated before being answered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1707W.3/5" class="indent">An average call lasts about 4 minutes&mdash;the calls cost (set by BT) between 1-3p per minute (from a landline) depending on the time of day. Call charges from mobile telephones vary depending on the service provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.1707W.3/6" class="indent">All Jobcentre Plus offices in Somerset were given alternative direct dial telephone numbers for central benefit teams. In addition, an e-mail procedure has been established to allow Jobcentre Plus staff to contact the processing teams, to improve communication. This will be in place by Mid April. The telephone and fax numbers were shared with Citizens Advice Bureau offices by means of a leaflet issued in the week prior to the introduction of the 0845 number on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">05 December 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1712W.2/2">Some people will return to new deal after leaving the programme, but this is inevitable in a dynamic labour market. New deal 25 plus has to be considered in the context of the people it sets out to help. People who suffer long periods of unemployment can find it particularly difficult to get back to and remain in work. The longer they are unemployed, the greater the barriers to getting work, and helping them into work is a considerable achievement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1718W.11/1">Estimates of eligibility and therefore take-up are not available below the level of Great Britain, it is not therefore possible to say how many people are eligible to pension credit or what the take-up is in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.11/2">The latest estimate of the number of pensioners entitled to pension credit in Great Britain is between 3.7 million and 4.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.11/3">The latest estimates of the take-up of the main income-related benefits: income support, pension credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit and jobseeker's allowance (income-based) in Great Britain can be found in the DWP report entitled &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 2004/2005&quot;. Copies of the publication are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.11/4">Pension credit has been highly successful in reducing pensioner poverty and now, after housing costs have been accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole. Since the introduction of pension credit, the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by half a million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.11/5">We continue to make every effort to ensure that pension credit goes to those who are entitled to it. The table shows the number of households in Great Britain and Wales receiving pension credit each year since its introduction.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-29b.113565.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-03-29b.1722W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" speakername="James Purnell" colnum="1722W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/text/70329w0016.htm#07040322005534">
	<p pid="b.1722W.2/1">The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey (FRS) may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>
	<p pid="b.1722W.2/2">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in 'Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2005-06' (HBAI). This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1722W.2/3">Pension credit has been highly successful in reducing pensioner poverty; since its introduction, the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by over 700,000. Now, for the first time in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole, after housing costs are accounted for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1722W.2/4">We continue to make every effort to ensure that pension credit goes to those who are entitled to it. It is more challenging to reach those entitled to smaller amounts, or to the savings credit only, who may be less familiar with the entitlements available to them. The Pension Service has contacted pensioners to encourage them to take up entitlement to pension credit many times already as part of extensive marketing activity. Over 70 per cent. of those pensioners who appear to have entitlement to pension credit have been contacted over five times already. And around 25 per cent. of customers visited about pension credit say that they do not want to make a claim. However, we are committed to improving take-up and are continually looking at further ways to target these groups and encouraging them to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1722W.2/5">The information requested for pensioners in Great Britain is shown in the following tables. Estimates of entitled non-recipients of MIG or pension credit should be treated with caution. This is especially the case given that we are looking at the extreme of the income distribution and so are less sure of pensioners' modelled entitlement. Results are based on small sample sizes and have not been corrected for biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income related benefits&mdash;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non-recipients but will not all actually be entitled non recipients and vice versa. Figures are therefore presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income.</p>

This is consistent with low income estimates published in the latest edition of Households Below Average Income. The GB median is similar to the UK median.<br/> 6. minimum income guarantee (MIG) was introduced for pensioners in April 1999 paid through income support.<br/> 7. Pension credit (PC) was introduced mid-way through 2003-04; therefore, estimates for 2003-04 cover those pensioners who were entitled but not receiving either MIG or PC. As this relates to the first six months of pension credit the figures should be treated with some caution.<br/> 8. For the purposes of this analysis, benefit unit based data (take-up statistics) were combined with household equivalised income based results (Households Below Average Income statistics).<br/> 9. Estimates for 2000-2001 and 2003-2004 onwards incorporate the results of a data matching exercise, which links the Family Resources Survey with DWP administrative data in order to identify 'hidden recipients' of MIG-PC, i.e. those people who tell the FRS they do not receive pension credit, but actually do.<br/> 10. Estimates are presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income, as the analysis is based on single-year survey data and the absolute numbers of such pensioners who were not claiming the pension credit or minimum income guarantee they were entitled to might be biased due to small sample sizes.<br/> 11. These analyses have not been corrected for the biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income-related benefits&mdash;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non recipients (ENRs) but will not all actually be ENRs and vice versa&mdash;and so they should be treated with some caution.<br/> 12.The estimates relate only to those who were modelled as entitled to receive benefit but were not identified to be in receipt of any amount of benefit. It therefore does not include cases where a pensioner is in receipt of some benefit, but this is less than the amount they are truly entitled to. Including these cases may not give a reliable indication of full take-up due to the potential error that exists in modelling entitlement. </td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1728W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about the centralisation of Social Fund processing and calls to the Social Fund system. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1728W.5/4" class="indent">The centralisation of Social Fund is being undertaken on a roll-out basis and is not due for completion until March 2008. Once this schedule is complete Social Fund will be processed from 20 sites throughout the country. As we are only halfway through this process (with some of the rolled-out offices still to migrate Social Fund work into their sites), it is too early to make an assessment of the impact of centralisation. The decision to centralise this activity was to address performance variation and to concentrate our staff expertise to improve service to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1728W.5/5" class="indent">The revised standard operating model was introduced recently. This makes our service more accessible to our customers because our customers can complete the process in a single call. As a result we have seen an increase in Social Fund applications and payments and a widening of access to the Fund.</p>

	<p pid="b.1732W.2/11">The cost of administering LEGI in 2007-08 will be sensitive to a decision in CSR on whether there will be a third round of LEGI, and the timing of a third round. However, indicative costs for central Government administration spend for 2006-07 were &pound;112,050, or 0.36 per cent . of the total budget for that year. I anticipate that administrative costs should remain broadly the same next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1732W.2/12">It is for local partnerships responsible for delivering LEGI to determine the proportion of their budget that is necessary and appropriate to efficiently administer the programme. We encourage partnerships to evaluate their spend against outcomes to help them achieve good value for money.</p>

	<p pid="b.1732W.6/1">We are now consulting stakeholders and partners (including all local authorities affected) on two unitary proposals for Bedfordshire&mdash;the proposal of Bedfordshire county council for a single unitary for the whole of Bedfordshire, and the proposal of Bedford borough council for a unitary Bedford. It is open to anyone, including the local authorities affected, i.e., Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire, to comment on these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1732W.6/2">They may choose to respond to the consultation by proposing support for the Bedfordshire county council unitary proposal or by proposing support for the Bedford borough proposal, and in doing so, may suggest that the remainder of the county also be made unitary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1732W.6/3">On the basis of the information currently before us, it is the Government's view that should the proposals for a unitary Bedford be accepted then the remainder of the county area would not be a viable two-tier area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1732W.6/4">If, therefore, following consultation, we decided to implement the Bedford borough proposal, it would be open to us to direct (subject to the enactment of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill), the remaining authorities in Bedfordshire to come forward with a unitary proposal for the remainder of the county area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1737W.12/1">The Government are committed to informing and warning young people about the dangers of illegal drugs, including cannabis. Through the FRANK drug information campaign, we have consistently informed young people about the risks associated with cannabis use. Information has been made available on a website (with 1,100 visits to the cannabis page a day), in leaflets and via a helpline which receives around 1,350 calls a day. The message that 'cannabis isn't harmless' has been played out to young people as part of the FRANK campaign since October 2005 and information about the risks and effects associated with cannabis use continue to be a major element of the campaign through 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/2">Over the last 12 months, a comprehensive package of communications and resources has been delivered:</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/3" class="indent">Around 25,000 cannabis information leaflets have been distributed to young people and their parents every month in 2006. In October 2006, three new leaflets were published with the clear message that cannabis is not harmless, it can affect mental health and contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. To date over 400,000 leaflets have been distributed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/4" class="indent">New radio, TV and online advertising introduced from July 2006 carried strong messages to young people that cannabis can have an impact on mental health as well as having more immediate effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/5" class="indent">The Home Office, DfES and Department of Health have worked together with other key stakeholders to develop a drug education resource for pupils aged 11 to 14 and their teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/6" class="indent">The pupil book, that accompanies the pack, provides young people with information about those drugs which research indicates they are most likely to encounter, including cannabis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/7" class="indent">Working with the Department of Health we have produced a Mental Health pack that has been available to all mental health professionals since October 2006, highlighting the dangers of cannabis use and what can be done to tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/8" class="indent">The Home Office part funded the charity 'Young Minds' to produce a mental health leaflet for young people which was launched in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737W.12/9" class="indent">In addition, DfES has also worked with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to produce the joining forces pack which provides guidance for police working in schools and colleges in relation to drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1741W.0/1">Section 2 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 clearly establishes that only those aged 16 and over are eligible to be registered on the National Identity Register and issued with an identity card. Thus, there are no plans to record fingerprint biometrics of those aged under 16 on the National Identity Register for the purpose of issuing identity cards. The records of passport holders aged under 16 will not form part of the National Identity Register.</p>
	<p pid="b.1741W.0/2">To maintain the reputation and integrity of the British passport, we intend to keep in step with European Union regulations which require the introduction of fingerprint biometrics into passports by June 2009. At present, the regulation specifies no minimum age for the recording of fingerprint biometrics and discussions between member states are continuing on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1741W.0/3">As set out in the Strategic Action Plan for the National Identity Scheme published in December 2006, the Identity and Passport Service has anticipated that it may be necessary to record fingerprint biometrics for passports issued to those over the age of 11. Passports issued to those aged between 11 and 15 years are of a five year validity. They need to match the physical and technical standards of those issued to adults as the holders of such passports hold them when they become more economically active and move into adulthood, possibly continuing to use such passports up to the age of 20. For example it would be anomalous for one 19-year-old to have a passport which incorporated fingerprint biometric data and another 19-year-old to have a passport which did not incorporate fingerprint biometric data as it was issued when the holder was under 16 and not treated as an adult.</p>

	<p pid="b.1742W.2/2">Nearly all new places to be provided by 2012 will be built as single occupancy cells although, at certain sites, there will be cells built to hold two prisoners. The final configurations have not yet been confirmed for all sites.</p>

However, research is being funded by the Commission's Director General for Energy and Transport (DGTREN) under the projects VERA (Video Enforcement for Road Authorities) and CAPTIVE (Common Application of Traffic Violations Enforcement). These projects were initiated to identify the steps that could be taken at a European level to implement a pan-EU approach to cross-border enforcement of traffic offences involving all member states. Officials from the Department and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency have taken part in workshops to take this work forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1745W.2/1">Other than previous debates in the House and representations made by individual MPs on behalf of their constituents, no specific representations have been made by the drinks industry or other stakeholders on the use of plastic in licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003 already provides for the police to apply for licence reviews and for conditions to be attached to licences. For example, that the licensed premises should use toughened drinks glasses and bottles. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 will in due course also provide a new fast track alcohol licence review process that could lead to such conditions being applied in cases of serious crime and disorder. We are also committed to reviewing the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England that was published in March 2004, later this year.</p>

The vast majority of these collisions have been dealt with causing minimum disruption to the motoring public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/2">The nature of this route is such that there is almost constant congestion during rush hour; unfortunately any collision or road closure inevitably results in that congestion becoming extreme. The options available to relieve this route are limited and</p>

	<p pid="b.1754W.3/5">The collision, which was close to the Culloden Hotel, involved four vehicles and blocked both Belfast bound and Bangor bound traffic lanes. In this regard it was necessary to implement a closure of the road in both directions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/6">All available police resources were tasked to the area to deal with the accident investigation, assist with the casualties and manage the necessary diversions to keep traffic disruption to a minimum.</p>

	<p pid="b.1754W.3/8">Debris and a petrol spillage resulted on the road that required the attendance of DRD Roads Service before the route could be safely re-opened.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/9">Police reopened the road on a phased basis as soon as was practically possible, with one Bangor bound traffic lane being reopened initially, followed by the second Bangor bound traffic lane, followed by both Belfast bound traffic lanes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/10">Full use was made of local media to advise motorists of the incident and text alerts were circulated to members of a local community information network scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/11">Police in North Down are reviewing this incident and a further serious road traffic collision, which occurred in the same vicinity to ascertain if there are any learning points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/12">The procedure to deal with any road traffic collision will be dependent on the prevailing circumstances and the PSNI made every effort to deal with the incident on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-16">16 March 2007</phrase> in a professional, effective and efficient manner and return the area to normality as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1754W.3/13">Any disruption to traffic flow and inconvenience to motorists is regrettable; however the primary policing objectives of the protection of life and property must be the paramount and overriding considerations in response to this type of incident.</p>

For the first five years these figures are actual outturn (2001 to 2006), while projected expenditure is used for the current financial year (2006-07). It would have been possible to provide a response detailing each individual project only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Repairs are undertaken by a combination of in-house resources and approved contractors and the times taken to complete repairs are monitored to ensure they comply with set targets. These range from 2 to 7 days, depending on the nature of the defect, and they are normally achieved. Exceptions arise as a result of restrictions imposed by the location and nature of the defect. Unfortunately, Water Service does not specifically record average timescales for repairing reported leaks and the information requested could only be extracted manually at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1763W.4/1">With our strong support the EU is working hard to create a more dynamic and internationally competitive single market for broadband and mobile services accessible to all across Europe. Its current work is largely through the i2010 programme for the information society which was developed and agreed during the UK's presidency, came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> and lasts until 2010 with a mid-term review in 2008. The i2010 programme includes measures to improve the regulatory framework for electronic communications services like broadband and mobile as well as measures to promote innovation and inclusion including take-up in the less developed regions of Europe. On broadband coverage the Commission is working with a wide range of regional and other interests on the proposals in its Communication last year, &quot;Bridging the Broadband Gap&quot;, and has been working with member states and regional authorities to enable public funding of broadband in rural and other areas in accordance with state aid rules. On mobile the EU is also taking action to reduce charges for roaming between national mobile networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.4/2">The proportion of mobile phone subscriptions relative to population in the EU is 93 per cent. one of the highest in the world. In several member states, including the UK, there are more mobile phones than people. A comparable figure for broadband is not available for the whole of the EU. In the 15 older member states it averaged 16 per cent. last year compared with 19 per cent. in Japan, 19.2 per cent. in the USA and 19.4 per cent. in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1765W.2/1">The Government through their Market Transformation Programme (MTP) have analysed the performances of over 630 televisions sold in 2004, 2005, and 2006 and have concluded that the difference in energy consumption between analogue and integrated digital televisions (IDTVs) is negligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/2">The annual energy consumption of a television varies significantly with screen size and television type, and defining what constitutes a 'typical' television is difficult. However, for a 32in. widescreen cathode-ray television, MTP estimates that the annual energy consumption will be 292 kWh, and 310 kWh for a LCD screen of the same size. A 42in. (a typical size for this technology) Plasma TV will consume 746 kWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/3">The total energy consumption of all UK televisions has risen in recent years, but this is not as a result of the presence of integrated digital tuners but a function of increased TV ownership, the trend towards larger screen sizes, and the migration away from cathode-ray televisions to other technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/4">MTP does not currently have sufficient information to provide a comparison between the performance of analogue and digital (DAB) radios. However, MTP has identified that many portable DAB radios are supplied with external power supply units which are less efficient&mdash;and therefore consume more energy&mdash;than those sold with comparable analogue products. MTP will be working with retailers and manufacturers to seek to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/5">As these are relatively new products, there are likely to be efficiency gains as the products mature.</p>

Negotiations on a Community Patent have been ongoing for a number of decades, and have been complicated by questions around language and jurisdiction. As the European Commission Consultation in 2006 noted, there appears no imminent prospect of achieving the unanimity required in order to establish a Community Patent. The consultation aimed to find steps which could be taken to improve the European patent system in the near future, which would help us to make progress towards the long term goal of a Community Patent. We anticipate that the Commission will publish its Communication on those next steps in the next few months.</p>

Nlandu on several occasions with Congolese Ministers, the Congolese Interior Minister and President Kabila's advisors. He raised the case with President Kabila himself in February. Embassy officials have also been present during some of her appearances in court and visited her in prison last month. We continue to monitor her situation and treatment closely.

But these statements need to be underpinned by serious action. Although there have been advances, not least the formation of the Government of National Unity and the remitting of oil revenues to the south, major issues under the CPA remain outstanding. Of these, resolving the Abyei dispute, north/south border demarcation and initiating election preparations are among the most important. These pose a credible threat to the CPA's future and ordinary Sudanese people's belief that making peace brings about positive change. The UK continues to press for more rapid progress through its membership of the CPA implementation monitoring body&mdash;the Assessment and Evaluation Commission.

	<p pid="b.1785W.8/1">Acute hepatitis C infection usually occurs without symptoms, and there are no laboratory tests to differentiate between acute (recent), chronic (long-standing) or resolved hepatitis C infection. Therefore, trends in the number of laboratory diagnoses reflect the number of individuals being tested, rather than the incidence of infection, and those infections identified may have been acquired years or even decades earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.1785W.8/2">The rise in the number of laboratory diagnoses of hepatitis C in London is likely to reflect greater awareness of hepatitis C and increased testing of individuals as part of the investigation of liver disease (including abnormal liver function), testing in known risk groups or as part of screening (for example for occupational health reasons).</p>

The teams are now practicing from either midwifery centres (Goole, Crowle, Brigg and Ashby) or from children's centres (West Street, Henderson Avenue and Castledyke).

	<p pid="b.1797W.0/1">Toxocara is not a notifiable disease in England and Wales, therefore the numbers of cases per year is taken from confirmed diagnostic laboratory reports. The Health Protection Agency received 19 laboratory reports in 1998 and fewer than 10 reports in each of the years since then. The breakdown of data by primary care trust area is not collected.</p>
