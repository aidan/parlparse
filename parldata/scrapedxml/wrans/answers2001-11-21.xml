	<p pid=".279W.3/1">Clergy in office are provided with a house and are paid a stipend. In retirement, however, they must meet their own housing costs. The derivation of the formula for the pension and retirement lump sum takes this into account.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.3/2">Actual arrangement of retirement housing is a matter for the individual, who may purchase a property (if necessary with the aid of a mortgage obtained in the market) or rent. The Church offers, through the Pensions Board and supported by investment capital provided by the Church Commissioners, a scheme of housing assistance which widens the choice available. Subject to the circumstances of the individual, a value-linked mortgage loan may be granted to enable accommodation to be purchased, or a property owned by the Board can be occupied in return for payment of maintenance contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".279W.3/3">The Archbishops' Council has recently conducted a review of clergy stipends and the General Synod has agreed that the report should be sent to dioceses for consultation. A copy of the review group's report &quot;Generosity and Sacrifice&quot; (GS 1408) is available in the House of Commons Library. It includes the recommendation that the Pensions Board, the Church Commissioners, dioceses and clergy charities consider the possibility of finding sufficient capital for loans to clergy to enable them to make provision for retirement housing in advance of retirement by lending them the money for a deposit on a house, the mortgage for which could be funded by renting out the property. The Commissioners will give consideration to this in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.2/1">The Churchwardens Measure 2001 provides a comprehensive set of rules about the appointment of churchwardens and their tenure of office, building on earlier legislation. Most of the Measure has caused no controversy, and the draft provisions about which the Ecclesiastical Committee expressed concern, relating to the possible suspension of a churchwarden from exercising his or her duties, were deleted by the General Synod and form no part of the Measure.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/2">The Measure will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase>, and will apply to the elections of churchwardens at the annual meetings held in parishes from 2002 onwards. A good deal of information about the new rules has already been published and more guidance will be issued before the Measure comes into force.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/3">The new rule that a churchwarden may not serve for more than six years without a break is laid down in the Measure as the norm, but the parishioners of an individual parish will be free to decide that the rule is not to apply in their case. As the six years will not start to run until the Measure comes into force, there will be ample time for every parish to consider the matter and reach its own decision.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.0/1">UK emissions modelling suggests that small petrol-powered off-road equipment accounts for 2.1 per cent. of UK hydrocarbon emissions with chainsaws accounting for only a small part of this. However, the European Commission estimates the significance of emissions from these machines to be much greater. The Commission estimates small off-road petrol engines to produce 6.5 per cent. of EU hydrocarbon emissions with chainsaws accounting for approximately half of this figure.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.0/2">Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of ground level ozone, which is harmful to human health and, in addition, certain hydrocarbons are carcinogenic. Despite the low significance of total hydrocarbon emissions from this sector of machinery, individual machines are high emitters. It is therefore desirable to reduce emissions from them as far as practical, not only to benefit the environment, but also to reduce operator exposure to carcinogenic emissions.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.3/1">The amendment would regulate, for the first time, emissions from small, off-road petrol engines, such as those used in lawnmowers, chainsaws etc, by means of two stages of emissions limits. Compliance with the Stage 2 limits may require adoption of oxidation catalysts on two-stroke engines (typically used in handheld equipment such as chainsaws). Where machines must be compact and lightweight it may be difficult to accommodate catalysts; 'tree-service' or 'top-handled' chainsaws as used by arboriculturists are a case in point.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.3/2">The UK has campaigned vigorously for derogations for these machines to give industry the time they need to develop alternative emissions control technology. At their first readings of the proposal, both the European Parliament and the Council adopted a clause requiring the Commission to review whether all applications of handheld engines could meet Stage 2 limits and, if not, set derogations of up to five years where appropriate. The Commission have made a written declarations that this review will specifically consider chainsaws.</p>

More positive planning at regional and local levels will contribute to greater public familiarity with, and acceptance of, prospective renewable energy developments and will help to facilitate planning permission for individual proposals.

They report that it continues to alleviate peak congestion on this busy section of the motorway but they recommend that the scheme could be improved by raising the speed limit between junction 4 and the elevated section to 60mph and the use by motorcycles of the lane designated for buses and taxis.

Although temporary recruitment restrictions may occur from time to time under certain circumstances, the MOD intends to continue recruiting as normal until the outcome of the Airfield Support Services Project (ASSP) is known.

	<p pid=".300W.2/1">Assessment work on the new carrier project began in November 1999 when contracts were awarded to two competing consortia headed by BAE Systems and Thales Naval Ltd. The first stage of the assessment was completed in June this year.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/2">Since then officials have been working to determine the most efficient and cost effective way forward for the remainder of the Assessment Phase, taking into account the views of both consortia about the amount of work required to minimise the level of risk in the CVF programme.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/3">On the basis of that work, contracts have been signed today for both BAE Systems and Thales Naval Ltd. to proceed to Stage 2 of the CVF Assessment Phase.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/4">For the next 12 months, until November 2002, the competing consortiums will concentrate on refining their designs and on taking key trade-off decisions. During this period, there will be a continuous assessment of the two consortiums' work leading to an announcement of a single preferred prime contractor in early 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/5">The preferred consortium will then continue assessment work through the summer of 2003 in order to provide the robust cost, time and performance information needed to make the main investment decision. This will allow us to make a decision to place a formal build contract in early 2004. The selected prime contractor will be expected to maintain the time, cost and performance proposals agreed at the end of the Assessment phase. Following the announcement of a preferred contractor, there will be maximum competition at the sub-contractor level to ensure that robust prices are achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/6">This approach reflects a sensible revision to the original procurement approach envisaged for the future carrier project. By applying Smart Procurement principles, it will help to ensure the maximum potential for competition throughout the remainder of the Assessment Phase. It will ensure that we achieve best value for money for the taxpayer. As part of the new approach, we will make around a further &pound;20 million available to the contractors during the Assessment Phase.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/7">The In Service Dates of the two new carriers remain unchanged at 2012 and 2015.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/8">Both BAE Systems and Thales have welcomed this new approach which demonstrates innovative thinking to deliver value for money. It re-affirms in the strongest possible terms this Government's commitment to ensuring that our armed forces are equipped with battle-winning equipment. Combined with the Future Joint Combat Aircraft, the carriers will provide the UK with a formidable force projection capability.</p>

	<p pid=".301W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I attended the Capabilities Improvement Conference along with colleagues from other EU nations.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.0/2">Good progress has been made towards the Headline Goal target for a European pool of forces. Offers were made by EU member states at last year's Capability Commitments Conference for 94 of the 144 identified capability areas underpinning the Headline Goal. The new offers made on Monday enhance our capabilities in a number of these areas and provide solutions for a further 10. We also agreed an Action Plan to address the remaining shortfalls: there are already identified initiatives addressing 20 of the 21 most significant capability areas. This process also reinforces NATO's Defence Capabilities Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.0/3">EU nations have offered substantial contributions, as set out in the Compendium of national Contributions prepared by the EU Presidency. In addition to the UK commitments made at last year's conference, I have identified further capabilities targeted specifically at the remaining shortfall areas. Some will be available before 2003 for the Headline Goal target; others later.</p>
	<p pid=".301W.0/4">I will place a copy of the Compendium in the Library of the House.</p>

The implementation of the new Single Programme Budget for RDAs next year is likely to lead to even closer working, with the Government office having a key role in monitoring One North-East's performance against the demanding targets for that budget. The Government office was fully involved in the production of the Regional Strategy, and will be working closely with One North-East in the coming months on the review of the Agency's Regional Strategy for the North East which is now under way.</p>

Where possible we support countries' own poverty reduction strategies, for example by financing work to help them to design and implement pro-poor economic and social policies, improve the quality of governance and tackle HIV/AIDS. In countries affected by conflict we support initiatives to reduce the threat and impact of conflict, and provide emergency and rehabilitation assistance.

We hope that the international organisations, particularly the UN and Red Cross, will be able to improve delivery of food, healthcare, and other assistance and that some of the internally displaced will be able to return home before the winter gets worse. Plans are now being made for their international staff to return as soon as possible. In addition, we hope that it will be possible to accelerate deliveries so that winter stockpiles can be built closer to the people who need them.

We are providing substantial support to this work through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI) and work closely in partnership with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF. This must be underpinned by strengthened health systems, better health worker skills and better caring practices within the home and community, and we have committed over &pound;1 billion since 1997 to help governments with this task.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.2/1">Many developing countries suffer from subsidised food being dumped on their markets. Owing to the complexity of subsidies and the widespread use of subsidies in industrialised nations, it is difficult to determine exactly which developing countries are being harmed by dumped subsidised food and to what extent. However, the EU is one of the principal users of subsidies. For this and other reasons the Government are strongly committed to fundamental reform of the CAP.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.8/1">The Government have initiated a number of programmes aimed at encouraging and enabling schools to offer a wider range of sporting opportunities for their pupils. They give all pupils the opportunity to achieve high standards and those with the greatest potential the opportunity to excel at their chosen sport. The 1,000 School Sport Co-ordinators who will be in place by 2004 will have funding for, among other things, bringing sport specific coaches into schools to coach pupils and for building school-club links. Also, Specialist Sports Colleges are funded to provide the lead in innovative practice sharing resources and expertise to achieve high standards. Coaching for Teachers is a joint initiative funded by Sport England and coordinated by sports coach UK, it provides teachers involved in out-of-school-hours activities with low-cost coaching courses. Coaching for Teachers delivers governing body courses in both rugby union and football. Awards for All is a lottery-funded programme focused at four priority groups, one of those being girls and women and provides awards of up to &pound;5,000. These awards can be used to develop out-of-hour learning opportunities, eg training courses for coaches or the hiring of coaches, in schools that preferably link with the local community.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have considered the Board's recommendations very carefully. We are grateful to them and to the industry associations for the work which has gone into their proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.8/2">We have also had to bear in mind the report of the Gambling Review, chaired by Sir Alan Budd, which has also made recommendations about the maximum stakes and prizes in gaming machines. These recommendations of the Gambling Review differed from those made by the Gaming Board in a number of important respects.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.8/3">Having considered both sets of recommendations in detail&mdash;and in the light of the period of public consultation on the Gambling Review, which ended on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>&mdash;we have decided to place before Parliament an Order under the Gaming Act 1968 which would increase the maximum prize from an all-cash Amusements with Prizes gaming machine to &pound;25 and the maximum prize from a jackpot gaming machine in a casino to &pound;2,000. That Order will be laid before both Houses shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.8/4">We have decided to propose no further changes to the stakes and prizes in gaming machines for the present.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.8/5">The changes which we are proposing are supported both by the Gaming Board and the report of the Gambling Review. The Review concluded however that increases in the amounts which can be paid out by gaming machines should be accompanied by changes in the law to make it an offence for people under 18 to play them or to allow people under 18 to play them. It also recommended significant strengthening of industry agreements on preventing under-age play.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.8/6">We shall be considering possible changes to the law. In the meantime, we look to the industry to play the fullest and most active part in improving the present arrangements to prevent under-age play of gaming machines. I am asking the Gaming Board for Great Britain to assess whether there are practical improvements in this area, and we will take close account of their conclusions before reaching any conclusions as to further changes in the regulation of gaming machines.</p>

	<p pid=".321W.6/1">The most recent assessment of the levels of the illegal disposal of waste was carried out by the Tidy Britain Group. The report, &quot;Effects Of Landfill Tax: Reduced Disposal of Inert Waste To Landfill&quot;, explored the impact of the landfill tax on fly-tipping, and it confirmed that the type of waste most frequently fly- tipped is household waste. The Fly-tipping Stakeholder's Forum is also currently conducting a study on the scale of fly-tipping on agricultural land.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.6/2">My Department maintains close contact with the National Assembly of Wales on all relevant policy issues including on fly-tipping. The National Assembly voted additional funds to support the Environment Agency's targeted waste enforcement project in Wales, now in its second year. This has resulted in an increase in successful prosecutions of offenders.</p>

	<p pid=".322W.3/1">The Government are strongly committed to the public's right to know about polluting emissions. The Environment Agency has a comprehensive Pollution Inventory that provides easy access to annual emissions data on 150 pollutants from over 2,000 of the most potentially polluting industrial processes in England and Wales. The public can access this information through the Environment Agency's website <a href="http://www.environmentagency.gov.uk">www.environmentagency.gov.uk</a> and from local Environment Agency offices (general line: 0845 9333 111).</p>
	<p pid=".322W.3/2">The Environment Agency is working on improving the scope of the Inventory. This year the Inventory has been expanded to include emissions from nuclear sites and large sewage treatment works. Over the next year more sectors will be added including major landfill sites, more sewage treatment works, and radioactive emissions from non-nuclear sites.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.3/3">The number of sites reporting will increase to around 7,000 in 2003 as a result of the implementation of the European Union Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). The IPPC Directive requires member states to report emission levels to the European Commission so that an inventory of principal emissions and their sources, known as the European Pollutant Emissions Register (EPER), can be produced. The EPER will initially require reporting on 50 pollutants released to air and water every three years with the first year of reporting commencing in 2003.</p>

The research will use existing national datasets about changing countryside character, including agriculture, forestry and land use change statistics and, from Countryside Survey 2000, information on landscape features and biodiversity. New data on traditional farm buildings are being collated by English Heritage and the Countryside Agency. The research will consider tranquillity as an aspect of countryside character.

The Rural White Paper published last year announced &pound;92 million would be made available over the next three years to fund these two initiatives. Many of these services will also benefit as a result of the Government's intention to extend eligibility to receive fuel duty rebate to a wide range of community transport services. Following consultation earlier this year, regulations implementing this change will be introduced later this financial year.</p>

	<p pid=".338W.3/1">Two stories have recently appeared in the media alleging links between Osama Bin Laden and the trade in illicit diamonds. There is little doubt that terrorist organisations, like other criminal groups, have over the years, traded in illicit diamonds to generate funds for their activities. The Kimberley Process was designed to devise a way to break the link between the illicit diamond trade and armed conflict. Urgent completion of its work on an international certification scheme for rough diamonds would also help curb other illegal sales, including those which fund terrorists.</p>

	<p pid=".339W.8/2">The Bill will confer British citizenship on all other BDTCs except those who owe their status solely to their connection with the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus. Apart from the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar, the qualifying Territories are Anguilla (pop. 11,900), Bermuda (pop. 61,500) British Antarctic Territory (no permanent population), British Indian Ocean Territory (no permanent population), British Virgin Islands (pop. 19,100), Cayman Islands (pop. 36,600), Montserrat (pop. 4,500), Pitcairn Islands (pop. 54), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (no permanent population), St. Helena and Dependencies (pop. 6,400), Turks and Caicos Islands (pop. 20,000). All those who become British citizens under the provisions of the Bill will enjoy the rights of abode and employment in the United Kingdom which flow from British citizenship.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-20">20 November 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/2">Criteria and detailed requirements for joining the Early Excellence Centre (EEC) programme are set out in guidance issued by the Department. Guidance issued in February provided the framework for designations made so far this year. Additional guidance was issued on <phrase class="date" code="">5 October</phrase>. The core activities of the programme which all centres are expected to deliver, or have well advanced and convincing plans to develop, remain unchanged and are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/3" class="indent">good quality integrated early education and daycare for children 0 to five requiring centre-based extended-day and extended-year provision;</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/4" class="indent">parental and carer involvement in the education and care of children, eg schemes for family learning, developing parenting skills, raising parents' expectations and in other ways;</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/5" class="indent">support services for children and parents and carers of children, eg health, counselling and information services, home support, drop-in facilities;</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/6" class="indent">effective early identification and intervention for children in need and children with special educational needs, with a view to improving children's prospects and, wherever appropriate, achieving inclusion in mainstream provision;</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/7" class="indent">access to adult education and training by parents of young children and other adults, including those seeking skills and qualifications for employment;</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/8" class="indent">raising standards of integrated early years provision among other early years providers, including voluntary and private providers, childminders and other carers, by contributing to the training and development strategy of the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership and through the development and dissemination of good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/9">Decisions on designations also take into account links with other Government programmes, geographical coverage, support of key partners, especially the local Early Years and Childcare Development Partnership (EYCDP), and commitment to multi-agency working.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/10">The Department received 135 expressions of interest following the issue of the February guidance and 14 new centres were announced on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>. Officials are continuing to work closely with a further nine centres in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Wigan, Peterborough, Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire and Bury, on the basis of expressions of interest received in response to the February guidance. A further 93 expressions of interest in joining the programme have been received since additional guidance was issued in October.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/11">Somerford Infant School's expression of interest in the EEC programme was submitted in response to the guidance issued in February. It was closely linked to emerging local proposals for the development of a Neighbourhood Nursery, but did not meet the requirements set out in the guidance for joint Neighbourhood Nursery/Early Excellence Centre schemes. Neither did it provide sufficient coverage of the core activities or relate them sufficiently well to the wider strategy of the EYCDP.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/12">The Department wrote to the school inviting it to develop its plans further. I have placed a copy of that letter in the Library. The additional guidance issued in October indicates that those invited to do further development work should submit a fresh expression of interest taking into account feedback received. The guidance included full contact details for relevant officials at the Department and encouraged partners to make contact with them for further information.</p>
	<p pid=".347W.2/13">The Department has not received a further expression of interest from Somerford Infant School. To continue to develop its interest in the programme the school should contact officials at the Department who will be most willing to discuss it with them.</p>

	<p pid=".358W.0/1">&quot;Making Punishments Work&quot;, the report of a review of the sentencing framework undertaken by John Halliday&mdash;and known as the Halliday report&mdash;was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July</phrase> and responses were invited by <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>. The report was sent to a large number of individuals and organisations and a series of meetings were held with members of the public and representatives of the judiciary and other bodies to encourage consideration of the report and obtain views.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/2">In order to encourage wider public involvement in the debate, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, launched the Fairer Sentencing website which contained a quiz, a facility to e-mail views and an on-line debating provision. In addition debate was stimulated in local, regional and national media and hon. Members were encouraged to initiate discussion in their constituencies. A number of conferences have also been convened.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/3">The level of interest and response has been considerable. Over 120 detailed responses have been received from individuals or organisations with connections to the criminal justice system and even more from members of the public by letter or e-mail or through the debating channel. In addition, the website received 33,482 page hits, the home page was visited 5,831 times, 2,839 copies of the layman's summary of the Halliday review were downloaded, 1,171 copies of the Home Secretary's speech on sentencing reform were downloaded and 1,226 people completed the quiz on the website. This has been a unique opportunity to hold a public consultation on the point of sentencing and many members of the public have offered their own suggestions and alternatives.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/4">There has been almost unanimous support for the need for change to the present sentencing framework, accompanied by a strong message that the change should be done well, properly resourced and then allowed to stand the test of time. There has also been broad support for the general thrust of the proposals, in particular the need for radical changes in the approach to short prison sentences. There is widespread recognition that it is unacceptable to have no supervision for an individual leaving a short prison sentence and that there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of both a prison sentence and a community sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/5">There has also been considerable support for greater transparency in sentencing.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/6">There has been mixed support for the greater involvement of the courts in the management of sentences through review hearings. Many commentators have seen the strength of the arguments in terms of principle but have expressed doubts about whether the enormous practical difficulties could be overcome sufficiently well to justify that intervention in every case.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.0/7">Officials are now analysing the responses in greater detail and a summary of the responses will be published, with copies in the Library, towards the end of January 2002. I then anticipate publishing a White Paper in spring 2002.</p>

The year ending <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> was the first year in which the Department of Health has requested that only the council with the original responsibility for the child should include the child in its figures until the receiving council has held a child protection conference to determine whether the child should instead be registered by that council.
