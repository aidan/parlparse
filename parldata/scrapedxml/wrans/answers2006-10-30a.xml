Employees who have reached minimum pension age of 60 are similarly able to request to draw their accrued pension benefits and keep working, either on reduced hours or in a lower grade.

	<p pid="a.2W.5/1">New claims to severe disablement allowance were stopped on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-06">6 April 2001</phrase>. From that date new customers need to apply for incapacity benefit or income support on grounds of incapacity. At that time youth rules were introduced to incapacity benefit, whereby those incapable of work before the age of 20 (25 years old in certain circumstances) are eligible for the benefit without needing to meet the national insurance contribution condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.5/2">Existing severe disablement allowance customers, apart from those aged under 20 years old on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-05">5 April 2001</phrase>, have not been transferred onto incapacity benefit. Instead payment of severe disablement allowance continues as long as the benefit conditions continue to be satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.5/3">Entitlement to severe disablement allowance does not passport its recipients to other benefits, such as housing benefit, in the way that income support and income related jobseeker's allowance do. Many customers on severe disablement allowance may also qualify for income support and so be passported to other benefits in that way. People on severe disablement allowance with a low income, but not also receiving income support would need to be considered for housing benefit on low-income grounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.7W.11/1">Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recently re-published &quot;Charity and voluntary workers: A guide to health and safety at work&quot; (HSG192). This is mainly concerned with the health and safety of workers employed by the voluntary sector, but does touch upon public events. It was developed in partnership with the Charities Safety Group, which has over 100 member charities, and the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.11/2">The guidance makes clear that employers are required to carry out an assessment of risks that result from their undertaking and, if they employ five or more people, that they must record the findings of the assessment. Therefore, where the body organising an event is an employer, as many charities are, the law requires that a risk assessment is carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.11/3">The guidance also includes advice and case studies to help charities and volunteering organisations decide on the practical steps they need to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.11/4">HSE also supported Volunteering England in the development and recent launch of their risk assessment toolkit which is available free online at <a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk">www.volunteering.org.uk</a>. It gives detailed guidance on all aspects of risk assessment in volunteering, including health and safety aspects of organising events.</p>

This is because individuals who move abroad may at some point have a call upon contributions paid whilst in the UK. In the case of deceased individuals, a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependant on the contribution record of the deceased individual. This means that the number of accounts held on the system accrues as NINOs are allocated each year to all UK children who reach 16 years and persons from abroad requiring a NINO are added.</p>

DEAs support recently disabled people, or those whose health condition or disability has deteriorated and who need employment advice. They can refer people, where appropriate for occupational health assessments, or to access to work advisers, as well as the full range of Jobcentre Plus disability programmes. In addition, DEAs support people who encounter barriers in the workplace associated with disability, and also provide advice and support to employers regarding the employment and retention of disabled people and those with health conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.14W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question, what estimate has been made of the Pensioner Prices Index in each year from 1976-77 to 2006-07 (96313).</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.2/5" class="indent">The Retail Prices Index (RPI) covers the expenditure of UK private households only, excluding the top four percent by income and those pensioner households where the head of the household is retired and economically inactive and where at least three-quarters of the household income is derived from state benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.2/6" class="indent">Since 1969, RPI pensioner indices have been compiled on a quarterly basis for these pensioner households excluded from the RPI (separately for one and two pensioner households). These indices are based on the spending patterns of these specific households, and contain some pensioner specific items such as OAP bus and rail fares. They exclude items such as canteen meals, which are not relevant due to very small expenditure levels. They also exclude housing costs on the grounds that the price indicators used in the RPI would overstate the price increases experienced by these pensioners, because no allowance is made for rebates e.g. on council tax and local authority rents.</p>

	<p pid="a.16W.2/1">The Pension Service has written to every pensioner household to tell them about pension credit. A direct mail initiative &quot;You're missing out&quot; was targeted at 1.5 million households identified as highly likely to be eligible for pension credit, as a result of data matching. A further 'reminder' postcard was sent to one million households who did not respond. Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase> customers who contact the pension credit application line to make an application for pension credit are also able to claim housing benefit and council tax benefit during the one phone call.</p>
	<p pid="a.16W.2/2">During 2005-06 Local Service visited approximately 23,000 households each week, focusing on those customers who were most likely to be eligible for pension credit and working closely with partners (e.g. Help the Aged, Age Concern) to encourage pensioners to take up their entitlement to pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.17W.2/1">People aged 60 or over who are receiving the guarantee part of pension credit will normally be entitled to full council tax benefit, less deductions for any non-dependants in the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/2">There is no capital limit within pension credit although a notional rate of income for capital over &pound;6,000 (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes) is assumed at a rate of &pound;1 for each &pound;500 or part of &pound;500.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/3">Someone in ill-health may also be entitled to an additional amount in pension credit for severe disability if they qualify for attendance allowance or the middle or highest rate of the care component for disability living allowance. This would increase the level of the guaranteed minimum income that would be applied and increase the amount of income (including notional income from savings) that someone could have and still qualify for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/4">People over the age of 65 who are severely disabled and have personal care or supervision needs can claim attendance allowance. It is non-contributory, tax free and is not affected by income or savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/5">We want to make sure pensioners claim all the benefits to which they are entitled and know that some pensioners need support in doing so. The Pension Service Local Service, local authorities and sometimes the voluntary sector are joining forces nationally so that older people will receive a full and joined up service that can deal with a variety of issues and queries. Many older people dislike having to go through claim processes over and over again with different organisations and these joint teams can help reduce this by providing a single access point to social care and benefit entitlements such as pension credit, housing benefit and attendance allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/6">We now have 118 teams that are able to visit some of the most vulnerable people in the country, people who historically may never have applied for any entitlement or benefit and who would not be aware of referral routes or even the names of the many benefits they could receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/7">State pension, winter fuel payments and free television licences are not affected by health or savings and are available to everyone who satisfies the qualifying conditions.</p>

The resulting medical report is considered by the trustees. A former MP or Office Holder may also apply to receive an ill-health pension, subject to confirming that he or she does not intend to seek election to the House or accept any future offer to serve as an Office Holder, and the medical practitioner confirming that the former member has retired from 'gainful work' as a direct consequence of ill-health.</p>

	<p pid="a.27W.2/1">DFID has recently completed a study on the links between sexual and reproductive health and rights and the AIDS response. The study included a review of the experience of programmes to link sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS services. For example a South African NGO, LoveLife, provided youth friendly services for sexual and reproductive health and HIV in combination with a multi-media information campaign aimed at young people. Changes in HIV prevalence and sexual behaviour were tracked through the National Youth Survey. The survey results demonstrated that participation in the programme was associated with decreased odds of HIV infection and increased the odds of young men and women using condoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.27W.2/2">The DFID review concluded that there is emerging consensus, backed up by growing evidence, on the main priorities for developing links between sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS services. The challenge now is to support national governments to scale up the provision of evidence based and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services for all vulnerable groups including women and girls, men who have sex with men and sex workers.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.5/1">The UK Government are extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. This is caused by the conflict with Israel; an economic downturn due to restrictions on movement and access and the Palestinian Authority's fiscal crisis, which has meant it has been unable to pay salaries. The fiscal crisis is mainly the result of the withholding of clearance revenues by Israel and a downturn in domestically generated revenues. The suspension of budgetary support by donors has played a less significant role.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/2">The suspension of budgetary support has been necessary following the Hamas-led Government's failure to renounce violence, recognise Israel and sign up to previous peace agreements. However, the international community is doing what it can to address the humanitarian situation. The European Community has increased its aid from &euro;250 million to &euro;340 million this year. UK bilateral aid levels have remained constant at &pound;30 million this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/3">A Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) has been set up to support Palestinians directly instead of going through the Palestinian Authority. DFID intends to contribute up to &pound;12 million to the TIM and the European Community is contributing &euro;105 million. So far the TIM has delivered 2.6 million litres of fuel to keep water, sanitation and health care facilities running; allowances for over 63,000 Palestinian Government workers; and welfare payments to over 40,000 of the poorest Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.5/4">DFID has provided &pound;15 million this financial year to support Palestinian refugees, through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA). DFID also gives core funding to other UN agencies which are helping to address the humanitarian situation including the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Furthermore, we have deployed two experts to OCHA to improve its ability to monitor the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These experts will help to make sure that aid gets to those who need it the most.</p>

Where appropriate, the agency undertakes works to mitigate for the impact of its operational, maintenance and improvement works, which may include the provision of animal welfare measures. These measures include the provision of animal crossings in the form of tunnels and adapted farm crossings and underpasses. Appropriate fencing may be included to both prevent animals crossing the carriageway and direct the animals to a safe crossing facility. They also undertake specific enhancement measures, such as the provision of bat boxes as part of commitments set out in the Highways Agency Biodiversity Action Plan (HABAP). Finally, the agency also undertakes research to support the development of advice in relation to the effectiveness of such measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.2/2">With respect to expenditure, mitigation and enhancement measures are often provided as part of larger scheme budgets and specific costs are not available. However as part of its HABAP commitments, the agency has installed in excess of 920 bat boxes since 2002. Each of these enhancement schemes has been evaluated through a value management process, to ensure that works are appropriate and represent value for money. Other works are evaluated through cost challenge workshops or similar procedures for assessing value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.43W.2/1">Our new HomeBuy scheme offers three products based on equity sharing. Social HomeBuy enables tenants of local authorities and housing associations to buy a share in their current home at a discount, New Build HomeBuy enables people to buy a share of a newly built property paying a rent on the remainder, (including the First Time Buyers Initiative, which uses public sector land) and Open Market HomeBuy enables people to buy a property on the open market with the help of an equity loan.</p>
	<p pid="a.43W.2/2">Priority groups for our HomeBuy products are social tenants, key workers as defined under the Key Worker Living Programme and other first time buyers nominated by the Regional Housing Boards.

A supplementary table presents key information at local authority level, including the number of households accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need (and therefore owed a main homelessness duty) during the most recent quarter (April to June 2006), and the number of households in temporary accommodation arranged by the authority under homelessness legislation as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.48W.2/1">There is no right of appeal against a statutory grant of planning permission which has been enacted by Parliament and part 5 of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO), in particular, contains no powers, only entitlements. We have no records of part 5 permitted development rights being exercised by statutory undertakers. Statutory undertakers have their own permitted development rights in part 17 of schedule 2 of the GPDO, though there is nothing to prevent a statutory undertaker from enjoying the benefit of any of the other permitted development rights in the GPDO that might apply to their land in a particular case. Were there to be a dispute about whether permitted development rights applied in a particular case, it might be resolved either by an application made to the local planning authority for a certificate of lawfulness to confirm the existence of such rights in respect of a particular development proposal, or by enforcement action taken by the local planning authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.6/1">The second meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Nairobi, this November, presents an ideal opportunity to explore how Africa's participation in investment in projects through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) can be enhanced. There are several alternative proposals on the table for discussion in Nairobi, and the UK is keen to see a positive outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/2">The CDM market has grown enormously in the last year, with an estimated 1,000 projects, and 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the pipeline to 2012. The UK is the major private sector participant in the CDM market, with UK companies participating in some 25 per cent. of currently registered CDM projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/3">Africa does not have a record of attracting significant private investment in CDM.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/4">So the Government are arguing for the development of a fund which could assist in building capacity within Africa to develop and identify projects that could attract carbon finance. I am discussing the idea with colleagues from within the EU as well as from Africa. In parallel, I have asked officials to examine how a carbon fund for Africa could be best designed to deliver on this objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/5">The challenge is to ensure that any fund is designed to deliver long-term benefits to the countries concerned. As well as pressing the fund we need to look at the full range of measures to support and enhance Africa's participation in the CDM.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/6">There is already considerable international experience on support to CDM-related investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/7">The UK already supports several initiatives that assist African participation in CDM:</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/8" class="indent">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Opportunities Fund supports many projects designed to enhance developing countries' capacity to participate in CDM. There are several projects supporting CDM investment in Africa; in Angola, Nigeria and South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/9" class="indent">As a Government, we are also investing in the Kuyasa township CDM project in Cape Town, South Africa, to offset the emissions of the G8 presidency. I hope that we can build on this investment in the tender for the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund which we have set up to offset emissions from official travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.6/10">There are also several existing multilateral, European and bilateral initiatives on support capacity building and project investment, both agreed at a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change level, through the World Banks and bilaterally. This is something we need to learn from and build on.</p>

	<p pid="a.58W.2/1">The Farming Regulation and Charging Strategy for England, published in November 2005, details a number of commitments to reduce bureaucracy and make regulatory controls more effective and easier to comply with, including through the Whole Farm Approach. The strategy is available on the Defra website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/regulation/charge/pdf/farm-regulation-strategy.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/farm/policy/regulation/charge/pdf/farm-regulation-strategy.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/3">Defra has made a commitment to reduce the administrative burdens its regulations impose on business by 25 per cent. by 2010. We have recently participated in a cross-government exercise to measure this burden and are now in the final stages of finalising our Simplification Plan to be published in November 2006. This plan outlines a range of simplification initiatives, including many that impact on farmers, that will reduce the burden on business and reach our 25 per cent. target.</p>
	<p pid="a.58W.2/4">Some of these approaches will offer benefits to dairy farmers. In addition, the Government are continuing to press for the abolition of the milk quotas system, which will help to simplify existing arrangements in this sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.0/1">The Environment Agency (EA) is required, in accordance with HM Treasury's guidance and the &quot;polluter pays principle&quot;, to recover the full costs of regulation from those it regulates. The EA have worked with the farming sector to develop a straightforward, least-cost approach for farmers. It is for the EA, as the regulator, to assess the level of effort required to meet the pollution prevention and control requirements. In parallel, my Department continues to encourage the EA to demonstrate full transparency on what costs are for. The EA is also being set targets to drive efficiency throughout the organisation and gains will in turn offset charges as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.0/2">In response to concerns raised by the industry, the EA presented a proposal on subsistence charging in February this year. The EA's proposals were accepted by the British Poultry Council, as well as other intensive livestock trade associations in May. A subsistence charge of &pound;1,471 for an existing small farm and &pound;1,844 for an existing large farm will therefore be charged to the industry from August 2007 until March 2008, provided that the industry stage its applications over the three month application window (from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2007</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.3/1">The Department has been working closely with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to improve our understanding of how Campylobacter infection develops and spreads. We have also considered effective methods for controlling the spread of this bacteria at all levels of the food chain, including controls on farm and best practice guidance in the kitchen.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.3/2">For the period 2005-08, DEFRA has committed &pound;2.65 million towards research on the control of Campylobacter and the development of intervention practices to reduce the incidence of the bacteria within poultry production systems. This includes a DEFRA/FSA joint-funded three year survey, starting in 2007, to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in UK flocks of chicken for meat production.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.3/3">A report published by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food in July 2005 concluded that the control of Campylobacter is a practical proposition in housed flocks where producers maintain rigorous biosecurity measures and high flock management standards. As a result, priority action at farm level has focused on the importance of meeting good biosecurity standards. This action reinforces wider food hygiene initiatives in the commercial and domestic food handling settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.3/4">These research and education projects will help to support the FSA and the poultry industry in meeting their target to achieve a 50 per cent. reduction in the incidence of UK-produced chicken testing positive for Campylobacter by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.5/1">I have consulted closely with the chairman and chief executive of British Waterways about the in-year cut of about 7 per cent. of grant in aid amounting to &pound;3.94 million. They accept that Government have provided &pound;524 million in funding for British Waterways since 2000, of which &pound;452 million was for waterways in England and Wales. Over this period, British Waterways has substantially improved the state of its waterways and has eliminated the safety backlog. It has also concluded substantial regeneration and property projects and facilitated the restoration of some 200 miles of derelict canals. The current assessment of the effect of the reduction in the 2006-07 budgets is that there is likely to be some delay to capital works and set back the date by which British Waterways will be able to reduce year-on-year the requirements for grant in aid from Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.69W.3/1">The works programme for each year is planned to fit with the expected parliamentary timetable. Over the past three years approximately &pound;17 million has been spent in each summer recess on works projects across both Houses, of which approximately 60 per cent. (&pound;10 million) has been in the Commons. The Commission has estimated the effect of a two-week sitting period in September 2006 on the basis that such sittings and the works programme were planned from the previous November.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.3/2">If projects in the Palace and in those buildings housing Members stopped work for two weeks, an additional one/two week period would be required for project close down, making safe, then restarting. This means the overall impact on the works programme would equate to a total delay of up to three or four weeks out of the period over the summer recess from the end of July to mid October.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.3/3">Assuming that the aim would be to complete most projects in the shorter recess, the overall additional cost of an early September two-week return might be in the order of 15 per cent. (an additional &pound;2.5 million across both Houses or &pound;1.5 million for the Commons) of the cost of recess works in a normal summer. The additional costs would arise primarily from the need to increase evening and weekend working to complete projects more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.3/4">This figure for 2006 is substantially higher than the figure of &pound;90,000 for additional works costs in 2003 and 2004 given in my written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1083W, because it is impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been. The &pound;90,000 refers only to direct costs incurred in tidying up for the return including the dismantling of scaffolding and essential health and safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.3/5">There are also substantial but unquantifiable long-term costs and risks involved in delaying some projects and not tackling the backlog of maintenance work required for the parliamentary estate. The Parliamentary Estates Board has expressed the view that the Palace structure and infrastructure will need a higher level of maintenance and refurbishment over the next few years to halt further deterioration in its condition. Key elements are the needs for a major overhaul of the cast iron roofs, renewal of much of the internal infrastructure of pipes and cabling, fire compartmentation and automatic fire detection systems, and further stone restoration. It is unlikely that this can be completed effectively if all the work is confined to recesses, whether or not there are September sittings.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.3/6">It is not possible meaningfully to identify other additional costs arising from September sittings because major costs including accommodation and staffing continue throughout the year irrespective of whether or not the House is sitting. The overall daily resource cost of running the House administration in 2005-06 was &pound;560,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.69W.3/7">The cost of the two-day emergency recall in September 1998 was estimated at the time to have cost about &pound;375,000 in works costs. There were other staff costs, mainly for security and some overtime, amounting to &pound;33,200&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="1998-10-22">22 October 1998</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1189.</p>

	<p pid="a.70W.2/3">Following a resolution of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January 2005</phrase>, the House of Commons Commission was authorised to fund the publication and distribution of a new voters' guide.

The Modernisation and Administration Committees were consulted on the design and content of Voting Times prior to final approval being given by the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.70W.2/4">A further programme of research with recipients of the guide is currently under way to determine its effectiveness and any potential areas of improvement. This research will be completed by the new year. In addition, the House of Commons Information Office would welcome suggestions and feedback from hon. Members to improve future versions of the publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.87W.11/4">The administrators have a statutory duty to report to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if they consider that the conduct of any of the directors makes them unfit to be the directors of a limited company. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State then has a discretionary power to seek to have the directors disqualified if it appears to him to be in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.11/5">Also, directors do not enjoy absolute immunity from personal liability where a company goes into liquidation. If there is evidence in liquidation cases to indicate that there has been fraudulent or wrongful trading, a liquidator can ask the court to declare that those responsible should make a personal contribution towards the assets of the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.11/6">My right hon. Friend hopes hon. Members will appreciate that these are very early days in the administration. If any Member has constituents with concerns about the conduct of the company's affairs, they should contact the administrators.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.11/7">My right hon. Friend has also asked officials to make further inquiries as to the circumstances of the company's failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.11/8">My right hon. Friend has been discussing with the British Retail Consortium the possibility of their members making some form of goodwill gesture to the customers of Farepak who have lost the money they had been saving towards Christmas. I am pleased to say that the BRC have accepted in principle this suggestion, given the exceptional circumstances, and are contacting their members to consider further the practical steps required. This will not be a compensation package, and members of the BRC are under no legal obligation to provide any help, but they have had a lot of interest from many large retailers, who are keen to try and do something, and I am grateful to them for their co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.0/1">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 introduce a default retirement age of 65 together with procedures whereby the employee has a right to request that he or she be allowed to continue in work beyond the employer's normal retirement age. The employer has a duty to consider this request, and if both the employer and employee agree then the employee can continue in work. This will move towards a culture where a retirement decision is influenced by the individual circumstances and preferences of employers and employees, rather than an assumption about the norm. These arrangements were introduced in order to deliver the Government's labour market objectives recognising the need for workforce planning and avoiding adverse impact on the provision of occupational pensions and other work-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.0/2">In March this year we published the Survey of Employers' Policies, Practices, and Preferences Relating to Age that will provide the baseline for assessing the impact of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. Once the legislation has bedded in, we intend to carry out a follow-up survey, to inform the review of the default retirement age in 2011. We will also explore, with the Office for National Statistics and the Department for Work and Pensions, the process for collating better statistical data on employee retirement intentions and behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.0/3">The default retirement age has been developed as a result of extensive consultation. We have been interested in how other countries have approached age discrimination and seeing what lessons we could draw on. However, we have developed legislation that is right for Britain and which takes into account our own particular domestic and economic circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.102W.3/1">Equalised maintenance packages for the RAF's Harrier GR7/9 fleet were introduced in 2005. This has improved aircraft availability by an average of two aircraft per day. The airworthiness of the aircraft is also considered to have benefited from equalised maintenance packages but this aspect has yet to be quantified. The total technical support and man hour requirement of the new scheduled maintenance cycle is similar to the previous arrangements, albeit delivered more effectively; accordingly, there have been no measurable cost savings to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.3/2">Equalised maintenance packages are currently being introduced for the RAF's Nimrod MR2/R1 fleet. At this stage it is too early to measure accurately the full benefits of this change, but it is forecast that the new scheduled maintenance regime will deliver significant improvements in aircraft availability, and financial savings of approximately &pound;2 million per annum from financial year 2008-09. Before implementing this change a full safety assessment was carried out on the Nimrod MR2/R1 fleet and further safety assessments will be undertaken as the transition to equalised maintenance moves forward.</p>

The board of inquiry is under way and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the crash. Given that the crew had, however, received indications of a fire it was deemed prudent to conduct a fleet-wide examination of areas where flammable materials (such as fuel or hydraulic fluid) may be placed in relative proximity to potential sources of ignition should a leak occur. These examinations included visual inspections of the inboard wing and bomb bay areas, and pressurised functional and leak checks of the aircraft's fuel system.</p>

	<p pid="a.118W.2/2">The relevant target, as set out in the 2002 cross-cutting review into the role of the third sector in public service delivery is:</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Funders should recognise that it is legitimate for providers to include the relevant element of overheads in their cost estimates for providing a given service under service agreement or contract&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/4">The associated recommended action was that by April 2006, all Departments and agencies should recognise that it is legitimate for organisations to include relevant elements of overheads when seeking funding or bidding for contracts. Her Majesty's Treasury's Invest to Save programme now reflects full cost recovery in its bidding rounds; the Department of Health's third sector commissioning taskforce report emphasises the importance of reflecting the full cost of services in grants and contracts, and as set out in the Local Government White Paper, the Department of Communities and Local Government is working with local authorities to ensure relevant Compact principles (including full cost recovery) are reflected in local government finance codes.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/5">The principle of full cost recovery and funding of legitimate overheads is reinforced in &quot;Improving Financial Relationship with the third sector: Guidance to Funders and Purchasers&quot; published jointly by Her Majesty's Treasury, the Cabinet Office, The Office for Government Commerce and the National Audit Office on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/6">We recognise there is further to go in ensuring that full cost recovery is fully implemented in practice. Further details of the Government's work in this area will be set out in the Office of the Third Sector's Public Service Delivery Action Plan later this year. In addition, the independent Commissioner for the Compact will champion implementation of the Compact principles at all levels, national, regional and local, including those relating to sound funding and procurement practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.129W.3/1">The judicial pension schemes make provision for the immediate payment of accrued pension benefits to judges who are required to retire on grounds of ill health. Under the 1993 Judicial Pension Scheme there is an enhancement of service in the event of ill-health retirement prior to the age of 65. According to the available information, about 9.7 per cent. of judicial retirements in the period between 1992-93 and 2005-06 have been on health grounds. In the first six months of 2006-07 the corresponding figure has been 8.8 per cent.</p>

However, it is not possible to publish robust estimates of the number of incidents of graffiti due to the relatively low incidence and thus high variability of the estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.10/3">Criminal damage measures from the BCS are published in line with those from recorded crime, and thus will be reviewed if any changes are made to police statistics. We will explore whether police recorded crime returns could be amended to include the information requested, without placing an undue burden on police forces. The reviews of crime statistics (Statistics Commission and Smith, forthcoming) may also affect how measurements of criminal damage and graffiti are made in future years of the BCS and police recorded crime statistics.</p>
