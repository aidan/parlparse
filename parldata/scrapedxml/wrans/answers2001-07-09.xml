	<p pid=".319W.3/2">The Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 will be the biggest multi-sport event ever held in the United Kingdom. They will leave a lasting sporting, economic and social legacy.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.3/3">The Minister of State, Cabinet Office explained, in evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-20">20 March 2001</phrase>, that Manchester City Council, with the Government, had arranged a review of the finances and organisation of the Commonwealth Games in Manchester next year as a build up to the Games moves from the planning to the implementation phase.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.3/4">Following the review, conscious of the benefits the Games will bring to the nation as a whole, the Government have agreed to provide from existing resources up to &pound;30 million to support the Games. Sport England has agreed to provide up to &pound;30 million to support the Games' costs in addition to its existing contribution to capital facilities, and Manchester City Council will make available a further &pound;45 million. &pound;25 million of these funds will be held jointly by the three parties as a contingency fund. This support is additional to the &pound;10.5 million which the Government have already made available towards the costs of the opening and closing ceremonies for the Commonwealth Games, and marks the full extent of the financial support that the Government are prepared to make available.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.3/5">The Government consider that this package should give the Games' organisation sufficient certainty to deliver the Games. Manchester City Council continues to retain ultimate financial responsibility for the Games.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.3/6">Discussions continue about the make up and timing of the package of financial support. The Government, Manchester City Council and Sport England will be working with the Games' organisers to strengthen the management arrangements for the control of expenditure.</p>

	<p pid=".322W.2/1">The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June</phrase>. I represented the United Kingdom, together with Sarah Boyack MSP, Minister for Transport in the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/2">The Council opened with debates on a number of maritime issues.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/3">A common position was adopted on the draft regulation putting into Community law the recent agreement reached in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on the accelerated phasing in of double hull oil tankers.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/4">The Council reached a common orientation on a draft directive which seeks to improve controls on shipping movements, notably for vessels with hazardous cargoes. Two outstanding issues were debated. Firstly, the Commission introduced a new proposal giving a precise timetable for the retrofitting of Voyage Data Recorders (VDRs) to cargo vessels if no agreement was reached in the IMO. I was among Ministers unable to accept such a precise text. On the second issue, that of restrictions on ships leaving port in exceptionally bad weather or sea conditions, I joined others in expressing concern that legal uncertainties could arise. I also sought to clarify that a member state could only enforce reporting requirements on vessels in areas where it had jurisdiction in international law. A revised text was produced on which Ministers were able to reach common orientation, although I maintained a reserve on the VDR text.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/5">Common approaches were agreed for member states to negotiate in the IMO on the retrofitting of VDRs to cargo vessels, and in the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) on an increase in the limits for compensation to be paid in cases of major oil spills.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/6">A common orientation was also agreed on a draft directive on the harmonisation of reporting formalities for ships. The aim of the proposal is to simplify procedures for ships arriving at and departing from Community ports, through the acceptance of a common set of IMO forms.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/7">The French Minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, and I presented a joint proposal urging the Community to bring into force a number of International Conventions relating to marine liability and compensation and pollution from ships. We had, prior to the Council, jointly signed a letter on this issue to our EU counterparts.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/8">The Commissioner reported on the principal elements of the forthcoming White Paper on a strategy for the Common Transport Policy. She hoped that the White Paper would be adopted soon. It is expected to outline some 60 separate measures to address traffic congestion, increased mobility and demand, and sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/9">Council Conclusions were adopted on the Galileo satellite navigation project. I joined other Ministers in noting that more work was needed on the selection of services, the cost-benefit analysis and the securing of private sector finance. The Commission also presented a draft regulation on management of the development phase of Galileo by a joint undertaking.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/10">Over lunch, there was a discussion of the Commission's Single European Sky proposals, aimed at improving air traffic management in Europe and reducing delays.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/11">The Council discussed aircraft noise issues. The Commission reported on ongoing discussions with the US on hushkits, and said that, subject to developments at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in September, a proposal would be brought forward to replace the Hushkits Regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/12">The Presidency presented a progress report on the proposed regulation to establish a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It sought agreement on two of the outstanding questions: coverage of third country aircraft, and the mechanism to appoint the Executive Director. The Council agreed that the Commission should bring forward proposals on application to third country aircraft, where justified, as part of future work on essential requirements for airline operations. The Council accepted that the executive Director of the EASA should be appointed by four-fifths majority of the Management Board, on the basis of a proposal by the Commission. There will be further discussion under the Belgian Presidency, notably on institutional aspects.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/13">The Council discussed an amendment to Regulation 2027/97 on air carrier liability, and political agreement was reached on a common position. The amendment will have the effect of increasing the levels of carriers' liability to passengers. The Council has already signed the Montreal Convention, with a view to ratification, and the two measures together significantly strengthen the protection afforded to air passengers in the Community.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/14">The Council agreed Conclusions affirming the voluntary agreements reached with airlines on air passenger rights.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/15">There was a progress report from the Commission on proposals to update the state aid rules and procurement procedures for public transport services by rail, road and inland waterway. The Commission indicated that there were difficulties in agreeing the proposal. Sarah Boyack noted the United Kingdom's support for the general principle of the regulation, but pointed out that its application to traditional and complex underground railway systems needed careful reflection.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/16">There was also a progress report on a draft directive on training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/17">The Commission presented its proposals on three issues in the &quot;road package&quot;: an amendment to Directive 91/439 on driving licences; an amendment to Regulation 3820/85 on drivers' hours; and an amendment to Directive 92/6 on the use of speed limitation devices, extending compulsory fitting of them to vehicles above 3.5 tonnes. No decisions were taken.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/18">Under other business, the Commission presented a new proposal on airport slot allocation. It also reported on the implementation of the package of rail transport measures adopted by the Council last year, noting its intention to propose a second package of measures, including a directive on rail safety regulation and the establishment of a European Rail Agency. Also under other business, the Commission reported on progress in aviation negotiations with Central and Eastern European countries and with Cyprus; co-operation with Euro-Mediterranean partners on transport and energy; and discussions with Russia on the issue of charges imposed for Siberian overflights.</p>

	<p pid=".324W.2/1">The historical impacts of bus deregulation in 1986 were studied closely in the policy review which preceded the 1998 Transport White Paper. In the decade after 1986, operated bus mileage outside London increased overall by 25 per cent. The position necessarily varies from place to place. It is primarily for local authorities, in developing their bus strategies within local transport plans, to assess the adequacy of the bus network and to take appropriate action within the framework of their new powers in the Transport Act 2000. We are making additional funding available through the rural bus grant and the rural and urban bus challenge schemes.</p>

In addition, the FSA advise that the current evidence indicates no increased public health risk from dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls released from foot and mouth pyres for the vast majority of people who consume milk or dairy products produced on land within two kilometres of the pyres. Farmers and their customers who consume milk exclusively from such a source have been advised that there may be a slightly higher, although still very small, additional risk. This advice is precautionary until the results of the FSA's testing programme are available.</p>

In particular, we are aware that the EC has recently been considering written comments made by European Union member states following a meeting of the European Pharmaceutical Committee in April 2001. The detailed terms of various possible provisions to safeguard public health are likely to feature prominently in the ongoing discussions on the draft directive. The Medicines Control Agency will continue to consult the United Kingdom natural health sector as work on this initiative progresses.</p>

	<p pid=".341W.5/1">National health service bursaries provide a level of support which compares favourably with that available to other students in higher education. They will increase by 10.4 per cent. from September 2001. However the level of bursary support is only one factor influencing the recruitment and retention of student nurses.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.5/2">Applicants to pre-registration nursing and midwifery training course increased by 87 per cent. over the last three years, to 34,953 in 1999&ndash;2000, the latest year for which complete data are available.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.5/3">The National Audit Office earlier this year reported that attrition form training was currently 17 per cent., lower than in previous years and in line with attrition from higher education generally. 'Academic failure' was the most common reason for nurses dropping out. The Department has commissioned further research on factors influencing drop out. This will report later in the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".341W.8/1">The current national health service support package available to degree level students comprises 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. student loan. In addition the student's tuition fee contribution is paid in full. This support is more favourable than that available to other United Kingdom students studying at degree level.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.8/2">Students studying at diploma level receive a non- means-tested bursary and have their contribution to tuition fees paid in full. However, because diploma students receive a higher level of non-repayable, non-means-tested support for maintenance than degree students, they are not eligible for assistance through student loans.</p>
	<p pid=".341W.8/3">Student loans are a matter for the Department for Education and Skills and the Student Loans Company. The overall level of support provided to national health service-funded students is kept under review by my Department, taking into account the views of, among others, students themselves, for instance through the NHS Student Forum.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.0/1">The Hospital Discharge Workbook, issued in 1994, gives guidance to the national health service, social services and other agencies on hospital discharge procedures. The workbook emphasises that the patient and carer should be made fully aware of arrangements for discharge and understand fully what is going to happen. Before an individual is discharged, checks should be made by the discharge nurse to ensure that discharge arrangements take place as planned. The chief executive of the hospital trust is responsible for ensuring that discharges take place appropriately. Work will begin soon on revising the hospital discharge workbook.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/2">The NHS Plan acknowledged that health and social services need to do more to shape services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers. During 2002, older people, and where appropriate their carers, will be involved in agreeing a personal care plan, which they will hold. The personal care plan will document their current package of health and social care, their care co-ordinator, monitoring arrangements, and a list of key contacts for rapid response at home and in emergencies.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/3">We are continuing to provide additional resources to local authorities specifically to improve the working arrangements between local authorities and the NHS. The new Promoting Independence Grant is specifically aimed at fostering partnership between health and social services in promoting the independence of adults needing community care services. The grant will encourage these partnerships to improve their arrangements for multi- disciplinary assessment and hospital discharge (including rehabilitation and recuperation services).</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/4">In addition, we have pledged to consider the establishment of a fund to support the development of carers services under the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000. We have already begun preliminary discussions with key stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/5">The performance indicator for the number of informal carers receiving an assessment as a proportion of the total number of clients and carers receiving assessments will be published for the first time in autumn 2001. The indicator is based on information provided by local councils with social services responsibilities. Details of where the assessment took place are not available; therefore, the proportion of carers assessed at the point of hospital discharge can not be separately calculated.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/6">Requirements for Accreditation (RFA99) issued in October 1999 included the requirements for general practitioner computer systems to include a field where the details of carers could be entered. This, aligned with all GPs having access to a desktop computer as part of project connect programme by the end of March 2002, will mean that GPs will be prompted to ask for carer details as part of the registration details of patients. When entered this information will form part of the patient record.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/7">Progress in implementing the national carers strategy is measured against the criteria set out in the National Carers Strategy and summarised on pages 5&ndash;7 of the Strategy. Specific initiatives which take forward the strategy, such as the increases to the Carers Grant, are announced to the House at the appropriate time, and information about the implementation of the measures published as appropriate. For example the analysis which we commissioned from the Kings Fund of local authorities' carers plans for 1999&ndash;2000 was published in February 2001. The social services inspectorate's monitoring of local authorities includes questions regarding the implementation of the national carers strategy. The results will be published in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".346W.2/1">Data on the misuse or overuse of neuroleptic drugs are not available centrally. However, we are well aware of concerns about the use of these drugs in older people. Several current initiatives will help to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.2/2">The National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People, published in March 2001 under section 23(1) of the Care Standards Act 2000, contains a standard for the administration of medicines. This includes requirements to take advice from pharmacists, consult general practitioners and regularly review medication. These standards come into force in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.2/3">The National Service Framework for Older People was also published in March, together with 'Medicines and Older People', covering the implementation of medicines related aspects of the NSF. One of its aims is to ensure that older people gain maximum benefit from their medication and do not suffer unnecessarily from illness caused by excessive or inappropriate consumption of medicines. One of the milestones set in the NSF is that, by April 2002, people over 75 will have their medicines reviewed at least annually, and those taking four or more medicines will have a review six-monthly. And, by 2004, every primary care trust (PCT) will have schemes in place so that older people get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.2/4">Finally, the NHS Plan contains a target that repeat dispensing schemes will be in place nationally by 2004. Together with management of repeat prescribing commissioned locally by PCTs, these schemes will provide further help in avoiding medication problems in older people.</p>

We are also asked to help with repatriations and deportations, to help with searches for missing persons, to visit people detained by local authorities, to visit long-term prisoners and to arrange the deposit of funds (e.g. for prison comforts).

This forms part of the resource accounts preparation, and for the year 2000&ndash;01 will be available this autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.6/1">This Government have been at the forefront of international efforts to bring about good governance, respect for human rights and a return to democracy in Burma. Sanctions have been a significant aspect of this effort. We believe multilateral sanctions are the most effective and we were instrumental last year in securing a strengthening of the EU Common Position on Burma that includes an asset freeze and visa ban for members of the Burmese regime, an arms ban and a ban on non-humanitarian aid. In the UK, this has been implemented through the Burma (Sale, Supply and Export of Goods) (Penalties) Regulation (SI 2000/1408) and Burma (Freezing of Funds) Regulation 2000 (SI 2000/1472) and the Immigration (Designation of Travel Bans) (Amendment) Order 2000. We have given a cautious welcome to recent positive developments in Burma, such as the release of some political prisoners and the lessening of the restrictions on pressure on the National League for Democracy. But we will not soften our position until there is evidence of real change in Burma.</p>

	<p pid=".357W.5/2">Experience since then suggests that parental leave has created fewer practical problems for business than may first have been anticipated, and the time is now right to increase the number of parents who are able to exercise the right.</p>

	<p pid=".359W.11/1">I have discussed missile defence with the US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. I also discussed the subject regularly with his predecessor. I have consistently made it clear that we share US concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and that we will continue to work together to tackle the potential threat with a comprehensive strategy. But it remains the case that the US has not decided how it wishes to proceed with missile defence and has made no request for the use of facilities in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".363W.3/1">Our forward shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy is the largest for many years. We plan to introduce over 30 new ships into service in the next 15&ndash;20 years. This includes two large, more capable carriers due to enter service in 2012 and 2015 respectively, up to 12 new type 45 destroyers due to enter into service from 2007 onwards, and the new future surface combatant class.

	<p pid=".363W.3/2">Our procurement programme also involves major enhancements to our naval support and amphibious capabilities. Two new auxiliary oilers are expected to enter service in 2002 when we will also begin leasing three new offshore patrol vessels. In 2003, we will have two new multi-role survey vessels in service and two new landing platform docks. By 2006, we expect to have four new alternative landing ship logistics in-service.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.3/3">All these vessels will be built in UK yards and this programme provides an excellent opportunity for the British shipbuilding industry.

	<p pid=".364W.6/14">Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) is a new form of reserve service introduced by the Reserve Forces Act 1996. This legislation enables reservists to be employed on a wider variety of tasks than previously. This change has been particularly well received by personnel of the Reserve Forces and is being well used. It should be noted that both members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces, such as the Territorial Army (TA), and members of the Ex-Regular Reserve Forces (i.e. ex-Regulars who have left full-time service) can undertake FTRS.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.6/15">Reservists also contribute to enduring operations such as the Balkans and Sierra Leone by volunteering to be called out for permanent (i.e. mobilised) service, normally six-month tours. At present some 500 reservists are called out into permanent service. Although this further contribution by the Reserve Forces helps to relieve the Regular Forces shortfalls, it is short-term and does not count against the manpower strengths and requirements of the Regular Forces.</p>

	<p pid=".365W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1982-05-04">4 May 1982</phrase>, HMS Sheffield was lost in action in the Falklands with the loss of 20 lives; 26 other members of the crew were injured. Our sympathies of course lie with the survivors from HMS Sheffield and with the families of those who lost their lives or suffered injury. In accordance with normal naval procedures a Board of Inquiry fully investigated the incident. I am confident that the original Board of Inquiry was conducted to the highest professional standards and there would be no useful purpose in reopening this tragic incident.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/2">Following the Board of Inquiry and after giving due consideration to the findings, in September 1982, the then Commander in Chief Fleet concluded that it was not appropriate to take disciplinary action against any member of the crew of HMS Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/3">Much of the information put before the Board of Inquiry was, and remains, highly classified and I am withholding it under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Assess to Government Information which relates to defence, security and international relations.</p>
	<p pid=".365W.2/4">Instructions to the official stenographer would have been recorded in the Transcript of Evidence of the Board of Inquiry, but unfortunately, in the time available, I regret it has not been possible to trace the file containing the Transcript of Evidence. I will write to the hon. Member on that point when I have further information and a copy will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

However, figures from the Energy Saving Trust's Energy Efficiency Advice Centres suggest that 60 per cent. of their customers act in some way to advice given. They estimate that this has resulted in energy savings per home of &pound;26 per year, or around 1,600 kiloWatt hours.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.6/2">As my hon. Friend may know, as part of our proposals to improve the home buying and selling process, the Government propose to require sellers to include an energy efficiency report, prepared by an approved home inspector, in a new seller's pack. The purpose is to put information in the hands of the buyer at the time they are most likely to be taking decisions about expenditure on a property.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.6/3">Assuming that savings are similar to those resulting from advice given by the Advice Centres, we estimate that energy efficiency advice in the seller's pack could save around two TeraWatt hours per year. This is based on around 1.3 million home transactions per year in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.2/2">Carcase disposal has and continues to be defined for official statistics purposes by reference to the date on which disposal was completed. This is reflected in the statistical data published on the DEFRA website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/">http://www.defra.gov.uk/</a>. The only change has been in terms of the time taken to make information available; previously the time lag tended to make the situation appear worse than it was. Systems have been improved so that statistics are now entered much more quickly and give a more accurate picture.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.9/2">The date limit for harvesting potatoes, or other crops, from set-aside land is designed to ensure that farmers cannot receive both an EU payment for taking land out of production and revenue from agricultural operations during the set-aside period. In a normal year any previously planted crops must be harvested by <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-15">15 January</phrase> at the latest in order to comply with this condition, which is laid down in implementing legislation for the EU's Arable Area Payments Scheme. In view of a number of representations from the industry at the time, the UK twice successfully applied to the European Commission to have the date postponed, initially to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> and subsequently to <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-30">30 April</phrase>, in order to allow sufficient time for harvesting to be completed where field conditions resulting from exceptionally wet weather had earlier made this impossible. We also secured a derogation allowing failed crops to be ploughed in at any time before the <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-15">15 May</phrase> claim deadline, without prejudicing eligibility for set-aside payment.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.9/3">Notwithstanding these changes, my predecessor did receive some subsequent representations asking for a further postponement of the harvesting date limit beyond <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-30">30 April</phrase>. The European Commission were not prepared to agree to this, pointing both to the practical difficulties of ensuring that crops harvested so late had genuinely been planted with a view to harvest by <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-15">15 January</phrase>, as normally required, and to the likely condition of such crops after so long in unworkable ground.</p>

	<p pid=".379W.2/2">The EU Employment and Social Policy Council is not seeking to impose a specific limit on tractor use. However, it has been discussing the proposed Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive which would, among other provisions, set a mandatory limit for exposure to whole body vibration. Limiting whole body vibration would affect tractor driving time but the impact will depend on the magnitude of the vibration in individual cases. The Council agreed on a maximum dose of 1.15 metres per second squared (a measure of acceleration) averaged over an 8-hour period for whole body vibration exposure. In the case of tractor use, the impact would vary, depending on factors such as seating and cab design. Under the transition arrangements proposed agriculture would not be required to comply with the whole body vibration limits until 2013.</p>

It also has a contract with the Centre for British Teachers (CfBT) for training in threshold assessment and performance management. The value of these contracts depends on the volume and quality of activity.

	<p pid=".394W.3/1">The latest permanent exclusion figures for 1999&ndash;2000 indicate that exclusions have fallen to around 8,600, nearly a third less than the peak of 12,700 in 1996&ndash;97. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is satisfied that the level of exclusions we have reached is sustainable and, therefore, she does not intend to set fresh exclusion targets for reducing permanent exclusions further. My right hon. Friend has also announced new measures to: change the law on exclusions to reflect the interests of the school community; consult on extending Parenting Orders and maximising support to schools in dealing with disruptive children and violent parents; produce a positive package of preventive action to promote good behaviour; make Admissions Forums, whose role will include the re-integration of excluded pupils, mandatory.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.3/2">We have significantly increased the resources available to schools and local education authorities to tackle poor behaviour and provide education to excluded pupils, from &pound;17 million in 1996&ndash;97 to &pound;131 million in 2000&ndash;01 and again to &pound;174 million this year&mdash;a tenfold increase. Before April 2000 most of this money was held centrally by local authorities to support authority-wide initiatives to tackle poor behaviour and provide education to excluded pupils. For the first time in April 2000 the majority of this funding was devolved directly to schools so that they could decide how best to tackle poor behaviour. Schools have, therefore, benefited by an additional &pound;100 million in 2000&ndash;01 and &pound;126 million this year. Where a child has to be excluded some of the money previously held by local authorities which is now in schools reverts back to the local authority. This money can be used by the authority to provide education outside school or to support a re-integration package at a new school. This procedure follows the principle introduced by the last Conservative Government of money following the excluded pupil. By September 2002 all permanently excluded pupils must be offered full-time education and not the 2&ndash;3 hours per week all too typical in the past.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.6/1">The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development report, &quot;Education at a Glance&quot;, published in June 2001 and based on fieldwork undertaken between 1994 and 1998, notes the relationship between differences in literacy levels and income inequality. The United Kingdom performs better than some of our international competitors, including the United States, but has ground to make up to achieve the higher levels of literacy skills in countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.6/2">The Government have recognised the vital importance to individuals and the economy of improving adult literacy and numeracy. Research suggests that improved literacy and numeracy skills can help people earn up to &pound;50,000 more over their working life. The benefit to society of better skills has been valued at &pound;10 billion a year. Our strategy, &quot;Skills for Life&quot;, launched by the Prime Minister in March, will improve the basic skills of 750,000 adults by 2004. Many of these will come from groups we have prioritised for our support, including the unemployed, those in low-skilled jobs and those living in disadvantaged areas. By helping them improve their literacy and numeracy skills, we aim to create a more prosperous and more equal society. As we set out in the Labour manifesto, this is the first of our 25 steps to a better Britain.</p>

	<p pid=".410W.3/1">We have noted the references in the report to some of the problems faced in considering and applying for Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs). It is to be expected that a new provision will take some time to bed down. We are, nevertheless, conducting a review of these orders to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify best practice. The review should be completed later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".410W.3/2">In the meantime we note from the report that 32 antisocial behaviour orders have been made in the Metropolitan police area between April 1999 and June this year and the very positive message about the benefits of the police working in partnership with local authorities and other agencies to tackle antisocial behaviour. Paragraph 12 of the report states:</p>
	<p pid=".410W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;One of the major achievements of the work on ASBOs has been the obligation and need to work in partnership. [. . .] We are aware of no instances of Metropolitan police service officers failing to co-operate with local authority partners in applying for an ASBO. Quite the contrary, there is considerable evidence of excellent partnership working. Tentative early partnerships are maturing into collaborations with trust and understanding.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".416W.8/4">The Chief Constable informs me that on the basis of its current projections up to March 2003, the force expects to have 3,098 officers by the end of March 2002 and 3,175 by March 2003. About 60 per cent. of the total increase will be a result of the force's Crime Fighting Fund allocation of resources for 51 new recruits for 2001&ndash;02 and 77 for 2002&ndash;03. The force has made no projections as yet for 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".417W.2/2">Information on the number of offenders prosecuted in 1999 for offences of drunkenness per thousand head of population for each police force authority is given in table 1. Information showing, in descending order, the percentage change in the number of offenders prosecuted in 1999 compared with 1990 for offences of drunkenness in each police force authority is given in table 2. It is not possible to say what proportion of those prosecuted live in the area. Prosecutions of people from outside the area are likely to be much higher in some areas than others. This is most obvious for the City of London which has a low resident population and large numbers of visitors.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.3/1">A Home Office-led Strategic Group has been developing guidance and plans for next year's commemoration, building on the successful foundations of the first United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Day last January. The Strategic Group includes representatives from a wide range of Government Departments and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/2">A working group chaired by the Home Office is taking forward the planning and delivery of the 2002 national event, liaising with the BBC who produced and televised the first national ceremony last January.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/3">Updated guidance for local authorities and a wide range of voluntary and community groups on ways they can mark the day is being produced by a working group chaired by the Holocaust Adviser to the Local Government Association and involving a number of representatives of NGOs with experience and expertise in Holocaust remembrance and wider diversity issues.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/4">The Holocaust education resource pack launched last November and intended for use by schools and others is currently being reviewed by a Department for Education and Skills led working group, consisting of NGOs with experience and expertise in Holocaust education and research. Around 30,000 of these well received packs have already been issued to about 23,000 schools.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/5">The Strategic Group is devising a communication strategy for the promotion and delivery of the 2002 commemoration. It is envisaged that there will be a single launch date in September for all Holocaust Memorial Day promotional material. Details of relevant activities and supporting guidance will be placed onto the dedicated website <a href="http://www.holocaustmemorialday.gov.uk">www.holocaustmemorialday.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/6">I would like to encourage all hon. Members to support and encourage activities in their constituencies to mark the 2nd United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Day. The day is relevant to all of us. Its focus is on learning the lessons of the Holocaust and other more recent atrocities that raise similar issues.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.3/7">A key aim of the day is to convey the commemoration's relevance to contemporary issues of racism and victimisation and promote a democratic and tolerant society that respects and celebrates diversity and is free of the evils of prejudice. This will be reflected in all of the related guidance and plans to mark Holocaust Memorial Day next January.</p>

	<p pid=".423W.2/2">The Government are committed to having immigration rules which are clear, firm and fair. We have no immediate plans for legislation but will keep the possible need for further change under review. We want to ensure that those who come and work here continue to make a major contribution to our economic and social life. We have transferred responsibility for the work permit system to the Home Office and will be looking further at the legal entry routes for people seeking to work in Britain. Officials are currently reviewing the Immigration Rules with the aim of producing a consolidated version which incorporates all changes made since HC395, the last main Statement of Changes. These revised Rules are likely to include a number of additions and amendments.</p>

	<p pid=".427W.11/1">The cost of the Quantum project to July 1998 (when it was suspended) was &pound;8.3 million. The procurement recommenced in February 1999 and led to award of contract to Electronic Data Systems (EDS) 12 months later. Initially, EDS took responsibility for all existing Prison Service information technology and telecommunications services. From the recommendations to date, some &pound;44 million has been spent by the Prison Service on Quantum. This includes payments to EDS for the provision of information technology and telecommunications services.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.11/2">Under the terms of the Quantum agreement, EDS is responsible for updating the information technology and telecommunications infrastructure technology and telecommunications infrastructure of the Prison Service. This involves, among other things, installation of standard office computer software and equipment. The new infrastructure will be the technological platform for future business change projects and for delivering the benefits associated with improving efficiency and the quality of information.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.5/1">The Family Policy Unit at the Home Office under Family Support Grant (FSG) funds voluntary sector projects aimed at providing support for parents in their parenting role. Not all projects funded provide parenting classes as it is accepted that some parents prefer other methods, though all the funded work aims at supporting parents in their parenting role. Additionally not all the funded projects provide direct face-to-face services to adults as some like the National Family and Parenting Institute and Parentline Plus have a national role, such as the provision of information or a freephone telephone helpline, while some produce support materials to be used across the voluntary sector.</p>
