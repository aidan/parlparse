The competitive dialogue process is normally used when a specification may be unclear, and ongoing engagement is needed with potential suppliers. In this instance a specification was sufficiently developed and so a competitive dialogue was unnecessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.977W.6/1">The Government's assessment is that current sterling exchange rates will not have significant effects on budgetary provision for the 2012 Olympics. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) receives its revenues, and makes its payments, in sterling. It is the responsibility of the ODA tier one contractors to manage exchange risks as defined by their contractual arrangements with the ODA. The ODA is reviewing the current exchange rate fluctuations with its Delivery Partner and the tier one contractors to assess the level of impact on future procurement. To date, no call has been made on the contingency in relation to exchange rate fluctuations. The contingency (within the &pound;9.325 billion funding package) does, however, include provision for identified risks with the potential to impact on projects across the ODA programme such as exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
	<p pid="a.977W.6/2">The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is due some revenues in both US dollars and euros. As a result, LOCOG has taken steps to effectively minimise exposure to exchange rate shifts and it is expected that recent movements in both currencies against sterling will have no significant impact on LOCOG's revenues. As the majority of LOCOG's costs are sterling-based, it is expected that recent movements in both currencies against sterling will have no significant impact on LOCOG's costs.</p>

NRE is the partnership, which includes representation from both Peterborough city council and Cambridge county council, set up to provide strategic direction and support to county level working groups to take forward relevant and appropriate activity to maximise the benefits of 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.977W.9/5">I am delighted to say that progress on legacy in the east of England and Peterborough is already being made. For example, of the 48 local authorities in the east of England, 26 are offering free swimming to both those aged 16 or under and 60 or over (including Peterborough). 65 facilities from the east of England, including Grange Farm Equestrian Centre in Peterborough are included in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide; 22 events took place in the region during the Cultural Olympiad 'Open Weekend' and 60 special 'handover flags' were raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.977W.9/6">Furthermore, 353 schools and colleges covering 220,507 students in the east of England have registered on 'Get Set', the London 2012 education programme launched in September last year. Get Set provides a whole range of flexible, interactive learning resources and is designed to give expression to Olympic and Paralympic values.</p>

	<p pid="a.983W.3/2">The Government and a number of other bodies have undertaken work on various aspects of digital and media literacy. In the Communications Act 2003, we gave Ofcom a statutory duty to work with others to promote media literacy in the UK. My Department works closely with Ofcom on its media literacy priorities and contributes annual funding to Ofcom's work in this area, which includes the periodic audit of changes in media literacy skills across the UK. Their audit has demonstrated that progress has been made, but we recognise that there is more work to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.3/3">The new BBC Charter and Agreement also places a specific duty on the BBC Trust to promote media literacy. Furthermore, a wide range of activity is being undertaken by both education providers and industry&mdash;such as the Media Literacy Task Force&mdash;aimed at increasing levels of media literacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.3/4">In addition, the Government have set out a range of cross-departmental strategies that will further enhance media literacy. The Prime Minister has appointed my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales as Minister for Digital Inclusion and he has recently consulted on a Digital Inclusion Action Plan, aimed at improving access and skills to encourage the best use of digital technologies, building on the success of the 6,000 UK online centres in England. Furthermore, as one of the key recommendations from the Byron Review on internet safety, we have established the UK Council for Child Internet Safety which is developing a strategy including education and awareness for parents, carers and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.3/5">The interim Digital Britain report (Cm 7548) identifies the skills and literacy challenges to a fully digital Britain. We have therefore asked Ofcom to make an assessment of its current responsibilities in relation to media literacy and, working with the BBC and others, to recommend a new definition and ambition for a National Media Literacy Plan as a contribution to the final Digital Britain Report in the summer.</p>

As you know, we have always found it difficult, given the scale and complexity of the material with which we are dealing, to predict accurately how long it will take us to complete our task.

	<p pid="a.993W.5/1">In a statement to this House on <phrase class="date" code="1998-01-29">29 January 1998</phrase>, the then Prime Minister set out his intention to establish the inquiry into Bloody Sunday and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;It is not possible to say now exactly how long the Inquiry will take but it should be allowed the time necessary to cover all the evidence now available thoroughly and completely.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.5/3">At this early stage, there was limited information on which to base projections of the likely total cost. The inquiry initially anticipated that its work would last about two years and &pound;11 million was allocated for this in the Government spending review. However the unprecedented scale of the inquiry was not predicted, in terms of number of witnesses identified and available to give oral evidence, the number of legal challenges, and the ensuing increase in legal costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.5/4">At this late stage in the inquiry's lifespan, future spend is for the most part limited to running costs and the final total is therefore easier to predict with more certainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.2/5">The Horizonte project became operational and started generating electricity in 2004. The wind farm consists of eight turbines of 600 kW each for a total generation capacity of 4.8 MW. The project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by substitution of energy from fossil fuel power plants as it generates electricity with clean wind energy. Energy from the plant is sold to the Brazilian South-Southeast-Midwest Grid.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.2/8" class="indent">Location: India</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.2/9">The project installed a 6 MW biomass-fired power plant that utilises surplus biomass waste residues usually burnt in the local area. The electricity generated by the project is sold to the grid, reducing reliance on fossil fuel power generation as well as creating benefits and job opportunities to the local community. The project reduces local pollution by avoiding uncontrolled burning of waste in the fields.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.2/12" class="indent">Location: Brazil</p>
	<p pid="a.996W.2/13">This project increases the energy efficiency of bagasse cogeneration at Cuca sugar mill through the installation of more efficient boilers. The project also allows the mill to increase the steam efficiency in the sugar and alcohol production processes. Cuca is thus able to generate surplus steam and use it exclusively for electricity production. This electricity is then sold into the national grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of energy generated from fossil fuel-fired thermal plants.</p>

Resolution of the issue of liability for these cases is subject to the outcome of the trial of a sample of four cases, due to be heard in November 2009.

We are also talking about how we can make sure that IRENA works closely with, and avoids overlap and duplication with, other international bodies and organisations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership (REEEP), of which the UK is already a member.</p>

Provisions like that section are commonly included in Bills, and therefore in Acts of Parliament, without any intention that they should have a substantive legal effect. The explanation for their inclusion relates to the procedure of the House of Commons where a provision of a Bill introduced in that House may give rise to public expenditure. This is not a matter that is specific to the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, but raises wider issues relating to parliamentary procedure and Bill drafting practice generally.

Access through crossings between Gaza and Israel remains severely restricted although some deliveries of emergency food aid, medicines and medical supplies have been allowed in but is not adequate to fully meet the needs of the population.

The UK will continue to meet needs through our five year &pound;100 million commitment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. We also provide funding through the European Community's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) which has allocated &euro;3 million for urgent humanitarian relief work in Gaza, of which the UK contributes about 16 per cent.

	<p pid="a.1009W.3/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) programme in Zimbabwe is focused on providing immediate humanitarian support and broader livelihoods assistance to meet the essential needs of the people of Zimbabwe. This year we have provided: &pound;9 million to the World Food programme for food aid; &pound;10 million to support the growing season; and &pound;9 million to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. We also recently made &pound;10 million available to tackle the cholera outbreak and support life-saving essential health systems. The UK is one of the largest donors giving &pound;45 million last year in aid. We anticipate a total spend of &pound;47 million this financial year across these areas of life-saving need. Our aid is channelled through the UN and NGOs and not the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009W.3/2">We anticipate the need for sustained large-scale humanitarian support from the international community for the foreseeable future and we are monitoring the situation very closely. However, a sustainable and credible political solution is required to really address Zimbabwe's problems. In principle, we are ready to support economic and social recovery in Zimbabwe but the nature of our support will be contingent on a new administration's commitment to change, including: commitment to macroeconomic stabilisation; restoration of the rule of law; commitment to democracy and respect for human rights and full humanitarian access.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.6/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010W.6/6" class="indent">What the average amount of child maintenance arrears outstanding was on all Child Support Agency cases with maintenance outstanding in each month since May 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.6/7" class="indent">The analysis required to respond to your questions is only available on information held from March 2007. Such information as is currently available is provided in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.6/8" class="indent">It should be noted that the majority of child maintenance cases will have some debt. In particular all new cases will accrue debt unless the non-resident parent provides support while the liability is being assessed. In addition around a third of non-resident parents fail to regularly pay the maintenance they should and this debt will continue to accrue. Therefore where there are maintenance arrears the average amount owed to parents with care is around &pound;2,600, although in fact around a quarter of all cases with arrears owe less than &pound;170 or less than two monthly maintenance payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.6/9" class="indent">In the twelve months to September 2008 the Agency collected &pound;1,088 million in child maintenance, of which &pound;149 million was arrears. In the month of September 2008 alone, the Agency collected or arranged &pound;98.7 million in maintenance of which &pound;14.6 million was arrears. This is the highest level of maintenance and arrears collected or arranged by the Agency in one month ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010W.6/10" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act strengthens the range of enforcement and debt management powers available to the new Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. These will be used to enable the Commission to more effectively recover outstanding debt.</p>

	<p pid="a.1013W.0/21">As part of the Department's programme to bring increased focus to the management and recovery of debt generally, the decision was made to transfer the management and recovery of social fund off-benefit cases to the Department's specialist Debt Management unit. This commenced in 2005. Referring the outstanding social fund loans to Debt Management has enabled the use of their specialist skills in pursuing recovery from customers who are no longer in receipt of benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.0/22">This transfer of cases to Debt Management has already resulted in significant recoveries on loans from those no longer in receipt of benefit, without a need to refer for court enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018W.0/1">In cases where there is an overpayment of benefit outstanding, court action is only taken against those no longer receiving benefits. Such action is taken only should a voluntary arrangement not be possible, or if there is a default on that arrangement.

	<p pid="a.1018W.0/5" class="indent">The action the Department takes in county courts to recover overpayments of benefit is to seek an Order for Recovery of Money Awarded by a Tribunal. This does not result in a county court judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/6" class="indent">Between 2005 and 2008, no civil action in county courts was initiated by the Department in cases of this type. During this period, resources were concentrated on establishing the newly created Debt Management unit, with new processes, a new structure and new IT. This succeeded in increasing the total amount recovered from &pound;180 million in 2005 to 2006, to just under &pound;272 million in 2007 to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/7" class="indent">Some limited court action was taken by the Department's private sector partners during this period. They obtained charging orders in nine high value overpayment cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/8" class="indent">The Department recommenced county court action in overpayment cases from January 2008, and during 2008 1,700 orders were sought from the court. Information relating to the breakdown between benefits is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/9" class="indent">Information for the period prior to 2005 is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/10" class="italic"> 2. Where recovery is sought from a n estate of a deceased customer:</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/11" class="indent">In cases where there is an overpayment outstanding at a customer's death, or where an overpayment is identified after death based on information that comes to light after death, such as undeclared occupational pensions or under declared savings, recovery is sought from the estate. In certain cases, where repayment is not made, the Department may take the executor to the county court on the basis of maladministration of the estate. Such actions can result in county court judgments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018W.0/12" class="indent">The Department does not take action through the court to pursue recovery of overpayments arising as a result of a payment made directly into a bank account after death.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.2/1">Unfortunately, through no fault of any individual, overpayments of benefit can arise following the death of a benefit recipient. Such overpayments normally arise as a result of the Department being notified of the death too late to stop an automated payment being made into the deceased's account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/2">We are doing all we can to improve the current process. We now receive electronic notifications of death from the Office for National Statistics on a daily basis. This will assist in enabling a prompt cessation of payments following death and reduce the number of these overpayments occurring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/3">The Department has a duty to seek recovery of all overpaid funds where it is reasonable and cost effective to do so. However, we seek to do this as sensitively as possible, taking account of the fact that this will be a stressful time, particularly if the person contacted is a close friend or family member. Overpayments are written off if the deceased has no estate or there are insufficient funds in the estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019W.2/4">The Department does not have records to answer all the questions in the format asked. However, we do have data on the value and volume of cases of overpayments where recovery has been made, and data on those that have been written off. The details are in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.1040W.5/1">Each local area is responsible for setting up and managing its own multi-agency team to tackle antisocial behaviour (ASB). In doing so, it establishes its own priorities according to local needs. In some areas the lead agency is the police while in others it is the local authority. But all local agencies need to work together if anti-social-behaviour is to be tackled effectively and the police service has a key role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.5/2">The Government have provided practitioners with a toolkit of enforcement and support tools to tackle antisocial behaviour which they operate according to local priorities. And we know that they are using them. The latest Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) survey of tools and powers shows that between October 2003 and September 2007, CDRPs have:</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.5/3" class="indent">Issued more than 30,000 Acceptable Behaviour Contracts,</p>

	<p pid="a.1040W.5/6" class="indent">Made 12,675 antisocial behaviour orders (between October 2003 and December 2006; court data)</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.5/7">Three independent reports including the Home Affairs Select Committee report (2005), the Audit Commission report (May 2006) and the NAO report (December 2006) confirmed that our approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is working.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.2/1">Our approach is to provide parents with positive support and guidance to help them manage their children's behaviour more effectively. This includes making parenting classes more widely available to help give parents the confidence to use other, better means of disciplining their children than physical punishment. This approach works with parents and not against them. We are pleased that parents' attitudes towards smacking have been changing over time; this was the finding of the parental survey conducted in 2007 as part of the review of section 58 of the Children Act 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.5/2">We take the issue of safety on the internet very seriously. That is why we asked Dr. Tanya Byron to lead an independent review on potential risks online and in video games&mdash;and we have fully accepted all her recommendations, including those on the needs for vulnerable groups. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/3" class="indent">encouraging content hosts and search providers work with the relevant charities to make sure that advertisements with links to support services are displayed whenever users discuss or search for information about harmful behaviours;</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/4" class="indent">encouraging content hosts to work with charities to improve moderation practices around discussions about harmful behaviours; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/5" class="indent">targeted communications to raise awareness of internet content issues amongst those who work with vulnerable children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/6">The UK Council for Child Internet Safety, a multi stakeholder forum was launched in September 2008 to implement the Byron recommendations. Its work will lead to the publication of a Child Internet Safety Strategy later this year that will contain specific measures to make the internet a safer place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/7">We are also working with the Department of Health to implement the recommendations of the report of the independent review of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, 'Children and Young People in Mind', published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-18">18 November</phrase>. We have set up a National Advisory Council for children's mental health and psychological wellbeing to advise us on implementing the recommendations of the independent review of CAMHS final report and hold us to account on progress. Better access to specialist services for children, young people and families is a priority area for the implementation of the CAMHS review's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.5/8">In addition, the Department of Health announced in October 2008 a &pound;170 million expansion of psychological therapies to provide better support for people with common mental health problems such as eating disorders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.8/1">There is no requirement that Sure Start Children's Centres become self-sustaining by 2011. Integrated early learning and day care, which is a key part of the offer in children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas and optional elsewhere, is the only service which is intended to become self-sustaining. The Department's Phase 3 Sure Start Children's Centres planning and delivery guidance states that this is to run on business lines once it is established. Local authorities are accountable, through their sufficiency duties, to ensure there is appropriate provision to meet local needs.</p>

As the DSG is distributed through a single guaranteed unit of funding per pupil and is distributed from central government to local government, a primary/secondary split on a central to local government basis is not available.

	<p pid="a.1065W.2/1">No recent assessment has been made. The framework for the early years foundation Stage (EYFS) introduced in September 2008 requires staff to have the right language skills to support children from birth to five to develop communication skills in English and to help ensure that their welfare needs are protected. The requirements for providers working with older children set proportions for the number of staff required to hold level 2 and 3 qualifications in an area of work relevant to child care (and the common core skills for the voluntary part of the Childcare Register). As part of the requirements candidates need to demonstrate competence in English. Ofsted inspects providers against these requirements. The requirements on settings are designed to help ensure effective standards of communication in settings and to enable parents to choose providers who also speak their home language.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072W.11/1">The current economic situation means that it is imperative to ensure young people gain the skills and qualifications they need to succeed in employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.11/2">Local Connexions services have a key role in supporting all young people aged 13-19. They rigorously track young people's activities so that they can provide targeted support to those young people who are in danger of becoming unemployed and those not currently in education, employment or training. They also provide tailored information, advice and guidance, supporting these young people to reengage in learning or work as early as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.11/3">In 2008, we extended the September Guarantee to 17-year-olds for the first time. The guarantee aims to provide all 17-year-olds with a suitable offer of a place in learning by the end of September. Almost 80 per cent. of those young people who had been engaged on a short course, or who were NEET, received an offer under the guarantee last year. The guarantee will help to ensure that all young people aged 17 have a suitable learning place by the end of September and prevent them from becoming unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.11/4">Funding for apprenticeships across all ages is planned to increase by almost a quarter between 2007-08 and 2010-11, to over &pound;1.1 billion. In addition we have recently announced our intention to invest an extra &pound;140 million to deliver an additional 35,000 apprentices in both the public and private sectors in order to strengthen the country's competitiveness and match young people's demand. We have also introduced a number of flexibilities to help apprentices who face redundancy. As part of this work apprentices who are made redundant within the final six months of their apprenticeship will now be able to finish their training and gain a qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072W.11/5">We have been working closely with colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions to increase the level of support available to 18-year-olds who are unemployed. From April 2009, 18-year-old jobseekers who have spent a 26 week period NEET will receive mandatory early entry to intensive jobsearch support to enable them to enter sustainable employment faster. This system has been in place on a voluntary basis since April 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.3/2">DEFRA is currently undertaking a review of all permit exemptions, including those that apply to agricultural waste, and in the consultation document on that review it is proposed to introduce a charge for the registration of exemptions of &pound;50 every three years.

Surveillance schemes may include annual or periodic assessment of population size and distribution, and allow trends in both to be derived. Schemes are tailored to provide comprehensive coverage of common and rare species in both breeding and non-breeding seasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.6/2">In addition to the monitoring of wild birds, Animal Health's Wildlife and Registration Service, who are the regulatory authority for bird registration, has a compliance monitoring plan in place to reduce the potential for criminality relating to the bird registration scheme. The Animal Health team work closely with the National Wildlife Unit and other UK Law Enforcement Agencies and have a jointly agreed set of national priorities which they work to. Any future change in priorities with regard to bird of prey issues, including taking from the wild and persecution, would be considered and work aligned to this. This will enable more consistency and coordination between Animal Health and enforcement agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1074W.9/2">Responsibility for licensing veterinary medicines in the UK, including Bluetongue vaccine, rests with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). In licensing a product, the VMD assesses data on safety, quality and efficacy on all species for which the vaccine is intended (in this case cattle and sheep), and establishes whether the advantages and efficacy of the product outweigh any risks in deciding whether to issue a Marketing Authorisation. Once a product has been marketed the VMD monitors its safety and efficacy through reports of suspected adverse reactions, and through on-going data requirements from the authorisation holder.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.9/3">Sales data from the supply chain suggests enough vaccine was sold in 2008 in the South and East of England, where Bluetongue serotype 8 was circulating in 2007, to vaccinate over 90 per cent. of the susceptible animal population. Experts at the Institute for Animal Health advise that this level of vaccination in previously affected counties was effective in controlling BTV-8 and its possible spread to the rest, of the country. No circulating disease was detected in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1081W.6/2">Officials meet representatives from the National Farmers' Union frequently, both individually and in the context of discussions with other stakeholders, and at national and local levels. These discussions sometimes focus specifically on food security, such as the workshops held in September and November 2008, based on the discussion paper &quot;Ensuring the UK's Food Security in a Changing World&quot;, published in July last year. However, the issue of food security is also addressed in the context of broader discussions about the Department's strategic objectives, such as achieving a sustainable, secure and healthy food supply and a thriving farming and food sector. It is therefore not possible to provide a specific number of occasions when the topic has been discussed.</p>

Horse passports are an EU requirement introduced to prevent contaminated meat from entering the human food chain. Passports are also intended to reduce fraud and aid disease control and surveillance. The Meat Hygiene Service play an important role in ensuring that the horse is correctly identified and its passport is in order before horses are accepted for slaughter for human consumption. Samples are taken from a small number of horses entering the food chain as part of the UK statutory surveillance programme checking the appropriate use of veterinary medicinal products. In cases of non-compliance the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which operates this programme, requires an investigation to be carried out which involves checking the details on the passport of the animal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1084W.9/1">Northern Ireland Ministers have worked with other UK Ministers throughout the development of the proposals in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, most recently through the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) which held its plenary meeting in June 2008 when the draft Bill was discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.9/2">Northern Ireland is fully committed to the policy aims underpinning the draft UK Bill in order to introduce a new framework for the marine environment based on sustainable development principles, which will work towards delivering clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas. Ministers have also taken part in discussions on the Legislative Consent Motion needed from the Northern Ireland Assembly on certain measures in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.9/3">The JMC announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-27">27 November 2008</phrase> that the UK Government and devolved Administrations, including Northern Ireland, had reached agreement on a UK-wide approach to marine planning. This provides a coherent legislative framework with greater clarity and certainty for all those seeking to enjoy, or make a living from, the UK's waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.9/4">In addition, the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive work together as part of the British-Irish Council Environment Group which discussed marine issues at its last meeting in February 2008. Officials from the UK Government and the devolved Administrations continue to work together on the UK Bill and the expected Northern Ireland Assembly Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.8/1">We received over 600 responses to the consultation on proposals to revise the Nitrates Regulations. Since the consultation closed in December, representations have continued to be received from the farming sector. The proposals were also the subject of an inquiry by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.8/2">I recognise that some farmers in nitrate vulnerable zones will face costs when implementing the new rules established by the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008. By way of mitigation, we are applying to the European Commission for a derogation from one of the most costly new rules, the livestock manure N farm limit. If this application is successful, costs to eligible dairy farmers would be significantly reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.8/3">In addition, a package of advice and support, including a technical helpline, comprehensive guidance material, information events and practical workshops, is currently being rolled out nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.8/4">There are a number of existing potential sources of financial support available to farmers which could be used to help with implementation of the Action Programme measures. For example, funding through the Rural Development Programme for England&mdash;which is being administered by the Regional Development Agencies&mdash;could be used to support on-farm capital investments for modernising farm holdings, structures and equipment in a manner that will improve the management of manure and nutrients including, for example, the development of anaerobic digestion facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.8/5">Furthermore, slurry storage facilities are eligible for plant and machinery allowances such as the new annual investment allowance, capped at &pound;50,000 per year. Slurry pits also qualify for allowances in their own right under the Capital Allowances Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.8/6">For farmers who have land in a priority catchment, the England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative is operating a capital grant scheme under which part-funding may be available for items such as roofs for slurry stores and for improving yard drainage (clean and foul water separation).</p>

In 2000, 5.2 per cent. of 'agricultural' holders were under 35 years old compared to 7.4 per cent. in 1990. Between 1999 and 2004, the entry rate was 2 per cent. of farming population and the exit rate 18 per cent., mainly because of a decline in the total number of farmers and farm businesses. The report identified no evidence of major barriers to entry that justified policy intervention and no evidence of significant market failure in the processes of entry to and exit from farming. The research found that entry and exit decisions are rational and driven by strong market forces and personal motivations and that financial inducement to affect the rate of entry or exit would be expensive and ineffectual. Any use of financial incentives to facilitate entry to and exit from farming risks &quot;deadweight&quot; i.e. that many would enter farming in any case&mdash;the majority of those entering farming do so through the family farm. The most common reason given for the low rate of entry to farming was the expectation of relatively low incomes. This cannot be addressed through a start up grant as envisaged in the Rural Development Regulation but rather by developing a competitive, viable and sustainable farming sector. DEFRA is supporting the industry-led initiative 'Fresh Start' which encourages new entrants into farming whilst at the same time stimulating existing farmers to think how they will respond to CAP reform, such as expanding their business, diversifying or even retiring. Such choices create opportunities for new entrants.</td> </tr>

However, the same legislation requires a voluntary approach to be taken to ensuring the positive management of these sites wherever possible. The voluntary approach has been taken because of the difficulty of imposing complex positive management, which arises because the co-operation of the land manager is extremely important to the success of such management. Reserve powers to require specific positive management are available, but are very seldom used.

For example, State Veterinary Service inspections carried out in 2005 demonstrated that for randomly inspected farms (programmed and elective visits) nearly 80 per cent. comply with both legislation and voluntary codes of practice. As the European Commission noted in 2002, &quot;research has shown that both farm animal welfare and product quality improves when the people who care for, transport and handle the animals are well-trained, have a positive attitude towards their jobs and the animals, treat the animals with care, and are attentive to their needs. It is therefore important to educate and inform these professionals&quot;. It is felt that this strikes the right note and properly records the importance of extending good animal health and welfare beyond the farm gate. Ongoing payments for animal welfare (normally for between five and seven years under the Regulation) would not be the most effective way of delivering animal health and welfare outcomes in England, and in particular would represent a significant diversion of funds away from other priorities.

On the basis of our provisional timetable, stage 1 will be published in spring 2009 and stage 2 by the end of 2009. Both consultations will be for 12-week periods and will be carried out in line with the principles in the Government's &quot;Code of Practice on Consultation&quot; (July 2008).</p>

Working with ConstructionSkills and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) we have established a matching service to help apprentices in the construction sector at risk of redundancy to find alternative employment and to complete their apprenticeship. More generally, providers and the LSC have procedures to advise and relocate apprentices, in cases where providers or employers fail, to help ensure that they are able to continue in work and complete their apprenticeship. The &pound;140 million package announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last week for an additional 35,000 apprenticeship places will help fund new provision in both the public sector and private sector, and will extend the opportunities available to people facing redundancy. This package will further boost the number of people starting an apprenticeship which has increased from 65,000 in 1996/97 to 225,000 last year and further improve the completion rate which rose to an all-time high of 64 per cent. in 2007/08.</p>

	<p pid="a.1104W.2/1">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) introduced its star rating system in May 2008 to enable commissioners and users of services and the public to see whether CSCI judges a care service to be excellent, good, adequate or poor. Star ratings are based on the results of CSCI inspections of services against the relevant regulations and national minimum standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.2/2">The Department has not issued guidance to local authorities on incentives to care homes to achieve higher quality ratings. However, we expect local authorities to commission high quality services and would, therefore, anticipate that care homes which are rated as good or excellent will be more likely to attract local authorities' business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.2/3">Fees paid by local authorities for care are for local negotiation. Information on whether councils make special payments to care homes which are awarded three stars by CSCI is not collected centrally.</p>

A copy of the document has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.5/2">It stated that all children and young people with diabetes should have access to a Children and Young Person Specialist Diabetes (CYPSD) team with appropriate training and competencies; routine care, continuing care and annual assessment; and access to routine and integrated psychological support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.5/3">A Children and Young People Diabetes Implementation Support Group has been set up to take forward work on the report's recommendations. The group is chaired by the National Clinical Director for Children, Dr. Sheila Shribman, and includes representation from Diabetes UK, Royal Colleges, young people with diabetes, parents and representatives from organisations with an interest in this area, including the Healthcare Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.5/4">One of the obligations of the group is to raise the profile of quality care for children and young people with diabetes across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.5/5">It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) and trusts to take forward implementation locally. One example of this is Middlesbrough PCT which has in place a multi-disciplinary team currently providing a service for some 140 children with diabetes. The PCT is developing closer ties with partners in education to develop protocols for use in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.2/1">The Department consider that the rise in the number of confirmed cases of measles in children under 18 years of age in both London and the rest of England is a result of a decade of relatively low measles, mumps and rubella vaccination uptake. The potential exposure of a large number of unprotected children to the measles virus, means that there is a real risk of a large measles epidemic.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.5/1">The way to reduce the number of confirmed cases of measles recorded each year is to increase the number of children vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/2">Childhood immunisation is a 'tier 2 Vital Sign' which means it is a NHS priority. As such, primary care trusts (PCTs) must set targets to improve vaccination uptake and agree these with their strategic health authorities (SHAs). The SHAs, with the help of the Department, monitor the PCTs against these targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/3">In addition to the routine MMR vaccination programme, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-06">6 August</phrase> the Department launched a MMR vaccine catchup campaign. The aim of the campaign is to immunise all children between one and 18 years of age who are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated with MMR vaccine. The Department has secured additional MMR vaccine that is supplied free of charge to all PCTs. Over &pound;5 million has been transferred to PCTs to help support this programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/4">Recently the Department sent all general practitioners (GPs) surgeries new measles leaflets and posters and updated its immunisation website to launch the MMR campaign with a new measles landing page including press lines and questions and answers for PCTs to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/5">PCTs have also received multiple alerts through various Departmental communications including the PCT Chief Executives bulletin 'the week', 'GP bulletin', 'Vaccine Update' newsletter and the Chief Medical Officer's Winter Update newsletter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/6">A public relations campaign is planned to start in late February to support the MMR vaccination.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/7">We also underlined our commitment to immunisation by stating that immunisation is a 'right' in the NHS constitution.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.2/1">The Department is not aware of any overseas organisations that have contracts to provide services to national health service patients which have been indicted for defrauding taxpayers, patients or clinicians in their own country. This is because the Department does not centrally collect details of arrangements entered into by local NHS organisations with overseas organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.2/2">In terms of central procurements, while the Department's commercial directorate has contracted with the United Kingdom subsidiaries of a number of overseas health care organisations, it is not aware of any instances where these UK suppliers have been indicted for fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.2/3">In purchasing goods and services for the NHS, the Department is subject to all European Union (EU) public procurement regulations. The regulations require that as part of due diligence, all participating organisations must complete a pre-qualification questionnaire to ensure that they are suitable to play a role in the NHS. Under the EU procurement guidelines, public bodies are required to exclude a company that has been convicted of a criminal offence or grave professional misconduct in relation to the conduct of their business. The various offences leading to mandatory exclusion are listed in regulation 23 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2006. The mandatory exclusion does not relate to parent companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.5/1">As with all vaccines, clear factual information on the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is available from our information resources, such as leaflets, factsheets and the immunisation website, and through health professions working in primary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.5/2">In 2004 the Department collaborated with NHS London on their 'MMR capital catch-up' campaign. In August 2008 the Department issued guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on what actions should be taken to improve MMR uptake in their area. This initiative was supported by an information leaflet and surgery poster and on-line with a question and answer, 'Big facts' sheet and a measles infection timeline.

	<p pid="a.1119W.3/20">The CAA's Airworthiness Division also carried out approximately 900 safety inspections on UK registered aircraft during 2008. These inspections were carried out at maintenance organisations as well as at airports and formed part of a pre-planned monitoring programme that is applied to each UK aircraft owner or operator. The inspections varied in depth and scope between a simple 'in service' ramp inspection through to a more in depth inspection during maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.3/21">In addition, the CAA's Flight Operations Division has a system of planned audits of UK commercial operators which includes inspections of aeroplanes at airports. There were approximately 129 such inspections evenly spread throughout 2008. A further 20 inspections were specifically conducted on UK cargo aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.3/22">Details of these inspections are not recorded centrally and therefore providing either an exact number of inspections or the months in which they took place would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.3/23">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency carries out inspections to check safety standards and living conditions on UK and dependent territory ships, as well as port state control inspections for foreign ships visiting UK ports.

As part of the certification process the CAA had consulted the Spanish authorities on the differences between the Spanish and UK airworthiness codes for gyroplanes. Significant differences between the codes were identified. As a result, the CAA have been involved in discussions with the Spanish authorities and ELA, the manufacturer, of the gyroplane, with a view to agreeing and approving the modification necessary to meet the UK requirements. The CAA last met with the Spanish authorities and the manufacturer in October 2008. All of the follow up action from that meeting rests with ELA. ELA has requested the CAA not to do any additional work on the validation until ELA and the Spanish authorities have agreed the way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.1121W.9/1">Crossrail, in common with all other major projects, has been the subject of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. A significant part of this was the investigation of archaeological remains, including burial grounds, along the route. This investigation was carried out by the Museum of London Archaeological Services. Although there are a number of burial grounds on the route, this is not generally an issue where the running tunnels are at some depth underground. There are issues, however, at the stations where excavation must of necessity be carried out from ground level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.9/2">Only one site was identified where this issue may arise. This is at the eastern end of the Farringdon station adjacent to the eastern end of the Smithfield meat market. A trial pit will be excavated as soon as Crossrail has obtained possession of the site, and the appropriate testing will be carried out. The techniques for dealing with these matters are well understood by archaeologists and the necessary specialist advice will be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.9/3">This matter was discussed at some length in the House of Lords Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill and subsequently with Lord James of Blackheath who was a member of the Committee. In the event that any contaminated remains are found these will be dealt with in the appropriate manner as set out in guidance from Government, English Heritage and the ecclesiastical authorities.</p>

The Government envisage that the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) will be established and able to start giving advice to potential applicants this autumn and ready to begin receiving applications from spring 2010. Whether or not the IPC would act as the decision maker on such an application is also dependent on the availability of a designated national policy statement on airports, which is planned for publication in draft by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1134W.8/2"><i> </i>Current legislation requires compulsory motor insurance against third party risk for the use of a vehicle on a road or other public place. There is no statutory requirement to insure vehicles in private storage or under repair and declared under statutory off-road notification (SORN).</p>
	<p pid="a.1134W.8/3">We are consulting on proposals for a &quot;Continuous Insurance Enforcement&quot; scheme. Under the proposed scheme it would be an offence to keep a vehicle which has no valid insurance unless there is in place a valid SORN declaration. Those potentially uninsured will be identified by frequent comparison of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's vehicle register and the motor insurance industry's database.</p>

Permitted development rights do not apply where a building has become unsafe or otherwise uninhabitable by deliberate action or neglect by the owner, so planning permission is necessary in such circumstances. Where the demolition of a building is required as part of a redevelopment for which planning permission is sought, details of the demolition should be included in the planning application, and any planning permission granted for the development should include permission to demolish the building. The demolition of listed buildings, buildings in conservation areas, and buildings designated as scheduled monuments, is not classed as development but is subject to consent under separate consent regimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.2/2">Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) introduced in 1978, is not a payment but a scheme to protect the future state pension entitlement of parents and other carers who are not in paid employment or who do not earn enough to gain a qualifying year for state pension through national insurance contributions. It works by taking away years of caring responsibilities from the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension. Since 2002, it has also given entitlement to additional state pension in some circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.2/3">Over 99 per cent. of people become eligible for Home Responsibilities Protection automatically through the award of child benefit for a child under 16. Most people who satisfy the conditions for receiving HRP as a carer for a disabled person also satisfy the conditions for carer's allowance as these are very similar. Since recipients of carer's allowance are credited with national insurance contributions, they do not normally need HRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.2/4">There is publicity about HRP in a variety of leaflets concerning pensions and carers available in Jobcentre Plus offices, from the Pension, Disability and Carers Service and other outlets and on Government websites to alert the remaining carers to the need to make an application. Deficiency Notices issued by HMRC following the end of a tax year in which people have not gained a qualifying year for pension purposes also give advice about HRP and credits. There was an extensive national publicity campaign in early 2006 to make carers aware that they might need to apply for HRP in order to gain additional state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.2/5">The Pensions Act 2007 introduced a comprehensive package of reforms to help more carers build better pensions. These include the replacement of HRP with a system of weekly national insurance credits for parents and carers which will build up entitlement to basic and additional state pension and will extend pension protection to persons undertaking lower levels of caring. We are working to ensure that people are aware of the whole package of state pension reforms we will introduce from 2010. We want to reach all those who may be entitled to the new credits whether they have been in contact with the benefit system or not and will continue to work with interested parties to determine how best we deliver it.</p>

There are no plans to issue further policy or guidance. In order to provide information about what surplus public sector sites are available for development the Homes and Communities Agency is proposing to establish a small sites programme whereby developers and self-builders will be made aware about the release of former public sector sites on to the market. This programme is not yet fully developed but in advance of this details for some small sites to be auctioned in mid February by the Homes and Communities Agency will be released on their website shortly. Details of small sites recently taken to the market by the Homes and Communities Agency's predecessor, English Partnership, can be accessed through this web address:</p>

	<p pid="a.1156W.6/1">The Government's White Paper on Energy &quot;Meeting the Energy Challenge&quot; (2007) indicates that making best use of UK Energy resources, including coal reserves, where it is economically viable and environmentally acceptable to do so, contributes to the Government's goal of security of energy supplies. Planning Policy for coal extraction in England (whether open cast or deep mine) is set out in Minerals Policy Guidance Note 3 &quot;Coal Mining and Colliery Spoil Disposal&quot; (MPG3) published in 1999. Consistent with the broader policy in the White Paper, this sets a presumption against such development unless the proposal meets specific tests in terms of environmental acceptability or the provision of local and community benefits which clearly outweigh the likely impacts. The Government believe that these tests are sufficient to ensure that the environmental effects of opencast coal mining are properly considered in the planning process. There is no current intention to review policy in MPG3.</p>

	<p pid="a.1159W.3/1">Ministers and officials have been meeting housing associations and the National Housing Federation to discuss provision of affordable housing in the current housing market downturn, including the impact of a potential downturn on section 106 activity. In response, we have taken a number of steps to encourage delivery including allowing the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) increased flexibility on levels of grant funding to support development. The HCA will assess each bid on a case by case basis to ensure it meets its funding criteria, including value for money requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1160W.2/1">The site at Hanham Hall near Bristol is the first to be developed under the carbon challenge which the Homes and Communities Agency is delivering on behalf of Communities and Local Government. A planning application to build 195 homes at this site was submitted to the local planning authority in December 2008. Subject to consent being granted we anticipate that construction will start on the site before the end of this year with the first homes being completed in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160W.2/2">The brief for the carbon challenge requires that the new homes must achieve level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. In keeping with the brief, Barratt Developments Plc, the preferred bidders for the Hanham Hall site, have designed the homes to meet the requirements of the definition of net zero carbon in the Code for Sustainable Homes. We therefore envisage that all 195 homes will qualify for stamp duty tax relief in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1160W.8/2">The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 gives it powers to set standards for the nature, extent and quality of accommodation, and facilities and services provided by HAs, and in respect of the management of HAs' financial and other affairs.

	<p pid="a.1160W.8/3">The TSA is therefore undertaking wide-ranging public consultation in 2009 on how to exercise these powers. It has launched a 'National Conversation' and is encouraging landlords all over England to engage their tenants in discussion. The TSA is also holding its own events and activities. These include hiring a camper van fitted out with a video camera for nine days, which has proved to be an effective way of speaking to tenants who would not otherwise give their views through more traditional consultation events. The cost of hiring this facility is &pound;14,816.00 plus VAT.</p>

	<p pid="a.1162W.18/1">Since 1997 the Government have been working to ensure that all sections of domestic violence law support and protect all victims of domestic abuse. In 2004 the Government passed the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act which was the biggest overhaul of domestic violence law in 30 years</p>
	<p pid="a.1162W.18/2">Aside from legislation, on a national level in criminal courts this has included practical system changes promoting a co-ordinated community response to domestic violence through a set of initiatives in and around the criminal justice agencies. This includes establishing 104 specialist domestic violence courts (SDVC) with a commitment to increase this to 128 courts by 2011. Linked to each SDVC is a dedicated independent domestic violence adviser service which provides invaluable support to victims of domestic violence and their families. Evidence shows that incidents of victimisation decrease and victims are less likely to withdraw from cases when this support is provided.</p>

The Government have made considerable progress in taking forward the recommendations from that review, as has been reported to this House by my ministerial colleague the member for Liverpool, Garston.

The consultation period closes <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March 2009</phrase>. The paper proposes to increase fees in order to maintain full-cost recovery for civil business in the county courts and High Court and increase civil fees for the magistrates court to 100 per cent. cost-recovery. The current fee for an application for conviction within the magistrates court is in three stages, costing a total of &pound;90. The consultation proposes a single fee of &pound;250.

	<p pid="a.1172W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice is committed to ensuring that court fees do not prevent access to the courts for those less well-off. A system of fee concessions is available in the High Court, county court and magistrates courts to ensure those of limited means are not denied access to the courts because they genuinely cannot afford to pay the fees.

	<p pid="a.1174W.9/1">When an offender is convicted of murder, the courts must hand down a life sentence. Such a sentence will include a minimum tariff which must be served before the offender can be considered by the Parole Board for release. This tariff is set by the courts and is the minimum term required for retribution and deterrence, which is set in line with Section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.9/2">As a rule, no life sentence prisoner is released before the expiry of their tariff, although there are provisions under the Section 30 of the Crime Sentences Act 1997 for the compassionate release of life or other indeterminate sentenced prisoners. Compassionate release is granted only in the most exceptional circumstances and normally only when the prisoner is terminally ill and close to death.</p>

This involves some estimation. Income from the Youth Justice Board (YJB) in respect of services recharged to the YJB is excluded in order to show the overall cost to the Ministry of Justice. The figures do not include prisoners held in police and court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. for health and education).

	<p pid="a.1178W.5/1">From 2003-04 to 2007-08, victim satisfaction with the criminal justice system (CJS) was assessed through the British Crime Survey (BCS), as part of an overall measure of victim and witness satisfaction. The BCS is a survey of the general public and includes a question to those members of the public who have been victims or witnesses about their experience of the CJS. The following table shows results for England and Wales from the last six months of 2003-04 to the end of 2006-07.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/4"> <td colspan="2"><i> Victim and witness satisfaction with the CJS (British Crime Survey)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/5"> <td><i> Period</i></td> <td><i> Percentage</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/6"> <td>6 months to March 2004</td> <td>58</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/7"> <td>Year ending March 2005</td> <td>59</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/8"> <td>Year ending March 2006</td> <td>59</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/9"> <td>Year ending March 2007</td> <td>60</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.1178W.5/12">Since 2008, the public service agreement for the CJS has changed to use the Witness and Victim Experience Survey (WAVES) to measure victim and witness satisfaction with the CJS. WAVES surveys victims and witnesses whose cases resulted in a charge being brought. The survey was introduced to give more detailed feedback about the experience of victims and witnesses. Unlike the BCS, WAVES gives both national and Local Criminal Justice Board-level data and contains many more questions about every aspect of the CJS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.5/13">The following table shows results for England and Wales from 2007-08 (the latest available data).</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/16"> <td colspan="2"><i> Victim and witness satisfaction with the CJS (WAVES)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/17"> <td><i> Period</i></td> <td><i> Percentage</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1178W.5/18"> <td>Year ending March 2008</td> <td>80</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.1178W.5/21">There are a number of reasons why there is a disparity between the two sets of figures. The BCS is a survey of the general public and although it interviews nearly 50,000 people, this includes only a relatively small proportion of victims whose cases have gone all the way through the CJS. WAVES focuses specifically on victims whose cases have got to the stage of a charge being brought or beyond, and interviews nearly 40,000 victims and witnesses. Hence the two surveys sample different groups. The BCS and WAVES also use different measures of satisfaction. The BCS defined satisfaction as the percentage of victims who were fairly or very satisfied with the contact they had with the CJS. WAVES gives victims the choice of three different levels of satisfaction defining overall satisfaction as the percentage of victims who were fairly, very or completely satisfied with the contact they had with the CJS. This is the standard scale now used by most customer satisfaction surveys and allows a more detailed breakdown of different levels of satisfaction.</p>
