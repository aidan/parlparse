	<p pid="b.410W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-26">26 August</phrase> the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) jointly published a consultation paper on draft regulations for transfer to the ownership of the water and sewerage companies of private sewers and lateral drains which drain to the public sewerage system in England and Wales. The consultation, supplemented by a series of workshops held jointly with WAG, seeks final responses by <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-18">18 November</phrase>. To date, DEFRA has received many representations from the drainage industry. The current consultation follows earlier consultations on the subject in 2003 and 2007, to which DEFRA also received many responses, and is available via the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.0/2">In addition to the formal consultation process, DEFRA has been working closely with a steering group including the water industry regulator Ofwat, the Environment Agency, Water UK, the Consumer Council for Water, WAG, other Government Departments and representatives of local authorities, the insurance industry, house builders and the drainage industry. DEFRA has also held meetings with more specialist groups including representatives of the pump installation and maintenance industry, to hear their views and gather evidence. Representations from the independent drainage sector have focused on concern about the approach taken by the water and sewerage companies to the procurement of maintenance services after transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.0/3">The current impact assessment was published with the August consultation paper. It estimates the transfer to result in an increase in annual sewerage bills in the range &#163;3 to &#163;14. This includes the cost of the transfer of private pumping stations, based on an estimated number of 22,000. It also contains a Small Firms Impact Test and considers the benefits to householders including reduced incidence of blockages, which can result in sewer flooding. It is not anticipated that incidence of surface water flooding will be significantly affected. The impact assessment will be updated in the light of the outcome of the consultation.</p>

The majority of DFID staff in-country are locally engaged staff (known as Staff Appointed in Country) who provide a high level of continuity in managing programmes and projects. Around one-third of staff in-country are UK-based Home Civil Servants, who typically serve between one and three years in post before moving to another job.

	<p pid="b.423W.5/2">To this end, we will introduce the Work Programme which will be an integrated package of support providing personalised help to a broad range of individuals, including those who may previously have been receiving incapacity benefits for many years. We will offer providers differentiated levels of payment for supporting harder customers into work that reflect levels of support to ensure it is worthwhile for providers to offer different customer groups appropriate support. We aim to have the Work Programme in place nationally by the summer of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.5/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2025-10-25">25 October 25</phrase> 2010 we launched Work Choice, a new pan-disability supported employment programme for disabled people, which provides tailored support and targets those customers who face the most complex barriers in reaching or retaining employment, including self-employment. Under a new funding model in which prime providers work closely with their subcontractors, individuals get early, quality support that helps them progress at work and, where it is appropriate for the individual, helps them move into sustainable long-term employment.</p>

	<p pid="b.439W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/2">Non-consolidated performance awards-MOD: A close and effective link between pay and performance is a key element of the reward arrangements for the civil service. The performance element of pay is colloquially known as a bonus, but it is a misleading description because the performance-related element of pay is not additional, it is part of the departmental pay bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/3">For the senior civil service (SCS) performance incentives are paid primarily as non-consolidated performance payments. Any award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers and awards are made to those judged to have made the greatest in-year contribution to business objectives. There is no restriction on the nature of the contribution but it must benefit the Department or defence more widely. Recommendations for awards are considered by moderation committees and must be linked to clear evidence of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/4">All satisfactory performers at SCS level were eligible to be considered for a non-consolidated performance award in line with Cabinet Office guidelines and the MOD pay strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/5">Financial year 2003-04 was the first year in which the MOD paid non-consolidated performance awards to any of its staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/6">The following table details how much was paid to members of the SCS in non-consolidated performance payments by financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/7">Senior fixed term employees are individuals who are recruited through fair and open competition from outside the civil service. Those employed as senior fixed term appointees (FTAs) are on individual contracts and have a higher percentage of pay set to performance awards which are judged against stringent and stretching delivery based objectives. Some have staged payments and it is now usual to pay a smaller annual performance award with the remainder deferred for two to three years and judged against the delivery of medium to longer term objectives. Performance is judged by line management with assistance from senior officials, stakeholders, remuneration committees and in some cases internal audit.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/8">Details of how much has been paid in non-consolidated awards and to how many SCS each year are shown in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 shows the monetary values of the largest non-consolidated payments made in each year to the combined SCS population of permanent staff and fixed term appointees.</p>

Separate arrangements apply to Ministry of Defence police (MDP) officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.439W.2/186">In 2007 the Department moved to a new pay system and the ability to interrogate payments made through the SBS before this date has been diminished and therefore any effort now to try and access this data would require a disproportionate cost. SBS data is though available for financial years 2003-04 to 2006-07 because it was reported in previous parliamentary questions.</p>

The final staff cost is estimated to be approximately &#163;120,000. In addition, there has been some expenditure on external assistance and technical consultancy for the value for money review which has totalled some &#163;200,000.

	<p pid="b.450W.1/1">Future planned expenditure on the nuclear deterrent will be subject to cost savings measures identified in the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). This includes expenditure on the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) and the Future Submarine Programme. Release of further detail may prejudice the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) negotiating position with its commercial suppliers, and final savings figures will depend on detailed SDSR-related implementation. The MOD is, therefore, not prepared to release this financial information at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.1/2">We expect, however, that the in-service costs of the UK's nuclear deterrent, which includes AWE's costs, will remain similar to those of the 2006 White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.1/3">The AWE costs associated with the Mk4A modification form part of the Nuclear Warhead Capability Sustainment Programme, which cannot be distinguished from the AWE management and operation costs.</p>

These will be achieved through sharing development and equipment costs, eliminating unnecessary duplication, coordinating logistics, and aligning our research programmes. The treaty also provides the framework for closer co-operation, and improved interoperability, between our armed forces. It will lead to more capable and effective forces and improve our collective defence capability to the benefit of NATO, the UN and the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.456W.8/3">Central administrative databases are not able to separately identify how many of these orders were in relation to squatters specifically. The Ministry of Justice also does not hold any statistical information about the number of evictions of squatters from properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.8/4">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated. However, county courts' jurisdictions are not coterminous with constituency boundaries. The above figures do not therefore necessarily relate to properties located in the Dartford constituency area.</p>

	<p pid="b.457W.9/1">At present it is too early to project how many regulations will be repealed or amended over the next five years. However, we are already taking steps to reduce the regulatory burden. We are also reducing the unnecessary burden of existing secondary legislation and other forms of regulation to remove needless bureaucracy. We have already announced various changes including the suspension and impending abolishment of home information packs, consolidation of building regulations and consolidation of three sets of tree protection regulations together with streamlining of this system. In addition to this, the forthcoming Localism Bill will contain additional measures that will further free local government from central and regional control so that they can ensure services are delivered according to local needs. Examples of this include radically reforming the planning system to give neighbourhoods much greater ability to determine the shape of the places in which their inhabitants live.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.9/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that new regulatory burdens on businesses are given full consideration through the new one-in one-out rule, and that new burdens on local government are also fully taken into account. Later this year we will publish our Regulatory Forward Programme which will provide details of all forthcoming regulatory and deregulatory measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.458W.2/1">We inherited a catastrophic decline in home building from the previous Government. A combination of divisive top-down targets and a public subsidy-driven approach delivered just 118,000 completions in 2009, the lowest level of house building in England and Wales in peace-time since 1923-24. This is despite the previous Government increasing the notional annual house-building target to 240,000 dwellings a year-showing the disconnect between Whitehall targets and actual house-building.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/2">Under the hon. Member's system, if a local authority built more homes, little of the benefit was seen by the local community. Existing residents saw only further strain on public services. We are wasting no time in taking action.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/3">Rewarding rather than penalising councils and communities for new homes is not only fairer, but will be far more effective. We will create a powerful framework of incentives which will return the economic benefits of growth back to communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/4">The cornerstone of this framework is the New Homes Bonus-a powerful, simple, transparent and permanent incentive. The scheme will match fund the additional council tax raised when new homes are built or brought back into use for the following six years and we will increase the incentive for building affordable homes with an additional amount. Those local authorities that take action now to consent to and support the construction of new homes will receive direct and substantial benefit from their actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/5">We have set aside almost &#163;1 billion over the spending review period and previously made clear that funding beyond those levels would come from Formula Grant. Almost &#163;200 million will be made available to meet the costs of the scheme in 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/6">I am pleased to announce that a formal consultation will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-12">12 November</phrase> and I will be writing to all local authority leaders and English MPs on this.</p>

	<p pid="b.463W.5/1">Over the last three years, the Department has funded research on variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/2" class="indent">surveillance and prevalence of vCJD in the population;</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/3" class="indent">infectivity of vCJD tissues, and aetiology and transmission studies;</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/4" class="indent">improving the safety of blood;</p>

	<p pid="b.463W.5/6" class="indent">development of therapeutics for prion infected patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/7">The projects have built largely on previous studies, as part of the Department's overall strategy for addressing key policy questions relating to vCJD. This has enabled the implementation and continuing refinement of measures to reduce the risk of exposure of the population to vCJD.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/8">Research to determine how many people may be carrying infection in the United Kingdom population has resulted in an estimate, based on a sample of around 10,000 tissue samples, giving a wide prevalence range of between 1:1,200 and 1:20,000. Efforts to refine this are under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/9">Transmission of vCJD via blood has been proven and measures have been introduced to reduce the risk of contamination of blood and blood products. The potential for transmission of vCJD via instruments used in neurosurgery, some other surgery and dental procedures remains. Single-use instruments and decontamination guidelines have been introduced to reduce this risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.463W.5/10">The Department does not hold shares in any companies engaged in research into Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.478W.9/2">However, as a first step, the Government initiated a pipeline review of legislation inherited from the previous Administration. This is now well advanced, and, as part of this, this Department will repeal the Small Business Credit Adjudicator measure, saving BIS some &#163;3 million, and amend the Ban on Unsolicited Credit Card Cheques measure to look for alternative approaches to regulation.

Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector providing they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect.

	<p pid="b.482W.0/1">The Government believe it is important for the media to reflect different viewpoints at the national level and to safeguard democratic debate. Plurality and diversity in the media market are encouraged by promoting effective competition in relevant markets and regulating mergers to ensure they do not result in a loss of such competition. Statutory rules enforced by Ofcom separately place absolute restrictions on cross media ownership and are designed to prevent too great a concentration of media power.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.0/2">Where a merger is not prohibited altogether by these rules, media mergers are subject to the same competition based regulation by the independent competition authorities as all other mergers. Exceptionally, the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills may intervene in a media merger to address concerns about the need to maintain plurality in media ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.0/3">The statutory media ownership rules were reviewed by Ofcom last year. The Government agreed with Ofcom's recommendations. Therefore no changes will be made to the national cross-media ownership rules. However, the Government intend to bring forward legislation to remove the local cross-media ownership rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.483W.2/2">It is the responsibility of sector skills councils, in this case SEMTA, and other representative bodies to determine the content of apprenticeship frameworks. We expect sector skills councils to work with employers to ensure that the range and content of apprenticeship frameworks fully meets the skills needs of their respective industries. This allows the market to determine the content of apprenticeship frameworks and keeps apprenticeships focused on meeting business skills needs.</p>
