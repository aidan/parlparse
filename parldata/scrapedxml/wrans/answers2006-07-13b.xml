	<p pid="b.1931W.6/1">The House administration is taking several actions which are working towards the goals of improving ethnic-minority representation at senior levels and helping staff from all backgrounds to realise their full career potential. A corporate Senior Management Development Programme was introduced in 2005 to prepare managers for more senior positions. The first cohort of the programme has a number of ethnic minority staff participants. The Diversity Forum has as part of its action plan for 2006-07 the aim that talented staff from under-represented groups should actively be encouraged to develop their careers. A proposal will go to the House's Human Resources Group in 2007. On external recruitment, the House's job advertising policy requires that ethnicity of readership should be a priority in the placing of an advertisement. For fast-stream recruitment the House participates in the Cabinet Office's policy of targeting minorities, and specifically the House is involved in a fast-stream summer development programme which includes an open day aimed at ethnic minority applicants. The next open day is on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1938W.8/1">There are two measures of overcrowding&mdash;the statutory definition and the bedroom standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.8/2">Using the bedroom standard, the only recent estimate of the number of overcrowded households in Gloucestershire is 3,000. This is from an ad hoc report based on combined data from both the Survey of English Housing and the Department for Work and Pension's Family Resources Survey for the three years 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.8/3">Reliable estimates for the number of children living in overcrowded accommodation in Gloucestershire are not available. Separate data for Stroud are also not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1938W.8/4">Estimates based on the statutory standard are not available because the underlying data are not collected systematically. A one-off estimate was made in the autumn of 2001 that there were approximately 25,000 households across the whole of England that were in conditions of overcrowding that breached the statutory standard. This estimate was based on data from the Survey of English Housing for the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and from the 1996 &quot;English House Condition Survey&quot;. Equivalent estimates for Gloucestershire are not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1939W.2/1">The final report was completed in June 2004 and owing to its specialist nature it was considered the demand would be insufficient to warrant publication of a glossy hard copy. Electronic copies were made available on request following the publication of the regional energy strategy in November 2004, which was informed by the study and made specific reference to it. Delays in commissioning the GOWM website resulted in a delay until February this year, when the Environment and Rural pages on the site were redesigned, and a link was placed on the new site to improve public access to the report.</p>

Her Majesty's Government have discussed these issues regularly with the Iranian authorities, through the British embassy in Tehran and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.</p>

	<p pid="b.1953W.8/1">The Government are very aware of the problem of private sewers, whereby householders often do not know they have a private sewer until a problem occurs such as a blockage or collapse, which can lead to disputes and consumer resistance to paying for repairs. Local authorities have also traditionally lacked any kind of records of where such sewers are, and the condition that they are in.</p>
	<p pid="b.1953W.8/2">Legislation concerning private sewers has been kept under review by the Government since 2001 when a protocol was proposed for the construction of new sewers, enabling them to be built to a standard suitable for adoption by water and sewerage companies. The Government published their &quot;Review of existing private sewers and drains in England and Wales&quot; in July 2003, which sought views on a number of possible solutions to the problem of maintenance of such sewers including their adoption by water and sewerage companies. This report is available on the DEFRA website:</p>

	<p pid="b.1953W.8/4">In January 2005, DEFRA held a stakeholder seminar&mdash;&quot;Review of Existing Private Sewers in England and Wales: What Next?&quot;&mdash;which explored and drew conclusions on sustainable options for the scope and form of any potential transfer of private sewers to water and sewerage companies. There was general consensus at the seminar that transfer provided the most comprehensive solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1953W.8/5">DEFRA has worked hard with stakeholders, including Ofwat, Water UK and the Consumer Council for Water, to examine the scope and form of any potential transfer to water and sewerage companies. This has included its costs and funding, the impact on the drain repair and insurance industries, and public expectation. We intend to publish a decision on existing private sewers in England and Wales in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1954W.2/1">The Rural Development Service (RDS) have implemented a variety of measures to facilitate the earliest possible entry into the Environmental Stewardship (ES) Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/2">Under the Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) strand of ES in particular, the following steps have been taken:</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/3" class="indent">Monthly, rather than quarterly start dates were implemented in the summer of 2005;</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/4" class="indent">Shortly after the launch of the scheme, a prioritisation list of ELS applicants with outstanding Rural Land Register (RLR) mapping issues was established. This enabled Rural Payment Agency staff to prioritise cases more effectively;</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/5">In circumstances where applicants were not able to fully register all of their land on the RLR, applicants could consider either:</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/6" class="indent">applying for an agreement on the land initially registered and then applying for a separate subsequent ELS agreement on the newly registered land; or</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/7" class="indent">applying for an agreement on the land initially registered and then once land registration for all land was completed, applying for a new, re-started agreement across the whole of the holding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/8">It should also be noted that applicants are able to take up a full five-year ELS agreement. Therefore, though payments may be initially delayed for some, the opportunity to participate in an ELS agreement and receive payment for this will not be lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1954W.2/9">Given the steps outlined, and the voluntary nature of the ES scheme rather than its being a regulatory entitlement, I do not believe that there is a sufficiently robust case for compensation, where a later than anticipated entry into the scheme has been experienced.</p>

	<p pid="b.1955W.11/1">The Waste Incineration Directive (WID) applies to all technical units incinerating waste or co-incinerating waste along with non-waste material. As the law currently stands, the burning of waste tallow as fuel is subject to the requirements of the WID and is regulated by local authorities and the Environment Agency depending on the type of rendering unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1955W.11/2">Having received representations&mdash;including one from the UK Government&mdash;that the application of the stringent requirements of the WID is disproportionate in relation to the burning of tallow, the European Commission has set up a study to help establish whether such controls are appropriate and necessary to the protection of the environment. The study is expected to report by the autumn, and the Government are pressing the Commission for the study to be completed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1955W.11/3">Against this background, operators have argued that the continued burning of tallow in rendering plants would be more beneficial for the environment than switching to alternative fossil fuels, which do not require WID-compliant plants. In addition, switching fuels would have damaging cost impacts on the livestock chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1955W.11/4">Recognising these points and the ongoing Commission study, but also the current state of the law, Ministers have encouraged the industry to enter technical discussions with the regulators to determine how best individual plants might plan move over time to comply with the WID.</p>
	<p pid="b.1955W.11/5">A plant's failure to comply with WID requirements .included in Pollution Prevention Control permits is a matter for the regulator. My Department does not maintain a database of Waste Incineration Directive breaches. Following detection of non-compliance, decisions about enforcement action and/or prosecution are taken in line with the regulator's existing enforcement and prosecution policies. The latter includes consideration of &quot;public interest&quot; in upholding environmental law.</p>

	<p pid="b.1956W.5/1">The Government are supporting the production of biodiesel through a 20p per litre duty rate cut. This has brought forward biodiesel from a variety of feedstock, including tallow. The forthcoming Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation will require 5 per cent. of road fuel to come from renewable sources by 2010. Tallow-derived biodiesel will qualify under the obligation. Burning tallow for the generation of electricity may also qualify for Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), although the Government are not aware of any significant burning of tallow which is eligible for ROCs.</p>

Ofwat has also set revised leakage targets for the period up to 2010 to get the company's leakage reduction back on track and to take leakage down to 720 rather than 725 megalitres per day by 2009-10. It is right that the consumer does not bear the burden of the increased investment needed for Thames Water to deal with its failure to meet its leakage targets.</p>

The Environment Agency reported on the appropriateness of those plans in 'Maintaining Water Supply', which is available from its website:</p>

	<p pid="b.1959W.2/3">Currently, no water company has a desalination plant in operation. South East Water has been testing a pilot plant at Newhaven, although no water from this pilot project has gone into supply. The company is preparing the documentation to support a planning application for a plant at this site. Thames Water is appealing against the refusal of planning permission for a plant at Beckton in the Thames estuary. The company's water resources plan also identifies provision for a second plant in the 2020s. Folkestone and Dover Water plans a small desalination plant at Hythe in 2019 and Southern Water proposes the development of a desalination plant in the 2020s.</p>

Norway, Brazil and South Africa have since pledged contributions. The first bonds will be issued within a few months, and the IFFIm will begin purchasing vaccines and delivering these to the poorest countries through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) before the end of the year. The IFFIm will demonstrate the benefits of frontloading aid using legally binding, long-term commitments from donors through issuing bonds in international capital markets.</p>

The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) published in May 2006 by the Department for Work and Pensions&mdash;&quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot;, &quot;Regulatory Impact Assessments and technical annexes&quot;&mdash;estimates that the increased saving resulting from the proposals could increase tax relief paid on individual contributions by around &pound;1 billion once the scheme is fully operational. On the same central assumption of take-up as the RIA for the first year of personal accounts, the cost of tax relief on individual contributions is estimated to be &pound;350 million, of which &pound;100 million is estimated to be higher rate tax relief. The costs are lower in the first year owing to the proposed three-year phasing of contributions for both employers and employees.</p>

The corporation is also responsible for maintaining licensing records. I have asked the BBC's head of revenue management to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1970W.0/2">The Department's assessment of the impact of replacing savings stamps is likely to be limited. Stamp sales have been falling for several years, being 60 per cent. lower in 2005-06 than in 1999-2000. The introduction of free TV licences for over-75s has relieved some 3.5 million older citizens of the need to pay the licence fee.</p>

	<p pid="b.1971W.0/1">Modelling has been applied at two levels to the road schemes in the targeted programme of improvements (TPI): first at the individual scheme level where carbon dioxide assessments are carried out in accordance with the guidance in the Design Manual of Roads and Bridges (DMRB) volume 11.3.1, and secondly, at the national level (for all schemes) using the Department's National Transport Model.</p>
	<p pid="b.1971W.0/2">The road build included in our national modelling is the Highway Agency's illustrative forward programme of schemes. This includes schemes in the targeted programme of improvements (TPI), plus an estimate of schemes that may make their way into the TPI going forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1971W.0/3">The modelling carried out for the &quot;Future of Transport&quot; White Paper included this HA illustrative programme, with it adding around 0.15 million tonnes of carbon in 2010, in England. The carbon added from just the current TPI would, therefore, be somewhat less than this, as my estimate of the <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June</phrase> response reflects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1971W.0/4">The modelling carried out for the 10-year Transport Plan gave an aggregated figure for the carbon impact of the plan as a whole (including sustainable distribution etc.) and did not split out the road build impact. However, given that the amount of road build in the 10-year plan is of a similar magnitude to that modelled for the White Paper, the carbon impact is likely to be of similar size as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.1973W.5/1">It should be emphasised that identity documents are required with applications for a first photocard driving licence only and where there are personal changes subsequently. As over 25 million drivers now have a photocard licence the requirement for identity documents is diminishing. In addition, arrangements are in place for digitised passports to be checked by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) online with the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). Non digitised UK passports can be checked at Post Offices, with the same facility available at DVLA's 40 Local Offices, which can also check ED passports and those from certain designated countries where licence exchange agreements exist. All these facilities remove the need for submission of a passport to DVLA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1973W.5/2">The use of Special/Recorded delivery arrangements for the return of all submitted identity documents to drivers has been examined, but it would involve substantial clerical intervention, which would result in a significant increase in the fees charged for driving licences. The use of plain fit-for-purpose envelopes by DVLA has not revealed any widespread problems. Some drivers send their own special envelopes for return, but this is a matter of personal choice.</p>

In this study the IAEA considered the shipment of radioactive materials including the shipment of irradiated fuel, plutonium, high-level vitrified wastes and fresh mixed oxide (MOX) fuel in a nuclear transport vessel. The study considered a number of issues related to accidents at sea, accident statistics, risk studies and emergency response. The study concluded that all the scientific information available in this area demonstrated that there were very low levels of radiological risk and environmental consequences from the sea transport of radioactive material.</p>

	<p pid="b.1980W.9/1">The Government understands the tough conditions in which energy consumers are operating and is leaving no stone unturned, working closely with industry, to find solutions and reduce the impact. The Government fully appreciates that high energy prices create problems for the competitiveness of industry, and takes very seriously the potential loss of jobs and investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.9/2">Estimates suggest that in April 2006 industrial gas and electricity prices in the UK including taxes were above the EU median for all but the smallest consumers. However, historically prices to industrial users have been below the EU median, and right up to October 2005 prices were no higher than the EU median, except for the very largest energy consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.9/3">Our discussions with the Energy Intensive Users Group and others have helped us focus our efforts on maximising gas and electricity supplies, improving the operation of the market, encouraging demand side response and pursuing fair access to markets across Europe. Over the summer we are pursuing a detailed work plan with Ofgem, National Grid, industry and others to ensure we have examined all the options and that we are in the best possible position ahead of next winter. The new Business Energy Forum, co-chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Richard Lambert of the CBI, which met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase>, is monitoring this work and looking at other strategic energy issues impacting on business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.9/4">Other Ministers and I will continue to take every opportunity to raise the issue of implementation of energy market liberalisation across the EU in meetings with the Commission and our opposite numbers in other member state Governments. We welcome the Commission's decision to initiate infraction proceedings against 17 member states, and the series of dawn raids in six member states in pursuance of anti-trust action. These actions should lead to a change of behaviour across the EU.</p>

The Government's commitment to establish a network of sector-based National Skills Academies (NSAs) is a skills initiative designed to operate in England. Sector Skills Councils, however, have the development lead for NSAs and also hold a UK-wide remit, regulated in Wales by protocol with Education and Learning Wales. Employers there and in Scotland and Northern Ireland may well wish to see NSAs reach across the UK and their engagement with their Sector Skills Councils will determine their wider establishment. Construction Skills, the Sector Skills Council leading the development of the Construction Skills Academy is planning a series of workshops to be held in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to explore the potential for introducing NSA arrangements there. The NSA for Construction is currently in the business planning stage with an announcement concerning its opening expected in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1983W.3/3" class="indent">You recently asked a Parliamentary Question of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. The question was:</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;What resources are being deployed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection to assess whether Cumbria County Council is complying with national standards in the delivery of services for the care of children?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.3/5" class="indent">That question has been referred to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.3/6" class="indent">The Commission for Social Care Inspection has a team of local inspectors based at Penrith who are responsible for assessing residential and domiciliary care services for both adults and children in Cumbria. Inspectors assess services against the same standards regardless of whether those services are provided by the County Council or the private or voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.3/7" class="indent">In addition to this, there have been service inspections, which cover assessment and care management delivered by the social services authority (Cumbria CC) as well as direct care provision. Specific inspections for Children's Services were carried out most recently in 2003, with a follow up inspection carried out in 2004. A service inspection team is currently working with Ofsted on a Joint Area Review of all Children's Services in Cumbria. This will report in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.3/8" class="indent">Until last year Social Services in Cumbria were receiving monthly monitoring visits and additional support because of concerns over their performance. In the performance assessment published in December 2005 the council was awarded one star, up from zero stars the previous year. The 2005 judgements in relation to children's services were that Cumbria were serving some children well, with promising capacity to improve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1983W.3/9" class="indent">The budget available to the Penrith office in 2006/07 totals &pound;937,000. Of this, staffing costs are &pound;872,000. Cumbria County Council is the only council in the Penrith Office's jurisdiction. There is one Business Relationship Manager (BRM) and one Performance Information Manager (PIM) with responsibility for Cumbria County Council (as well as Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council). In addition to this, there are two Regional Managers and twelve dedicated Regulation Inspectors (two deal with children's resources and ten with adults) for Cumbria region.</p>

	<p pid="b.1984W.6/2">The nature of these courses means that many are not readily identifiable through the national qualifications framework or other formal qualification bodies. This means we are unable to accurately estimate the number of these courses. However, we are aware from providers' prospectuses of these type of courses being offered by some providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1984W.6/3">We would expect courses that are valued by learners to continue, but those who can, should contribute more to the cost of that learning. Public funding for courses for personal and community development has been 'protected'/ringfenced at &pound;210 million per year for 2006/07 and 2007/08.</p>

We are continuing to take up the challenge of implementing these comprehensive new controls, some in areas which bring in activities not previously subject to control. On greater transparency, we have introduced quarterly reports (which are available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front">http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front</a>?page name=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page &amp;cid=1089131553823, and provide detailed information on our export licensing decisions. The 2005 annual report on the UK's Strategic Export Controls will also be published in a new format later this month. These initiatives illustrate our commitment to maintain, and expand, the high standard of transparency and accountability in the area of export controls that we established with the launch of our first annual report in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="b.2009W.5/16" class="indent">The decrease in training provided in 2005-06 was caused by a number of factors including awaiting the agreement of the Operational Implementation Plan, which has led to a new training programme for managers and other employees of the Child Support Agency. We have also seen a move towards blended learning and the use of e-learning with less emphasis on classroom training.</p>
	<p pid="b.2009W.5/17" class="indent">Following the announcement of the Operational Improvement Plan a full and comprehensive training programme has been developed. This includes a full training programme for Team Leaders, focusing on technical training, management skills and client outcomes. This will enable team leaders to effectively coach and mentor people leading to increased productivity and better client outcomes. In addition, we are currently developing training to support the movement of people to compliance work, as specified in the Operational Improvement Plan, so enabling the Agency to deliver the associate business benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.2009W.5/18" class="indent">More detailed plans are still being finalised but the training will be for both new entrants and to support existing employees who may take on a different role on implementation of the new organisational design.</p>

	<p pid="b.2012W.5/2">However, and particularly as completing wind up can take a number of years, initial payments enable us to start paying some money at a lower rate, to qualifying members or their survivors who become entitled to assistance before their scheme has completed winding up.</p>

	<p pid="b.2016W.9/1">The Home Office has one advisory body concerned with animal health and welfare, the Animal Procedures Committee. The role of the Animal Procedures Committee is to advise the Home Secretary on matters concerned with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and his functions under it. In doing so, the Committee is required to have regard to the legitimate requirements of science and industry and to the protection of animals against avoidable suffering and unnecessary use in scientific procedures. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has lead responsibility for other aspects of animal health and welfare.</p>

	<p pid="b.2017W.2/1">Data from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform showing the number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts for selected offences related to antisocial behaviour are provided in the table A.</p>
	<p pid="b.2017W.2/2">Noise is often one of the symptoms of other antisocial behaviour and anecdotal evidence suggests that a variety of other tools, such as warnings, ASBOs, ABCs, parenting contracts and demotion of tenancy are used to tackle perpetrators' antisocial behaviour rather than a noise prosecution. It is not possible to ascertain the number of individual graffiti and fly-posting prosecutions because graffiti is recorded as criminal damage and fly-posting is recorded as an illegal display of advertisements. The penalty notice for disorder scheme was brought into effect in all police forces in England and Wales during 2004. Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons committing specified minor offences with a fixed penalty notice, including the offence of littering, which was added to the scheme on one November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.2017W.2/3">No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence. Data showing the number of penalty notices for disorder issued in 2004 for the offence of littering broken down by police force area, as well as provisional data for 2005, is provided in table B. Data on prosecutions for 2005 will be available in the autumn .</p>

Legislation that is especially relevant to the policing of a particular community will be incorporated within the delivery of the programme in that area, thus paving the way for student officers to develop a more detailed understanding of local issues at an early stage in their careers.</p>

	<p pid="b.2027W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-20">20 June 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/2">We have introduced a number of measures to identify, rescue and protect the victims of child trafficking in England and Wales. Guidance issued to Immigration Officers provides advice on how to identify any child entering the UK who may be at risk, whether they are travelling alone or with adults, and what action to take.</p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/3">The Government are currently working towards developing the &quot;Paladin&quot; model whereby joint working between Immigration, Police and local authority social services ensures best practice is applied in identifying children at risk. Furthermore, a change to Immigration Rules on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-12">12 February 2006</phrase>, enables Immigration Officers to carry out more robust checks on the identity of children passing through ports of entry. For example, the names of all non EU accompanied children will be recorded and, for visa nationals, the visas will carry details such as the child's photograph, whether the child should be accompanied or unaccompanied and, if accompanied, the person with whom they should be travelling.</p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/4">The visa application form will also cover details of the parent/guardian, accompanying adults and sponsors of the child. Specially trained teams of Immigration Officers have also been established at 22 ports to deal with cases of unaccompanied children, and arrangements for round-the-clock referral to police and local authority children's services where this is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/5">These arrangements will support the development of even closer working arrangements between Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), the police and local authority children services departments. Additionally, the Immigration Service is becoming more involved in the work of the newly established Local Safeguarding Children's Boards in local areas covering major ports of entry.</p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/6">The Home Office National Asylum Support Service (NASS) currently reimburses local authorities who receive unaccompanied asylum seeking children into their care with a total of &pound;140 million per annum. Partnership plans to provide safer arrangements for children who have been trafficked are being incorporated into a Home Office/DFES joint review of how local authorities accommodate children from abroad. The review will aim to deliver improvements by ensuring unaccompanied asylum seeking children are placed in local authority areas where specialist services exist to deal with their specific needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/7">The review is also designed to increase specialisation, end inconsistencies in treatment and enable the retention and development of expertise.</p>
	<p pid="b.2027W.6/8">We have also commissioned the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP) to carry out an analysis of intelligence data to identify potential numbers of children who may have been trafficked. The results of this exercise will lead to further in depth analysis in order to refine the Government's response to tackling human trafficking.</p>

The deployment of police officers to community based policing and to other specialist police units is an operational matter for each Chief Constable in Wales. All police officers have the powers of the office of Constable. We aim to introduce Neighbourhood Policing in every community in England and Wales by April 2007. Communities will see increased patrolling, have better local information, and see a greater focus on confidence and reassurance.</p>

This is in order to identify and eliminate any DNA profiles found at a crime scene which may have been inadvertently deposited there by an investigating police officer. Police officers who were in service prior to that date were asked to provide a sample on a voluntary basis. Police forces are responsible for notifying the custodian of the PED when officers retire or leave the police service in order that his/her DNA profile may be removed from the database. Police personnel who provided a sample for the PED on a voluntary basis can request removal of their profiles from the PED at any time without giving any reason.</p>

	<p pid="b.2029W.8/1">Information is not collected or collated centrally on the detailed basis requested. Detailed information relating individual offenders under supervision is held locally by their supervising probation officer. All offenders released on licence, including sex offenders are subject to six standard licence conditions: three of which require them to 'keep in touch with your supervising officer', 'permanently to reside at an address approved by your supervising officer' and 'notify him or her in advance of any proposed change of address or proposed stay (even for one night) away from that approved address'. In the event that any such licence conditions are breached, the offender is liable to be recalled to prison upon the recommendation of the probation officer in order to protect the public. Once the licence is revoked and the offender recalled, the police are notified, in order to ensure a swift return to custody. In addition, any offender subject to sex offender registration requirements is required to notify to the police a home address within three days of leaving prison, and to notify any subsequent change of address within three days of the change thereafter while still subject to registration. Failure to supply that information, or supplying false information, is an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Registration requirements were strengthened recently by the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>

	<p pid="b.2043W.9/2">The Medical Devices Regulations 2002, for which the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) acts as the regulatory authority on behalf of the Secretary of State, does not regulate the quantity of dentures imported from countries outside the European Union. They do, though, contain requirements for the safety and fitness for purpose of custom-made dental appliances which all manufacturers, wherever they are based, should ensure are met before placing their dentures on the United Kingdom market. Where the manufacturer is based outside the European Community they are also required under the regulations to appoint an authorised representative to register on their behalf with the member state competent authority where they have their registered place of business. MHRA conducts an annual programme of inspections of custom made appliance manufacturers and authorised representatives based in the UK, selected at random.</p>

	<p pid="b.2048W.3/1">The Department has been reviewing the arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents (blood glucose testing strips), dressings, incontinence appliances and stoma appliances to primary and secondary care since October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/2">In the intervening period, two consultations papers have been published that sought views from interested parties on proposed changes to the arrangements. Interested parties includes patients, the national health service and manufacturers and suppliers. These parties were informed that the Department was seeking their comments on the proposed changes. Responses were received to both consultations from Diabetes UK and from the in-vitro diagnostic industry, both individually and through their trade body, BIVDA.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/3">The first consultation&mdash;&quot;arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents, dressings, incontinence appliances and stoma appliances to primary and secondary care&quot;&mdash;was open for 90 days and the second&mdash;&quot;arrangements for the provision of dressings and chemical reagents to primary care&quot;&mdash;for 30 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/4">The shorter period for the second consultation was judged to be warranted as it was part of an ongoing process that had begun with the first consultation in October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/5">The second consultation stated that the Department believes that current reimbursement prices for some dressings and reagents may not represent value-for-money for either the NHS or taxpayers. Therefore, it proposed that a reduction in the reimbursement price through Part IX of the drug tariff should be made on some dressings and some reagents and sought views on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/6">The proposed reduction in the reimbursement price on some reagents was 15 per cent. In arriving at this, the Department believes that one of the clearest indications of value-for-money is the difference between reimbursement prices in primary care, and the prices at which these products are available in secondary care. The Department believes that a comparison between the sectors is appropriate, subject to a number of adjustments to reflect factors unique to each sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/7">These factors include differences in the underlying costs associated with supply of products to primary and secondary care. Packaging specifications, pack sizes, logistics costs and margins across the supply chain, amongst other things, have an affect on price, and were taken into account in the analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/8">The Department also took into account the claims that were made about the provision of 'free' testing meters in primary care when comparing pricing between the two sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/9">Overall, there is a difference of up to 35 per cent. between reimbursement prices in primary care and prices paid in secondary care. The size of difference cannot be reasonably explained by the factors outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/10">The Department's diabetes policy team&mdash;which includes Dr Sue Roberts, national clinical director for diabetes&mdash;has been kept informed throughout the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/11">Until such time as the review has been completed, the Department is not in a position to comment on plans to ensure the availability of blood glucose testing strips.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/12">Regarding the publication of responses in full to the consultations on the &quot;arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents, dressings, incontinence appliances and stoma appliances to primary and secondary care&quot;, the Department considers that it is reasonable to withhold publication until a future date, pending the outcome of on-going discussions and further consultations on future arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/13">Disclosure of the responses to the first consultation would be likely to influence or inhibit those responding to the further consultations and prevent the Department from obtaining fair and representative views from stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.3/14">The Department considers that the public interest in disclosing the responses is outweighed by the public interest in withholding them. This is because although there is an inherent public interest in openness and accountability in Government, there is a greater public interest in ensuring that the Department's consultation process is effective and that the Department negotiates new arrangements that deliver fair prices for the NHS and reasonable returns for suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.2059W.5/31">The current MHRA performance in the processing of parallel import applications is not satisfactory. The large number of pending applications has been a result of increased volume of applications being received on a year on year basis as well as some severe operational problem with the new information management system introduced in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.2059W.5/32">Many system improvements affecting both the function and the speed of new information system have now been implemented and staff are more familiar with the use and new ways of working with the system. Since January 2006 the electronic portal has been available to companies for electronic submission of applications. This has major benefits as electronic submission via this system cuts down on initial administrative processing at the MHRA and facilitates more immediate and reliable exchange of correspondence on applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.2059W.5/33">Further implemented measures such as increasing the number of assessors and out-of-hours bonus exercise for assessors are resulting in increased throughput of work. The MHRA is paying very close attention to the MHRA's performance and they are monitoring weekly so as to evaluate the effect of strategies that are in place to improve the level of service.</p>

	<p pid="b.2082W.5/1">The main statutory responsibility for implementing the Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1979, the Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1979, and the Public Health (International Trains) Regulations 1994, often referred to as the port health regulations, rests with local authorities, including some that are specifically constituted as port health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2082W.5/2">Funding for port health is included in revenue support grant (RSG). The RSG is an unhypothecated block grant and as such local authorities can use it for any purpose. The amount provided for a particular service is not separately identifiable. This is consistent with the Government's view that local authorities are best placed to take account of local circumstances in setting their priorities for spending. The Department does not collect information on the arrangements made by each local authority with port health responsibilities, consistent with its policy of minimising burdens on local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2082W.5/3">The medical staff needed to implement the regulations are provided or commissioned for local authorities by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) or in some cases the local primary care trust. Following a review of arrangements at ports, airports and international train stations completed in March 2006, the HPA has agreed to take the overall operational lead in ensuring that there is appropriate (human) health input into arrangements for port health.</p>
	<p pid="b.2082W.5/4">The paragraphs above cover the position in England. Responsibility for port health in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland rests with the National Assembly for Wales, Scottish Ministers, and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.2082W.5/5">The existing port health regulations reflect the requirements of the International Health Regulations 1969. New International Health Regulations were adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2005 and are due to come into force generally in June 2007. They are the means by which the World Health Organization aims to prevent and control the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with the public health risks and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The Government is working closely with the Association of Port Health Authorities, the HPA, the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and other interested parties to consider how the International Health Regulations 2007 should be implemented in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.2086W.9/1">The Government response to the House of Commons Health Committee Report on the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalised patients was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Health in July 2005. The response included a commitment to set up an independent expert working group which would make its recommendations by summer 2006, and that once the expert group had assessed the current guidance on VTE, the Department would ask that the Healthcare Commission look to seek conformity with this good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.2086W.9/2">The Department expects the report of the independent expert working group to be presented to the Chief Medical Officer shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.2090W.15/1">From the beginning of the current parliamentary Session to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-10">10 July 2006</phrase>, 6,874 parliamentary questions have been tabled to my Department. On that date 174 of these were awaiting reply; 30 are unanswered between two and three weeks of tabling and 80 unanswered in over three weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.2090W.15/2">Of those over three weeks old on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase>, most were tabled in June and many will now have been answered.</p>
	<p pid="b.2090W.15/3">Delays in answering parliamentary questions can occur for a variety of reasons, from complications arising from the need to request information from external agencies and organisations to pressures on staff when dealing with such a large volume.</p>
	<p pid="b.2090W.15/4">The Northern Ireland Office aims to ensure that Members receive a substantive response to their named day question on the named day and to endeavour to answer ordinary written questions within a working week of being tabled. Unfortunately, this is not always possible but my Department makes every effort to achieve these time scales.</p>
