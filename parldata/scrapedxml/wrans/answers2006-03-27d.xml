	<p pid="d.621W.3/1">The World Bank's Africa Action Plan, which forms part of the World Bank's response to the commitments made at Gleneagles last June and was endorsed by bank governors at their annual meeting in Washington in September, proposed the establishment of a Catalytic Growth Fund&quot;. Its purpose is to help Africa make faster progress on meeting the MDGs, particularly the hardest-to-reach&quot; ones like health and access to water, and increasing the rate of economic growth. Its aim is to complement other sources of development financing, including those from the International Development Association (IDA), while, at the same time, being innovative and creative in supporting countries that have shown an ability to make good use of increased amounts of aid, as well as countries with reforming and post-conflict Governments that show a commitment to reducing poverty. Money will also be given to regional projects to deal with needs that cross borders.</p>
	<p pid="d.621W.3/2">We welcome the Bank's agreement that use of the Fund will be guided by the priorities of the Africa Partnership Forum and that the World Bank will ensure regular consultations with Fund donors, African Governments and regional institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.621W.3/3">The Fund will be financed by voluntary contributions from World Bank members. The UK is the first country to pledge support, our &pound;200 million contribution was announced in October 2005. The Bank is also seeking contributions from other donors. We expect the first projects to be approved in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="d.623W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is strongly committed to the targets set out in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. During the refurbishments of our UK offices we incorporated many energy saving mechanisms; for instance, a new building management system allow us to monitor and manage energy usage to a much greater extent than in the past. DFID has also installed energy efficient heating systems and lighting systems which are movement sensitive and take account of natural lighting levels. An environment management system has been implemented at both UK offices.</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.2/2">DFID is also currently installing timers to regulate energy usage and additional sub-meters to monitor our energy usage even more closely in the future. We have ensured that 100 per cent. electricity used in our main UK offices is from renewable sources and we are also currently investigating additional options such as combined heat and power plants, solar panels and a wind turbine at our East Kilbride office. The design for the refurbishment of our East Kilbride office has received an excellent&quot; and the London office a very good&quot; rating under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). We are also actively encouraging staff to use energy efficiently, for instance by switching off equipment when not in use rather than simply leaving on stand-by&quot;. DFID is also in the process of arranging under the Carbon Trust Framework Agreement, a carbon management programme including an energy audit of both UK offices.</p>

	<p pid="d.624W.2/1">This year, DFID will spend around &pound;250 million in India&mdash;the Department's largest country programme in the world.</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/2">DFID's India programme supports the achievement of the Government of India's (GoI) 10th Plan and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) poverty reduction targets, as outlined in our India Country Assistance Plan (CAP) for 2004&ndash;08 (available on DFID's website <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/3">The programme is provided in close partnership with the Union Government and the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal. In these states, and at the national level, DFID supports the Indian Government's measures to improve the quality and poverty impact of public policies and services and in creating the necessary conditions for economic growth. Our funds are directed at increasing access to basic education and health and to improving the lives of poor people in rural and urban areas. We also promote better management of the environment and support activities to empower the poor, especially women and those who are less able to represent themselves.</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/4">For example, in West Bengal, our Kolkata Urban Services for the Poor Programme aims to help slum dwellers directly, through funding improvements to slum infrastructure (for example; better drainage, road systems, latrines, solid waste management), and indirectly and in the longer term through supporting overall city management, building in a poverty focus to urban planning, strengthening urban management systems, and working to help municipal authorities become more accountable to citizens. A parallel programme operates in Andhra Pradesh and one is also planned for Madhya Pradesh.</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/5">In Andhra Pradesh, our Rural Livelihoods Project supports the State Government in helping poor rural households to develop new livelihood options and landless farmers to earn income from the use of common lands through better use of water in drought-prone areas. The project aims to extend the reach of these schemes to target the poorest and most excluded groups including women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/6">Alongside assistance to its four focus states, DFID is strengthening its National Programme to provide significant resources for central programmes in key areas, including health and education where progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to accelerate. For example, DFID is currently supporting the Government of India's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) programme with a &pound;210 million commitment in close collaboration with other donors. This programme is aimed at ensuring that by 2010, all children in India receive eight years of basic education of acceptable quality regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location and has already resulted in a reduction in the number of out of school children from 25 million in 2003 to 13.5 million in March 2005. DFID is also financing over 20 per cent. (&pound;128 million) of the Government of India's National Polio Eradication Programme, which has succeeded in confining this disease to only a few isolated pockets in the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/7">Through the National and State programmes, DFID is also placing renewed emphasis on support to Indian civil society, to strengthen the capacity of poor people to participate in decisions affecting their lives.</p>
	<p pid="d.624W.2/8">A table of all projects currently supported by DFID India is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="d.627W.8/1">The Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Rwanda have concluded discussions on their development partnership and havesigned a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to this effect. The new MoU, which was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-13">13 February</phrase> by representatives of the two Governments, supercedes the previous MoU originally signed in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="d.627W.8/2">The new 10-year arrangement re-affirms and extends the UK's development partnership with Rwanda. The partnership focuses on reducing poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Rwanda, as well as the promotion of peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.</p>
	<p pid="d.627W.8/3">Currently, we allocate bilateral development assistance worth &pound;46 million each year to Rwanda. Subject to Rwanda honouring its commitments under the MoU, the UK expects to maintain bilateral assistance at this level or higher over the next 10 years. Of this, we expect that at least two thirds will be provided as Poverty Reduction Budget Support.</p>
	<p pid="d.627W.8/4">In recent years, the United Kingdom has provided substantial development assistance to Rwanda. There have been good results in the form of impressive development progress, with improvements in the quality of life of Rwanda's people, as well as increased peace and security. It is in the light of this good progress that we have agreed the new MoU as a basis for providing more predictable finance for Rwanda's development.</p>
	<p pid="d.627W.8/5">The MoU sets out shared objectives as well as specific commitments made by each side and arrangements for monitoring and review. The MoU also specifies circumstances under which the UK's development assistance may be interrupted or reduced. The MoU will be underpinned by a set of specific, monitorable benchmarks, to be agreed with the Government of Rwanda. These will provide a clear basis for monitoring adherence to the MoU as well as tracking the progress of our development partnership with Rwanda, and will provide a basis for continuing dialogue and discussion with the Government of Rwanda.</p>
	<p pid="d.627W.8/6">I have arranged for copies of the document entitled 'Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda' to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.634W.2/3">Firstly, to ensure that optimism bias is factored intodecision making the department makes explicit adjustments to promoters' cost estimates within economic appraisal. The adjustments are empirically based (e.g. using data on cost overruns for transport projects in the past).</p>
	<p pid="d.634W.2/4">Secondly, the department is taking a number of steps to try to reduce optimism bias in the future. These include:</p>
	<p pid="d.634W.2/5" class="indent">Issuing improved guidance on cost estimation and risk assessment (including requiring a Quantitative Risk Assessment to be undertaken for all larger major schemes).</p>
	<p pid="d.634W.2/6" class="indent">More closely scrutinising promoters' cost estimates to ensure they are realistic and based on the latest cost information.</p>
	<p pid="d.634W.2/7" class="indent">Involving private sector contractors earlier in scheme development to help to better estimate costs, improve scheme design and to ensure that schemes are planned in a way that uses existing capacity effectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.634W.2/8" class="indent">Providing greater incentives for scheme promoters to produce realistic estimates of cost. This is achieved by only committing to fund risk-adjusted cost estimates excluding optimism bias and not automatically funding cost overruns.</p>

	<p pid="d.634W.5/2">A range of appraisal information including assessments using the New Approach to Transport Appraisal system, is required alongside all schemes submitted to the department for funding. Traffic forecasts are used by scheme promoters as part of these appraisals. There is departmental guidance available to promoters, setting out the appropriate use of forecasting techniques, to ensure that traffic is realistically forecasted. The forecasts are checked by the promoters, such as the Highways Agency or other appropriate body, and by the department's modellers. The full appraisal is finally inspected by the department as part of the value for money assessment, to provide Ministers with advice on the case for a particular scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.635W.2/2">The Department does not ordinarily compile information on the modelling technique used by external promoters in assessing future patronage; to compile a list of schemes on this basis would be prohibitively expensive. However, scheme promoters are expected to use appropriate techniques in the appraisals of a project, using the guidance published by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.635W.2/3">Since 1997, of some sixty Highways Agency road schemes that have been approved, around 90 per cent. were appraised using a fixed trip matrix method to assess future traffic levels; a similar proportion would be expected for local authority major road schemes. The 'elasticity' approach has been the alternative used in larger schemes. This technique models the growth in traffic induced by the completion of a transport improvement&mdash;something a fixed trip matrix would notdo. The Department for Transport has recently published guidance for road scheme promoters to encourage greater use of improved 'variable demand' appraisal techniques. All rail schemes are assessed using an 'elasticity' approach. In the largest schemes, affecting a number of modes, full multi-modal studies are conducted which would better articulate modal change as well as induced traffic.</p>

It was estimated that a statutory Operating and Financial Review would cost business &pound;33 million per annum more than the Business Review. Most of these additional costs related to the different audit requirements applying to the OFR compared to the Business Review. As the Business Review and OFR reporting requirements are similar, work already undertaken on the preparation of the OFR will be useful in the preparation of the Business Review.</p>

	<p pid="d.639W.5/1">The recent volatility in gas and electricity prices is driven by the current tight supply/demand balance and the general uncertainty in the market over the winter months. The Government have been pursuing a number of avenues to reduce this tightness and improve the operation of the market. We have talked to the North sea gas producers, and the operators and capacity owners of the Bacton-Zeebrugge Interconnector and the Isle of Grain Liquefied Natural Gas import terminal, in order to maximise supplies over the winter. We have encouraged end users, particularly gas-fired power stations and other energy intensive industrial consumers, to respond to price signals by reducing demand and switching to alternative fuels where possible. We have sought to improve the operation of the market by making more information available on a timely basis through the voluntary agreement with the offshore industry, and by encouraging the Futures and Options Association to develop an action plan for improving the liquidity of the gas and electricity markets.</p>

	<p pid="d.639W.8/1">The UK energy market is one of the most liberalised in the world. The UK is giving the European Commission our full support to ensure that EU energy markets are also open and competitive. As the Chancellor noted in his budget speech, incomplete liberalisation of EU energy markets is a factor in high gas prices and at the Spring European Council the UK will propose that the energy and other sectors which fail to liberalise and open up to Competition should be subject to independent investigation and enforcement. This work has been ongoing in the energy sector for some time; the Commission launched a sector inquiry into EU gas and electricity markets in June 2005 and the UK gave this prominence during our Presidency of the EU in the second half of last year. The Commission recently reported the preliminary findings of this inquiry and identified a number of areas of concern. We expect the Commission to remedy the defects it has found.</p>

	<p pid="d.642W.6/1">We have received a range of representations concerning the programmes of advice and assistance for small businesses some of which reflect the wish of Ministers to make support for business muchsimpler and easier to obtain. The CBI's report Improving Government Services to Small and Growing Businesses&quot;, published in January 2006, demonstrated the CBI's support of the Government's objective to ensure services to businesses become more coherent. A report from the Federation of Small Businesses published this month, showed that only 4 per cent. of its members who responded to the survey used the help available from the Business Link network yet 96 per cent. of those who actually use the service would recommend it to a friend&mdash;so there is clearly a gap between perception and reality.</p>
	<p pid="d.642W.6/2">During November 2005, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants informed the DTI of its concerns with the Government's wider business support agenda and Small Business Service officials recently met the Association to discuss these issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.642W.6/3">Ministers believe that the proliferation of business support schemes has created a complex picture that makes it difficult and time consuming for businesses to gain access to relevant support and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set in train a process of deproliferation. We will work with the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and other local and national bodies to reduce the number of business support services from around 3,000 now, to no more than 100 by 2010. The DTI's Small Business Service will spearhead this cross-Government programme and will engage with a wide range of key stakeholders, including the CBI and ACCA. An announcement of this programme was formally presented in the 2006 Budget report.</p>

	<p pid="d.643W.5/1">The Information Commissioner is responsible for administering the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. Regulation 21 of these Regulations relates to unsolicited direct marketing telephone calls. Where a complaint is made about a potential breach of Regulation 21, the alleged breach is considered to have been committed by the instigator of the marketing call rather than the telephone service provider who has provided the service by which the call was made. While the Commissioner's Office have received complaints about potential breaches of Regulation 21 which have allegedly been committed by organisations that would be classed as telephone service providers, the nature of the casework management system used makes it impossible to identify the number of telephone service providers about which the ICO has received more than 50 complaints. They are looking to develop this function in their casework management system in the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.654W.2/1">The game farms of the Loire Valley could be exposed to H5N1 infection from wild birds during the spring migration. So far, however, there is no evidence of the virus in the region.</p>
	<p pid="d.654W.2/2">France has taken measures across the whole country to prevent infection entering poultry flocks including game farms. This includes surveillance of wild birds in order to detect H5N1as rapidly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.654W.2/3">If avian influenza was confirmed, or even strongly suspected, in wild birds or poultry, then trade in live birds from the affected zone would stop. The extent of any ban would depend on the precise circumstances, but the restricted area would have a radius of at least 10km and remain in place for at least 30 days. Any birds already imported would be traceable if the required records have been kept.</p>
	<p pid="d.654W.2/4">Because of the large number of live bird imports and the recent cases of H5N1 in France, the chief veterinary officer (CVO) for the UK has raised concerns with the European Commission and the French CVO. In response, we have received additional written assurances that France is carrying out surveillance on game farms and enforcing the same rules on biosecurity that apply to poultry holdings.</p>

Farmers can receive the Single Payment for oilseed rape and wheat on set-aside land when grown under contract as a biofuel crop. Sugar beet will soon be eligible to receive the same support. However, biofuel crops are not the only potential use for set-aside and in some situations, other vegetation cover may provide more suitable environmental benefits.</p>

	<p pid="d.656W.2/2">Government has been looking at ways of reducing the usage of disposal plastic shopping bags by encouraging reuse. Last Autumn, WRAP (the Waste and Resources Action Programme) conducted a 'Reusable Bag' campaign trial, which took place in Bristol and Edinburgh in association with supermarket retailers, Defra, the Scottish Executive, the British Retail Consortium and the Scottish Waste Awareness Group. Customers were asked to Choose to reuse&quot; any kind of durable shopping bag for their supermarket shop, and remember to bring it with them to store, in an effort to curb carrier bag take-up. WRAP are hoping to publish the results of the campaign by Easter.</p>

The Government also provides support and advice to public sector organisations through mechanisms such as the Carbon Trust, a private company funded by Government, which takes the lead on public sector carbon reduction. The Trust can provide support and practical advice on a range of measures (which includes no and low cost measures such as not leaving equipment on standby) to help them meet their commitments.</p>

	<p pid="d.659W.5/1">UK nitrous oxide emissions are monitored via the UK's Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which is published annually. Between 1990 and 2004 (the most recent year for which figures are available) the inventory shows that nitrous oxide emissions fell by about 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.659W.5/2">The main sources of nitrous oxide are agriculture and industrial processes including manufacture of adipic and nitric acids. Under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) system introduced by the Environmental Protection Act, DuPont (UK) Ltd., the operators of the only adipic acid plant in the UK, introduced an abatement unit that reduced nitrous oxide emissions from their plant by over 95 per cent. This is estimated to have reduced UK greenhouse gas emissions by 6.5 million tonnes of carbon equivalent, equal to about 3 per cent. of 1990 greenhouse gas emissions. The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) system which is now superseding IPC will drive further reductions including at nitric acid plant.</p>
	<p pid="d.659W.5/3">In the agriculture sector nitrous oxide emissions fell by 17 per cent. between 1990 and 2004, and are expected to continue to fall. A range of options to reduce emissions from the sector are being considered through the Climate Change Programme Review and development of the Adaptation Policy Framework.</p>
	<p pid="d.659W.5/4">As part of a resource-efficient approach to farm management, we are promoting actions to optimise fertiliser use, as well as measures to improve management of manure, nutrients and soil. Additionally, activities under a range of Defra initiative, such as Catchment Sensitive Farming, can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while addressing other environmental issues. Defra is seeking to maximize the benefits of these policies in delivery of climate change objectives.</p>

	<p pid="d.660W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.660W.5/2">The Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) system was set up by the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 and encompasses (i)regulation by the Environment Agency of industrial installations subject to the requirements of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, and (ii) regulation by local authorities of some 23,000 generally smaller industrial installations in respect of their emissions to air. Local authorities are also responsible for the regulation of about 10 per cent. of the some 4,500 installations subject to IPPC.</p>
	<p pid="d.660W.5/3">These regulators recover their costs through charges made to each operator who holds a permit issued under the PPC system. The income from these charges is set out in the tables which cover the annual periods from 2000, in which year the PPC Regulations came into force. The increasing income to the Environment Agency arises because installations subject to IPPC requirements are being phased into the new system according to a timetable laid down in the PPC Regulations extending from late 2000 to early 2007. Many of those installations were already subject to integrated pollution control under the system introduced by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and which IPPC is superseding. The local authority income from charges does not vary so much from year to year because it includes income from the predecessor controls under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="d.660W.5/4">While these charges account for a large part of the administrative costs of the PPC system, operators may also incur costs directly in preparing applications for permits and, on a recurring basis, responding to routine monitoring and other information requirements of their permits. No estimates of these on an annual basis are available.</p>

	<p pid="d.663W.3/2">DEFRA has published an independent study, 'Review of the Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management', which was peer reviewed by the Royal Society and concluded that on the evidence from studies so far the treatment of municipal solid waste&mdash;including by incineration&mdash;has at most a minor effect on human health and the environment. The report is available on DEFRA's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/research/health/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/research/health/index.htm</a>. We have also just published a study, 'Impact of Energy from Waste and Recycling Policy on UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions', in support of the waste strategy review consultation.</p>

Most of them are the result of a campaign by Friends of the Earth and raise the concern that increased incineration will prevent higher levels of recycling, but make no reference to health impacts. These issues are addressed in the current waste strategy review consultation.</p>

	<p pid="d.664W.0/2">Incineration with energy recovery is principally a waste management solution for residual, post-recycling waste, which also provides a source of renewable energy. Energy recovered from residual municipal waste currently accounts for about 0.35 per cent. of electricity generation in the UK. At current rates of conversion efficiency, this could rise to about 1.5 per cent. by 2020 on the basis of anticipated increases in this waste management route.</p>

	<p pid="d.664W.3/1">The Waste Implementation Programme has two overarching targets. The first is to work with stakeholders, particularly local authorities, to ensure that our national recycling and composting targets are met. The 2003&ndash;04 target of 17 per cent. was exceeded and we are confident that the 2005&ndash;06 target of 25 per cent. will be met, although figures are not yet available. WIP's second overarching target is to create the conditions in which the investment needed to meet our 2010, 2013 and 2020 landfill directive targets can take place. This remains a highly challenging objective but we are confident that good progress is being made towards achieving it.</p>

	<p pid="d.666W.3/1">The proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East would be deeply damaging for stability and security in the region and beyond, and for the multilateral non-proliferation system.</p>
	<p pid="d.666W.3/2">We have serious concerns about the nature of Iran's nuclear activities, its history of concealment and inadequate co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and its failure to take the steps requested by the IAEA Board. These have all contributed to the international community's lack of confidence that the aims of the Iranian nuclear programme are, as Iran claims, exclusively peaceful.</p>
	<p pid="d.666W.3/3">These concerns must also be seen in the context of Iran's ballistic missile programme, its attitude to Israel and the Middle East Peace Process, its links to Lebanese Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups undermining peace through violence.</p>
	<p pid="d.666W.3/4">It is therefore essential that Iran should meet in full the requests set out in the <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-04">4 February</phrase> IAEA Board Resolution, including reinstating a full suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. We will intensify our efforts, with our partners, to that end.</p>

	<p pid="d.669W.2/1">Land Systems OMC, is a South African based company in which BAE Systems has a 75 per cent. shareholding. We are aware of reports that Land Systems OMC has sold armoured vehicles to the Ugandan Government. Uganda is not an embargoed destination and the UK did not approve export licences for these vehicles. Overseas subsidiaries are subject to the export controls of the country in which they operate.</p>
	<p pid="d.669W.2/2">Armoured vehicles were used on several occasions to police the recent elections, but we have not been able tosubstantiate the allegations that they were used to violate human rights.</p>
	<p pid="d.669W.2/3">Armoured vehicles are also used by the Ugandan armed forces to escort convoys in the north of the country where there is a long-running and very violent incursion by the Lord's Resistance Army. Food convoys are essential to sustain the 1.7 million people living in internally displaced people's camps in the region.</p>

	<p pid="d.675W.10/1">There is currently no administrative backlog of appeals at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT). Between April 2005 and October 2005, an administrative backlog of entry clearance and family visitor appeals built up with the AIT, totalling approximately 39,000 cases. Those cases experienced a delay in initial processing (acknowledgment and issue of papers to the respondent requesting the appeal bundle) of up to 16 weeks. The administrative backlog was cleared by the end of December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.675W.10/2">The once backlogged appeals now form part of the Tribunal's current work in progress&mdash;as at February 2006 around 82,000 immigration judge appeals and 6,000 other cases for review or reconsideration. As a result of work load volumes, and the clearance of backlogged cases, the AIT is currently listing entry clearance and family visit appeals at 16 weeks from receipt of the appeal bundle. This represents a departure of between eight and 12 weeks from steady-state time scales.</p>

	<p pid="d.681W.2/1">The Causeway Programme is a joint enterprise by the six criminal justice organisations in Northern Ireland that aims to improve their performance by sharing information electronically. The programme is being implemented in phases.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/2">Phase 1, the Criminal Justice Viewer, was implemented on time and within budget in March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/3">Phase 2, Electronic Case Preparation&mdash;which enables the electronic transfer of information between the police, prosecution and forensic services&mdash;went live on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase>. To date some 40,000 PSNI investigation cases have been placed on the Causeway system with approximately 13,000 of these being shared with the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). There have been over 11,000 shares of forensic test requests and reports between forensic scientists, the police and prosecution lawyers. Over the course of the year Causeway is expected to have removed from circulation some 6 million pieces of paper.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/4">Examples of other tangible benefits already delivered include:</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/5" class="indent">A reduction in the average time taken by police officers in Omagh to prepare a case from 70 to 29 days.</p>
	<p pid="d.681W.2/6" class="indent">The release of 33 police officers from administrative duties back to the beat.</p>

	<p pid="d.681W.2/8">The programme is currently working on phase 3, in which the Northern Ireland Court Service and the Prison Service will join the system. Recently the Compensation Agency, Youth Justice Agency and thePolice Ombudsman's Office have been provided with access to on-line criminal records. The programme is also examining the feasibility of linking into the Police National Computer. In addition to winning a national award for promoting joined up government, Causeway was recently cited by HM Treasury as an example of best practice in risk management.</p>

	<p pid="d.693W.0/1">Invest NI continues to implement a strategy that promotes all areas of Northern Ireland as attractive and viable locations for new inward investment opportunities in what is a very competitive global marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="d.693W.0/2">To achieve this, Invest NI's marketing and sales resources are focused on those sectors and geographical markets most likely to generate projects to match the Northern Ireland business proposition and contribute to the development of an innovation-based economy.</p>
	<p pid="d.693W.0/3">In recent years the shift from manufacturing to predominantly tradeable service-based sectors has seen a significant change in where projects are located within Northern Ireland. Investors from these sectors place an increasing emphasis on locations with large labour pools, excellent infrastructure and close proximity to universities or centres of excellence. Consequently, Belfast and Londonderry are often the main focus of potential investors' interest.</p>

	<p pid="d.694W.2/1">Migrant workers in Northern Ireland are entitled to the same employment rights and working conditions as other workers, including benefiting from the laws relating to the conduct of employment agencies. Employment agencies and employment businesses in Northern Ireland are regulated by Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 ('Conduct Regulations'). The Conduct Regulations, which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-25">25 September 2005</phrase>, were subject to two full public consultations. They establish a framework of minimum standards that the work-seekers and employers who use employment agencies can expect, including establishing the suitability of work-seekers for vacancies, agreeing terms and conditions, placing controls on client accounts and record-keeping, and clarifying arrangements for charges and fees. Under the 1981 Order, the Department for Employment and Learning has responsibility for enforcing the legislation, including powers to prosecute offenders and in more serious cases, seeking a prohibition notice from an industrial tribunal to prevent an individual from operating an agency for up to ten years.</p>
	<p pid="d.694W.2/2">Under powers granted in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 the Department may also enter and inspect employment agency premises and records to ensure compliance with the Conduct Regulations. A schedule of inspections, undertaken by the Trading Standards Service on behalf of the Department, will commence from April 2006. The inspections will be scheduled based on the perceived risks of vulnerable groups, including migrant workers and as such a high priority will be attached to their interests. The Department will investigate all complaints brought to its attention in respect of employment agencies.</p>
	<p pid="d.694W.2/3">In addition the Department has produced and distributed guidance material aimed at those affected by legislation governing the recruitment sector, including material to assist migrant workers in Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Tetum and Lithuanian.</p>

	<p pid="d.706W.6/1">Our usual source for these figures is the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) collected by the Office for National Statistics. In this case, however, it has not been possible to obtain these figures. The ASHE is unable to provide estimates of the number of people earning below these thresholds, on a statistically reliable basis (only proportions of people are available), and consequently it has not been possible to perform the calculation that is requested.</p>

	<p pid="d.710W.0/1">VAT is not chargeable on the construction of academies, or parts of academy buildings, provided that use of the building for which a charge is made will account for less than 10 per cent. of its total use under this relief. Taking the year as a whole (including non-term time) a 1,000 student institution could potentially provide charged extended services for an average of around 50 people per day.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.0/2">VAT agreements with our European partners meanthat while we can maintain this relief for the construction of charitable buildings, it cannot be extended further. DfES and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will explore with academies how community use of their facilities might be maximised, consistent with this VAT relief.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.0/3">If VAT is chargeable on construction of any part of an academy building, this can be reclaimed from HMRC to the extent that the building is to be used for a taxable business purpose. DfES and HMRC will also explore with academies how any remaining VAT costs might be managed within the current rules&mdash;for example by allowing academies to spread VAT costs relating to non-business use of their facilities over a 20-year period.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.0/4">In relation to other youth and education facilities, the VAT relief detailed applies for buildings constructed for charities. Where VAT is chargeable on construction, this can be reclaimed from HMRC to the extent that it relates to taxable business use of the facilities. In addition, local authorities can usually reclaim from HMRC all VAT costs relating to schools and other youth and community facilities that they maintain.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.0/5">Where VAT is chargeable and not reclaimable from HMRC, it is legitimate for bids for grants or public funding to include relevant overhead costs, such as this irrecoverable VAT.</p>

	<p pid="d.711W.5/1" qnum="59004">To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what enforcement measures are in place to ensure that existing regulations on the use of asbestos are adhered to.</p>
</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-27d.59004.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-27d.711W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" colnum="711W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060327/text/60327w25.htm#60327w25.html_spnew10">
	<p pid="d.711W.6/1">The Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations 1992 prohibit the importation, supply and use (namely the manufacture) of asbestos and asbestos-containing products into the United Kingdom. The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) are the enforcing authority for these regulations and to their knowledge there is no manufacture of asbestos-containing products within the UK. HSE have the authority to grant exceptions to the prohibition of supply and importation. Such an exemption is granted only in exceptional circumstances with strict conditions applied by HSE.</p>
	<p pid="d.711W.6/2">However, asbestos-containing materials were widely used up to the implementation of these regulations. Although it is difficult to give a precise figure, it was estimated in 2000, that 500,000 commercial premises contain asbestos products. Asbestos products present no risk to a person unless its condition deteriorates and asbestos fibres are released. Therefore the principal duty on the person in control of these premises is Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 regulation 4, commonly known as the Duty to Manage. HSE Inspectors and Local Authority Environmental Health Officers enforce this legislation. The Duty to Manage is one of the strands of HSE's Disease Reduction Programme, which sets out a schedule of work to seek compliance with this legislation. There is a range of enforcement powers available to secure compliance, including the issue of enforcement notices and taking legal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.711W.6/3">When work has to be carried out on the asbestos material, including its removal, then it is subject to the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations. This requires that prior to the commencement of work that a suitable risk assessment is carried out to determine the appropriate control measures required to prevent, or reduce to the lowest level practicable, exposure to asbestos fibres. HSE Inspectors and Local Authority Environmental Health Officers have the same enforcement powers as for the Duty to Manage Asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="d.711W.6/4">For high-risk activities, work is also subject to Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983. These prohibit an employer or self-employed person from carrying out any significant work with asbestos insulation, asbestos coatings and asbestos insulating board unless HSE's Asbestos Licensing Unit has granted them a licence. The applicant is subject to a rigorous assessment prior to any licence being granted. HSE have the authority to apply any conditions on a licence, refuse, amend, or revoke a licence. A licence is granted for a fixed period and the applicant is subject to a further assessment on re-application. A condition on all licences is that work with asbestos is notified to the relevant enforcing authority. HSE carry out site visits for a sample of this notified work, and if acceptable standards are not met take suitable enforcement action, which includes letters, enforcement notices and prosecutions. In addition relevant information is fed-back to the Asbestos Licensing Unit, to enable the terms and conditions of an individual licence to be continually reviewed.</p>

	<p pid="d.715W.5/2">There have been no changes in the decision-making process for the referral of cases of potential fraud for criminal investigation since April 2003. The current process is based on a computerised scoring system, the Fraud Referral Intelligent Scorecard (FRISc). Using this system, each referral is given a score based on pre-determined criteria. Cases that attain a score above a set level are referred for investigation by the Fraud Investigation Service.</p>
	<p pid="d.715W.5/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, we are introducing a revised referral decision system that will also identify cases that require action at a level below the criminal law standard. Cases identified under the new system will be referred for action by Customer Compliance Officers. Customer Compliance Officers will deal with cases of lower level fraud, enabling the Fraud Investigation Service to concentrate its resource on cases requiring criminal investigation.</p>

	<p pid="d.717W.0/1">The Government's reasons for not taking forward options to simplify non-dependent deductions were set out in paragraph 10.54 of The Way Forward for Housing&quot; published in December 2000:</p>
	<p pid="d.717W.0/2" class="indent">There are a number of changes raised in the Green Paper which we don't intend to pursue at this time. These include further reform of disregards, tapers and non-dependent deductions. Given the current problems, sorting out the administration, combined with our benefit run-ons&quot;, will have more impact on work incentives than changing additional rules in these areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.717W.0/3">Although we have not taken forward the options in the Green Paper, there have been reforms to the non-dependent deduction scheme. From October 2003, if the householder or their partner is aged 65 or more, and a non-dependant moves into their home or an existing non-dependant's circumstances change to increase the deduction, then the start of the deduction or increase in deduction is delayed for 26 weeks. Also, from April 2005, if the non-dependant is on pension credit, no deduction is made in respect of that non-dependant.</p>
	<p pid="d.717W.0/4">However, as with all aspects of the benefit system, the provisions for non-dependants in housing benefit will continue to remain under review.</p>

	<p pid="d.718W.2/1">The Disability and Carer Service (DCS) have a number of initiatives in place to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing. These include the Customer Information Leaflet (CIL) which is produced in British Sign Language (BSL) in both video and DVD format. All DCS offices have text-phones with text-phone numbers that are published to the public. Typetalk is also available (a BT service that enables a customer who is deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired to communicate via a third party on the telephone).</p>
	<p pid="d.718W.2/2">For face-to-face contact with customers accessing our services, some DCS staff have BSL interpreting qualifications and DCS staff can also book external BSL interpreters via RNID or contact the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP). In addition, DCS are currently producing an information video and DVD, You Can Benefit&quot;, which includes subtitles, audio and a BSL interpreter.</p>
	<p pid="d.718W.2/3">Pension Centres and Jobcentre Plus offices are equipped with audio induction loops, high-powered earphones, radio microphones and text-phones. Training and guidance on deaf and hard of hearing issues are routinely provided for staff. The Pension Service Local Service teams use a portable communication aid to support those people who are hard of hearing.</p>
	<p pid="d.718W.2/4">The Pension Service are working with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) to ensure that the service achieves the RNID Louder than Words accreditation, which has already been attained by the National Pension Centre.</p>

	<p pid="d.724W.2/3">This applies where the transfer was valued at &pound;5,000 or more and was made as a result of a court order or written maintenance agreement made prior to <phrase class="date" code="1993-04-05">5 April 1993</phrase>, and the transfer was made in lieu of ongoing child maintenance.

Such an order made after that date will prevent an application for a year, again unless the parent with care claims benefit. When a maintenance calculation is made in a case where an order exists, that part of the order which provides for periodical payment of maintenance ceases to have effect.</p>

	<p pid="d.726W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive is currently unavailable as he is communicating the Operational Improvement Plan to all Agency staff. I am responding on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the nature is of technical problems affecting the Child Support Agency's new computer system; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/5" class="indent">In addition, you asked how long the technical problems which are affecting the Child Support Agency's new computer system have been continuing.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/6" class="indent">And finally, you asked how many payments to single parents have been delayed due to the technical problems affecting the Child Support Agency's new computer system; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/7" class="indent">The following response seeks to address all three questions.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/8" class="indent">The new child support scheme was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>. It has been well publicised that there has been a number of technical problems with the performance of the new computer system (CS2) from this date. A great deal of work has been carried out to improve the stability of the new computer system (CS2) and operational performance has improved to the point where contracted service levels are now consistently being met.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/9" class="indent">There are still a number of defects in the CS2 computer system which can prevent some cases from progressing. The clerical process allows staff to progress these cases off-line to ensure that any money paid in by the non-resident parent is paid out to the parent with care.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/10" class="indent">Where a payment has not been issued by the system a manual payment can be requested. The Agency has a process for manual payments which has reduced delays in issuing such payments to clients. In such circumstances, a hold is placed on the computer system to prevent it from releasing the funds pending recovery and adjustment of the accounts. Further investigation is taking place to ensure that this system is effective.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/11" class="indent">We have around 3,400 customers who are regularly paid their maintenance manually. This includes a mix of payment frequencies&mdash;i.e. weekly, monthly, 2- monthly, 6-monthly etc. Iam unable to give a breakdown between computer failure and other reasons for payments having to be made manually.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/12" class="indent">Work is ongoing to remedy the problems with the new computer system, and future IT releases are planned during 2006 and 2007 to resolve the various system performance issues and build on the improvements already made.</p>
	<p pid="d.726W.0/13" class="indent">I hope you find this helpful</p>

	<p pid="d.727W.5/1">Prior to the formal tendering stage of the procurement process, the Department requires potential contractors to complete and submit a detailed 'Pre-Qualification Questionnaire' (PQQ), developed by the Office of Government Commerce, which provides the basis for selecting potential contractors to be invited to tender. The financial information required via the PQQ comprises the last two years' audited accounts, or, where audited accounts are not available, turnover, profit and loss, cash flow details and end-period balance sheet. The PQQ also seeks separate information regarding the turnover which enables us to assess the capacity of the organisation to fulfil the contract.</p>
	<p pid="d.727W.5/2">The PQQ is analysed by procurement and financial experts to determine whether or not the potential contractor is capable of undertaking the required work, and is also financially able to take the work on. This helps to prevent the Department entering into a contract with a financially exposed supplier.</p>

In 2004, the Chairman of the Health and Safety Commission wrote to all Local Authority Chief Executives, setting out the need for a sensitive and proportionate approach to headstone safety. HSE is now assisting the DCA in preparing advice, which, following consultation, they plan to publish later this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.731W.5/1">Safety standards in the transport and handling of hazardous cargoes at ports and terminals are improved and maintained through an inspection and enforcement regime operated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and Statutory Harbour Authorities, which considers the type of cargo handled and any specific risks associated with the cargo.</p>
	<p pid="d.731W.5/2">Specifically, this is achieved through the Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 and planning requirements (the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Regulations 1992). All establishments wishing to hold certain hazardous substances above a threshold quantity (the threshold for LNG for example is 15tonnes) must apply to the Hazardous Substances Authority for a hazardous substances consent. HSE is a statutory consultee under the regulations and carries out risk assessments to enable it to advise on the health and safety risks.</p>
	<p pid="d.731W.5/3">The assessments which are carried out in relation to Consents consider the risks to people in the vicinity of a major hazards establishment. The assessments are rigorous and detailed taking in all aspect within HSE's remit.</p>
	<p pid="d.731W.5/4">COMAH is the principal legislation dealing with the operation of major hazard establishments. COMAH applies to specified quantities and types of substances. The aim of the regulation is to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances and limit the consequences of any incidents to people and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.731W.5/5">COMAH requirements are necessarily robust, the requirements are proportionate to the hazards and risks but the sites with the highest quantities of major hazards substances are subject to a safety report regime which requires a demonstration that all measures necessary have been taken to prevent major accidents and to limit the consequences to people and the environment of any that do occur.</p>
	<p pid="d.731W.5/6">Both the COMAH requirements and the criteria for carrying out assessments in relation to consents are updated and improved in the light of advances in technology and experience. This is an ongoing process.</p>

	<p pid="d.734W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking which Jobcentre Plus call centres are available to jobseekers in Oxfordshire and for what hours each call centre operates, and how many calls to Jobcentre Plus call centres serving Oxfordshire were necessary on average for a jobseeker to get through to a member of staff in the last period for which figures are available. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.734W.5/4" class="indent">Jobseeker Direct is a telephone job matching service for customers who are job ready and looking for work. Customers can contact Jobseeker Direct by ringing a local rate 0845 number. We have a number of contact centre sites located through out the UK that deliver the Jobseeker Direct Service. None are located in Oxfordshire. When a customer calls the dedicated 0845 number, the next available advisor within the network, regardless of the call's geographic origin, will answer their call. This service is available from 8.00am to 6.00pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays.</p>
	<p pid="d.734W.5/5" class="indent">Jobseeker Direct is a national service and it is not possible to identify the number of calls received from the Oxfordshire area. However, I can tell you that for the three months to the end of February Jobseeker Direct answered over 2.2 million calls which represents 97% of all calls received (against our target of 90%). Jobseeker Direct also exceeded our target of 80% of calls answered within 20 seconds, for that period.</p>

	<p pid="d.735W.2/5" class="indent">In October 2004 the full-time equivalent staffing allocation for Stroud Jobcentre (which included an element for Dursley) was 17.23.

The work currently being undertaken at the Stroud office is significantly different from that undertaken in 2004. The old Jobcentre has closed and the Social Security office has been refurbished and converted into a Jobcentre Plus office. New systems have been introduced and new claims for benefit are now taken over the telephone by the contact centre in Torquay, with the majority of benefit processing work taking place in Gloucester and Cheltenham. District-wide functions have also been housed elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="d.736W.2/1">Our Welfare Reform Green Paper sets out proposals that will build on the success of Pathways to Work. To ensure our reforms are successful and that we deliver the best services possible, we are working with customers and their representatives, employers and medical professionals to increase awareness of the needs of all groups, including those with mental health conditions. We know that nearly four out of 10 people who claim incapacity benefit have a mental health condition and the longer people remain on the benefit; the more likely they are to develop mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.736W.2/2">One of the key principles of Pathways to Work is inclusion and support for all, and it is important that claimants attend and participate in their scheduled work-focused interviews to maintain contact and take advantage of the support that is on offer. Everyone who wants to work, whatever their health condition or disability, should get the appropriate help and support to enable them to work as soon as they are able to do so. With that support the prospects for the majority of people are good. To provide this advice and support we have invested heavily in training for personal advisers and in condition management programmes in Pathways to Work areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.736W.2/3">We intend to develop our work with health service providers to meet the particular needs of those with mental health conditions, many of whom are likely to require ongoing support, whether they return to work or remain in receipt of benefits.</p>

	<p pid="d.744W.11/1">The Criminal Justice System (CJS) Information Technology (CJS IT) Programme was set up in spring 2002, in response to the Justice for All&quot; Government White Paper, with the following vision:</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.11/2" class="indent">By <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>, anyone involved in the CJS&mdash;users of it or people working within it&mdash;should have access from any browser enabled device, to a seamless, coherent set of computer systems and information to cover the breadth of their dealings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.11/3">Considerable progress has been made in achieving this, with 100 per cent. of the underlying server hardware, computers and desktop applications is now in place across the police, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Magistrates' and Crown courts, prisons and probation. The CPS completed deployment of its case management system in 2003 and the case management systems for the police and Magistrates' Courts are expected to be substantially complete by March 2007. Key to achieving this joined-up vision is the CJS Exchange, which is part of the CJS IT Programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.11/4">This will transport data between the various case management systems, transforming data as required. The CJS Exchange has been designed to cope with all languages. Already, the CJS Exchange is making the exchange of case file data between the police and the CPS possible in Humberside and a further link will enter full live operation in Avon and Somerset in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.11/5">The CJS Exchange is also providing a secure website that, by the end of March, will give all appropriate staff within a Crown Court's catchment area access to hearing information that was previously only available within the courthouse itself. In early March, connectivity between the probation service and prison services offender assessment systems across all 42 areas was completed; currently there are over 810,000 completed assessments on the probation system and over 62,000 completed assessments on the prison system.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.11/6">If deployments go to plan, initial indications are that, by March 2007, 70 percent. of the CJS areas are expected to have connected their case management systems to the CJS Exchange.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.11/7">The CJS Exchange is also to be used for the National Enforcement Service's pathfinder pilot in the North of England.</p>

	<p pid="d.745W.2/1">The Criminal Justice System (CJS) Exchange programme has been reviewed by the Group Investment Board four times, most recently in June 2005. The Home Office Group Investment Board, a sub-committee of the Home Office Group Executive Board, is responsible for approving and monitoring all major projects across the Home Office. The CJS Exchange programme has been given the required approval at all reviews.</p>
	<p pid="d.745W.2/2">It was also agreed that CJS Exchange should report annually to the Group Investment Board after each Gateway 0 review; the next appearance before the GIB is scheduled for May 2006. The CJS Exchange programme is also subject to a monthly review of progress by the Permanent Secretary of the Home Office, and a further report is made to the Office of Government Commerce, as this programme has been identified as one of the Home Office key programmes. Expenditure and deliverables for the CJS Exchange programme is agreed as part of the CJS IT programme, which is approved annually by the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General, the Minister with responsibility for the CJS and the Director General of Criminal Justice IT.</p>
	<p pid="d.745W.2/3">Already, the CJS Exchange is making the exchange of case file data between the police and the CPS possible in Humberside and a further link will enter full live operation in Avon and Somerset in March 2006. The CJS Exchange is also providing a secure website that, by the end of March, will give all appropriate staff within a Crown Court's catchment area access to hearing information that was previously only available within the courthouse itself.</p>
	<p pid="d.745W.2/4">In early March, connectivity between the Probation Service and Prison Services Offender Assessment Systems across all 42 areas was completed; currently there are over 810,000 completed assessments on the probation system and over 62,000 completed assessments on the prison system. If deployments go to plan, initial indications are that, by March 2007, 70 per cent. of the CJS areas are expected to have connected their case management systems to the CJS Exchange.</p>
	<p pid="d.745W.2/5">The CJS Exchange is also to be used for the National Enforcement Service's pathfinder pilot in the North of England.</p>

	<p pid="d.746W.2/1">The intention is to create a more compact Registered Body network, working in greater partnership with the CRB and composed of high-volume users. This will allow the CRB to focus its resources more effectively to improve compliance and support the evolving role of Registered Bodies. It will also give the CRB the ability to deregister those Registered Bodies that repeatedly fail to adhere to regulations. Overall, the reduction will enhance efficiency and improve standards within the Registered Body network, through the introduction of an annual threshold of applications per Registered Body. This is a key part of the CRB's strategy. The CRB is committed to ensuring that organisations wishing to access the CRB's service can continue to do so. Those that are selected for deregistration will not be deregistered until alternative access arrangements have been found.</p>

	<p pid="d.747W.2/2">In order to meet these targets the Department is benchmarking key office sites, after which we propose to undertake energy surveys at those sites above the benchmark, and thereafter, will compile site-specific action plans. We will also incorporate energy management clauses within future contracts and include energy performance among the criteria for future site selection. The contract for the management of the new headquarters site at two Marsham Street requires our PFI partner to operate the building at 10 per cent. below the best practice benchmark contained in the Government's Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme Energy Use in Offices Guide.</p>
	<p pid="d.747W.2/3">The public sector Prison Service has an Energy Efficiency Action Plan. A benchmarking guide has been developed and the data used to help set carbon dioxide key performance indicators for each prison. The Prison Service was the first Government Department/Agency to be accredited under the National Energy Foundation's scheme for energy efficiency and was re-accredited in 2003. It aims for reaccreditation every three years, which requires evidence of continuous progress.</p>

This ensures that travel restrictions can be imposed. However, to ensure that anyone subject to restrictions for an extended period of time can demonstrate their identity for domestic purposes, they will be able to obtain an identity card which will be issued to the same standards as other cards but which will not be valid for travel. This will be achieved by not specifying the nationality of the card holder on the face of the card.</p>

Security risk assessments have been conducted on issues such as the physical, logical, procedural, personnel and systems aspects of the identity card scheme to ensure such necessary procedures are implemented correctly and are sufficiently comprehensive. In addition, all security aspects of the scheme will be subject to a security accreditation process which must be passed before the scheme can be launched.

	<p pid="d.761W.2/1">In May 2006 the 101 service will be launched in two of the First Wave 101 Partnership areas (Hampshire/Isle of Wight and Cardiff). Provision has been made for up to 40,000 calls in this first month, based on the number of calls currently handled through existing emergency and non-emergency telephone numbers.</p>
	<p pid="d.761W.2/2">Whilst the 101 service is expected to bring about a significant reduction in the number of calls to the police 999 emergency service, that do not require an emergency response (experience from the United States shows up to 50 per cent. reduction to their equivalent to the 999 service), this is only predicted to happen once the service is available nationally and has been widely marketed. Successful use of both 999 and 101 will depend upon a significant marketing and public education campaign. The 101 programme will not only reduce calls to 999 but also provide better access to advice, information and improve action concerning community safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.761W.2/3">The first wave of the programme is a special stage that allows for close monitoring and measurement of the introduction of the service to allow lessons learned to be fed into the roll out of the programme to achieve national roll out by 2008. The programme is also subject to an independent evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="d.767W.6/1">The survey, Psychiatric morbidity among prisoners in England and Wales (Office for National Statistics, 1988) showed that 90 per cent. of prisoners have at least one significant mental health problem, including personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence.</p>
	<p pid="d.767W.6/2">The responsibility for the provision of health services, including mental health services, to prisoners in publicly run prisons transferred from the Home Office to the Department of Health in 2003. The Department of Health has in turn devolved funding and responsibility for prison health to national health service primary care trusts, which work in partnerships with prisons to commission and deliver services.</p>
	<p pid="d.767W.6/3">Effective mental health services are central to the Government's programme of improvements in health services for prisoners. Nearly &pound;20 million is being spent on mental health provision in 2005&ndash;06. The NHS plan commitment to have over 300 additional staff working in prisons as part of NHS mental health in-reach teams (effectively community mental health teams working within prisons) by April 2004 has been met: there are now 360 such staff in post.</p>
	<p pid="d.767W.6/4">In-reach teams are now operating in 102 prisons. All prisons are expected to have access to mental health in-reach services by this spring. An evaluation of the prison mental health in-reach programme has been undertaken and is due to be delivered shortly. We are currently looking at other aspects of our prison health mental programmes with a view to their assessment.</p>

Key elements of the strategy focus on the development of effective and proportionate protective security arrangements and ensuring that we are prepared to respond effectively to, and recover from, a terrorist attack. We do not comment on the specifics of the operational activity across the UK as this could assist those who may wish to perpetrate acts of terrorism.

Such a decision by the host or transit country would have no significant impact upon the English and Welsh strategy for preventing English football disorder during the tournament. This is because the strategy is based on preventing known risk fans from leaving England and Wales during the tournament rather than on the reintroduction of border controls in host or transit countries.</p>

Rape can come within the category of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for the purposes of article three of the European Convention on Human Rights as defined in the published instruction to caseworkers.

	<p pid="d.779W.5/1">The Department has awarded contracts to Baxter and Chiron to manufacture a total of 3.7 million doses of H5N1 vaccine and expects to receive stocks by October 2006. The H5N1 supplies will be used to conduct further research and could be used to vaccinate frontline health care workers before a specific pandemic vaccine can be developed. Storage arrangements for the stockpile are yet to be determined.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>, the new Health White Paper, Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services reaffirmed that the new programme will be rolled out from April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="d.780W.0/3">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes are currently assessing where the five programme hubs will be located. The English bowel cancer screening pilot site at the Hospital of St. Cross, Rugby, Warwickshire, is expected to become the first programme hub when national roll-out begins. It is hoped to establish the other four programme hubs by March 2007, with announcements to be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid="d.780W.0/4">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes are taking all the necessary action to ensure that successful roll-out of the programme, including the procurement of testing kits. Following a formal tendering exercise, a preferred provider of the testing kits has been selected. An order will be placed for the delivery of the kits for the commencement of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.793W.2/1">The Healthcare Commission assesses national health service organisations under powers provided by the Health and Social Care Act (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, and private and voluntary health care providers under powers in the Care Standards Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="d.793W.2/2">The Commission may assess organisations contracted to provide for NHS funded work under either of these sets of powers. If a non-NHS provider of NHS services is registered as a provider of independent health care under the 2000 Act they are assessed using the Regulations and National Minimum Standards provided under that Act. If such a provider is not so registered and where they are commissioned by an NHS organisation it is for that organisation to ensure that the services comply with Standards for Better Health&quot;, the national standards set under the 2003 Act, using thecriteria of the Commission's Annual Health Check process.</p>
	<p pid="d.793W.2/3">In addition, health care provided for NHS patients, be it by the NHS or for the NHS by a non-NHS establishment, may be reviewed by the Healthcare Commission under 2003 Act, against the NHS standards&mdash;Standards for Better Health&quot;&mdash;published by the Secretary of State in July in 2004. As part of its review process, the Healthcare Commission ensures that services for NHS patients delivered from outside the NHS are commissioned against these standards, including those covering patient safety.</p>

	<p pid="d.802W.2/1">The Department and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) have received eight representations on the FSA nutrient profiling model since it was adopted by the FSA board on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December 2005</phrase>; four from food industry representatives and four from individual consumers and organisations representing consumers' interests.</p>
	<p pid="d.802W.2/2">Those from consumers and organisations representing consumers' interests have supported the model, while those from industry representatives have argued that it is not appropriate to differentiate between foods on the basis of their nutrient composition.</p>
	<p pid="d.802W.2/3">The FSA's nutrient profiling model is a tool for use by Ofcom, the United Kingdom's communications regulator, to enable them to target rules on television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugars, without having an unhelpful impact on the advertising of healthier options.</p>
	<p pid="d.802W.2/4">Ofcom is expected to consult on options for tightening the rules on broadcast advertising at the end of March.</p>

The responsibility for introducing a single assessment process (SAP) rests with local health and social care service planners, commissioners and providers.

	<p pid="d.806W.4/1">The estimated net saving in the Department's annual operating costs, for which the headcount reduction target is a key contributing factor, is approximately &pound;60 million per year by 2008. These savings form part of the efficiency opportunities in public funding and regulation costs, a key workstream identified by the Gershon review, Releasing Resources to the Front Line&quot; and therefore will count towards the Department's total efficiency target of &pound;6.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.806W.4/2">The target full time equivalent level of employment to achieve the headcount target is 2,245. The baseline for this target was 3,645 budgeted posts in March 2003. Of the 1,400 posts planned reduction, 680 were expected to be transfers to other organisations that would not count towards the Gershon target. The Department change programme to deliver these reductions was announced in February 2003. The Gershon commitment to 720 net reductions was predicated on this programme and therefore agreement was made with HM Treasury for this specific target for an appropriate earlier baseline date.</p>
	<p pid="d.806W.4/3">The baseline for reductions in staffing of arms length bodies (ALBs) is 25,174 at <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. The targeted headcount reduction of 25 per cent. is a separate policy commitment as published in Reconfiguring the Department's Arms Length Bodies&quot; (July 2004). This does not form part of the Gershon headcount reduction targets, which relate specifically to civil servants. It is however a driver for cost efficiency savings in ALBs.</p>
	<p pid="d.806W.4/4">The target for Lyons relocations is full time equivalent 1,110 posts by March 2010. The baseline for this target is zero at March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.806W.4/5">There are no interim targets for headcount reductions (the Department or ALB), relocations or efficiency savings. The Department's commitment is to achieve the full savings by the target date of March 2008 for headcounts and efficiency savings and 2010 for relocations.</p>
	<p pid="d.806W.4/6">In our autumn performance report, published in December 2005, we reported a net reduction of 695 full time equivalent civil service posts at September 2005. We also reported efficiency savings of &pound;46 million for the public funding and regulation workstream, through the Department and ALB change programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.806W.4/7">The ALB programme is on track to deliver a reduction of around 900 full time equivalent posts by April 2006. Remaining reductions are planned to be delivered by reconfigurations due to take effect in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="d.822W.5/1">The Government intend to consult this year on the statutory overcrowding standards which are set in 1935. The definition fails to capture the complexity of modern society and is dated.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.5/2">In West Lancashire, funding from the Housing Corporation and the District Council will continue to support schemes and measures to tackle a range of housing issues including overcrowding. Part of this approach will be to better understand need, and the council's recent housing needs survey and the Annual Monitoring report will inform this.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.5/3">Changing the definition alone, will not tackle overcrowding, therefore the government will continue promoting better preventative approaches, and support investment in areas where required. The Government have doubled its investment in social housing from 1997 levels, and the Housing Corporation's programme of social housing investment over the next two years for every region will be available shortly at: <a href="http://www.housingcorp.gov.uk">www.housingcorp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.823W.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's 2003 based household projections for England, estimated that out of 209,000 additional household per year between 2003 and 2026 about 65,000 per year (31 per cent.) is attributable to net migration into England. This assumes migrants have a similar average household size to the average population.</p>
	<p pid="d.823W.2/2">Research for the Town and Country Planning Association takes account of the higher average household size of recent migrants and estimates that 23 per cent. of household growth is attributable to net migration. In the longer term, however, the average household size of migrants may move towards that of the overall population.</p>
	<p pid="d.823W.2/3">Out of the 209,000 additional households per year it is projected that 150,000 of these will be single person households, 72 per cent. of the growth. Most of these 'one person households' are projected in the older age groups, with 137,000 over 35 years and 55,000 over 65 years.</p>

This will replace the existing low cost home ownership programme and offers affordable home ownership on an equity sharing basis to social tenants, those on the housing register, key public sector workers and other first time buyers prioritised for assistance in their region by Regional Housing Boards. Over the five years to 2010, we aim to help over 100,000 households into sustainable home ownership who would not otherwise be able to afford it.</p>

Homebuy agents, who provide a one-stop shop for applicants for HomeBuy products, and other registered social landlords, will take credit ratings into account in assessing applicants' suitability to access and sustain home ownership.</p>

A further &pound;3 million is being made available for 2006&ndash;07.
