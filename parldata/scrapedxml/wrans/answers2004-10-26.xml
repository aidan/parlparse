	<p pid=".1091W.7/1">The Government have worked with industry and others to ensure that the benefits of the REACH proposals to human health and the environment are well focussed on achieving maximum practical benefit with a minimum of direct impact on industrial competitiveness. In particular our own proposals for &quot;one substance, one registration&quot; are intended to lower costs to industry as well as creating a level playing field across Europe and keeping animal testing to a minimum. We have presented proposals jointly with the Hungarian Government and received positive responses from other Governments to our proposals which will now be considered and discussed further within the EU. Estimates have to be based on proposals as they stand at any given stage and our suggestions are not yet part of the official proposals. Based on the Commission's proposals, the results from the UK partial Regulatory Impact Assessment referred to in the answers to questions 189034 and 189035 (i.e. an estimated direct cost of &pound;515 million over the 11 year phase in period which is equivalent to total direct costs across the EU of approximately &pound;2.4 billion) are estimates of the costs to be incurred by industry. This is in line with European Commission estimates published in October 2003 of a maximum overall cost of the revised proposal to be &euro;7.5 billion. We are currently carrying out further impact assessment work to assess the indirect costs passed down the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid=".1091W.7/2">The European Commission estimates published in October 2003 indicate that, in addition to testing and registration costs, the chemicals industry is estimated to pay some &euro;0.3 billion in fees to the new European chemicals agency. The costs of establishing and running the European chemicals agency under the REACH system were estimated at some &euro;0.4 billion as a one-off cost over 11 years. This cost will be met from the fees paid by industry (&euro;0.3 billion) and the remainder from the Community budget.</p>
	<p pid=".1091W.7/3">In the UK, the appointment of a Competent Authority or Authorities is a practical issue relating to the introduction of REACH and will be subject to a consultation exercise in the future.</p>

The strategy recognises that a flourishing biodiversity makes a real contribution to the quality of life of urban residents and visitors alike. It aims to ensure that biodiversity conservation is integral to sustainable urban communities by enhancing biodiversity in green spaces and among developments in urban areas so that they are used by wildlife and valued by people. It aims to ensure that construction, planning, development and regeneration have minimal impacts on biodiversity and enhance it where possible. A workstream group has been established to develop and take forward a work programme to implement the goals.</p>

These policies are firmly rooted in working with the grain of nature, including the objectives for urban areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1093W.0/1">There are no central records of the incidence of mastitis or lameness in dairy cattle. However, I am well aware of the seriousness of these welfare problems and their impact on the dairy industry.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.0/2">That is why we continue to fund research in these areas. We are currently funding two research projects into the causes and control of cattle lameness at a cost of more than &pound;800,000. Defra also has a contract with the Agricultural Development Advisory Service to run an advisory programme for farmers to encourage good welfare. A significant part of the contract is used for providing free advice to individual farmers, which often includes giving advice on ways they could help to alleviate mastitis and lameness levels in their herds. The most substantial part of the contract is used to fund awareness campaigns on topics of welfare concern. The campaigns aim to promote good practice, highlight the latest research and to discuss practical experiences. This year (and not for the first time) we are funding a series of meetings for farmers advising them on how to reduce the incidence of mastitis and promoting Defra's Mastitis Management Action Plan, which was developed in 1999. Lameness in dairy cattle has also been a major topic over the last few years. Last year, for example, we held a series of meetings on reducing injuries to dairy cows and produced an interactive CD-ROM aimed at helping farmers identify potential causes of injury to dairy cattle and provide guidance on minimising such risks.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.0/3">The Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Cattle (which was revised last year) and its associated publications also provide advice on how to treat and prevent mastitis and lameness in dairy cows.</p>

	<p pid=".1094W.0/1">The Countryside Agency funds Rural Transport Partnerships through their Vital Villages programme. The Agency will continue to fund existing projects and commitments until the Vital Villages programme closes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. From <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> Defra will devolve decision making on the delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to the regional development agencies. The regional development agencies are charged with contributing to the delivery of DEFRA's Public Service Agreement target to improve the accessibility of services for people in rural England. In recognition of their larger role in the delivery of DEFRA's policies, we have given the regional development agencies an additional &pound;21.3 million per annum for the years 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.0/2">These new arrangements will mean considerable changes for how DEFRA achieves its rural objectives. regional development agencies, working with their partners, will be responsible for deciding how to spend their resources and grants may not be available for the types of projects that have been supported through the Countryside Agency's Vital Villages programme hitherto. But I am confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the regional development agencies and increasing their resources, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.0/3">From now until the closure of the Vital Villages programme the Countryside Agency is working to mainstream the work of the Rural Transport Partnerships and share good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.0/4">&pound;14 million has been invested in the Vital Villages programme this year. Although separate figures for rural transport plans are not available, the larger Vital Villages programme underspent by &pound;80,000 in 2003&ndash;04. This underspend was not reallocated to DEFRA expenditure. In June the Agency published a &quot;Guide to Finding Funding for Rural Transport Partnership Projects&quot; (available in hard copy from the Agency and on their website, <a href="http://www.countryside.gov.uk">www.countryside.gov.uk</a>) and some funding for small scale community transport schemes, such as mini-bus links, is available through DEFRA's Rural Enterprise Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.0/5">The Agency published an evaluation of the Rural Transport Partnerships in June 2004 (also available in hard copy from the Agency and on their website) and is holding a national conference on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-27">27 October</phrase> to publicise the Partnerships' work and achievements.</p>

	<p pid=".1104W.9/1">There are 351 cases against the United Kingdom pending before the European Court of Human Rights that have been declared admissible or partly admissible by the Court. There has been an oral hearing in five of these cases, but the Court has not yet delivered its judgment on the merits. None of the remaining cases is at present scheduled for an oral hearing; owing to the enormous backlog of cases before the Court, oral hearings are now the exception rather than the rule.</p>

	<p pid=".1105W.0/1">I refer the hon. Member to paragraphs 366&ndash;387 of the report of the Butler Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction (HC898) which describe the role of intelligence in assessing the legality of the use of force against Iraq. This section of the report sets out the legal process, including when advice was given by the Attorney-General.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.0/2">The Butler Report also makes it clear that the advice concerned the legal interpretation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and not WMD-related intelligence. In paragraph 1 of UNSCR 1441, the Security Council itself decided that Iraq was, and remained, in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions. In paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, the Security Council also decided that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to the resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution would constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations. It is a question of fact whether there were any such false statements or omissions in Iraq's declarations and whether Iraq did comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution. As appears from paragraph 383 of the Butler Report, it was not for the Law Officers themselves to ascertain what those facts were. As stated in paragraph 385, the Prime Minister formed the view, based on information from a wide range of sources, including UNMOVIC reports, that there were false statements and omissions in the Iraqi declarations and also that Iraq had failed to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441.</p>

	<p pid=".1108W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that it is extremely important that people with disabilities and access needs are housed appropriately and that they have the right level of priority for housing under an allocation scheme. Furthermore, the Government want to see housing authorities, and other social landlords, make the best use of our housing stock, and this includes stock which is accessible or has been adapted.</p>
	<p pid=".1108W.5/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister considers that local authorities would find it useful to operate a disability housing register and should be encouraged to do so, but ultimately it should be up to the authority itself to decide whether it makes sense to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1108W.5/3">(1) The statutory Code of Guidance on the Allocation of Accommodation (paragraph 6.11) recommends that housing authorities maintain lists of properties that are suitable for people with disabilities and other special needs groups and that these could be made available to relevant applicants of social housing, free of charge. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consult with the Disability Rights Commission and other interested parties on how to strengthen the Code of Guidance to ensure that disabled people are housed appropriately and to make better use of properties which have been designed or adapted for disabled people. A revised Code of Guidance will be issued next year.</p>
	<p pid=".1108W.5/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is developing a national standard for measuring accessibility through the National Register of Social Housing (NROSH) which should be available by September 2005. NROSH will be a central record of social housing and will collect information on the attributes of each dwelling including size, type and rent. These attributes include three measures of accessibility; first, whether the dwelling meets one of the recognised standards (Lifetime Homes, Housing Corporation Design Standards or Building Regulations&mdash;Part M); secondly, counts of the number of steps outside and within the dwelling or block; and finally a record of adaptations which have been carried out. By establishing a national standard for recording accessibility NROSH will assist local authorities in the setting up of local registers. The surveying of properties to collect accessibility information and provision of this to NROSH will be at the discretion of local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1108W.5/5">(2) The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not collect this information.</p>

It asks local planning authorities to assess the need for Gypsy accommodation in their areas and, wherever possible, to identify in their plans locations suitable for Gypsy sites, whether local authority or private sites. Where this is not possible authorities are asked to set out clear, realistic criteria for suitable locations as a basis for site provision policies.

	<p pid=".1109W.5/1">The industry estimates that around 7,500 home inspectors (some working full time some working part time) will be needed to compile home condition reports for home information packs in England and Wales. As this new qualification is dependent on the passage of the Housing Bill, there are no qualified home inspectors yet. However, independent research by Asset Skills, the relevant sector skills council, shows that between 10,000 and 18,000 people working in property services or related industries are expected to convert to work as home inspectors. This indicates that there will be sufficient qualified inspectors available to provide the required number of home condition reports when the reforms are implemented in January 2007. All home inspectors will have to belong to a certification scheme and will have to obtain the required home inspection qualification before they can become members. The length of training will depend on the candidate's level of existing knowledge and experience. This could range between a matter of months for a RICS surveyor already doing similar work, to the equivalent of a full time two year course followed by a period of &quot;on the job&quot; training for someone with no previous experience.</p>

But we will not introduce compulsory home condition reports until we are satisfied that all the necessary elements are in place, including satisfactory indemnity insurance for home inspectors. This continues to be the subject of extensive research and discussion and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has established programme management arrangements involving consumer representatives and key industry stakeholders to provide help and guidance on this. Assisted by the Association of British Insurers and our industry working group, discussions with commercial insurers are taking place aimed at identifying options based on a commercial approach. The possible basis for an insurance regime will be published when this work is complete. Discussions with leading commercial insurers indicate that they are broadly comfortable with the proposals and that there is an appetite to insure home inspectors.</p>

	<p pid=".1111W.5/1">The Government strongly believe that the issues of social inclusion, neighbourhood renewal, and local and regional prosperity are tightly interlinked. A partnership approach&mdash;not only across Government Departments but also more widely with local and regional service providers and policy makers&mdash;are essential to tackle the difficult issues underlying deprivation and social exclusion. Both the Social Exclusion Unit and the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit work closely with all Government Departments, and this work has already produced tangible results:</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.5/2" class="indent">on crime, where the average burglary rate in the 88 most deprived local authority areas has seen significant falls;</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.5/3" class="indent">on education, where the average pass rate gap (for five good GCSEs&mdash;grade A-C) between the 88 local authority areas and the English average continues to narrow at a faster rate;</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.5/4" class="indent">on worklessness, where the rise in employment rates has climbed faster in the 88 areas than it has nationally; and</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.5/5" class="indent">through investing in children to break the cycle of disadvantage, with the Government increasing financial support for children by &pound;10 billion since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.5/6">The Government have also successfully strengthened the regional tier in order to draw together the policies, strategies and funding streams of many departments. The Government Offices for the Regions carry out work on behalf of 10 Government Departments, influence regional investment of around &pound;9 billion and are involved in the delivery of 39 national Public Service Agreements. They play a key role in delivering the Government's policies for neighbourhood renewal, social inclusion and regional economic performance, using their programmes and influence to enable regions and localities to become better, more sustainable communities in which to live and work.</p>

	<p pid=".1116W.0/1">The number of cycling trips per person per year has remained broadly similar at a national level since 1996.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.0/2">The Department for Transport is currently engaged in a review of the effectiveness of the National Cycling Strategy. This includes the work of the English Regions Cycling Development Team, which has been provided by AEA Technology under a contract that expires in May 2005. The Team carried out an important assessment of local highway authorities provision for cycling which has considerably improved our knowledge base. Its advice has also improved local and national practice. The Department is now looking for a more flexible resource than a single team to support the development of cycling and the contract will not therefore be renewed or extended.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.0/3">Local authorities' provision for cycling will remain a key part of the second Local Transport Plans, which will be submitted to my Department in July 2005. Officials will be involved in the development of all aspects of those Plans and the advice of the English Regions Cycling Development Team will be sought on the elements related to cycling, including targets. Progress under the Plans will be measured through the established system of annual progress reporting.</p>

	<p pid=".1133W.5/1">An evaluation of the National Reassurance Policing Programme has been commissioned. This study will assess the impact of police activity on public feelings of safety and security, community engagement, confidence in, and satisfaction with, the police in 16 pilot sites around the country. Two of the sites, Bexley and Enfield, are also part of the Safer Neighbourhoods Programme in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) area. The evaluation is based upon a repeat survey of residents in pilot and control areas during Winter 2003&ndash;04 and Winter 2004&ndash;05. The respondents were randomly sampled to render the findings more robust. The results should be available in autumn 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1133W.5/2">The MPS are conducting their own internal assessment of the Safer Neighbourhoods Programme for operational purposes. They are rolling out a public attitudes survey across the 96 wards involved in the programme. Residents in the first six wards were interviewed in April using a quota sample. A second quota sample of residents in the same six wards was taken in August.</p>
	<p pid=".1133W.5/3">The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis reports that the introduction of Safer Neighbourhoods Teams is making a discernible impact across London. The feedback is extremely favourable: the public, the business sector and police partners are supportive of the programme. It is placing an increased uniform presence on the streets, increasing accessibility to policing services, galvanising community cohesion, impacting on crime, providing benefits to the wider community and providing the necessary familiarity to increase public confidence in the police service.</p>

	<p pid=".1138W.0/1">The British Embassy in Luanda, in partnership with British Petroleum (BP), co-funded a pilot project to give the village of Paranhos communal lighting, power supply to the school and clinic, potable water and some domestic lighting. Paranhos was selected in part because it houses roughly equal numbers of families from both sides of Angola's civil war. The project, as well as demonstrating the viability of renewable energy, is also an important part of the process of national reintegration.</p>
	<p pid=".1138W.0/2">This small pilot project and BP's interest in setting it up are welcome. I hope that BP and the Government of Angola are able to follow this up to ensure that the equipment continues to operate properly, providing a useful service to the selected village. No doubt, there are valuable lessons that can be learnt from this project, not least how best it might be replicated on a larger scale to provide permanent, reliable services.</p>
	<p pid=".1138W.0/3">In general, while solar energy can deliver useful benefits, it does have limitations, notably its inability to provide heat for cooking, the main energy requirement for most households in Africa. Other issues, such as the need to periodically replace expensive batteries, were taken into account in the design of the Paranhos project. This experience and the lessons learnt from this pilot need to be properly understood before there is any consideration of expanding it to other communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1138W.0/4">DFID is not providing support for renewable energy sources in Angola. However, more generally, DFID has funded some 75 energy projects since 1992 through our Knowledge and Research Programme (47 of which were started since May 1997) with a total value of &pound;10 million, of which &pound;3.6 million was spent on the development and promotion of renewable energy, especially for rural communities in developing countries. These have covered a wide range of technologies, including wind, small hydropower, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal and biomass.</p>
	<p pid=".1138W.0/5">DFID has recently signed a Programme Partnership Agreement with an international UK-based NGO, Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) for &pound;750,000 per year. Much of their work is the promotion of small-scale renewable energy technologies in developing countries to improve access to energy services, especially for poor communities.</p>

The EC's humanitarian aid programme provides assistance, relief and protection to victims of natural disasters and man-made crises in third countries, as well as preparedness for risks of natural disasters. It approves annual allocations ('global plans') to countries suffering chronic humanitarian crises, as well as emergency response to disasters.</p>

	<p pid=".1143W.0/1">DFID's policy is to tackle illegal logging and its associated trade, in partnership with timber-producing countries. This requires action on demand as well as supply. The UK, as a significant consumer of timber products, shares responsibility with these countries to find solutions to this global problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1143W.0/2">DFID supports regional forest law enforcement and governance processes in Asia and Africa that help build awareness of the problems of illegal logging and the political commitment to tackle them. DFID has also recently started work with Russia on a forest law enforcement and governance process covering Eastern Europe and North Asia. In Indonesia DFID has a programme of work under a Memorandum of Understanding that commits both governments to tackle illegal logging and associated trade.</p>
	<p pid=".1143W.0/3">The UK Government are playing an active role in implementing the EU Forest Law Enforcement and Governance and Trade Action Plan. This includes development of EU legislation to prevent imports of illegally logged timber into the single market and support for timber producing countries to improve their forest governance. UK Central Government are also working towards ensuring that timber and timber products are procured from legal and sustainable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".1143W.0/4">In all of this work, DFID co-operates closely with other parts of Government, particularly Defra and FCO, as well as the private sector and NGOs.</p>

	<p pid=".1146W.3/1">The EU's CAP regime for sugar is a heavily regulated, highly protected and discriminatory one. It is also extremely costly to the consumer and taxpayer. By maintaining high guaranteed prices for production which are well above world market prices, high tariffs on most imports, and heavily subsidising exports, the regime encourages over-production in the EU and dumps millions of tonnes of subsidised sugar onto world markets each year. It has the effect of depressing world prices, and it crowds developing countries out of local markets which they would otherwise be able to supply. Some traditional suppliers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific regions (ACP), do have preferential access to the EU market under an arrangement called the Sugar Protocol. Most of the countries in Africa and Asia who are sugar producers or potential sugar producers are currently denied preferential access to the EU market. For these and other reasons, reform of the regime is both necessary and desirable, and long overdue.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.3/2">The European Commission presented a Communication to the Agriculture Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-19">19 July</phrase> that set out their preferred approach to reform. The Communication proposes to substantially reduce sugar exports and export refunds, abolish intervention, restructure EU production at a lower level, reduce the internal sugar price and grant a de-coupled payment to sugar beet farmers. The reform process would start in July 2005. This should make the regime more market oriented and reduce the quantity of EU sugar exported to third markets. If the option were to be agreed, the Commission estimate that the combined, aggregate effect of the proposals on support price and quota reduction would be a significant reduction in the level of EU production under quota, from 17.3 million to 14.5 million tonnes per year. In turn, as a consequence of the substantial reduction in the overall level of EU production, EU subsidised sugar exports&mdash;dumping&mdash;are projected to fall by around 2 million tonnes. The Commission Communication will be the subject of discussion between the EU member states over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.3/3">However, there will be winners and losers from this reform, just as there are winners and losers from the current regime. Those preferential suppliers to the EU who receive prices very similar to EU producers will see these prices fall. DFID has always stressed the need to take account of the impact that reform of the EU sugar regime will have on our developing country preferential suppliers. We are conscious that substantial reform will give rise to transitional problems for the ACP counties, and for Least Developed Countries (LDC) seeking to develop an export trade to Europe under the Everything But Arms initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.3/4">In order to help inform the debate and ensure the impact on developing countries is taken sufficiently into consideration, DFID commissioned a study last year with LMC International and Oxford Policy Management, 'Addressing the Impact of Preference Erosion in Sugar on Developing Countries'. The study is divided into two sections. The first part assesses the economic and social impact on the ACP Sugar Protocol countries of the various reform scenarios suggested by the European Commission. The latter part of the study assesses alternative options for addressing the impact of preference erosion in sugar. The purpose of this analysis was to identify various options for debate by the ACP and the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.3/5">DFID has recently commissioned two further pieces of work on this issue. The first report has been commissioned with LMC International, 'EU Sugar Reform: the Implications for the Development of LDCs' and should be finalised very soon. The second report has been commissioned from the Overseas Development Institute, 'Forthcoming changes in EU sugar/banana markets: a menu of options for an effective EU transitional assistance package' and should also be finalised very soon. This report should help those countries affected by reform determine their priorities for a transitional package. This report will include some analysis of alternative uses for sugar.</p>

In monetary terms this amounted to &pound;559,000 in financial year 2003&ndash;04. The planned figure for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;500,000.

The final decision on any proposals would be for the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision, an independent schools adjudicator. The Secretary of State has no role in such matters.</p>

	<p pid=".1166W.6/1">The available information on the non-continuation of students beyond the first year in each university, and the projected course non-completion rate in each university is contained in &quot;Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK&quot;. The publication was produced by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) up until the current year when the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) took over publication. The latest edition was published by HESA in September 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1166W.6/2">The figures cover full time first degree courses only and show, for each individual HE institution in the UK, the numbers and proportion of entrants who fail to complete their course. Copies of the publication are available for students starting courses in each year from 1996&ndash;97 to 2001&ndash;02. Copies of the publication covering data up to 1999&ndash;2000 are available from the House Library. Additionally, the publications up to and including figures for 2000&ndash;01, can be found on the HEFCE website (<a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs</a>) and the publication for the most recent year can be found on the HESA website (<a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/press/pr78/pr78.htm">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/press/pr78/pr78.htm</a>). For full time first degree entrants at UK institutions in 2001&ndash;02, table 3a shows that around 27,000 (9.0 per cent.) students did not continue beyond the first year and table 5 shows the number of students projected to not complete over the whole course is around 42,000 (14.1 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid=".1167W.2/1">The national rate of non-completion for those full-time students starting first degree courses in 2001&ndash;02 is 14. per cent. compared with 15 per cent. for the cohort starting in 2000&ndash;01. This represents one of the highest completion rates amongst OECD countries and we are determined to maintain this level of performance.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.2/2">We have asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to bear down on non-completion and their national co-ordination team, Action on Access, is working with institutions to improve retention rates and to spread good practice from those institutions with low drop-out rates and good access figures. In addition, the &pound;273 million which HEFCE has allocated to institutions in 2004&ndash;05 for widening access and improving retention recognises some of the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and those who are less well prepared for higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.2/3">Research indicates that the reasons for non-completion are many and varied, but one factor is incompatibility between the student and their course or institution. It is vital that potential higher education (HE) students have the right information on which tobase sound decisions. This is why we have worked with the National Union of Students to develop a new guide to HE, linked to the new Aimhigher portal, which will help students search for information about any aspect of HE. We are working with HEFCE to develop a range of published information about the quality and standards of institutions' programmes and a National Student Survey. Both will give students better information to help them make informed choices about where and what to study.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.2/4">Another factor which has been associated with non-completion is financial hardship. In addition to statutory student support, discretionary support through the Access to Learning Fund is also available as a safety net for vulnerable students. The Access to Learning Fund is administered by Higher Education Institutions and provides additional non-repayable grant support to help students access and remain in higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.2/5">From 2006&ndash;7, as a consequence of commitments made during the passage of the Higher Education Bill, we propose to ensure that students entering higher education will receive up to &pound;2,700 in up-front support. We also intend to raise the levels of maintenance loan to meet the basic living costs of the mid-range student, in response to the recent Student Income and Expenditure Survey. Additionally, institutions will, under the terms of access agreements, be required to provide further financial help to poorer students in the form of bursaries.</p>

In summary, non-completion is one of the categories of the projected outcomes. These outcomes are derived by linking students from one year to the next to create a matrix of possible outcomes which is then used to calculate the projected outcomes. For the most recent projected outcomes, which cover students starting first degree courses in 2001&ndash;02, changes were made to <i>(a)</i> the method of linking students and <i>(b)</i> the categories used in the matrix. The effect of the changes to the linking on the national figures is quite small. Some institutions show changes that appear relatively large, but these are mainly the small institutions where relatively large fluctuations are common. Similarly, the effect of the changes to the matrix at national level is small, and for most institutions there is no discernible effect.</p>

Our ambassador to Laos (resident in Bangkok) also raised the treatment of Christians with the Lao authorities in June; and we again raised general human rights issues, including prisoners, at official level in September.

	<p pid=".1178W.3/1">The UK abstained on the Security Council Resolution on Israeli military action in Gaza because the text on which we were called to vote gave the impression that fault lies only on the Israeli side. It is our view that the responsibility for taking steps to end violence lies with both sides. We proposed amendments that would have seen the Security Council resolution acknowledge Israel's right to defend itself against terrorism and make clear that the international community's concerns are about actions disproportionate to the threat. We also proposed that the resolution call on the Palestinian Authority to take firm action against acts of terrorism and their perpetrators. Unfortunately the sponsors of the text refused to accept our amendments.</p>

	<p pid=".1181W.9/1">In April 1996, the Departmental Board of the former Department of Social Security agreed a feasibility study to identify and examine a range of options for the future management of the DSS Estate. The study, known as PRIME (Private Sector Resource Initiative for Management of the Estate), concluded that greater efficiency could be achieved if both ownership and management of the Estate was transferred to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.9/2">The opportunity was advertised on <phrase class="date" code="1996-06-28">28 June 1996</phrase> in the <i>Financial Times</i> and in the <i>European Journal</i> in accordance with EEC/GATT rules. Thirty initial written response were received, and a sift exercise was completed, from which six candidates were chosen. Three consortia were selected to go forward to the final selection process. However, all three consortia had placed a lot of conditions on their tender submissions which could have had a material effect on the final price. It was agreed, therefore, to extend the procurement process to a fourth stage. Consequently, two consortia, Mapeley Holdings Ltd. and PPM (Partnership Property Management Ltd.), now known as LandSecurities Trillium, were invited to submit best and final offers which removed all conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.9/3">Following evaluation of the tenders, Trillium was chosen as preferred supplier. This was endorsed by the Departmental Board at their July meeting and, after obtaining Ministerial agreement, an announcement was made on <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-31">31 July 1997</phrase>. The finer details of the contract were negotiated through to December and an agreement was formally signed at mid-day on Christmas Eve.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.9/4">The evaluation process was a tightly controlled three stage procedure and included eight review groups with technical and operational representatives from across DSS, and who were independent from the project team.</p>

Information and support for the carers of confused people.&quot; At a local level, a range of services exist to support carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Southwark Carers provide funding for breaks, travel cost support, counselling provision and advice, which includes welfare rights support, and housing issues. They also run a taxi scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.12/4">In addition, carers who are in need of help or support, can access secondary mental health services directly via the North Southwark Community Mental Health Team for Older Adults.

	<p pid=".1190W.8/1">With regard to reducing human and environmental exposure to chemicals identified as of potential risk, the United Kingdom Government have for some time recognised the need to develop a fast, efficient and workable process for testing, screening and tackling those of most concern first, while minimising animal testing. To this end, the Government strongly supports the proposals by the European Commission for a new system to gather hazard information, assess risks, classify, label, and restrict the marketing and use of individual chemicals and mixtures. This is known as REACH&mdash;registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals.</p>
	<p pid=".1190W.8/2">In the REACH negotiations, led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Government supports the aim of the authorisation process to ensure that the risks from substances of high concern are properly controlled and that these substances are eventually replaced by suitable substances or technologies, with the aim of reducing risks to human health and the environment. The Government also supports the inclusion in REACH, of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, very persistent and very bioaccumulative chemicals and substances of equivalent concern, such as endocrine, also known as hormone disrupters, when scientifically validated test methods have been developed and criteria established.</p>
	<p pid=".1190W.8/3">The Department also considers the potential effect of endocrine disrupting natural substances in the diet and has provided, for example, advice on soy-based infant formula as a result of an extensive review of oestrogen-like compounds in plants by its expert committee (published in May 2003).</p>

	<p pid=".1193W.5/1">In the period between entry to medical school and full registration, it is estimated that training a doctor costs between &pound;200,000 and &pound;250,000. Doctors generally continue training after full registration. As the duration and nature of post-registration training varies greatly, and as service and training costs are closely related, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.</p>

	<p pid=".1194W.2/1">The Department's policy with regard to local choice about information technology (IT) provision remains as stated in the guidance agreed jointly with the British Medical Association. Each general practitioner practice should have a choice of more than one system so long as these have been accredited against national standards and can deliver the required functionality. Guidance published on the national programme for IT (NPfIT) website makes it clear that existing suppliers play an important role in current and future national health service IT service provision.</p>

	<p pid=".1199W.2/1">The Department is committed to improving the quality of maternity services and extending choice in maternity services for all women.</p>
	<p pid=".1199W.2/2">Maternity services were included in the national consultation exercise &quot;Choice, responsiveness and equity&quot;&mdash;to improve patient and user experience in the National Health Service (NHS). The results of the consultation were published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-09">9 December 2003</phrase> in &quot;Building on the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equality in the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1199W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-15">15 September</phrase> the Department published the children, young people and maternity services national service framework (NSF). The maternity module of the NSF looks at how to make maternity services more flexible, accessible and appropriate. The maternity module of the NSF builds on the work contained in &quot;Building on the Best&quot;, including the emphasis on direct access to midwives and the development of birth plans.</p>
	<p pid=".1199W.2/4">The Department has worked with the organisation Dr. Foster to produce local &quot;You're Pregnant&quot; maternity guides, which were published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-22">22 December 2003</phrase>. The guides give women and their families information about a range of maternity services in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1199W.2/5">In addition to a 6.2 per cent. per annum increase in funding to primary care trusts over the last five years, specific funding has been allocated for maternity services. &pound;100 million capital investment was made available over two years (2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03) to refurbish and modernise over 200 maternity units in England to improve the environment in which care is provided and better to meet the needs of women and their families. The &pound;100 million was allocated on the basis of individual bids submitted by maternity units after consultation with local staff and users.</p>

	<p pid=".1201W.2/2">The director's brief is to deliver change at a national level, within the context of the NHS improvement plan, to help ensure health and social care services are available on an equitable basis and support the NHS in integrating equality and diversity into its corporate strategies and actions. Through this, the director will assist the Department and NHS in complying with their legal duties in relation to equality and human rights, and developing good practice, but he will not have legal enforcement powers.</p>

	<p pid=".1207W.0/1">Since 2002 the Ministry of Defence's strategy has been to reduce the number of small contracts regularly placed for clothing. The aim was to award a longer term contract under a partnering arrangement that would introduce improvements in product and supply chain costs. Following competition, a contract was awarded in June 2004 for both combat and non-combat clothing manufactured by a cut and sewn method, and is expected to generate potential savings of &pound;23 million compared to traditional procurement methods.</p>

No steps were taken to obtain a representative from victims wounded or left bereaved by IRA terrorists. This was essentially a technical seminar, designed to show to a European audience how the EU PEACE II Programme was being implemented. The seminar included a presentation on an ex-prisoners project with a cross-community dimension which had benefited from the Programme. The organisers regret that the platform presentations did not encompass a wider range of projects supported under the PEACE II Programme.</p>
