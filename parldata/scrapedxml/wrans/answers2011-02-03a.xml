	<p pid="a.876W.11/2">For example, in response to public concerns about the fear of litigation, in October 2010 the Department for Transport published straightforward guidance for households and traders who wish to act in a neighbourly way by clearing snow and ice from paths in front of property, pavements and other public spaces. It was clear during the recent spell of severe winter weather that the overwhelming majority of people want to take social action in a common sense way, whilst showing neighbourliness and generosity of spirit in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.11/3">Furthermore, the recently published Local Transport White Paper, encourages local authorities to form greater partnership with the voluntary, community, and social enterprises sector and citizens in the design and delivery of local sustainable transport solutions. This is intended to lead to greater community empowerment, the opening up of public services and to further the promotion of social action to achieve the local outcomes people want.</p>

In delivering this commitment the Government have already confirmed that this will include an ambitious requirement for energy efficiency in the fabric of new homes. In addition to this the Government have commissioned further work from the zero carbon hub on the right levels of on-site reductions and we are awaiting the full findings of this work. It is widely accepted that for the majority of new homes it is not feasible to deal with all emissions on-site; given this, Government are working with industry to develop off-site mechanisms to deliver additional cost effective carbon savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.886W.9/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) employs consultants only when the necessary skills are unavailable from permanent FCO staff. We apply a strict value for money test to all consultancy use in line with central Government guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.9/2">The FCO spent &#163;11.98 million on consultancy services between May and November 2010 (December 2010 data are not yet available). This was spent on practical projects to improve the FCO's global operations and provide better value for money for the taxpayer. It funded in particular the provision of the external technical expertise necessary to develop better IT systems and a more modern global estate. A significant proportion supported the Echo project, which is designed to deliver better and cheaper global IT services to the FCO and other Government Departments and save the taxpayer up to &#163;90 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.893W.6/1">The Government have no current plans to conduct such an assessment. However, we are committed to speeding up the implementation of individual electoral registration and later this year as part of that we will be trialling data matching-comparing the electoral register against other public databases to find individuals missing from the register and allow EROs to encourage them to register. If these trials are successful we will roll data matching out nationally, which will improve the accuracy and completeness of the electoral register.</p>

	<p pid="a.896W.3/1">A key priority for the Department around the provision of customer information is to ensure that it is both accurate and up-to-date across both online and offline channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.3/2">The information on departmental websites, including Directgov since the Jobcentre Plus website closed, is subject to the Accuracy of Information framework. This framework is audited by the Department's Risk Assurance Division (RAD) who seek assurance from the nominated Senior Responsible Office (SRO) within the Department that information is correct. The Department, in turn, seeks assurance from the businesses, including Jobcentre Plus, that information is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.3/3">The Department's content on Directgov is reviewed annually, or more frequently if, for example, a policy changes. The review process requires the owner of the policy to confirm the accuracy of the information developed by them, or in collaboration with them, before it is published on Directgov. Responsibility for obtaining this assurance rests with DWP Communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.3/4">Content on Businesslink is also reviewed by policy owners at least once a year or more frequently if, for example, a policy changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.899W.2/1">Employment and support allowance (ESA) was introduced in October 2008. A key factor in determining eligibility for ESA is the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). The WCA is carried out by health care professionals employed by Atos Healthcare. A report of the WCA is then sent to Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.2/2">Jobcentre Plus decision makers (JCP DMs) have to consider all the available information before making a decision on benefit entitlement. Any additional evidence provided by a customer's GP or consultant is important and is fully considered as part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.2/3">The Department therefore holds information on both the recommendation made by Atos Healthcare at assessment and separate information on the JCP DM's final decision. We can determine where the decision differs but not why the decision was changed or whether a case was returned for reconsideration. Where the final JCP DM decision differs to the original Atos recommendation we refer to the decision being a result of 'at reconsideration' which may or not involve a return of the case to Atos.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.2/4">The number of people for whom Atos recommended they be placed in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) and the Support Group (SG) and additional people who were placed in the WRAG or SG based on the JCP DM decision is presented in the following table.

	<p pid="a.905W.5/1">DEFRA is committed to reducing carbon emissions from its estate and has taken a number of actions through the 10% CO2 reduction initiative to implement projects which will improve its performance and deliver further savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.5/2">To date, improvements have been made to a number of buildings across the DEFRA estate. Improvements to plant controls and Building Management Systems (BMS); improved insulation; and installation of energy efficient technologies such as voltage optimisation, boiler optimisation, and low energy lighting, are examples of initiatives implemented to meet the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.5/3">These initiatives have been supported by the introduction of a 19&#176; C winter heating temperature set point across the DEFRA estate, tighter control of heating and lighting times and staff awareness campaigns which have encouraged participation and support. These campaigns have enabled the Department to identify additional ideas for delivering further savings and help to embed culture change.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.5/4">Delivery of the 10% CO2 target is enabling DEFRA to demonstrate its commitment to reducing CO2 emissions. This follows on from its achievement of the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) 2010 target for carbon reduction from offices in 2009, where it met and exceeded the target. DEFRA is now less than 0.5% away from achieving the 2020 target of a 30% reduction in its CO2 emissions. Since 2006, the Department has delivered an average 4% reduction year on year 2006 to 2009 and a 12.5% reduction in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.5/5">DEFRA's CO2 reduction performance is a direct result of the implementation of measures identified through its ongoing Carbon Reduction Programme. Since 2006, this programme has identified and reduced excessive energy consumption across the network estate. This has been delivered through a structured approach to the analysis and benchmarking of energy consumption data and a focus on quick win, high carbon saving projects. DEFRA's achievements have often set the benchmark for the sustainability industry. Specific achievements have been recognised through Carbon Trust Standard, BREEAM outstanding ratings and internationally through CoreNet Global.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.3/1">The Coalition programme for government included a commitment to improve the recording of hate crime offences. This has been implemented and the official collection of this data will begin in April 2011. This collection of data will cover the five 'monitored' hate crime strands and, at this time, it will not be possible to disaggregate this data down further. We will continue discussions with the police to see whether it is feasible to break this data down further so that anti-Semitic hate crime can be collected. These discussions will have to include whether the disaggregation of this data will add to the bureaucratic burden on police officers, which is something the Government have committed to reduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.3/2">The Community Security Trust (CST) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) National Community Tension Team (NCTT) collect data on reports of anti-Semitic hate crime and will continue to do so. The ACPO NCTT data, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase> showed that there were 703 anti-Semitic hate crimes in calendar year 2009.

We will retain legal aid in Community Care cases. Legal aid will also continue to be available where it is now for unlawful discrimination employment cases.

	<p pid="a.940W.0/18">The reduction in the net expenditure is due to a number of factors, including, the removal of personal injury from the scope of legal aid, and the introduction of 'risk rates' for multi-party actions where legal aid is paid at a third of the market rates throughout the duration of those cases where the full legal costs are likely to be recovered from the opposing party. The high spend in the early 2000s was due to discontinuing a number of very expensive actions, and the recoveries in the mid 2000s were due to success in a number of child abuse cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.945W.2/1">This Government welcomes the Age UK report, &quot;Invisible but Invaluable&quot;. We do recognise the valuable contribution made by older carers, many of whom spend a significant proportion of their life providing unpaid support to family members or friends. Local authorities and the national health service have a vital role to play in identifying and supporting more carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/2">In November 2010, the Government published &quot;Recognised, valued and supported: next steps for the Carers Strategy&quot;. The Strategy is a cross Government strategy and shows how Government intend to support carers in terms of the outcomes and plans of health, social care, education and other services across Government. Two of the key recommendations were:</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/3" class="indent">supporting those with caring responsibilities to identify themselves as carers at an early stage, recognising the value of their contribution and involving them from the outset both in designing local care provision and in planning individual care packages; and</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/4" class="indent">enabling those with caring responsibilities to fulfil their educational and personalised support both for carers and those they support, enabling them to have a family and community life.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/5">These have been supported by:</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/6" class="indent">the Department has provided funding of over &#163;63,000 plus VAT for the training of up to 200 general practitioners (GPs) and practice staff in the current financial year. As a result of this training, GPs and practice staff will be better able to identify and support carers; and</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.2/7" class="indent">an additional &#163;400 million in primary care trust (PCT) baselines to support the provision of breaks for carers. The &quot;Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12&quot; indicates that PCTs should pool budgets with local authorities to provide carers' breaks, as far as possible, via direct payments or personal health budgets. This money is not ring fenced but for 2011-12, PCTs should agree policies, plans and budgets to support carers with local authorities and local carers' organisations, and make them available to local people.</p>

	<p pid="a.950W.9/1">From April 2013, upper tier and unitary local authorities will receive a new ring-fenced public health grant, in order to improve the health of their local population. The size of the ring-fenced grant will be based on relative population health need and weighted for inequalities. We are currently consulting on the range of activity for which local authorities will take responsibility and this will be key in determining the size of the grant. Work is also ongoing to determine baseline spending on public health activities in the national health service and this will inform the process of determining the size of the local authority public health grant. Our consultation also seeks views on the approach we should take to public health allocations.</p>

We intend to establish a stakeholder group to assist in this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.956W.2/1">This Department is leading work aimed at making the provision of information, advice and education to consumers simpler and more effective. The organisations at the focus of this work are Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland. These are the umbrella organisations for the citizens advice bureaux that have a unique track record in providing advice to citizens, often those who are vulnerable or come from deprived communities. This includes consumer advice. In 2009/10 Citizens Advice helped 2.1 million people with over seven million problems at 3,500 locations in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.2/2">This Department is also involved with Consumer Direct (CD) which is an online and telephone advice service funded and managed by the Office of Fair Trading. It handles approximately 1.7 million telephone calls and emails annually often helping those who are vulnerable or come from deprived communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.2/3">Although at the national level CD does not specifically target communities, individual CD centres work with a range of community groups to give targeted advice and information. 40% of the contacts handled by CD are from people whose annual household income is less than &#163;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.956W.2/4">This Department is also discussing with the consumer organisation Which? about making wider use of its online information and thereby reducing the costs to the taxpayer of providing such information.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.6/1">We receive occasional correspondence on stigma in relation to claiming free school meals. It is an issue that we take very seriously-there are clear financial and nutritional benefits for pupils from poorer families taking a free school lunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/2">Cashless catering or 'swipe card' arrangements, integrated dining/queuing and pricing meals so that the cost of a meal is the same for those on free lunches as it is for others, are some of the helpful ways schools can minimise the easy identification and stigmatisation of pupils on free meals. Many schools have chosen to invest their targeted kitchen capital funding in cashless systems for this reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/3">The Department has worked closely with other Government Departments to develop a Free School Meals Eligibility Checking System, known as &quot;the ECS&quot;. The ECS enables local authorities to check data from the Department for Work and Pensions, the Home Office and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in order to find out if a family qualifies for free school meals. It represents a significant achievement in reducing bureaucracy and cost for local authorities and encouraging more parents to sign up their children for a free school lunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/4">Bullying or victimisation of pupils claiming free school meals is totally unacceptable. This is why we are now strengthening head teachers' authority to enforce discipline and ensure good behaviour both in and out of school.</p>

Capital funding of up to &#163;50 million has been set aside in 2010-11 to meet the needs of Free Schools. Beyond that, the provision for Free Schools forms part of the overall spending review settlement for schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.966W.14/1">The Department receives a number of complaints from parents on a variety of school attendance related matters. These are usually considered under section 496/7 of the Education Act 1996. The decision whether or not to authorise individual pupil absences rests with the person who has responsibility for the school register (normally the head teacher) and the governing body of the school which has overall responsibility for the register. Where a governing body has followed the relevant attendance regulations it is unlikely that there will be grounds for the Secretary of State to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.14/2">The Secretary of State has power to intervene under section 496/7 of the Education Act 1996 if he considers that the governing body of a maintained school or a local authority has acted unreasonably in the exercise of their powers or duties (section 496) or that they have failed to carry out a duty (section 497). Every matter that is referred to the Secretary of State under section 496 /497 will be considered on the individual merits of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.14/3">Where attendance becomes problematic schools should address the matter informally with parents in the first instance. They may also want to back this up with voluntary parenting contracts that provide support to parents to enable them to manage their child's school attendance.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.14/4">Where parents are unwilling or refuse to co-operate then decisions will have to be taken at a local level in relation to more rigorous sanctions-such as sanctions under the school attendance order framework, including school attendance orders, prosecutions, penalty notices, parenting orders. Ultimately these decisions are made by local authorities and by the courts. We do expect prosecutions to be used as a last resort where other strategies to address poor attendance have failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.14/5">Local authorities receive information on pupil attendance from the schools in their area. They are under a duty to use the school attendance order statutory framework where they identify that a child may not be receiving suitable education because of a failure to attend school regularly, Parents can be prosecuted for failure to comply with a school attendance order. There is provision within the school attendance order framework for parents to complain to the Secretary of State if they feel that the local authority has acted unreasonably in continuing to enforce a school attendance order. The Secretary of State can in these circumstances make whatever direction he thinks fit. Again, each case would be considered on its merits.</p>

Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or Young People's Learning Agency if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.968W.2/3">Local authorities will also attract the pupil premium for looked-after children which will be allocated to local authorities for pupils who at some point in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> were looked after continuously for at least six months, and who were aged four to 15 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August 2009</phrase> as recorded on the April 2010 local authority return.

	<p pid="a.968W.2/4">The January 2010 school censuses allow an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In Coventry in January 2010 there were 10,395 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;4,469,850. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. The number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.968W.2/5">The question of how many young people in Coventry received EMA is a matter for the Young People's Learning Agency who operate the education maintenance allowance for the Department for Education.

	<p pid="a.972W.2/1">For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE.</p>
	<p pid="a.972W.2/2">However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>
