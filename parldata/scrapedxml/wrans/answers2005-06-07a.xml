	<p pid="a.443W.4/1">Post-mortem testing of badgers killed in road accidents is carried out under the Road Traffic Accident (RTA) survey. This was established on the advice of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) and is conducted in seven English counties (Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Dorset).

	<p pid="a.444W.5/1">The Government have undertaken an extensive engagement process with stakeholders on recommendations on inshore fisheries management made by both the Strategy Unit report on the UK fishing industry (Net benefits&quot;) and the Bradley review of fisheries and environmental management. The English Inshore Fisheries Working Group which met as part of that process reached agreement on an updated set of responsibilities and powers which would be needed to operate a modern, efficient system of inshore management and have submitted their report on this to me. Views in the working group were divided on the best structure to deliver inshore fisheries management.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/2">The response of the four UK Fisheries Departments to the Net Benefits&quot; response will be published shortly, but we are currently further evaluating the options for the future structure of inshore fisheries management in England. Whatever the outcome of that consideration, there will be a need for legislation, at the minimum to update the current legislative framework for Sea Fisheries Committees. The proposed Marine Bill is likely to be the vehicle for introducing such changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.447W.10/54">There could also be the following services that would not be part of the principal Crossrail passenger service but would be complementary to it:</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/55" class="indent">(i) a service of up to six trains per hour between Gidea Park and Liverpool Street during the morning and evening rush hours; and</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/56" class="indent">(ii) an all day service of between two and four trains per hour serving Reading, Slough and Paddington.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/57">The capacity for non-Crossrail passenger services (other than existing suburban services subsumed by Crossrail or complementary services) and freight trains is largely unaffected for the following reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/58">For the Greater Western route Crossrail services will share use of two of the four tracks and will not displace services on to the other two tracks. So apart from periods of maintenance and disruption when services on all four tracks may need to be looked at together, there will be no impact from the operation of Crossrail on the two tracks that currently, and will continue to, carry all of the passenger services not subsumed into Crossrail and complementary services.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/59">For the Great Eastern route the position is similar with Crossrail trains normally operating on the tracks currently carrying the local services subsumed into Crossrail services and not normally affecting the other two tracks.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/60">In relation to freight, Crossrail service planning assumes that the current level of planned freight paths will continue. This allows for some growth in services run, since not all of the planned paths for freight are currently used on any given day. The Crossrail project includes a number of local infrastructure works specifically to facilitate continued freight operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.447W.10/61">This Bill does not specify a maximum number of principal Crossrail passenger service trains to which the use of powers in the Bill could apply. The Bill enables the Secretary of State to specify a minimum number of principal Crossrail passenger service trains. If the Secretary of State exercised this power he would do so taking account of all of his relevant rail and other policies, not simply the interests of Crossrail services in isolation.</p>

Member to the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-05-25.123W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 123W</phrase>, where I indicated that the Department does not maintain a noise complaints database. It does however regularly receive representations about aircraft flight paths. Most concerns relate to the effect of noise on correspondents. As part of this, some comment adversely on the way in which they became aware of changes. I am aware of a judicial review case on airspace changes affecting Suffolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.2/2">Airspace changes are primarily the responsibility of the Directorate of Airspace Policy at the Civil Aviation Authority in the light of Guidance and Directions from the Secretary of State for Transport under section 66(1) of the Transport Act 2000. These are designed to ensure that changes are made only where it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue, or where airspace management considerations and the overriding need for safety allow for no practical alternative.</p>

The draft structured&quot; claim form is being designed in line with National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee recommendations on reviewing and improving Government forms, and through consultation with our customer representative organisations.

	<p pid="a.454W.3/2">The current availability of Freeview is restricted in much of the constituency because of the local terrain which means that, until switchover, the local transmitter at Winter Hill can only broadcast signals at low strength.

	<p pid="a.458W.6/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reviews all cases in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Crown prosecutors consider whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction' and if such evidence exists, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute the accused. A prosecution will usually take place unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution, which clearly outweigh those tending in favour, or it appears more appropriate to divert the person from prosecution. The public interest decision will depend upon all the circumstances of the offence and the background of the offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.6/2">In respect of adults, diversionary options include informal warnings, cautions, and, in some places, conditional warnings. A caution will only be appropriate when the public interest accords with the Home Office's guidelines on cautioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.6/3">In respect of youths, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 established a diversion scheme to prevent re-offending by children and young people, who are issued with reprimands or final warnings aimed at diverting them from crime before they enter the formal court system. This scheme, which replaced the previous system of repeat cautioning, provides a response, with appropriate interventions to reduce re-offending. Although the CPS may be consulted during the course of an enquiry if officers want to seek advice on the correct charge, the decision whether or not to issue a reprimand or final warning is for the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.6/4">Since the introduction of this scheme, the Home Office has issued detailed guidance to the police forces in England and Wales on the application of the legislation to ensure national consistency. It provides a number of options enabling a reprimand or final warning to be administered to a youth, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The police are guided to the appropriate resolution by the identification of a number of gravity factors in the case. A caution or final warning may be an appropriate disposal where a youth without previous convictions or cautions commits an offence, fully admits it and shows appropriate remorse. A very large percentage of young people who are the subject of the diversion scheme do not re-offend.</p>

	<p pid="a.459W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.3/2">It is estimated that current indirect (via electricity generation) carbon emissions from air-conditioning in homes are in the range 20 to 80 kT of carbon per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.3/3">This represents estimated annual electricity consumption of between 195,000 and 780,000 MWh.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.3/4">The global warming effect of direct emissions depends on the refrigerants used, and on the proportion emitted to the atmosphere by leakage, during servicing or on disposal. It is estimated that the direct impact of emissions from air-conditioning in homes is the equivalent of between one and seven kT of carbon per year, depending on the assumptions made for these factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.459W.3/5">There are limited statistics on the number of air-conditioning systems in UK homes, but the figure is believed to be of the order of 500,000. These are much smaller systems than would be found in larger buildings. Many of them are portable units sold over the counter&quot;. The annual usage of the systems is also uncertain. Emissions and energy use estimates therefore have a wide range of uncertainty. Estimates of the future stock of air-conditioning in homes, based on continuation of current trends are 2005, 0.5 million; 2010, 0.7 million; 2020, 1.1 million; 2050, 2.3 million. In practice, sales will be affected by the pricing and marketing policies of suppliers, household wealth, weather (including perceptions of climate change) and energy efficiency policy measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.460W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/2">Defra has recently commissioned research to update estimates of direct fluorinated gas historic and projected emissions (1990&ndash;2025) from the UK refrigeration and air conditioning sectors. This work, which is still in progress, is being performed under Defra's contract with AEA Technology plc for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. As part of this study, an assessment will be made as to whether it will be possible to estimate emissions separately for domestic air conditioning units, as at present only a single emission estimate is calculated for a wider equipment category.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/3">Several measures are in place or under consideration to address indirect emissions, which arise through electricity consumption:</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/4" class="italic">Reducing cooling need.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/5" class="indent">Building regulations already include requirements aimed at limiting overheating in new housing. These are currently being reviewed as part of the general revision of the Regulations;</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/6" class="italic">Encouraging the use of efficient equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/7" class="indent">Domestic air-conditioners are required to carry energy performance labels. (Mandatory minimum performance standards exist outside Europe, but not within the EU). Ways of including air-conditioning energy use within the Government's Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) are being investigated. SAP defines the energy performance of a dwelling for Building Regulations purposes and for the building energy performance certification required by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive;</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/8" class="italic">Encouraging wise use.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/9" class="indent">Energy consumption can be affected greatly by the way in which users operate systems but there is little empirical information on actual use. Field measurements of the annual usage of domestic air-conditioning are in progress at University College, London.</p>

The advice received was that further inquiries should be made before a decision as to what action to take was made. Having received that advice further inquiries were undertaken of the UDM. The UDM assured the Department that the letter related to a very limited number of Claimants who were part of a pilot group who had, for operational reasons and with the agreement of the DTI, undertaken the VWF MAP report process twice. The UDM acknowledged that it had been wrong to issue the letter and gave the Department assurances both as to its limited use and its unconditional withdrawal. The Department also made inquiries of its Claims Handlers at the time in relation to the cases affected having received the UDM's explanation and having reconsidered the advice from its legal advisers in the light of the information received from its Claims Handlers the Department chose to take no immediate action either against the UDM or any individual Claimant, but to keep under very close review the potential for the coaching of claimants.</p>

	<p pid="a.472W.0/1">Tackling bullying in all its forms is an issue which is taken seriously by the Department. No child should have to suffer the pain and indignity of bullying. Protecting children from fear and intimidation is a pre-requisite of raising school standards. Creating an environment where bullying is not tolerated is integral to good discipline; it is central to a strong school ethos and will help to ensure we can support every child to fulfil their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/2">There has been no national assessment made of incidences of bullying in schools involving the use of mobile phones and in particular happy slapping. However part of the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) remit under the funding provided by the Department is to develop innovative and practical approaches to tackling bullying, including the modern menace of bullying by text messaging. Bullying by text messages on mobile phones is also referred to in our guidance pack for schools 'Don't suffer in Silence'.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/3">Departmental guidance on bullying does not refer to the use of an approach with the title no blame&quot;. There has not been an assessment of its effectiveness. Don't Suffer In Silence&quot;, the DfES guidance, describes a range of possible approaches for schools to use, including the support group approach. The key features of this approach are demonstrating to the learners who have been bullying a child the harmful impact of their words and actions, and involving the learners who have been bullying in putting matters right for the child who has suffered.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/4">There has been no formal assessment of the escalation of bullying into other forms of antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/5">In the 2004&ndash;05 financial year the Diana Award received &pound;50,000, ChildLine in Partnership in Schools (CHIPS) &pound;164,000, Parentline Plus 193,000 and the ABA &pound;480,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/6">There are many voluntary sector and community groups included in discussions including Act Against Bullying, Actionwork, Action for Inclusion, Beat Bullying, Bullying Online, Bullywatch, ChildLine, Children's Legal Centre, Children's Society in Rochdale, Commission for Racial Equality, ContinYou, Coram Family, Council for Disabled Children, Educational Action Challenging Homophobia (EACH), Kidscape, National Children's Bureau, NCH, NSPCC, Parentline Plus, Safer Custody Group, Save the Children, School's Out!, SCOPE, Stonewall UK, Observatory for the Promotion of Non-violence, Young Minds, Young Transnet, Young Voice, YWCA England and Wales, Barnardos, The Circle Works, Diana Award, Bully Free Zone, Children are Unbeatable, PUPILINE, Shakti Imani Inclusion Project, The 1990 Trust, Muslim Liaison Committee, Muslim Council of Britain, Bradford Council of Mosques, Lancashire Council of Mosques, An-Nisa Society, Birmingham Central Mosque, Forum against Islamophobia and Racism, Imams and Mosques Council, Islamic Foundation (Leicester), Islamic Cultural Centre, Islamic Human Rights Commission, Islamic Society of Britain, The IQRA Trust, The Muslim Council for Religious and Racial Harmony and the Churches' Commission on Racial Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/7">Work to support parents, schools and local authorities is carried out in our anti-bullying funded programmes referred to above. These programmes are delivered on our behalf by voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.472W.0/8">In answer to the question on the regional and national conferences on bullying&mdash;the costs of those conferences from 2003&ndash;05 was approximately &pound;1 million. The conferences were a significant success. Evaluations for the London conference were 100 per cent. positive, and for the series overall 97 per cent. positive. Evaluations judged that the conferences had been highly effective in spreading best practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.473W.2/3">To help schools tackle bullying, the Department has issued guidance in the Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot; pack and in the Stand up for us: challenging homophobia in schools&quot; guidance. We have also commissioned various pieces of research to look at effective ways of tackling bullying from children and young people's points of view, launched an anti-bullying charter and in July 2004 funded a national alliance to tackle bullying to tackle bullying to carry forward the momentum of the work of the Make the Difference series of ministerial conferences.</p>

We are currently consulting on statutory guidance, building on existing guidance published in 2000, which will set out what steps local authorities should take to fulfill this duty, including the importance of working effectively with schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/2">This autumn we shall also be publishing a guidance document on looked-after children for school governors which will include advice on a range of specific issues, including behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/3">The national standards which apply to children's homes and fostering services are designed to ensure that looked-after children develop socially acceptable behaviour and attend school regularly. In 2004 we introduced parenting contracts and parenting orders for behaviour, which can be applied to foster parents of looked-after children.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/4">The Government have funded the National Association for the Care and Re-settlement of Offenders to develop a good practice handbook for children's services and youth offending teams on reducing offending by looked-after children, which is due to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/5">More generally, we are implementing a wide-ranging programme to improve the behaviour of all school pupils. This includes behaviour management training materials for school staff, advice from expert behaviour consultants, curriculum materials to help schools develop pupils' social, emotional and behavioural skills and extra resources for learning mentors, learning support units and multi-agency teams to support schools and pupils with the greatest need.</p>

	<p pid="a.477W.2/1">Research on the impact of parenting programmes undertaken in 2002 for the Youth Justice Board showed that they have a positive impact both on young people's perception of their parents and on their behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.477W.2/3" class="indent">Court ordered parents benefited just as much as voluntary participants.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/4" class="indent">In the year prior to the parenting programme, 89 per cent. of the young people had been convicted of an offence. In the year after, this had dropped to 61.5 per cent.&mdash;a reduction of nearly one third.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/5" class="indent">On average, in the year before the programme, the young people committed 4.4 offences. This reduced to 2.1 in the following year, a 50 per cent. reduction. So, fewer young people offended, and those that did offend, offended less often.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/6">These findings indicate that parenting orders can have a beneficial effect on the behaviour of the young person.</p>

	<p pid="a.477W.5/1">None. Acceptable behaviour contracts are general measures used by the police to improve the behaviour of young people. They can be used in a school setting but they are not exclusive to schools. Schools have a range of measures to help them manage pupil behaviour including Pastoral Support Programmes which identify precise and realistic behavioural outcomes for the child to work towards and Parenting Contracts where the LEA or school governing body considers that parenting is a factor in the truancy or behaviour of the child and where the parent appears to be in need of (and willing to accept) support.</p>

	<p pid="a.478W.5/1">Local authorities and their local partner agencies in children's services have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their areas. This includes providing accommodation for any child, where the person caring for them is prevented from providing him/her with suitable accommodation or care.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/2">For the majority of young people who run away from home it will be in their interests to be provided with support that maintains them in their family network. Given the variety of ways in which children who run away come to official attention, for example outside normal working hours or in emergencies, some young people may require immediate access to overnight accommodation. Usually, the local authority's children's services will be best placed to provide this. However, the Social Exclusion Unit, in its report Young Runaways&quot; (2002) found that runaways may have difficulty accessing emergency overnight accommodation at the point of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.478W.5/3">For this reason, the Government have provided funding for a two year pilot scheme to develop, evaluate and test out the delivery and costs of flexible community based accommodation for young runaways. Six sites are now operating&mdash;in Co. Durham, Liverpool, Leicestershire/Leicester City and Rutland, Bradford, Torquay and London (at the long-established London Refuge). These pilot services have now reached the end of their first year. Government will give careful consideration to the lessons from this pilot programme to inform policy about future services for vulnerable young people who run away from home.</p>

	<p pid="a.479W.0/1">Together with the Food Standards Agency and People 1st, the Department has developed a Vocationally Related Qualification (VRQ) at Level 1 in Healthier Catering. It is currently with awarding bodies to arrange for accreditation by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. The qualification should be in place and available for people to start on courses this autumn term. It is intended to give school cooks and caterers the knowledge and skills to deliver a healthier meals service. It has been specifically designed for staff involved in the preparation and service of school meals and it will enable school caterers to improve pupil nutritional intake from all food provided by the school meals service. It will ensure that everyone in the school kitchen aspires to the same high standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/2">15,791 schools are currently participating in the Healthy Schools Programme. We currently targeting all schools with a 20 per cent. or more free school meals entitlement and aim to recruit the remainder of schools to the programme by 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/3">DfES does not collect data on the proportion of schools that provide drinking water to pupils. Regulations require all local authority maintained schools in England to have a wholesome supply of water for domestic purposes, including drinking water. However, it is for local education authorities, governors and schools to decide how and when drinking water should be made available to pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/4">Guidance produced by this Department advises caterers on meeting the requirements of the Government's nutritional standards for school lunches and recommends that drinking water should be made available to all pupils every day, free of charge. In addition, the Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools document suggests that all pupils should have access to drinking water at all times at a number of points around the school, preferably not from taps in toilets. The guidance also suggests that pupils should be permitted to carry water with them and consumption encouraged both in class and during break and lunchtime.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/5">DfES does not routinely collect data on schools adherence to statutory school lunch nutritional standards. The responsibility for ensuring that the standards are met rests with local education authorities or, where the budget for school lunches is delegated to them, a school's governing body. Ultimately, the Secretary of State can direct a school to meet the standards where she considers they are failing to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/6">As part of the package aimed at improving school lunches, we are looking at a number of ways to strengthen the monitoring of school food:</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/7" class="indent">From September 2005, every school inspection will include an assessment of the school's contribution to the Every Child Matters outcomes. Ofsted will review the quality of school approaches to food as part of their regular school inspections. In addition, Ofsted will be making visits to a number of pilot LEAs and schools in the autumn, working alongside nutritionists to determine the best way to inspect the proposed school meal standards. Once the new standards are in place, Ofsted will sample schools across LEAs to investigate how well they are being used;</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/8" class="indent">Support for healthy eating will be one aspect of children's services Joint Area Reviews at Local Authority level;</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/9" class="indent">Additional requirements for local authorities and school governing bodies to monitor the content of school lunches.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/10">Current minimum school lunch standards require all schools to provide food from the fruit and vegetable group on a daily basis. More specifically, primary schools must ensure that both a fruit and a vegetable are provided on a daily basis; a fruit based desert is available at least twice per week; and fresh fruit, fruit tinned in juice or fruit salad is available every day. In secondary schools two foods from the fruit and vegetable group must be available each day, which must include both a fruit and a vegetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/11">In addition, 16,069, or 97 per cent. of eligible schools (February 2005) benefit daily from the free fruit and vegetables provided by the Government's National School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/12">A School Meals Review Panel has been convened to recommend changes to current school lunch standards. The panel's work is expected to produce new draft school lunch standards for secondary schools in September 2005 and for primary schools soon after, both becoming mandatory in September 2006. Once the school lunch standards have been considered the panel will then set about looking at how the standards could apply to other food and drink on school premises, e.g. vending machines and tuck-shops. Any extended standards will need to be enshrined within regulations as are the current standards.</p>

Of the 48 approved applications at operating schools, 33 involved proposals to improve on-site sports facilities, such as new all-weather pitches, sports halls or improved grass sports pitches.

	<p pid="a.482W.6/1">Research conducted by and for the Department shows there is a link between social exclusion and behaviour and that there is a complex interaction between risk and protective factors that can lead to the development of antisocial behaviour among children and young people and to later social exclusion. In addition, research suggests that this could be a two-way relationship, with behavioural problems both leading to, and resulting from, social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.6/2">The Department has commissioned a number of pieces of research to explore these issues in more detail as well as looking at what interventions are effective in reducing the risk of these negative outcomes. Some key examples of this are: Support from the Start: working with young children and their families to reduce the risks of crime and antisocial behaviour&quot;, Preventing Children's Involvement in Crime and Anti-social Behaviour: a literature review&quot;; and Offenders of the Future? Assessing the Risk of Children and Young People Becoming Involved in Criminal or Antisocial Behaviour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.6/3">In addition, the Youth Cohort Study shows that pupils' poor behaviour and poor attendance at school are associated with a greater likelihood of not being involved in education, employment or training at ages 16 to 18 and lower attainment at GCSE. The Social Exclusion Unit's Bridging the Gap&quot; report showed that these factors increase the risk of social exclusion. The report also concluded that related risk factors for non-participation in education, employment or training include mental health problems, educational disaffection, use of drugs or alcohol and involvement in criminal/antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.6/4">These issues are acknowledged in the Green Paper Every Child Matters&quot; and in the development of the Change for Children Programme, signalling the Department's commitment to improving children and young people's outcomes. The Government's aim is for every child, whatever their background or their circumstances, to have the support they need to: be healthy, stay safe, enjoy and achieve through learning, make a positive contribution to society and achieve economic well-being. As part of this the Department is committed to improving behaviour in schools, and has implemented a range of policies (such as the Behaviour Improvement Programme) aimed at tackling the issues of poor behaviour and poor attendance in order to reduce the risk of negative outcomes in later life for young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.495W.2/1">The announcement by my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May</phrase> referred to 700 sites currently entered on the Register of surplus public sector land which is maintained by English Partnerships. The sites' owners and English Partnerships are currently reviewing all registered sites to assess their development potential. A list of the sites, as at March 2005, can be found on the English Partnerships website at: <a href="http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C904340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf">http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C9043 40DDAB44702EF5D2 ADE6.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.495W.2/2">51 sites on the Register as at March 2005 are situated in the Greater London area. None of these sites is located in Chipping Barnet. An updated list of Register sites will be published by English Partnerships towards the end of June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.2/3">In addition, it was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> that a portfolio of nearly 100 ex-NHS sites, would be transferred from the Department of Health to English Partnerships. The first tranche of 67 sites transferred on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-06">6 April</phrase>. Work is on-going with partners and local authorities to assess each site to identify how they can contribute to local housing and employment needs. It is estimated that the total portfolio of 96 sites could accommodate up to 15,000 new homes nationally, with at least 5,000 being affordable. This estimate is subject to planning permission for the individual sites, and residential development will not be appropriate on all of the sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.498W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/2">In England and Wales local land charges are matters of a public nature affecting land. They are recorded in registers maintained by local registering authorities. The fees payable for local land charge services are set by the Lord Chancellor, with the concurrence of HM Treasury, under the Local Land Charges Act 1975 as amended. The fees do not vary according to the identity of the person to whom the service is provided. There are no plans to change this policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/3">The fees are set at levels that take into account the cost of delivering the relevant services. For example, the fee for an official search of the local land charges register is &pound;6 or, if conducted electronically, &pound;4, and the fee for a personal search is &pound;11. However, as the present nationally set fees can only approximately reflect the costs of each individual registering authority, the Government has amended the 1975 Act (see schedule 4 paragraphs 82&ndash;85 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005) to devolve the power to set local land charge fees, other than personal search fees, to registering authorities in England. They will be permitted to set fees, which taking one year with another, recover an amount up to, but not exceeding, the costs they incur in providing local land charge services. In setting fees, registering authorities will have to have regard to guidance issued by the Lord Chancellor. These arrangements are to be brought into force on a date to be fixed. The Lord Chancellor's fee-setting power for all local land charges in Wales was devolved to the Welsh Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/4">There are currently no plans to change the fee payable for personal searches. Any change would have to be supported by sound evidence and public consultation would be required before making any substantial increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/5">The Office of Fair Trading's market study on the provision of property information includes consideration of the charges for local land charge services (including personal searches of the local land charges register). Any recommendations made by OFT will be taken into account in the setting of fees for personal searches of the local land charges register and in the preparation of any guidance to be issued in relation to other local land charge fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/6">In relation to the provision of property information, other than local land charges, local authorities can already set fees under the Local Authorities (Charges for Land Searches) Regulations 1994. In setting such fees a local authority is required to have regard to its costs in providing the information. Local authorities may also impose a charge for the provision of information in response to an enquiry under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. No changes are currently proposed to these arrangements.</p>

There have been no subsequent changes to the performance requirements for registered social landlords (RSL). The suggestion that the RSL achieve two star performance was in a working draft on which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consulted. It was not included arrangements as during consultation it became clear that it would be unreasonable to link payment of gap funding, on which the viability of the RSL business plan is dependent, to a decision from a third party, the Housing Inspectorate, who gives the performance ratings.</p>

	<p pid="a.501W.3/14">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has had its homelessness strategy in place since late in 2002. The impact of the strategy is starting to be reflected in the homelessness figures, which showed a small but welcome reduction in 2004&ndash;05 compared to the previous two years. An analysis of the figures shows a reduction in the number of cases of homelessness caused by intimidation. During the past year the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has met its target of eliminating the use of bed and breakfast type of accommodation for families, except in emergency cases. It has also provided approximately &pound;1.5 million of funding to a range of voluntary bodies for special projects to tackle and prevent homelessness. These projects included rent guarantee schemes, mediation services, youth homelessness prevention schemes, street outreach services for rough sleepers and specialist advice workers.</p>

We support fully all of the aims of the Convention and we too want to see widespread action to tackle this abhorrent trade at source, to protect and support the victims and bring those responsible to justice. Ministers and officials are in contact with non-governmental organisations about the Convention.

	<p pid="a.507W.8/1">The 10 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) in Hertfordshire and the Drug Action Team (DAT) are responsible for the delivery of crime reduction and the National Drug Strategy at the local level. The performance of the CDRPs and DAT is managed by the Home Office team in the Government Office for the East of England (GO East), whose role is to support and challenge the partnerships' performance in the region. The director of this team is held accountable by the Crime Reduction Director and Drug Strategy Director in the Home Office through quarterly meetings, supplemented by performance review meetings with the Home Office performance support managers in the intervening months. The Home Office funds the ten partnerships in Hertfordshire with &pound;1,490,102 from the Building Safer Communities Fund and &pound;559,354 from the Basic Command Unit fund. The Government will shortly introduce the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will target gun and knife crime and alcohol-related crime and disorder. It will toughen the laws on replica firearms, create restrictions on the sale of primers and specialist equipment for making ammunitions and it will tighten laws on airguns, powers to require certain pubs and clubs to search for guns and knives on entry, powers for the police to impose 48-hour bans on pubs and clubs persistently selling alcohol to under-18s, and the establishment of alcohol disorder zones. The CDRPs and Drug Action Team (DAT) and their constituent members in Hertfordshire are taking the following actions to tackle street crime, binge-drinking and drug-related crime in Hertfordshire.</p>

The CDRPs have each negotiated a three-year crime reduction target with GO-East. The progress towards the target will be measured by performance on ten crime types, two of which cover street crime. While Hertfordshire was not one of the l0 areas involved in the Street Crime Initiative, best practice is being spread between police forces through the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office's Police Standards Unit. This is to ensure that the lessons that have been learnt from the Street Crime Initiative can benefit all forces. Several of the Hertfordshire CDRPs have identified specific strategic priorities around street crime. These include Broxbourne and North and East Herts, aiming to make town centres safer, Stevenage, aiming to reduce alcohol-related crime in the town centre and leisure park, and Watford, aiming to make the town safer at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.8/3"><i>(b)</i> Binge Drinking&mdash;Hertfordshire County Council have instigated a &pound;400,000 project to reduce alcohol-related antisocial behaviour and curb alcohol abuse. This includes the launch of a website aimed at 13&ndash;17 year olds which has extensive information about the risks of alcohol among other material. Among individual initiatives by Hertfordshire CDRPs, Stevenage have planned a number of actions including a requirement that all public entertainment licensed premises should have a drugs policy by April 2006; regular joint licensee inspection visits from the police and the council; a ban on irresponsible drink promotions and support for the licensed industry's voluntary code on low priced promotions; and encouraging licensed premises to participate in the Club/Pub Watch scheme that contains a banning/exclusion order facility. These measures will be supported by GIS mapping of alcohol related crime and disorder and fixed penalty enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.8/4"><i>(c)</i> Tackling Drug-Related Crime During 2004&ndash;05&mdash;Hertfordshire DAT has introduced the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) within the area. The aim of DIP is to reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs by substantially increasing the number of drug-misusing offenders entering treatment through the criminal justice system. Government funding for DIP in Hertfordshire in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;1,038,586 (this includes &pound;530,842 arrest referral grant). Hertfordshire has set a target of 600 DIP clients for 2005&ndash;06, of which 450 will be 'generic' DIP clients and 150 specifically Prolific and Priority Offender (PPO) DIP clients. More recently the PPO project has also been introduced in the area. The project has already engaged a large number of people in hard-to-reach target groups in structured treatment. This project is now ready to be rolled out to the whole of Hertfordshire. GO East and the CDRPs are also funding MIDAS, a web-based database for crime, disorder, drugs, alcohol and community safety information, for the use of all partners involved in Community Safety. Hertfordshire DAT and the CDRPs within the area are working towards integrating their work.</p>

	<p pid="a.510W.14/1">The Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 is the biggest overhaul of legislation on domestic violence in the last 30 years. It received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-15">15 November 2004</phrase> and contains a wide range of reforms on domestic violence, crime and victims and witnesses. The provisions in the Act will be commenced in stages during 2005. The table gives a brief outline of some measures in the Act and the plans to assess their effectiveness, once they have been implemented. The measures specifically relating to domestic violence will run alongside the broader set of national performance indicators, published in our National Report on Domestic Violence, in March this year. The indicators will be used to measure the effectiveness of our domestic violence strategy over the medium and long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.512W.8/1">There are a number of offences which cover the practice of happy slapping&quot;. These include common assault and battery where one person recklessly or intentionally causes another person to fear immediate violence or to sustain unlawful personal violence, plus a range of offences where actual injury is caused. Maximum penalties range from six months' imprisonment for common assault up to life for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The Government take the issue of violent crime and its impact on people's lives very seriously. Even though the British Crime Survey shows that violent crime has fallen by 26 per cent. since 1997, it fully recognises public concern and is taking forward several initiatives to tackle violent crime in all its forms and make the country as safe as possible for law-abiding citizens. In particular, the Government will shortly introduce the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will target irresponsible drinking, imitation firearms and knives.</p>

	<p pid="a.513W.3/1">Dialogue has been ongoing with the security services in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed identity card. The security services have said that an ID card will help in tackling terrorism. The Security Service have stated that a card scheme would disrupt the use of false identities by terrorist organisations, for example in money laundering and organised crime. We know that at least one-third of terrorist suspects make use of false identities. An ID card will reduce the opportunity for those facilitating terrorist and organised criminals to operate using multiple identities. The scheme would also be a useful tool in helping to monitor and disrupt the support activities of terrorist networks.</p>

Training courses are available at all levels, from new recruits through to specialist investigators. In addition, the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit (NMPCU) has developed a National Mobile Phone Register to hold information on registered mobile phones, information on crime reports from police forces and information from the mobile phone industry's own lost or stolen list. About a third of forces are making use of this system and the unit is working to make the register available to all forces in England and Wales.</p>

The Government have made a commitment that by 2008, every area in England and Wales will benefit from dedicated neighbourhood policing teams which will be led by police officers and involve Special Constables, Community Support Officers, volunteers and neighbourhood wardens among others. These teams will provide a visible, accessible and responsive police presence in rural and urban areas. By the end of 2005, every force in England and Wales will have a pathfinder area (in what are known as Basic Command Units). Forces will be able to develop local approaches to neighbourhood policing which are tailored to their local needs, including those for rural areas. New measures have been introduced to the policing performance assessment framework which report on customer satisfaction with the services delivered by the police and public confidence in the police in the local area.</p>

	<p pid="a.523W.2/2">The number of police officers in Hertfordshire Constabulary stood at 2,135 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>. This is a record figure and represents a steady increase since March 2002. Since 2000 we have provided money for additional recruits under the Crime Fighting Fund, which in Hertfordshire's case stands at 113 officers. Any further increases are a matter for the Chief Constable and the police authority. In addition, Hertfordshire Constabulary had 99 community support officers at the end of March, an increase of 53 on 12 months earlier.</p>

	<p pid="a.523W.11/1">Records of the average cost to local police forces of employing neighbourhood wardens, community support officers (CSOs) and police constables are not kept centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, information available to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister indicates that neighbourhood warden salaries in 2003 ranged, on average, between about &pound;13,900 and &pound;15,600. The interim report of the National Evaluation of Community Support Officers published in December 2004 (available at <a href="http://www.policereform.gov.uk">www.policereform.gov.uk</a>) found that, of the forces surveyed, the minimum pay point, excluding allowances, for CSOs ranged nationally from &pound;14,094 to &pound;19,626 and the maximum ranged from &pound;15,408 to &pound;25,356. The pay scales for police constables range from &pound;19,803 for a newly recruited officer, rising to &pound;31,092 for a constable with 11 years service. Additional allowances may be payable such as a competence-related threshold payment, London weighting, London allowance, special priority payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.530W.2/1">In the European Union, all genetically modified (GM) foods are subject to a mandatory pre-market safety assessment before they can be permitted to enter the food chain. This assessment is carried out on a case by case basis and provides assurance that any approved GM food is as safe as its non-GM conventional counterpart. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) funds a large body of research to support the safety assessment of GM foods, but has not commissioned any specific research in the area mentioned above. Information on research carried out by the FSA can be found on its website at: <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/">www.food.gov.uk/science/research/</a></p>

In line with the requirements of the FSA's new strategic plan, the branch is also currently establishing a food fraud database, which will further enhance local authorities' abilities to carry out effective investigations into the trade in illegal meat.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.12/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) has already undertaken preliminary assessments in respect of the impact of price competitive tendering on all current suppliers in the London area, including small solicitors' firms. It has worked with suppliers and their representative bodies throughout the consultation period to enhance its understanding and has held a number of workshops which allowed suppliers to express their views and concerns directly to the LSC. This has helped to identify small firm issues that will be considered as part of the further work undertaken in the context of the final proposals following consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.12/2">Quality of service and access to advice are a key priority for the LSC. The Commission's view is that all clients (including BME communities and the socially excluded) receiving services following any tendering process will be assured a quality service through the application of robust quality assurance mechanisms and the use of peer review of suppliers' services.</p>

Where EU legislation does require transposition into national law, it may be implemented either by primary legislation, or by secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972 (the ECA). The majority of EU legislation is enacted under section 2(2) of the ECA.

	<p pid="a.551W.11/1">My right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for Defence discussed the provision of NATO and EU support to the African Union (AU) mission in Darfur, ahead of the <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-26">26 May</phrase> AU donor conference, in the margins of the <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase> General Affairs and External Relations Council. Our joint FCO-DFID Sudan Unit holds regular discussions on Darfur with the Ministry of Defence and other Whitehall Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.11/2">We remain gravely concerned about the situation in Darfur. While direct clashes between the Government and the rebel groups have lessened in recent months, banditry and general insecurity continue to hamper the delivery of humanitarian assistance. We fully support the AU mission in Darfur and announced a further contribution of &pound;6.6 million at a donors' conference in Addis Ababa on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-26">26 May</phrase>, bringing our total contribution to that mission to over &pound;20 million. In addition, we have contributed &pound;73.7 million since September 2003 to humanitarian relief in Darfur. We welcome the announcement that peace talks between the Government of Sudan and the Darfur rebel groups will reconvene in Abuja on <phrase class="date" code="">10 June</phrase>. A UK representative will attend and offer support to the African Union mediators.</p>
