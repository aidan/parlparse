	<p pid="a.2049W.5/1">We remain concerned about the infringement of human rights through the Hudood Ordinances, which enforce strict forms of punishments such as whipping, amputation of limbs and death for breaking the law. We are particularly concerned by the ordinance relating to the offence of Zina (Fornication/Adultery) which increases potential injustices against women. Victims of rape, or even gang rape, have been accused of Zina and thereby subjected to wrong and unjust prosecutions. This has often left victims ostracised by their families and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2049W.5/2">The UK would like to see all of the Hudood Ordinances repealed and the Pakistan Penal Code should be amended to provide appropriate legal guidelines to enable a more coherent approach to prosecuting rape and adultery cases. Failing a full repeal, we would like the Government of Pakistan to consider amending the ordinances to ensure that they are not discriminatory towards women.</p>

	<p pid="a.2049W.8/1">As the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has documented in successive reports, Iran has long lacked transparency about its nuclear activities. The nature of Iran's nuclear activities, its record of concealment, its failure to co-operate fully with the IAEA, and its failure to take necessary confidence building steps have contributed to the deep concerns of the international community that Iran's intentions regarding its nuclear programme, may not be, as it claims, exclusively peaceful. It is precisely for this reason that we, with France and Germany, and with the support of the EU high representative and other members of the international community, have engaged in our diplomatic efforts. The remarks attributed to Hassan Rowhani serve only to underline the urgent need for Iran to address the requests made in successive IAEA Board resolutions, including by suspending all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2050W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office frequently amended its travel advice to British nationals during Hurricane Katrina and advised British nationals in the area to track the hurricane and pay attention to advice from local authorities and the media. We also published web links to US agencies who offered advice on how to prepare for storms and to meteorological sites who monitored her progress. When Katrina hit, we advised of causalities and widespread damage and disruption. The Mayor of New Orleans ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city on <phrase class="date" code="">28 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.5/2">We are constantly improving our consular response to British nationals caught up in mass casualty incidents overseas. If there is a major catastrophe, we will consider whether to offer exceptional help to those British nationals who are directly affected, bearing in mind the circumstances of the catastrophe and the resources available. In line with this, we put in place a version of the assistance package used for the Asian tsunami to help British nationals affected by Hurricane Katrina. The package includes: up to five nights accommodation for any residents and visiting British nationals in desperate need; business class return flights for those resident in the US who had lost homes, belongings and funds; flights for any bereaved families to travel to the US if appropriate and repatriation of remains if appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.2051W.2/1">The UK has made regular representations to the Nepalese Government on human rights. We have also made repeated public statements deploring human rights violations by both the Nepalese security forces and the Maoists. Most recently, senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials met the Nepalese ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March</phrase> and raised our concerns about the continued detention of political leaders and activists, and peaceful demonstrators. Prior to that we have registered our concern about physical abuses and the infringement of democratic and civil rights with the Government at all levels, including with the King after he took direct power of the country last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.2/2">In seeking to address human rights issues we have sought to coordinate closely with our EU partners. In October 2005, as Presidency of the EU, the UK led an EU directors level Troika delegation to Nepal. The Troika raised human rights issues with many of its interlocutors. In a press statement at the end of the Troika's visit, the Troika said:</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We urge the Government and the security forces to lead by example in respecting human rights, to tackle urgently the prevailing culture of impunity, and to use security legislation with utmost caution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.2/4">The Troika also registered its concerns about the Government's enforcement of repressive restrictions on the media in Nepal and said that freedom of expression was a fundamental prerequisite for an effective democracy and the recent Media Ordinance infringed upon the right to freedom of expression.</p>
	<p pid="a.2051W.2/5">In a more recent statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January</phrase>, the UK joined the EU in responding to the recent escalation of violence and political unrest, which also addressed the issue of human rights in Nepal.

	<p pid="a.2056W.8/1">The Department's National Transport Model uses fuel prices that are based upon DTI crude oil price projections. We update our fuel price forecasts in line with DTI oil price updates. DTI usually make their oil price projections (which they normally update one or two times a year) publicly available on their website and also subject them to periodic public review&mdash;most recently in the summer of 2005 (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/fossil_fuel_price_assumptions.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/fossil_fuel_price_assumptions.pdf</a>). Their latest projections are for crude oil to fall from its current high levels to $35 (in 2004 prices) in 2010 and then remain at that level in real terms through to 2020&mdash;the end of their projection.</p>

Movements in the oil price since publication of the White Paper are clearly one material factor; any further forecasts would need to take into account up-to-date departmental assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2056W.8/3">The draft guidance on rail closures is not itself based on any particular assumption about crude oil prices. Prevailing and anticipated future fuel costs are one of a range of issues which we will expect to be taken into account at the time a specific proposal is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.2057W.5/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has a specialist section which deals with all inquiries relating to missing identity documents, including passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.5/2">Over the past five years the total number of passports reported as missing by drivers was 20,660 (14,968 UK and 5,692 foreign). To date, only 7,740 (5,282 UK and 2,458 foreign) have become the subject of claims for compensation. Approximately 25 per cent. can be attributed to a DVLA error in keying the address, with 75 per cent. due to non-delivery by Royal Mail. Over 12,500,00 applications for first photocard driving licences (i.e. those requiring the submission of identity documents) were processed during this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.5/3">The use of special/recorded delivery arrangements for the issue of documents has been considered, but this would involve substantial clerical intervention which would mean a significant increase in the fees charged for driving licences. The use of plain fit for purpose envelopes by DVLA has not revealed any widespread problems. Some drivers send their own envelopes for return, but this is a matter for personal choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.5/4">Holders of UK passports can take their applications to 750 post offices for checking, with the passport returned immediately. DVLA's local offices offer the same service and will also check EU passports and those from certain other countries where agreements for the exchange of licences exist. DVLA now also has in place a computerised link with the UK Passport Service whereby holders of digitised UK passports need only quote their passport number on their application forms. A check is then made online and the applicant need not send or take their passport anywhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.2058W.8/1">The Driving Standards Agency administers the Pass Plus scheme. The agency's chief executive chairs the Pass Plus Board which comprises representatives from the driver instruction and motor insurance industries. Some insurance companies offer premium discounts to newly-qualified drivers who have completed a Pass Plus course. Several advanced driving test organisations have negotiated discounts with insurance companies for their members who have passed an advanced driving test.</p>
	<p pid="a.2058W.8/2">The Department has not assessed the impact of the Pass Plus scheme or other advanced driving courses on accident rates. We do not have the commercial data to assess any impact on payouts made by insurance companies for road traffic accidents. The Department commissioned a research project in January 2006 on how to improve the Pass Plus scheme and its take up by newly qualified drivers. This project is due to be completed in December 2007. We are also currently undertaking a large cohort study of novice drivers which includes the collection of data about accidents in the three years after passing the practical driving test. This has collected data on whether subjects in this study have taken Pass Plus training. The Driving Standards Agency is planning work with providers to assess standards of provision of advanced driving courses and ensure that minimum standards are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.2068W.3/1">Ensuring better regulation of the arms trade is an essential pre-requisite for conflict prevention and development. As a result, DFID has worked very closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to promote the Government's commitment to an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). When the first committee of the UN General Assembly meets this year, the UK will aim to secure a UN resolution which will establish a formal UN-based ATT process. Significant progress has already been made, notably the endorsement of an ATT by the EU Council and the call for negotiations on an ATT from Commonwealth Heads of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.2068W.3/2">DFID has contributed to a range of FCO-led initiatives, including the May 2005 meeting of experts at Lancaster House in London. This year, DFID is developing a joint strategy with Whitehall partners on how to encourage other countries and regional bodies to actively promote the ATT. This will focus on building wider support for a first committee resolution, and will include awareness raising events and the establishment of a &quot;friends of ATT&quot; group of supportive Governments. In addition we will use ministerial visits and discussions with partner countries, regional and international organisations to generate support for a resolution. For example, this month we participated in a cross-Whitehall lobbying visit to China.</p>
	<p pid="a.2068W.3/3">In parallel, given the devastating impact of small arms and light weapons (SALW) on the developing world, DFID is working closely with the FCO and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on strengthening language on transfer controls within the existing UN Programme of Action on SALW. When the UN Programme of Action is reviewed in July we will seek agreement to develop a set of politically binding criteria for SALW transfers. In the run up to the review conference DFID will work closely with the FCO to win support for a common text on universal principles for SALW transfers. There has been good progress in developing regional agreement on standards for small arms transfers in Central America and the Horn of Africa/Great Lakes region. Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, we have funded non-governmental organisations such as the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) and Saferworld, which work with African Governments and civil society to ensure that African voices are heard in discussions on transfer controls.</p>

	<p pid="a.2068W.6/1">The Commission for Africa Report set out a wide range of recommendations for African countries and its donor partners. Each recommendation has its own timetable. This is reflected in the detailed report on what the UK has been doing to take forward the Commission's recommendations and make sure that the G8's commitments are implemented, which has been deposited in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.2068W.6/2">DFID has been active in carrying out conflict assessments, in recent years, in a number of African countries, including Nigeria, Mozambique, Angola, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia. More recently, DFID has undertaken a range of work to strengthen the analytical basis for its conflict programmes and policy throughout the continent. These activities include commissioning work on long and shorter term conflict trends to inform the Pan-African and Regional strategies of the interdepartmental Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP). Furthermore DFID's Security and Development paper, completed in the latter half of 2005, and a subsequent internal report also recommended the increased use of conflict assessments throughout UK development programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2068W.6/3">The next iteration of the DFID Delivery Plan for Africa will also emphasise the importance of conflict assessments.</p>

	<p pid="a.2069W.2/1">Maternal mortality is quite difficult to measure over relatively short time periods, and DFID looks to the World Health Organisation (WHO), with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to collectively produce global estimates. These are supplemented in some countries by information on maternal mortality obtained from demographic and health surveys conducted every four to five years. From the data available, it is estimated that each year 529,000 women die from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and that 99 per cent. of these deaths take place in poor countries. With the exception of Afghanistan, the countries with the highest maternal mortality ratios are all in Africa. These include Sierra Leone which has a maternal mortality ratio of 2,000 deaths for every 100,000 live births, and Malawi which has a ratio of 1,800 deaths for every 100,000 live births.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/2">DFID is supporting research with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation to improve the way maternal mortality is measured. This will enable poor countries to both better track progress of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of improving maternal mortality and to advocate for more resources for maternal health. Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing a reversal of previous gains and without considerably more action this MDG target will not be met.</p>

	<p pid="a.2069W.5/1">Over 529,000 women; mostly young, impoverished and vulnerable, die each year as a result of pregnancy or childbirth. Much more effort is needed if the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to lower maternal mortality is to be achieved by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/2">This is why DFID launched its strategy 'Reducing maternal deaths: Evidence and action' in 2004. The strategy sets out four clear priorities for action:</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/3" class="indent">1. to advocate for change and more attention to maternal health globally and in our country work;</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/4" class="indent">2. to scale-up evidence based interventions, especially the availability of health services that can provide women with the care they need in pregnancy;</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/5" class="indent">3. to address the wider social and economic barriers to progress, such as gender inequality and to get more girls into school; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/6" class="indent">4. to develop and apply new knowledge, through support for research on approaches to improve maternal health.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/7">The UK is the only major bilateral donor to have developed a strategy specifically to address 'improving maternal health' (MDG 5). We are also supporting the global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health which is working to advocate on a much bigger international and national platform.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/8">Improving maternal health depends on functioning health services, and stronger health systems, with the right staff, equipment, drugs and supplies in place and functioning properly. Women also need to be able to access sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, and care to deal with the causes and consequences of unsafe abortion, as well services to prevent, treat and care for HIV and AIDS. DFID has invested &pound;650 million for health sector support since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/9">DFID support in Nepal is addressing all these issues. For example, the remote Baglung district hospital is providing emergency obstetric care (Caesareans), with local nurses who have been trained in giving epidural anaesthesia. Blood transfusions are available, transport is possible because bridges have been built and communications (now through mobile phones), is working. Access to obstetric care is increasing, irrespective of the conflict. And that means that not only are women benefiting, but children with fractured limbs and others who need blood transfusions are getting help.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/10">In Malawi, DFID has provided &pound;100 million to an Emergency Human Resource Programme. In a country where two out of three nurse-midwife posts are vacant and where only eight out of 27 districts have a Malawian doctor, there is now early evidence to suggest a positive shift. And importantly, pregnant women are beginning to be able to have HIV tests and some are receiving anti-retroviral drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.5/11">In 2004&ndash;05, DFID spent more than &pound;243 million on bilateral programmes on maternal health (including sexual and reproductive health) and are continuing to ensure that good country plans which highlight maternal health are fully funded. In several countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Kenya, DFID is investing strongly in specific safe motherhood programmes with a focus on skilled birth attendants and access to obstetric services. We further support maternal health through multilateral support to our partners in UN agencies, the World Bank and the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.2071W.3/1">HIV surveillance among pregnant women is undertaken every second year by the Government of Lesotho. Pregnant women are not representative of the general population, though estimations can be made and they provide a useful indicator of the progress of the epidemic.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.3/2">Surveillance data from 1991 show infection rates among pregnant women to be in the region of 5 per cent. By 1994 that figure had risen to 20 per cent. By 2003, the last available surveillance data, the prevalence among the general population had risen to 28.9 per cent. Rates of infection among patients with sexually transmitted diseases are much higher&mdash;often in the region of 50 per cent. to 60 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.3/3">A recently completed Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), conducted in 2005, did do HIV tests among the general population. The highest HIV prevalence rates was for women aged 35&ndash;39 years at 43 per cent. and for men aged 30&ndash;34 it was 42 per cent. These figures are consistent with data for HIV prevalence rates in South Africa and Swaziland. The final DHS report has not yet been released but a copy of the preliminary report can be made available.</p>

	<p pid="a.2071W.6/1">The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) is a consortium of 33 public and private development agencies working together to expand access to financial services for the poor (including the poorest) in developing countries. CGAP is a trust fund housed in the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.6/2">While my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and I have not personally met with CGAP officials recently, there is a close interaction between CGAP and DFID at international and country level. My hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has been personally involved in promoting DFID work on microfinance and remittances, which has benefited from CGAP's work developing good practices in microfinance and helping build microfinance capacity in bilateral and multilateral donors. The CGAP developed the 'Key Principles of Microfinance' that were endorsed by the G8 leaders at their summit in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.6/3">Recognising the enormous potential for microfinance and the need to set standards, share best practices and improve co-ordination among donors, nine donors including DFID formed CGAP in 1995. DFID chaired the executive committee of CGAP until two years ago, and has contributed &pound;1,250,000 to CGAP core funding since 2001. An additional &pound;250,000 is being considered for the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.6/4">The CGAP's director and senior officials meet with DFID officials on a regular basis, and there is close cooperation in a number of areas. DFID is assisting the CGAP in developing its Africa Strategy at present, which will increase the CGAP's impact and influence in that priority region. DFID and the CGAP are currently collaborating on research into electronic banking (&quot;e-banking&quot; projects) and on social cash transfers. CGAP and DFID jointly funded MicroSave Africa, an Africa-based initiative to improve access of poor people to savings and other financial services. DFID also contributed &pound;960,000 to the joint CGAP-DFID microfinance capacity building programme in Africa during 1998&ndash;2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.2071W.6/5">Of particular note, DFID initiated and strongly supported (at ministerial level) the CGAP-led donor peer review process among CGAP's member agencies. The peer review process led to microfinance strategies at institutions such as the African Development Bank and the European Union being revamped and improved.</p>
