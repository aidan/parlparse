	<p pid=".1207W.6/1">We do not hold bovine TB surveillance data for individual constituencies. However TB data is available for Leicestershire. At the end of November 2004 there were 3,187 registered cattle herds in the county. Of these, 49 herds (1.5 per cent.) were under restriction at some point between <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase>. There were 36 new herd TB incidents during this period, of which 13 have been confirmed to date (three remain unclassified). TB surveillance data for Leicestershire is published each month on Defra's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1207W.6/2">The level of bovine TB in Leicestershire is low in comparison to some other areas of the country, e.g. South West England. We realise the importance of preventing the risk of TB spreading to new areas and that is why we introduced new measures at the end of 2004, e.g. changes to testing frequency and the imposition of movement restrictions immediately a test becomes overdue.</p>

	<p pid=".1208W.0/1">The UK contributes to the EU budget as a whole rather than to individual elements, and it is not therefore possible to make precise estimates of savings to UK public funds following the reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy. However, increased financial discipline and setting the CAP budget until 2013 will limit the burden that the CAP places on taxpayers. Cross-compliance and modulation of direct payments into agri-environment schemes means that a greater proportion of public funds are now delivering better value for society by buying public goods not readily provided by the market. The Government will continue to press for further reforms which reduce the cost to taxpayers of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

The letter of <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-11">11 June 1998</phrase> communicates the Ministerial decision that a system of fixed quota allocations (FQAs) should be introduced in domestic waters from <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>. This decision was preceded by extensive consultation with the fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid=".1210W.5/3">The position set out in the letter, regarding the management of under 10 vessels through producer organisations (POs), was changed following a review of the operation of the FQA system in consultation with industry in 2000&ndash;02. As a result of that review Fisheries Departments decided that under 10 metre vessels should, for the first time, be permitted to fish against &quot;sectoral&quot; quota allocations managed by POs as an alternative to fishing against the &quot;pool&quot; quota allocations for the under 10 metre fleet which are managed by Fisheries Departments in consultation with industry. The owners of the small proportion of under 10 metre vessels who elect to fish against PO allocations are required to complete EU logbooks and submit landing declarations in the same way as vessels over 10 metres. The new arrangements were communicated to fishermen in August 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".1213W.6/1">As part of the funding process for national parks I indicate my priorities to park authorities and I shall be writing to national park authorities about this shortly. We are encouraging them to actively promote understanding and greater use of national parks by all sections of society, especially people with disabilities, people from ethnic minorities, the inner cities and young people. We want our national parks to be appreciated fully by all sections of society as truly national assets. Defra and the Department for Education and Skills are working with national park authorities to develop initiatives to meet this aim. I also emphasised the Government's position on this policy of inclusion at a meeting with national park authorities on sustainable tourism in June 2003 so they have been aware of it for some time. I have also made clear that these ends can be achieved without excluding existing users groups and that we will encourage increased engagement of volunteers in meeting national park purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".1213W.6/2">National park authorities will also benefit from the findings of Defra's Diversity Review which is looking at what can be done to provide more opportunities for people who, for various reasons, have little experience of what the countryside has to offer. An action plan will be published next year. In addition, many park authorities were involved in the Mosaic Project set up by the Council for National Parks and the Black Environment Network in 2001 to enable people from black and ethnic minorities to experience the parks at first hand. The Council for National Parks recently secured lottery funding to develop this project further over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid=".1213W.6/3">The Government are providing adequate resources for the national park authorities. Funding for the authorities in 2005&ndash;06 is 51 per cent. above the 2001&ndash;02 level. Each authority receives &pound;200,000 each year to run a sustainable development fund, to make grants to projects which aim to change the attitude and behaviour of individuals and communities in ways that enhance understanding of sustainable development and the role of the national park while promoting cooperation and social inclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".1214W.2/1">Our policy is to expand interest in national parks so that they are understood by all communities, as intended, as a genuinely natural asset. Initiatives like the Mosaic project have successfully engaged members of Asian and Black communities in the attractions of visiting several national parks, but there is a long way to go. From my own experience as a youth worker in Wales and from visits to English national parks in the past nine years, I can testify to the value and impact of such visits on inner city youngsters in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".1214W.2/2">In expanding interest in the national parks to new groups, we have no wish whatsoever to see a reduction in the groups who already make use of these invaluable national assets and I am keen to see the engagement of volunteers expanded rather than reduced.</p>
	<p pid=".1214W.2/3">In order to support the work of the national parks in England we have significantly increased the level of grant&mdash;by 51 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02&mdash;to a sum of &pound;42.13 million in 2005&ndash;06. Also each national park has a sustainable development fund of &pound;200,000 per year to encourage innovation with a particular emphasis on linking the concept of sustainable development to the national parks and engaging people&mdash;particularly young people&mdash;from urban and rural areas in joint projects in the national park.</p>
	<p pid=".1214W.2/4">Even with these additional resources the pressures on each national park is considerable. Each authority has to deal with conflicting pressures, and also identify whether any of their services are already being provided, or could be done better, by others. The introduction, later this year, of a streamlined Comprehensive Performance Assessment and Best Value regime for the national park authorities will help to identify priorities and improve cost-effectiveness.</p>

The Government has set out national policies to improve air quality in the Air Quality Strategy for England published in January 2000 and its Addendum published in February 2003. At local level the Government requires local authority to review and assess air quality locally and take actions (such as for example by using their traffic management powers) in cooperation with others if necessary, if they are unlikely to meet air quality objectives such as those for nitrogen dioxide; The Governments Air Quality Strategy and Guidance for Local Authority on Local Air Quality Management, including on local action planning, can be found at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".1217W.3/2">DFID is aware that social exclusion and discrimination on the grounds of gender, caste, ethnicity or religion constrain access to resources by some of the poorest people in Asia. DFID has made a public commitment in its Asia Director's Delivery Plan and Country Assistance Plans to ensuring that reduction of social exclusion is explicitly addressed in all its Asia programmes. DFID also regards the empowerment of women as an essential precondition for the elimination of poverty and the upholding of human rights.</p>
	<p pid=".1217W.3/3">DFID promotes an inclusive approach to ensure that no groups are excluded from mainstream programmes. DFID seeks to address the causes and consequences of exclusion and encourages disagregation of data by Governments in the region, where possible, to ensure that programmes are in fact reaching the poorest marginalized groups and to identify where programmes are failing.</p>
	<p pid=".1217W.3/4">DFID works with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations in the poorest areas that advocate the rights of excluded groups. In India, DFID is currently supporting the development of a system to assess how well social exclusion is being addressed in the tsunami relief programme. Many NGOs, including some that are not receiving DFID funding have asked to be involved in this auditing scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1217W.3/5">Experience suggests that real change cannot be imposed by outside agencies. Recipients of aid, whether they are individuals, groups or Governments need to be convinced of the need for social inclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".1218W.2/1">DFID withdrew its bilateral development support to Burma in 1988 as a response to the military takeover that year. In 2001, when the view of the political situation in Burma took a more optimistic turn, DFID worked towards reviving its programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1218W.2/2">It is clear that progress towards a political settlement in Burma is an essential ingredient for significant pro-poor development and until such progress is made large-scale, sustainable poverty reduction will remain out of reach. However, as is explained in the DFID Burma Country Plan (available at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>) we continue to believe that in certain areas, we can have a valuable impact on poverty in Burma.</p>
	<p pid=".1218W.2/3">In 2003&ndash;04, as part of its work to prepare the Country Plan, DFID reviewed its experience of working in Burma and consulted widely with colleagues including FCO, civil society groups inside and outside Burma, the National League for Democracy the UN and other donors. Some key lessons identified by this work included: the need to be realistic about what we seek to achieve; the importance of taking a long-term approach; that it can be possible to influence Government policy in certain areas; and that donors need to, and can, work better together in Burma to share lessons and experience to increase our impact.</p>
	<p pid=".1218W.2/4">Since then DFID has worked with the UN, NGOs and other donors to develop programmes under the Country Plan objectives such as on HIV and AIDS, health, education and livelihoods of poor people.</p>
	<p pid=".1218W.2/5">The first review of progress with implementing the new Country Plan will take place by the end of 2005. This will draw on reports on the progress and impact of the programmes we are funding in Burma.</p>

	<p pid=".1219W.3/1">The events of last year's hurricane season in the Caribbean, has given an added urgency to the Department for International Development's (DFID) work on a Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy. There are best practice lessons to be learnt from within the region, for example in its preparedness for Hurricane Mitch and Cuba demonstrated that lives can be saved with a relatively small amount of resources. DFID's Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy, will be ready by autumn 2005, and will feed into our assistance plans for all the countries and regions where we work.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/2">Over the period 2003&ndash;08, DFID is providing &pound;3.75 million to the Pan American Health Organisation's Programme for Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief (PAHO PED). Of this money approximately a third will be allocated to the countries and territories of the Caribbean. PAHO PED focus on three key activities:</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/3" class="indent">preparing the health sector for disasters</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/4" class="indent">reducing the vulnerability of hospitals</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/5" class="indent">reducing the vulnerability of water and sanitation systems.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/6">PAHO PED have also trained many professionals in the Caribbean region on disaster risk reduction policy and practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/7">DFID's Overseas Territories Department (OTD) have a Disaster Management Adviser based in the Caribbean and an ongoing disaster management programme (&pound;350,000 per annum) with an emphasis on strengthening preparedness and risk reduction capabilities in the Caribbean Territories.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/8">The FCO has a &pound;55,000 per annum Good Governance Fund (GGF) disaster management project for the Overseas Territories (OTs) designed to raise the capacities of National Disaster Offices in the Caribbean OTs.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/9">Within these programmes DFID OTD and FCO OTD are providing &pound;80,000 to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency and Response Agency (CDERA) to facilitate national performance evaluations by Caribbean countries affected in the 2004 hurricane season. A high level forum is being organised for 2005 to share experiences, to identify opportunities to improve disaster planning and to agree an action plan. Evaluations are already under way.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/10">The DFID and FCO OT programmes have allocated &pound;30,000 for emergency supplies and capacity building of British Red Cross OT Branches in the Caribbean for 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/11">In a written response I gave to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon.

The study, to which we have allocated &pound;20,000, will aid the development of planning and preparedness criteria throughout the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/12">The disaster management adviser offers direct technical assistance to Caribbean Overseas Territories. He remains engaged and involved in the longer-term recovery and risk reduction programme in the Cayman Islands.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/13">With respect to the ongoing flooding emergency in Guyana, which is estimated to have affected 294,000 people or 39 per cent. of the population of Guyana, DFID immediately gave a total of &pound;100,000 to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for the delivery of emergency supplies and the Government of Guyana's own relief effort. This support will provide water purification sachets and water containers, and survival items such as blankets and treated mosquito nets to reduce the chances of malarial infection.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/14">DFID has also made available a 20-member six boat team from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution's (RNLI) Rapid Response Unit. This team is led by a member of DFID's Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department, and will help with the distribution of supplies in areas cut off by the floods. The estimated cost of the RNLI initiative is &pound;120,000, which includes the provision of 400 pairs of waders and 50 loudhailers (worth &pound;15,000). The RNLI team and these supplies arrived in Georgetown on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February 2005</phrase>. The RNLI team began work immediately and the supplies have been handed over to the Government of Guyana's Civil Defence Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/15">A further &pound;57,000 has been allocated to the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) in Guyana, to help improve the quality of drinking water for up to 195,000 people/35,000 households and offer short-term solutions for human waste disposal.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/16">The UK has also made &pound;95,000 available as part of our contribution to the European Commission's Humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.3/17">Once the immediate emergency has passed, we will work with the Government of Guyana, local and international relief agencies, to review and assess Guyana's disaster preparedness and the lessons learned from these floods.</p>

	<p pid=".1222W.6/1">The UK Government is Rwanda's major bilateral development partner. Our engagement with the Government of Rwanda is based on the UK/Rwanda Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU describes the Government of Rwanda's commitments to the Rwandan people on poverty reduction, promoting regional stability, creating a democratic and inclusive state, and progressively securing human rights. The Government of Rwanda's undertakings include commitment to playing a full part in international and regional initiatives to prevent and reduce conflict within and between countries and establish peace in central Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.6/2">The MoU confirms that the UK's engagement depends on continuing progress in these areas. Should we believe that the Government of Rwanda is not honouring the commitments made in the MoU, the UK's programme of assistance to the Government of Rwanda may be reconfigured or suspended.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.6/3">DFID is concerned by reports that Rwanda planned to mount a cross-border operation in DRC against elements of the ex-FAR and the Interahamwe (ex-FAR/l). Any military action by Rwanda in DRC would have very serious repercussions for Rwanda, DRC and the region as a whole. DFID has urged all parties to refrain from any actions that would breach international law and undermine regional stability and the work of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC). We therefore welcome the recent statements by the Government of Rwanda indicating that they will not pursue cross-border military action and will support international efforts to disarm the ex-FAR/l in eastern DRC.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.6/4">DFID condemns the attacks made by the ex-FAR/l against Rwandan citizens and territory and also recognises that the disarmament of the ex-FAR/l is a critical requirement that needs to be addressed urgently. We are working actively with the UN and international partners on how this can best be addressed.</p>

	<p pid=".1223W.9/1">The Crown Prosecution Service instructs experienced and committed advocates to prosecute cases involving allegations of rape. This includes instructing advocates of the necessary skill, competence and sensitivity to prosecute rape cases. In London and the South East advocates are instructed from a specialist list. In other parts of the country, Grade 4 advocates are instructed where possible. CPS Areas have been advised in guidance issued in August 2003 that local monitoring is appropriate. Examples of local monitoring carried out by CPS Areas include the monitoring of the performance of counsel at trial by experienced caseworkers; monitoring by rape specialists for part of the trial and the raising of performance issues with local Heads of Chambers and at Joint Advocates Selection Committee as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".1223W.9/2">In 2002, HMCPSI produced a report on the investigation and prosecution of Rape Offences. It made a number of recommendations, which have been followed up in a joint agency rape action plan. HMCPSI keeps the handling of rape cases under review in its inspection of Areas.</p>

The corresponding figure for its vehicle database was 85.6 per cent. The main cause of error was motorists' failure to notify DVLA that they had changed address and 18 per cent. of driving licence holders and 7 per cent. of vehicle keepers had failed to do so. This means that DVLA's records were sufficiently up-to-date to allow law enforcement agencies to trace vehicle keepers in over 92 per cent. of cases.</p>

	<p pid=".1238W.2/1">It is not appropriate to provide anonymity for people accused of crime for a number of reasons. The principle that criminal trials should take place in open court and be freely reported is one of the key foundations of our criminal justice system. The fact that the system is open and transparent, and that the media is able to report freely what has taken place publicly in court, helps ensure public confidence in the system and helps encourage victims and witnesses to come forward. Also anonymity would raise important principles of the freedom of the press and the public interest. Publicity can work to an accused person's advantage: by helping him or her gather support and bringing to light evidence in his or her behalf. Equally there have been examples of responsible investigative journalism bringing to light cases of serious abuse that might otherwise have gone undetected.</p>
	<p pid=".1238W.2/2">However, someone who is under investigation by the police but who has not been charged with a criminal offence should not be identified in the press. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has issued revised guidance to all police forces, applying to all offences, which makes it clear that anyone under investigation, but not charged, should not be named, or details provided to the press which might lead to their identification before they are charged.</p>

Despite this, elections took place successfully as planned, with initial indications of a high turn out and less violence than many anticipated. This reflects the thoroughness of the security arrangements put in place by the Iraqi Security Forces, the efforts of the Multi National Force-Iraq in support, and the determination of the Iraqi people to exercise their democratic rights.</p>

	<p pid=".1249W.5/1">The United Kingdom takes very seriously the need to respect Iraq's cultural heritage. We are not aware of any assessments identifying damage done to sites of archaeological and historical significance by the British Army in Iraq. We have, however, taken a number of steps to minimise the risk. This includes being a signatory to the 1977 Additional Protocol (AP1) of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Under the terms of AP1, civilian objects are to be protected from attack unless that object is being used for military purposes, in which case it may lose its special protected status. An aide memoire is also issued to all UK service personnel deploying under Operation Telic, which reminds service personnel of their obligation under AP1. The leaflet contains a pictorial example of the protective emblem that can be used under the Hague Cultural Property Convention 1954, to which Iraq is a full signatory, to denote buildings used for religion, art, science, charity, historical monuments, or other important cultural sites. During the combat phase of Operation Telic, legal advisors briefed commanders deploying to theatre about the importance of protecting cultural property. Further guidance was, and continues to be available in the rules of engagement and the targeting directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.5/2">In addition to operating under AP1, we are signatories to UNSCR 1546, which stresses that all parties need to respect and protect Iraq's archaeological, historical, cultural, and religious heritage. HMG also recently announced its intention to take forward the ratification of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.5/3">The Secretary of State for Defence has not had any direct consultations with the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities or British archaeologists and scholars regarding the impact of activities of the British Army in Iraq. We do, however, work in partnership with other Departments who take the lead on this issue. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department of Culture, Media and Sport, have regular discussions with the Iraqi Ministry of Culture on these issues. The UK has provided support to the British Museum to enable them to help the Iraqi Ministry assess the damage caused to archaeological sites in Iraq and to ensure their future protection.</p>

	<p pid=".1251W.5/1">The anthrax vaccine given to United Kingdom defence personnel is the same as that used for civilians in the UK and its composition has not changed since the vaccine was licensed in 1979. The active ingredient is a sterile filtrate of an alum precipitated anthrax antigen in a solution for injection. The other ingredients are aluminium potassium sulphate, sodium chloride and purified water and the preservative is thiomersal at 0.005 per cent. The composition of the current UK licensed anthrax vaccine is available on the Health Protection Agency website.</p>

These figures are provisional and subject to final audit. In the current financial year ending March 2005, it is estimated that the likely spend will be some &pound;33.986 million.

In such cases ICSTIS has imposed fines and/or instructed that access to the service is barred.</p>

These requirements, and the requirements for evaluation to demonstrate performance, we shall take to the market when the Identity Cards programme enters its procurement stage which is subject to approval of the Identity Cards Bill which is currently before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".1271W.9/1">The creation of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) offers a unique opportunity to sustain and expand existing voluntary sector work with offenders, while opening up the prospect of new areas for partnership and engagement with the voluntary and community sector. A new Voluntary Sector Unit has been established to provide a national lead and, will work closely with the recently appointed Regional Offender Managers, assisting them in being able to reach, support and work effectively with voluntary groups in their regions. The work of the Unit will be overseen by an independently chaired Advisory Group drawn from the voluntary sector, prisons and probation. A voluntary sector representative has been appointed to the NOMS Board, voluntary groups are included in the working group on Offender Management and proposals are being developed for a voluntary sector stakeholder group to help develop the mixed economy of provision for NOMS.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.9/2">NOMS published a draft strategy &quot;The Role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in the National Offender Management Service&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>. This has been sent to voluntary and community groups and staff working with them in prisons and probation for consultation. The consultation period will run to 25April 2005 and a revised strategy will be produced in the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.9/3">NOMS commissioned a study in Yorkshire and Humberside by Sheffield Hallam University. &quot;Enhancing the Role of the Voluntary Sector&quot; The study examines the extent and nature of current voluntary sector involvement with correctional services, identifies good practice in working relationships, assesses the potential for extending involvement, identifies barriers and capacity building needs and suggests ways to help to overcome these.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.9/4">Copies of these reports have been widely circulated and are also available on the Home Office and Prison Service websites.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.9/5">A major conference and exhibition was held on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-22">22 November 2004</phrase>, to highlight the contribution made by voluntary and community groups to support the delivery of services to prisoners, offenders and their families. The event was attended by over 500 delegates.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.9/6">Funding for 2005 and 2006 has been secured from the Home Office Active Communities Directorate's Change Up programme to support the development of the voluntary sector in this area. This includes training, advice and support to help the voluntary sector prepare for contestability. We will also encourage projects where large organisations work with smaller, local groups; and a project to address the needs of under-represented groups, particularly those from the black and minority ethnic sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.9/7">A Strategic Partnership Project has been established, led by Clinks, the organisation that supports voluntary and community groups working with offenders and their families. This has provided NOMS with a network of organisations and a quick and easy route to consultation. NOMS has been able to fund a Partnership Manager to support and service this work.</p>

	<p pid=".1275W.6/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department's aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities pf the citizen, and to modernize the law and constitution.</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.6/2">Currently, the Department has six strategy objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has seven Public Service Agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.6/3">Examples of the activity in 2004 to deliver these objectives include work with partners to make sure criminal trials are more efficient with the numbers of ineffective Crown Court trials falling from 24 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 16 per cent. in September 2004. The rate has reduced from 31 per cent. to 25 per cent. for the same period in the magistrates courts. The Department has also been involved in work to help people resolve their disputes in the most effective way, including pilots to test the effectiveness of court-based mediation. During 2004 there was a reduction from almost 49 per cent. to 41 per cent. in those cases that had eventually to be resolved by a hearing. Another area where pilots were used successfully was for all postal voting in four regions of England at the combined European and local elections in June 2004. Voter turnout doubled in the pilot regions compared with 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".1275W.6/4">The range of the Department's policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to all of that activity is not collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost. However, statistical information about the Department's activities can be found at:</p>

It does not have statutory responsibilities in relation to mayoral referendums or local issues referendums under the Local Government Act 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1279W.2/4">The Commission has, however, on two occasions commented on suggestions for combining elections and referendums. In July 2002 the Electoral Commission issued a statement regarding the possibility of elections to the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, and English local government elections, being combined with a referendum on the adoption of the single currency. In February 2004, it responded to the ODPM's consultation on combining regional and local referendums and on local referendum rules.</p>
	<p pid=".1279W.2/5">On both occasions, the Commission expressed concerns about the possibility of combination, reflecting its view that on balance it is disadvantageous for elections to be combined with referendums.

	<p pid=".1287W.8/1">The Government's initial response to Kate Barker's report was provided by my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister alongside the budget on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-17">17 March 2004</phrase>. We said then that we intend to bring forward a package of measures to address the recommendations of the Barker review by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1287W.8/2">Kate Barker's proposals build on the approach adopted in the Communities Plan, launched by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister in February 2003. Her analysis has reinforced our case and strategy for more growth. In particular, the Government has accepted Kate Barker's central recommendation that there should be a step change in housing supply and intends to set a national market affordability goal, by the end of 2005, as part of the package of measures in response to the Barker Review.</p>
	<p pid=".1287W.8/3">In advance of the wider package, and in response to one of Kate Barker's recommendations, the Government recently consulted on proposals to strengthen regional integration by bringing together regional planning bodies and regional housing boards and to provide the merged bodies with independent advice. Following that consultation, we will be announcing decisions shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".1287W.8/4">In the 2004 Spending Review, we made a start on infrastructure investment in creating a Community Infrastructure Fund, as recommended by Kate Barker. An extra &pound;50 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;150 million in 2007&ndash;08 will be available to finance transport projects needed to sustain housing growth. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor also allocated funds which, with additional Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding, aims to provide an extra 10,000 new homes for social let annually, together with resources that will help deliver the 200,000 new homes identified in the Sustainable Communities Plan in Thames Gateway and the other growth areas by 2016 and go further by responding to new proposals for growth.</p>

	<p pid=".1289W.0/1">The Government announced in November 2002 a package of freedoms and flexibilities for local authorities which would be granted following Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA). All authorities have gained new powers to borrow and to charge for discretionary services, and the freedom to spend surplus street parking income on environmental improvements. We have also given them powers to establish Business Improvement Districts and to vary council tax discounts.</p>

	<p pid=".1289W.3/1">The Government has invited the Audit Commission to take on the role of performance assessment for the Fire and Rescue Service in England. The Audit Commission is currently implementing the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) across the 46 English Fire and Rescue Authorities and will publish the results by August 2005. London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority has already been assessed as part of the Greater London Authority's Initial Performance Assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".1289W.3/2">Neither the Government nor the Audit Commission have any specific plans at present to extend the CPA to Police Authorities. However, the recently published Police Reform White Paper, Building Communities, Beating Crime, suggests a package of measures intended to clarify and strengthen new accountability arrangements for policing. These propose that police authorities, for the first time, be subject to inspection and intervention. The detail of this will be worked though in conjunction with stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid=".1289W.6/1">Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) was introduced in 2002. Prior to April 2004, no regulatory impact assessment was required for any proposal that impacted solely on public services, and it was determined at the time that the CPA proposals met this criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".1289W.6/2">The Audit Commission are currently consulting on proposals for Comprehensive Performance Assessment from 2005. These proposals include a reduction, by 2006&ndash;07, of 68 per cent. in the volume of inspection required to support CPA, compared to the 2002&ndash;03 level. A regulatory impact assessment has not been provided with this consultation because current guidelines only demand one for public sector proposals that impose an additional burden of over &pound;5 million per annum.</p>

However under the Licensing Act 1964, a special hours certificate is required to permit the sale and consumption of alcohol during specified times on particular days outside the permitted hours up to 2.00 am, and 3.00 am in the West End of London.

Like other lottery distributors, the fund will not have Government defined, ring-fenced programmes but will engage more with local communities and respond to their aspirations and needs. We expect funding for children's play projects to continue to come from across all lottery distributors, and to reach &pound;200 million between 2006 and 2012.</p>

As part of this process of land assembly, the LDA is responsible for ensuring that any business that needs to be relocated receives compensation in line with the current legislation and is given the opportunity to relocate to an alternative site. The LDA has gone beyond its statutory obligations by making sure that each business has already received an offer making clear what compensation would be payable in the event that they need to be relocated. This compensation offer ensures that every business with a compensatable interest will receive the market value of their property interest and will also receive payments in respect of costs incurred in relocating their business, including any loss of profits directly attributable to the relocation. All of these payments will be made as though the property had been compulsorily acquired, even though no compulsory purchase order is currently in place and there is no obligation to offer compensation on this basis.</p>

	<p pid=".1314W.0/1">The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) printed 59 million ballot papers for the national and provincial elections. The total number of ballot papers allocated to a polling station was determined by the voter register. A small number of surplus ballots were provided to account for spoilt ballots. The IECI ensured that ballot papers were under observation throughout the process, including putting the ballots in tamper evident bags during transit to the tally centre.</p>
	<p pid=".1314W.0/2">On polling day, voters were required to present identification and were checked against the voter register before entering the polling station and collecting a ballot paper. Once their vote was cast, their finger was marked with indelible ink.</p>
	<p pid=".1314W.0/3">Before the election took place the voter register was presented for challenges. 4,500 deceased voters had already been removed at an earlier stage. Any that were identified during the challenge period were marked as ineligible.</p>

	<p pid=".1320W.5/2">There has, however, been significant improvement in Turkey's human rights record since 1996, brought about by the Turkish Government's EU-driven domestic reform programme. The European Commission's 2004 progress report on Turkey states that</p>

A package of constitutional amendments was adopted by Turkey in May 2004, that included affirmation that international human rights agreements take precedence over domestic law.

The National Health Service knowledge and skills framework provides a single, comprehensive framework on which to base the review and development of all non-medical staff in the NHS.

	<p pid=".1328W.11/1">The majority of dental practices treat both private and national health service patients under an &quot;open&quot; contract with a primary care trust. The Office of Fair Trading report &quot;The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, published in March 2003 estimated that out of 11,000 dental practices about 210 are private. The table shows by London constituency the numbers of dentists who stopped doing general or personal dental service work in England and Wales during the year as a percentage of the total number of dentists for the years 1997 to 2004. These figures do not include dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing NHS work for a number of different reasons, for example, retirement or to take a short-term absence, apart from the reason that the dentist only wished to treat private patients. New contractual arrangements, which we are to introduce by April 2006, are intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dentists.</p>

The FSA will, in addition, provide information on the ingredients listed in the FSD and on the scope of the directive. It is the responsibility of food supplements manufacturers to ensure that the products on sale after <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> meet the requirements of the FSD and to decide what information is available to consumers on the products on sale. Manufacturers have had three years in which to produce dossiers.</p>
	<p pid=".1332W.0/2">No assessment has been made by the FSA of which supplements will be banned or reformulated under the FSD. The number of supplements which will be banned or need to be reformulated under the FSD will be dependent on the number of dossiers submitted by industry for assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Where a dossier for a particular ingredient has been submitted to either the UK or another European Union member state then that ingredient will be able to continue to be used in food supplements until December 2009 pending an opinion from EFSA on its use beyond 2009.</p>
	<p pid=".1332W.0/3">An assessment of the economic impact of the Food Supplement Regulations was made in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which accompanied the regulations. Article 4(8) of the FSD states that, no later than <phrase class="date" code="">12 July 2007</phrase>, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on whether the directive should be amended to increase its scope to include other nutrients as well as vitamins and minerals. This will also include a proposal for any amendments to the directive that the Commission deems necessary. The FSA will provide any information requested from member states by the Commission to inform this report.</p>
	<p pid=".1332W.0/4">The directive does not at present set limits for the levels of vitamins, which can be used in food supplements.

	<p pid=".1332W.0/5">The list of supplements in annexes 1 and 2 of the FSD has not been altered since the directive was agreed in July 2002.

	<p pid=".1339W.2/1">The Government's modernisation of the national health service, underpinned by a sustained investment programme, is delivering more staff, faster treatment, more hospitals, a new focus on quality and, crucially, more choice for patients. Coupled with an increase in the NHS budget from &pound;43.9 billion in 2000&ndash;01 to &pound;69 billion in 2004&ndash;05 has come an increased devolution of power and responsibility to the front line NHS: 80 per cent. of the NHS budget in England is now devolved to local primary care trusts (PCTs), and central targets have been dramatically reduced to give the local NHS in rural and urban areas alike the headroom to address local priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.2/2">The Government have therefore given PCTs in rural areas the resources and the authority to make a difference locally and address rural needs. At the national level the Department is committed to rural proofing policies so that they take into account the needs of people living in rural areas. To further support the rural proofing agenda, last year the Government incorporated the rural proofing checklist within the regulatory impact assessment framework, thus ensuring that new policies are screened for their impact on rural communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.2/3">The Department also supports rural health initiatives through grants to the voluntary sector. The Department has funded the Institute of Rural Health since 2001. The Institute is currently working on two projects (i) the rural health forum project which provides a regular interface between Government Departments and health providers at national, regional and local levels, and (ii) a rural proofing toolkit which will help PCTs and policy makers identify the health needs of residents in rural areas and help incorporate those needs into policy making at a strategic level.</p>
	<p pid=".1339W.2/4">The Department has also taken specific actions to help patients living with stress and mental health problems in rural areas. The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) in implementing the national suicide prevention strategy is providing specific support for farmers and their families. We are also part funding a network of support for people in rural communities who are suffering from stress.</p>

	<p pid=".1340W.3/1">The Department has provided some &pound;5 million of funding, over three years, for mental health helplines provided by voluntary and community sector (VCS) organisations. This funding can be accessed by VCS organisations via the mental health helplines investment framework that has been commissioned to support providers of mental health helplines in developing capacity; enabling 24 hour access, and to increase the quality of service provision through accredited training and accreditation against quality standards.</p>
	<p pid=".1340W.3/2">The investment framework will be launched by the Department next month and applications for funding will be considered by a steering group represented by a range of mental health helpline providers, including Saneline.</p>

	<p pid=".1340W.6/1">Saneline provides information, advice and emotional support for people with mental health problems and responds to around 50,000 callers per year. Saneline operates a virtual network with calls routed to whichever site has capacity. At present, Saneline is operating two of its three centres without a reduction in capacity. Saneline refers many of its callers to a range of other helpline providers who, jointly, take a significant number of mental health calls.</p>
	<p pid=".1340W.6/2">There are around 60 other mental health helpline providers within the voluntary and community sector that provide an excellent service and, between them, handle significant number of calls on mental health issues. Of these, Samaritans receive in excess of 4.8 million contacts a year, of which 2.5 million are by telephone and the majority of these are from people with mental health problems. The organisation Rethink's helplines handle approximately 80,000 calls per year. The majority of these helpline providers, including SANE, Samaritans, Rethink and Mind, are members of the Department's mental health helplines partnership, which aims to achieve greater consistency, quality and choice for people who use members' helpline services.</p>
	<p pid=".1340W.6/3">In the statutory sector, NHS Direct provides a 24 hour, seven days a week service and its fully-trained staff respond to about 325,000 calls per year from people with mental health issues. NHS Direct works in close partnership with the member organisations of the mental health helplines partnership, including Saneline.</p>
	<p pid=".1340W.6/4">The Department's contract with Saneline was for two years and it ends on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. The total contract value was &pound;2 million. Part of the contract payment was delayed during discussions on contractual detail with Saneline and when invoices were delayed as a result. No formal assessment of the impact of any potential reduction in Saneline's activities has been made. Saneline, like other voluntary and community sector organisations in health and social care, can apply for further funding.</p>

	<p pid=".1341W.5/2">From the DSPD beds, no patients have absconded. From the personality disorder beds, two patients have failed to return from leave.</p>
	<p pid=".1341W.5/3">When a decision is taken to send a patient on leave, a detailed risk assessment is carried out beforehand. This details the potential risks involved should a patient abscond and a plan is in place to deal with these risks should it happen.</p>

	<p pid=".1342W.5/1">To date, most human embryonic stem cell lines have been cultured for laboratory research using nutritional support from animal cells. It is therefore not surprising that a recent United States study has demonstrated that many of the human embryonic stem cell lines, which can be used in federally-funded research in the US, are contaminated with a molecule from animal cells. As with any contaminated therapeutic product, these cells could never be used for clinical applications.</p>
	<p pid=".1342W.5/2">Unlike the situation in the US, United Kingdom legislation permits the generation of new embryonic stem cell lines.

The research was conducted at both pre and post stages of the publicity activity. Overall, the research suggested that this activity had a positive effect in raising levels of awareness among our primary target audience of pensioners. Those respondents aged 65 plus were more likely than other age groups to have seen or heard something about paying less council tax, and this increased from 19 per cent. at the pre-publicity stage to 29 per cent. at the post-publicity stage.</p>

	<p pid=".1356W.0/1">The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2002. The available information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1356W.0/2">The cost of the departmental staff survey (excluding consultancy costs) was &pound;249,000 in 2002 and &pound;136,000 in 2003. The survey cycle for 2004 is not yet complete, but costs are estimated at &pound;130,000. All surveys have been available to all individuals within the Department, with responses ranging from 74,000 to 77,000 completed questionnaires. Data reports are made available not only at departmental and business level, but for over 500 different operational units, allowing improvement actions to be identified at both national and local levels. Reports detailing the breakdown of demographic data allow monitoring of the effectiveness of diversity and equality policies and targets.</p>

Information on winter 2004&ndash;05 is not yet available but we expect the number to be similar.</p>
