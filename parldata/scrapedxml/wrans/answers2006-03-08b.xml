	<p pid="b.1491W.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is making a very significant contribution to the Respect agenda through the &pound;39 billion Sustainable Communities Plan. The ODPM is in particular making key contributions on the specific themes of housing, family support and working to make neighbourhoods cleaner, safer and greener.</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/2">For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/3" class="indent">ODPM, along with the Respect Task Force and Department for Education and Skills (DfES), are key players in a cross departmental initiative aimed at establishing family support projects in up to 50 areas during 2006&ndash;07. This will help prevent and reduce homelessness. The projects will be delivered through the Local Area Agreement (LAA) framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/4" class="indent">ODPM is co-funding the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund which will contribute to reduced crime, reducing the harm caused by illegal drugs, addressing antisocial behaviour, empowering communities and improving the condition of streets and public spaces in disadvantaged areas. And the successful Neighbourhood Managers and Wardens programmes will be rolled out more widely.</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/5" class="indent">We have allocated &pound;1.5 billion over 2005&ndash;08 to the 86 most deprived local authority areas in England. Local Strategic Partnerships use these funds alongside their main programmes&mdash;usually concentrating on crime and antisocial behaviour, educational underachievement, worklessness, housing/environment and health issues&mdash;to improve public services and aid long term regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/6" class="indent">Our proposed Neighbourhood Charters will provide formal, agreed, identification of the rights, duties and responsibilities between citizens, public services and others at a local, neighbourhood, level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/7" class="indent">The Supporting People programme will contribute to the Respect agenda by providing housing related support to vulnerable people and helping them improve their quality of life through the provision of a stable environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1491W.2/8" class="indent">We are also developing a &quot;Respect Standard&quot; for housing management which will set out the core elements of a good service. We are also working to strengthen the links between enforcement tools and support packages to address the underlying causes of antisocial behaviour while simultaneously acting on the needs of the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.1493W.14/2">We are currently consulting on both the principle and method of a badger culling policy, including what methods of disposal would be suitable to minimise risk of disease transmission, assist in monitoring a cull of badgers and be practical.

	<p pid="b.1494W.8/1">Defra has policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk management in England and provides most of the Government funding for managing that risk. Flood and coastal defence operating authorities (the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards) are Defra's delivery partners. Operating authorities have &quot;permissive powers&quot; which means that while they may undertake flood and coastal erosion risk measures, they are not generally obliged to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1494W.8/2">Coast Protection authorities (district or unitary councils) have permissive powers to carry out works to manage the risk of coastal erosion or encroachment by the sea under the Coast Protection Act 1949. Subject to conditions determined by the Treasury, Defra may make grants towards any expenditure. To satisfy conditions, proposals must satisfy essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve a relevant priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1494W.8/3">The Act also includes provisions for the safety of navigation. Sections 34 and 35 refer to consents to undertake a broad range of marine works in the sea around the coasts of England and Wales. Defra is responsible for administering these provisions on behalf of the Secretary of State. Defra expects to make proposals for improving the regime for regulating works at sea, of which these controls are a component, in a Marine Bill to be introduced later in this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.1498W.6/1">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 extends the night noise provisions in the Noise Act 1996 to licensed premises. Local authorities will be able to fine those responsible for excess noise from licensed premises between 11 pm and 7 am. Those found responsible for exceeding the permitted level of noise will be liable to a fine of up to &pound;5,000 upon summary conviction. A local authority will be able to offer the responsible person the option to discharge liability to conviction with the payment of a fixed penalty notice of &pound;500 within 14 days. It is planned to bring these provisions into force in the autumn. They will complement the power to close licensed premises on noise grounds introduced by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1498W.6/2">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also gives local authorities new powers to designate alarm notification areas in which it will be a requirement for those with intruder alarms to register key-holder details with the local authority. Local authorities will be able to contact key-holders in the event that an alarm sounding for 20 minutes continuously or one hour intermittently causes annoyance to those in the vicinity. Local authorities will also be able to enter premises without force, where possible, to deactivate an alarm, and to obtain a warrant to force entry where this is not possible. Silencing misfiring intruder alarms as quickly as possible is particularly important at night. These new powers, which will be commenced in April, are additional to the existing statutory nuisance powers under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="b.1498W.6/3">The Government is also taking steps to reduce environmental noise at night. The Department for Transport has responsibility for controlling aircraft noise at night at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports. Restrictions, comprising a movements limit and supplementary noise controls, are set on a seasonal basis for a 5&ndash;6 year period. The Department has recently consulted on a night restrictions regime to apply from October 2006 at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1498W.6/4">At regional airports noise restrictions are set by the Airport Operator, in accordance with any planning conditions which may apply.</p>

The Government are negotiating a similar agreement with the Periodical Publishers Association to increase the recycling of magazines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1500W.8/8">To help improve the economics of recycling as well as better reflect the true environmental impact of landfill, the Government have committed to an annual increase on landfill tax of at least &pound;3/t until it reaches &pound;35/t.</p>

	<p pid="b.1502W.2/1">We have no plans to introduce further legislation on packaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1502W.2/2">There are two sets of Regulations which cover packaging in the UK and which encourage businesses (including supermarkets) to minimise packaging and to manufacture packaging which can be recycled.</p>
	<p pid="b.1502W.2/3">The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) include a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer. These Regulations also require that</p>
	<p pid="b.1502W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;packaging . . . be designed, produced and commercialised . . . to permit its . . . recovery, including recycling, and to minimise its impact on the environment . . .&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1502W.2/5">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. Because the amount of packaging waste recycling businesses have to do is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle, they can cut costs if they reduce the packaging used around their products.</p>
	<p pid="b.1502W.2/6">Legislation is one way of reducing packaging, but consumers have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought 'loose' food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers might be encouraged to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.</p>

	<p pid="b.1503W.0/1">Estimates of the type sought are not normally made or held by Government. National policy set out in Planning Policy Statement 10 &quot;Planning for Sustainable Waste Management&quot; expects regional planning bodies to prepare regional spatial strategies which aim to provide sufficient opportunities to meet the identified needs of their areas for waste management for all waste streams. In turn, planning authorities are expected to prepare local development documents that reflect their contribution to delivering the regional spatial strategy. At the regional level, regional technical advisory bodies support the work of regional planning bodies and have a key role in assembling data and information on waste including from the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1504W.5/1">The most relevant area of publicly funded research is the Drinking Water Quality and Health Research programme, managed by the Drinking Water Inspectorate. Such research can provide credible and authoritative information and help to ensure that regulations and standards for water quality provide adequate safeguards. Much of this programme touches upon issues related to water purification and summaries of all the reports can be found on the Foundation for Water Research website at <a href="http://www.fwr.org">www.fwr.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1504W.5/2">Treatment of the public water supply is an issue for the water companies themselves, although the Research Councils and the European Union's Framework research programmes contribute significant funding to the development of new technologies. Consequently, Defra does not normally fund research into water treatment technologies for drinking water, unless the research is needed to inform new regulations, or where there may be a perceived risk to health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1504W.5/3">One example of research that includes methods of purifying water derived from private sources, is the production of the &quot;Manual on treatment for small water supplies systems&quot;. This was produced to help local authorities to discharge their statutory duties and functions relating to private water supplies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1505W.5/2">Water companies are already factoring new house building into their water resources plans, using projections from ODPM and local authorities. Ofwat has already assumed in its current price limits that almost 1 million new properties will be connected to the water and sewerage service by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1505W.5/3">To fulfil their duty to maintain adequate supplies of water, several water companies propose to enlarge existing reservoirs (three in total) or construct new ones (five in total). These proposals are set out in the 25 year water resources plans they prepared in 2004. The Environment Agency has advised Ministers about the appropriateness of these proposals and other measures to ensure security of supply in its report &quot;Maintaining water supply&quot;, which was published in July 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1505W.5/4">Planning for new sewerage systems should be carried out in close and transparent co-operation between planners and water and sewerage companies. The provision of water and sewerage services are key factors in ensuring the sustainability of new housing developments. New sewers are usually laid by developers or requisitioned from the water and sewerage companies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1507W.2/5" class="indent">ONS carried out a Race Equality Impact Assessment (REIA) on the proposed relocation prior to the final decision being taken. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) has confirmed that it welcomes the actions that have been taken by ONS with regard to the General Statutory Duty under s.71(1) of the Race relations Act 1976, as amended, in respect of employees who will relocate to Newport and Titchfield. CRE has asked ONS to consider whether there need to be further specific measures in place to support ethnic minority staff who choose not to relocate. ONS is currently consulting its Trade Unions and Diversity Groups on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/6" class="indent">(56508)&mdash;To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what funds have been allocated by the Department for (a) redundancy, (b) relocation, (c) recruitment, (d) training and (e) travel costs in relation to the relocation of Office for National Statistics London-based staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/7" class="indent">Appropriate funds are being held within ONS budgets for all of these purposes. These funds are not measured separately and are held within a number of operating budgets as part of the ONS spending baseline. However, ONS received agreement from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to provide up to &pound;5 million of extra funding in each of the next two years to match funding already provided for by ONS. This was mainly provided in recognition of the fact that ONS needed to reduce staff numbers quicker than could be achieved through natural wastage in order to deliver the efficiency savings we have identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.1507W.2/9" class="indent">ONS aims to meet targets for relocation in a way that protects our ability to deliver our business and achieves cost savings in order to fund future work. We are providing assistance to staff who wish to relocate. Where staff choose not to relocate we are helping them to move into other skilled roles, often elsewhere within ONS or within Government. Where specific skills are key to the continuity of ONS business, we aim to retain those skills in London until such time as we can replace them on our Newport or Titchfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/10" class="indent">(56510)&mdash;To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, how much the Office for National Statistics has spent on modernisation in the last five years; and what assessment has been made of the impact of such modernisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/11" class="indent">ONS has spend &pound;54.5 million on the Statistical and Technical Modernisation Programme begun three years ago. The Programme has delivered a working prototype for a new statistical database, re-engineered methods and business processes for key statistical systems, new standardised tools and software and a modernised IT infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/12" class="indent">(56511)&mdash;To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what estimate the Office for National Statistics has made of the number of people it requires to deliver key outcomes in (a) 2006 and (b) 2007; and at what (i) grades, (ii) salary and (iii) sites.</p>

	<p pid="b.1508W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your question regarding the population of <i>(a)</i> each Gloucestershire District and <i>(b)</i> each ward in the Stroud district according to (i) figures from the 2001 Census, (ii) most recent electoral rolls, and (iii) most recent figures for health service users; and what projections have been made for the next five years. I am replying in her absence. (55426)</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/4" class="indent">The tables attached provide the information you have requested. Data for Gloucestershire Districts are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Data for wards in Stroud district are shown in Table 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/5" class="indent">ONS publishes annual mid-year population estimates. The latest estimates are for mid-2004 and are given in Table 1. These mid-year population estimates are the best estimates of the resident population in an area. They are based on Census data taking into account ageing of the population and are adjusted for births, deaths, and net migration. Further information on the methodology can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575">www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/6" class="indent">Population projections for each district in Gloucestershire, for mid-2005 to mid-2011, are also given in Table 1. These projections are based on the mid-2003 population estimates and are the latest population projections available. They assume that trends in fertility, mortality and migration at the time of the mid-2003 population estimate will continue into the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/7" class="indent">Electoral rolls provide counts of the number of people registered to vote. Local/European electorate and Parliamentary electorate counts for districts in Gloucestershire can be found in Table 2. The 2004 figures are given for comparison with population estimates and the 2005 figures are the latest available data. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are a number of reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/8" class="indent">Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/9" class="indent">The number of people registered with a GP, living in each district in Gloucestershire, in July 2004, can also be found in Table 2. It should also be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/10" class="indent">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/11" class="indent">Ward data are shown in Table 3; the points set out above also apply to wards. However, there are some further points to note for wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/12" class="indent">The most recent population estimates for wards are for mid-2002. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care. The margin of confidence for population estimates is proportionately larger at ward level than at local authority level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/13" class="indent">The ONS does not produce projections of population at ward level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/14" class="indent">Table 3 contains CAS ward electorate counts for December 2002 and 2004 as well as patient register figures for July 2002 and July 2004. The 2002 figures are given for comparison with population estimates and 2004 are the latest available data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/15" class="indent">Finally, the local government electorate is definitionally closer to the population estimates; however these data are not available at ward level. Hence, the Parliamentary electorate is shown.</p>

	<p pid="b.1513W.3/1">As part of the Government's Climate Change Programme, various policies are in place to promote energy efficiency across the economy, including in the road transport sector where most oil is consumed. These include EU level voluntary agreements with car manufacturers on the fuel efficiency of new cars and company car tax rules. In addition, the Government recently announced the creation of the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) to introduce renewable fuels into the transport system. The RTFO announcement said that, by 2010, oil companies would be obliged to ensure that 5 per cent. of the fuel that they sell is made from renewable bio-sources.</p>

	<p pid="b.1515W.9/1">These bodies explained their role at the Public Inquiry and presented evidence to the Inspector accordingly. In addition, the South East Region (which includes the South East England Regional Assembly, the South East England Development Agency and the Government Office South East working with a wide range of partners and stakeholders) has recently provided advice to Government on the timing and funding of the A3 Improvement Scheme at Hindhead as part of its overall advice on priorities for major transport schemes. The Environment Agency is one of four statutory environmental bodies which advise Government on the environmental impacts of road improvements. Improvement schemes which are approved for funding would be developed and delivered by the Highways Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1518W.0/1">The Government are providing an extra &pound;350 million for 2006&ndash;07 which is sufficient to fund the cost to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1518W.0/2">Concessionary fares are funded through the formula grant system administered by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM).

	<p pid="b.1519W.5/1">In his report &quot;Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas&quot; Lord Donaldson charged the Department for Transport and the then Department of the Environment with determining how to identify MEHRAs. The Department for Transport, Department of the Environment and now Defra have worked closely with Devolved Administrations and statutory nature conservation advisors to develop the process for identifying MEHRAs through a robust and objective methodology. This included a parallel assessment of pollution from shipping risk and environmental sensitivity. Other environmental protection measures already in place at each location were also taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/2">The assessment of Coastal Pollution risk involved five distinct processes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/3" class="indent">1. Hazard identification</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/4" class="indent">2. Establishing ship routeing in UK waters</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/5" class="indent">3. The assessment of accident frequency</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/6" class="indent">4. The assessment of oil pollution spill frequency</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/7" class="indent">5. The ranking of coastal pollution risk</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/8">The approach taken to the assessment of the environmental sensitivity of each coastal cell was developed from the considerations outlined in Lord Donaldson's report 'Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas'. The classification of sites was however expanded considerably to include the following categories:</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/9" class="indent">Wildlife designations and sites;</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/10" class="indent">Vulnerability of seabirds to oil pollution at identified sites;</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/11" class="indent">Fishing data, including fish farms, shell-fishing areas etc;</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/12" class="indent">Amenity/Economy, represented by locations such as Blue Flag Beaches, Marinas and Country Parks;</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/13" class="indent">Landscape, including Heritage Coastal, National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/14" class="indent">Geological, including World Heritage Sites and Conservation Review Sites</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/15">In accordance with this methodology, only those areas which scored highly both in terms of environmental sensitivity and in terms of risk from shipping qualified as MEHRAs. They represent approximately 9 per cent. of the UK coastline, which is consistent with Lord Donaldson's view that not more than 10 per cent. of the UK coastline should qualify as MEHRAs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1525W.2/3">In his report &quot;Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas&quot; Lord Donaldson said the criteria should be set in such a way that not more than about a tenth of the UK coastline qualifies.

	<p pid="b.1527W.8/1">The Government are committed to improving public transport in rural areas. Local and central Government provide funding of &pound;1.7 billion annually to support bus services, which provide the majority of local public transport services, including those in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1527W.8/2">We are expecting all local transport authorities to include accessibility strategies in their next Local Transport Plans, due to be submitted this month. These strategies should be based on evidence and analysis of the problems people face in accessing jobs and essential services and facilities. They should include consideration of the accessibility and availability of local public transport. Our guidance to authorities makes clear that the strategies should take account of the particular needs of rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1527W.8/3">Since 1998 nearly &pound;450 million has been allocated by this Department to local authorities specifically for the support of rural bus services. The main element of this is rural bus subsidy grant (RBSG) which now totals &pound;53 million annually and which supports some 2,000 services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1527W.8/4">Last year we announced &quot;Kickstart&quot; support, totalling &pound;20 million, for 43 projects involving new and improved bus services which will become viable through growth in passenger numbers after an initial period of pump-priming from Government funds. 11 of these schemes will serve areas which are mainly rural in character.</p>
	<p pid="b.1527W.8/5">Demand-responsive, flexibly routed and community transport services have a particularly significant role to play in rural areas and we have encouraged their development. Many rural community transport services have since 2002 been eligible to receive the Department's bus service operators grant and regulations were introduced in 2004 to enable flexibly routed bus services to be registered with the Traffic Commissioner.</p>

	<p pid="b.1528W.2/1">This Department has funded research in recent years into different aspects of biofuel production and use, but not detailed consideration of these individual biofuels. Our research has focused instead on the potential environmental and other impacts of significant use of biofuels in the longer term, and on the emissions consequences and economics of various bioethanol and biodiesel blends. We have also contributed to projects being managed by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership which are aiming to create the carbon and environmental assurance schemes to underpin the Renewable Transport Fuels obligation. Taken together, this Department's expenditure on this research amounts to a little under &pound;200,000.

	<p pid="b.1528W.2/2">A number of other Government Departments (including the Department for Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) have also funded research into aspects of biofuel production and use. The DTI-sponsored New and Renewable Energy Research and Development Programme, for example, has included a number of projects on the development of advanced production methods for biofuels. Defra has published various research reports on the environmental and other impacts of biofuel production in the UK. All of these reports are available via their respective websites.</p>

In PSHE lessons pupils are taught about rules for, and ways of, keeping safe, to recognise the risks that apply in different situations and then to decide how to behave responsibly. They should be taught to recognise and manage risk, to be aware when pressure from others threatens their personal safety and to develop assertiveness techniques when dealing with unhelpful pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.8/2">DfES issued 'Safety Education: Guidance for Schools' in 2001 and this references both highways and railways as contexts for safety education although it is for schools to decide on the content of their safety education programme.</p>

We cannot, however, break these figures down to differentiate between those who were sent back to the UK early and those who presented at a MOD Department of Community Mental Health (DCMH) at a later date, as this information is not recorded. Nor do these figures indicate whether the mental health condition is attributable to service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1539W.3/4" class="indent">During the late 1980s benefit processing work for a number of offices in London was moved to centres in Glasgow, Makerfield and Belfast as part of a work relocation project. Over the last two years we have progressively centralised the remaining processing work for London mainly in three new centres based in Hackney, Ilford and Stratford as part of the roll out of our new Jobcentre Plus service. The centralisation of this work is now almost complete with around 96 per cent. of benefits processed in one of the six centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1539W.3/5" class="indent">The aim has been to locate the remaining benefit processing work in as few sites as possible to maximise efficiency, while ensuring the best use of our existing estate and expertise. The key criteria used in determining the number and location of these new centres were therefore:</p>
	<p pid="b.1539W.3/6" class="indent">sites able to house an optimum of 250 people, but at least 100;</p>

	<p pid="b.1540W.3/5" class="indent">Under the original contract for Child Support Reform IT services, EDS was required to design, build, finance and operate the new Child Support computer system (CS2) to meet the Child Support Agency's requirements. It has been well reported the new system did not function as well as expected. The Department continues to work with EDS to improve the performance of the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.3/6" class="indent">In August 2005, the Department further addressed CS2 issues as part of a general realignment of its IT contracts with EDS. Under this realignment EDS will complete the CS2 system as specified, including correcting all agreed defects at no additional cost. Operationally, the live system is now more stable than it was in 2003 and its performance is currently meeting all contracted service level targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1543W.2/5" class="indent">A key part of the Operational Improvement Plan is to increase Agency staffing levels by 1,000 in order to address backlogs of work. The Agency is seeking to maximise the contribution made towards achieving this increase in its headcount by transferring in existing staff from other parts of the Department, together with their existing accommodation. Discussions are currently taking place to establish the number of staff who would be available to transfer to the Agency from other DWP sites. Precise numbers have yet to be agreed. It is anticipated that most staff who transfer across to the Agency would do so on a voluntary basis but the need for some managerial redeployment cannot be discounted at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1547W.8/1">As part of the Pathways to Work approach Jobcentre Plus has been working closely with a wide range of NHS professionals in surgeries and other health settings to promote the health and employment message. Some non-governmental organisations have already placed employment advisers in general practitioner surgeries across the country and our proposals came from this experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.1547W.8/2">We want to build on the knowledge gained from these experiments and will be running pilots in five of the seven current Pathways to Work Pilot areas, where we will place employment advisers in general practitioner surgeries. We have already begun piloting this in two surgeries in Bridgend and Paisley. All pilots will be in place by April 2006 and will continue until March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1547W.8/3">The pilot will examine if an outreach service in health settings is a good way to engage with people who have a health condition or disability. In particular, we want to see if it is an effective method to reach those who do not currently access work focused support. The lessons learned from these pilots will help to ensure the success of our proposals recently published in our Green Paper; &quot;A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to Work&quot;. Any decisions on future roll out or methodology, as part of the Pathways approach, will be taken following an evaluation of the pilot.</p>

	<p pid="b.1550W.6/1">The cost of plastic cups provided for Committee and meeting rooms in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;2,887. Plastic cups are currently incinerated as part of the waste stream to generate electricity rather than recycled. A new contract for the supply of disposable catering products is about to be awarded. It is intended that bio-degradable cups will be used in catering outlets and, subject to suitability, in Committee and meeting rooms in place of plastic cups.</p>

It is not yet clear what technical or financial assistance will be required, but the UK stands ready to help. We continue to raise issues of justice and reconciliation with the Government, and to encourage them to tackle human rights abuses.</p>

We have not commissioned research into incidences of torture in Tibet. We regularly raise our concerns about Tibetan prisoners, including at a high level. We strongly supported the visit to China by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, in November 2005. He subsequently said that he believed that torture, though on the decline, particularly in urban areas, remained widespread and that this was increasingly recognised by Chinese officials. We agree with this assessment and hope that the Chinese Government will consider carefully the rapporteur's recommendations when they issue, with a view to making a wholehearted effort to implement them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1572W.7/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/2" class="italic">India</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/3">The DFID office in India regularly assesses progress on poverty reduction and other Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s. These assessments are based on official Government of India statistics, but take into account concerns over the quality of data and independent assessments where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/4">The most recent assessment of progress at the national level was undertaken in September 2004, and concluded that India is on track to meet the MDG target of reducing the proportion of people living on under a dollar a day by 2015. The estimate of poverty used in that assessment is based on the most recent large scale National Sample Survey of the Government of India, carried out in 2000. The actual proportion of the population living in poverty was assessed as 29 per cent. according to the national poverty line, and 35 per cent. according to the international ($/day) poverty line, or between 300 million and 360 million people in poverty, depending on which poverty line is used. Results from the next large-scale National Sample Survey are expected to be published in 2006 or 2007, at which point it will be necessary to update our assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/5">Assessments of inequality in India carried out by DFID, have to date focused mainly on geographical inequality, which is acknowledged to be increasing and is high on the Indian government's agenda. The aggregate picture at national level masks wide variations between states and districts. Among the four focal states for direct DFID assistance alone, (Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa) estimates for 2000, using the national poverty line, range from 16 per cent. (Andhra Pradesh) to 47 per cent. (Orissa). There are similar disparities with respect to the other MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/6">An assessment of trends in income distribution was undertaken as part of an India case study on Operationalising Pro-poor Growth commissioned by DFID's central Policy Division in 2005. This concluded that, while there is evidence of growing inequality since the early 1990s, economic growth has been sufficiently strong to generate substantial poverty reduction in spite of this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/7" class="italic">Nigeria</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/8">DFID monitors poverty and inequality measures and participates in initiatives to generate new knowledge on these matters in Nigeria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/9">The most recently completed national exercises covering poverty and inequality in Nigeria is the Demographic and Health Survey 2003. This presents data on a range of social and socio-economic indicators, including: employment patterns, infant and child mortality, maternal and child health, fertility, and family planning, and is analysed by a range of categories including geographical zone, age, sex and wealth. One of the key findings is that while levels of poverty across much of Nigeria are high by any standard, they are significantly higher in northern Nigeria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/10">DFID Nigeria is heavily involved in a range of ongoing initiatives at the national level that will generate important new knowledge on poverty and inequality. These include the National Poverty Assessment (NPA), the Nigerian Census 2006, and the national Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/11">The NPA will provide a comprehensive analysis across five areas: poverty profile, inequality and poverty, the MDGs, health and education, and rural poverty. Key results include the following: absolute poverty (using a minimum calorific requirement of 2,900 calories per day for the average Nigerian) and $/day poverty lines suggest that between 50&ndash;55 per cent. of Nigerians live in poverty; levels of income poverty at state level are close to 90 per cent. in some northern states and are generally significantly lower in the south; the Gini co-efficient&mdash;a standard measure of income inequality&mdash;is close to 0.5, which is high by international standards and has recently been cited as the mark at which the poverty returns to growth tend towards zero; income inequalities within states are lowest in northern Nigeria and highest in certain southern regions (over 0.5).</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/12" class="italic">Russia</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/13">In Russia, DFID relies on poverty and inequality assessments made by international organisations such as the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank. DFID Russia provides assistance through the World Bank to help improve the quality of poverty assessments made by the Russian Government. In addition, DFID programmes in two regions; Leningrad and Nizhny&mdash;provides funds to carry out (for the first time in Russia) household budget surveys to assess levels of regional poverty and help target scarce resources to address poverty and support to vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/14" class="italic">China</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/15">Latest estimates derived from an ongoing DFID funded participatory poverty assessment (PPA) suggest that the number of people living below US$1 per day fell from 33 per cent. of the population in 1990 to about 10.4 per cent. of the population; around 135 million people, in 2004. China has therefore met the income poverty Millennium Development Goal but there remain pockets of extreme poverty, for instance, in remote mountainous areas, amongst ethnic minorities or within vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled. The PPA suggests that some 93 per cent. of the absolute poor are rural with another 6 per cent. being rural to urban migrants. About one in two poor people live in the Western provinces, which have 29 per cent. of the population. Chinese official estimates currently suggest 26 million people are living in poverty. However, this group is best characterised as extremely poor, as China's poverty thresholds are low both by international standards and in terms of adequate coverage of basic needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.7/16">Progress against non-income dimensions of poverty has been slower than might have been expected from China's average 9 per cent. growth rate since 1990. While China is ahead of target on access to universal primary education, progress on HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, environmental sustainability including access to water and sanitation, and gender equality is lagging. Continuing effort will still be required to meet child and maternal mortality goals if China is to remain on track to meet these.</p>

However, work on the response was interrupted by appeals by the detainees to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, and by the subsequent introduction of the Terrorism Act 2005. The report was considered by Ministers in the Department of Constitutional Affairs and the Home Office and by officials engaged in the preparation of the Government's response. The Government submitted its response to the Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June 2005</phrase>, with a request for immediate publication along with the Committee's report.

	<p pid="b.1581W.7/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.7/5" class="indent">As you may be aware, the Department for Regional Development, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Cycling Forum, published a Northern Ireland Cycling Strategy in June 2000. The strategy identified a range of measures to seek to improve conditions for cyclists with a view to establishing a pro-cycling culture. It set two challenging targets:</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.7/6" class="indent">1. to double the number of trips by cycle (from figures available in 2000) by 2005; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.7/7" class="indent">2. to quadruple the number of trips by cycle (from figures available in 2000) by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.7/8" class="indent">To monitor progress, Roads Service introduced a Northern Ireland-wide cycle usage survey in 2000. Since then, automatic cycle counters have been monitoring cycle usage on a daily basis at 33 strategic sites, fourteen of which are located on the National Cycle Network throughout Northern Ireland. A further nine sites are located around the Greater Belfast area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.7/9" class="indent">The resulting figures, up to the end of 2004, are provided below and expressed as a percentage change in total average daily cycle flow at the sites indicated. Figures for 2005 are not yet available.</p>

Where the agency needs to employ consultants to assist with its work, it is normal practice for such appointments to be made using a competitive tendering process managed by the Central Procurement Directorate of the Department of Finance and Personnel who may seek expressions of interest from both Northern Ireland and external consultants.</p>

	<p pid="b.1592W.0/1">All of the 351 crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRP) in England and 22 community safety partnerships (CSP) in Wales have responded positively to our seed funding for antisocial behaviour co-ordinators in each CDRP area. Many areas have now gone further and are using funding from a range of sources to establish and support antisocial behaviour teams. Findings from the antisocial behaviour unit's second national survey of CDRPs in 2005 indicated that 60 per cent. of those CDRPs who responded had more staff than a year ago. Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1592W.0/2">A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour. For example, Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1592W.0/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and their work in tackling litter and fly-tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour. The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of antisocial behaviour activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1592W.0/4">In relation to specific Home Office funding to tackle antisocial behaviour in the last two financial years we have allocated &pound;25,000 to every CDRP in both England and Wales to fund an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator. This amounts to &pound;9.4 million per annum, the funding for 2005&ndash;06 is now part of the Safer, Stronger Communities Fund (SSCF) and this arrangement will continue for the next two years (2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08). In order to deal with antisocial behaviour problems effectively, housing providers, local authorities, the police, the courts and the Crown Prosecution Service, and other relevant agencies need to play a full role.</p>
	<p pid="b.1592W.0/5">Local authorities drive many aspects of our work including tackling graffiti, removing abandoned vehicles, dealing with noise nuisance and many antisocial behaviour housing issues. In order to help local agencies tackle antisocial behaviour, we have provided guidance and support to help them to target resources and use appropriate tools and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1592W.0/6">The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 has been fundamental to our work and has changed the culture of public services and protected our communities. However, while attitudes are shifting, the public's concern is not yet adequately reflected in the priorities of all our services. The Respect Programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today. People need to see and feel that a difference can be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1593W.2/1">The information requested is not available centrally. A 2004 Home Office study into the cost of obtaining an ASBO reports that costs have significantly reduced. An earlier review of costs published in 2002 (known as the Campbell report) indicated that the cost of obtaining an ASBO averaged &pound;4,000 to &pound;5,000. The later study showed that the costs of obtaining an ASBO had fallen to an average of &pound;2,500. Costs have fallen as a result of more efficiency as practitioners become more familiar with ASBOs, and the introduction of orders on conviction, which removes the need for separate hearing. The study found that, overall, police and local authorities using ASBOs find them cost-effective. The cost to communities and to society generally of not taking action against persistent antisocial behaviour is much higher. Information on the length of time taken to obtain an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1593W.2/2">Immediate respite from antisocial behaviour can be obtained by the use of interim and without notice orders. Orders on conviction and county court orders can avoid the need for a separate court hearing, and can therefore speed up the process. Four ASBOs have issued in the Swindon borough council area: three to males under the age of 18 years, and one to a female aged over 21 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1599W.12/1">The policy on prisoners pay supports the sentence planning section of the Offender Assessment System (OASys) which requires establishments to allocate activities in accordance with identified individual needs and objectives, thus targeting activities to those who will derive the most benefit from them. Each prison has devolved responsibility to enable them to set local pay rates over and above a national minimum. A local pay scheme must not provide disincentives to activities which are a part of a prisoner's sentence plan; this applies equally to education or employment. Rates of pay will therefore vary between prisons and activities, as governors use their discretion to balance regime activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1603W.2/1">There are a number of approaches currently under way in seeking to step up the drive in tackling and preventing antisocial behaviour in Swindon. Swindon has made good use of the range of tools and powers available to them to tackle antisocial behaviour. Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs) are used at an early stage to try to divert an individual away from further antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/2">The success of this approach has meant that only a small number of those individuals on ABCs have been subject to an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO). Dispersal Orders have also been used, however only where a designated area could be policed appropriately. Swindon has also made excellent use of Crack House Closure powers to tackle drug related antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/3">In addition to the use of powers a number of campaigns have been conducted to tackle antisocial behaviour. These include: Operation Graffiti&mdash;a multi-agency initiative using Home Office Action Area funding of &pound;40,000 to tackle environmental crime and specifically the issue of graffiti focussing on West Swindon. Operation Crackdown&mdash;a publicity campaign to highlight the effects of substance misuse on an individual and in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/4">Anti-begging&mdash;a campaign to educate the public about where their money that they give to beggars goes, namely Class A drugs, and that most of the street beggars actually do have homes. Operation Pinehurst Safe and Clean&mdash;a multi-agency operation to tackle community antisocial behaviour and environmental crime in Pinehurst. There are several multi-agency environmental operations planned for different areas in Swindon throughout the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.2/5">In terms of preventative work, the Youth Offending Service leads on a number of projects including Positive Activities for Young People, Positive Futures programmes and Splash, all of which aim to divert young people away from crime and antisocial behaviour. Action Area funding of &pound;25,000 is also used to work with those families engaged in antisocial behaviour in the community. There are two types of intervention: a group based programme, facilitated through New College Swindon and an intensive one to one support programme for families who need help.</p>

	<p pid="b.1604W.0/1">Home Office records show that all protocols for the detection of toxins in shellfish intended for human consumption were assigned a substantial severity limit. In total there were three such protocols for the detection of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) and three for the detection of diarrheic shellfish poison (DSP).</p>
	<p pid="b.1604W.0/2">A total of 6,468 animals were used in the relevant procedures during 2004. The predicted adverse effects associated with PSP are that all animals are subdued after injection. Animals injected with samples not containing toxin will frequently then go on to behave in an apparently normal fashion after a few minutes. If toxin is present, clinical signs of sudden, uncontrolled muscle contractions (which can include jerking movements of the limbs) will occur after a period of time related to the level of toxin present in the sample. Death usually occurs two or three minutes after the onset of initial signs and is due to respiratory muscle paralysis. For PSP testing the predicted adverse effects reflect the actual adverse effects seen. The predicted adverse effects associated with DSP are that animals are subdued after injection. Some animals will appear to recover and behave normally after a period of time that can range form a few minutes to around one hour. Behaviours associated with pain can be observed within this period. Additional adverse effects sometimes seen include diarrhoea and piloerection. Animals injected with samples that contain toxin may, in addition, show signs of torpor, cyanosis of the extremities, a drop in body temperature and weakness/inability to maintain balance, prostration, coma, or may die. These signs are seen within five hours of initial injection, and animals showing typical signs of DSP are humanely killed. Additionally, an atypical DSP response has been seen in some animals within 30 minutes of initial injection, whereby animals show convulsions, spasms of the back legs, prostration, and respiratory difficulties including gasping for breath. Signs may be severe and lead to death or less severe and animals may recover. The adverse effects predicted within the protocols in place reflected the actual adverse effects seen. Section 5.4 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act requires that the Secretary of State shall weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefits likely to accrue as a result of the programme to be specified in the licence. In the case of testing for the presence of marine biotoxins, the benefits of such testing are the protection of public health by ensuring that consumers are not exposed to biotoxins present in molluscan shellfish. European legislation sets the definitive test for detection of the DSP and PSP groups of marine biotoxins as a mouse bioassay. These toxins pose a significant risk to human health because they can cause serious disease, and in the case of PSP, death, in people. The Home Office is committed to replacement of both bioassays when non-animal tests have been developed and validated to a level that ensures the protection of human health. To this end inspectors within the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate are working actively with other UK agencies, the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods, EU regulators and other expert groups in order to progress the early adoption of alternative tests in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.1608W.0/1">Since 1988, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has issued the following advice to general practitioners on the prescription of benzodiazepines:</p>
	<p pid="b.1608W.0/2" class="indent">Benzodiazepines are indicated for the short-term (two to four weeks) relief of anxiety that is severe, disabling or subjecting the individual to unacceptable distress, occurring alone or in association with insomnia or short-term psychosomatic, organic or psychotic illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1608W.0/3" class="indent">The use of benzodiazepines to treat short-term 'mild' anxiety is inappropriate and unsuitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1608W.0/4">The Chief Medical Officer most recently communicated with all doctors on this issue through his January 2004 'CMO Update', reminding doctors that benzodiazepines are only indicated for short-term treatment, reiterating advice set out in the Department's clinical guidelines&mdash;'Drug misuse and dependence&mdash;guidelines on clinical management' (1999) <sup>1</sup> . The full update is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/07/01/76/04070176.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/07/01/76/04070176.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1608W.0/5">In 2005, responding to advice from professionals in the substance misuse field, and consistent with the recommendations made in Department's clinical guidelines, the Department amended prescribing regulation to allow diazepam to be dispensed in instalments for the treatment of drug addiction&mdash;to assist doctors in prescribing benzodiazepines more safely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1608W.6/1">We have a duty to ensure that any rules applied to blood donation by the National Blood Service (NBS) which is part of NHS Blood and Transplant, achieve a balance between risk reduction and security of supply. The latest statistics available indicate that gay and bisexual men are proportionately at a relatively higher risk of carrying HIV and a number of other sexually transmitted infections, many of which can be transmitted by blood.</p>
	<p pid="b.1608W.6/2">The self exclusion criterion concerning gay and bisexual men has been reached following analysis of the data by the Joint UK Blood Transfusion Services and National Institute of Biological Standards and control professional advisory committee (JPAC), and the advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood, tissues and organs for transplantation. The decision by the NBS is based on scientific grounds. The NBS donor exclusion criteria is reviewed annually in the light of updated epidemiology evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1608W.6/3">We are unable to assess the impact to the blood supply if the self exclusion criteria was removed for gay and bisexual men. This is because some men will be aware of the donor exclusion criteria and self exclude themselves without reporting to blood donor sessions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1611W.0/2">To encourage good financial management, the NHS Bank agreed that for cash brokerage in 2005&ndash;06 an interest payment will be required from SHAs receiving cash brokerage, and they have agreed to pay interest to those SHAs providing cash brokerage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1611W.0/3">The charge on SHAs receiving cash brokerage is 10 per cent. and the interest to SHAs providing brokerage will be between five per cent, and 20 per cent. depending on the time of year when the cash is offered. No estimate has been made of the level of interest paid on any cash brokerage received next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1611W.0/4">The NHS Bank operates a cash brokerage system at SHA level. Any arrangements with national health service trusts or primary care trusts are for individual SHAs to manage. Information on what has been agreed locally is not held centrally.</p>

The Department asked the Royal College of Physicians to lead a multi-disciplinary working group, which reported in 1999, to review the clinical assessment and prescribing of oxygen therapy in the home. Following a further review, we announced plans for change in June 2003. Organisations representing patients contributed to the specification for the new service&mdash;as patients want better access to modern equipment that can help improve their quality of life, including portable systems that enable them to leave the home. These are important features of the new service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1634W.0/1">The full implementation of the Sentinel programme will transform all the MHRA's regulatory responsibilities from a paper-based system to electronic working both internally within the MHRA and externally with its stakeholders. The programme, which will run for 10 years, takes forward the MHRA's information management strategy which was developed in 2000. There have been some technical operational and performance issues in certain areas of the programme which in turn have lead to delays in the day-to-day work of the MHRA. These have or are being resolved and urgent cases are being processed promptly. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. A core part of the Sentinel programme relates to the MHRA's ability to interact electronically with its stakeholders and several pilots have been piloted with a number of companies prior to implementation. In preparation for electronic working, some 25 million pages of historical data and documents were digitised and loaded into the system.

	<p pid="b.1634W.3/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for delivering sexual health services to their local populations and resource this from their baselines allocations. Sexual health and access to genito-urinary clinics is one of the six top priorities for the national health service in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1634W.3/2">In February 2005, individual PCTs were notified of their additional choosing health revenue allocation for sexual health. In 2006&ndash;07, an extra &pound;91.5 million will be allocated to PCTs for sexual health modernisation which includes funding for chlamydia screening, genito-urinary medicine (GUM) and reproductive health. A further &pound;111.5 million will be allocated in 2007&ndash;08. Also, an extra &pound;15 million for capital was allocated this financial year for sexual health services and a further &pound;25 million allocated in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1634W.3/3">The national chlamydia screening programme already has 26 regional programmes implemented, covering over 25 per cent. of PCTs in England. By April 2006, we expect to see screening happening in the whole of England. This is well ahead of the 2007 target. The vision is to implement a multi-faceted, evidence-based and cost-effective national prevention and control programme for genital chlamydial infection in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1634W.3/4">Between September 2004 and June 2005 the number of consultants in the GUM speciality increased by seven (2.1 per cent.) and between September 1997 and June 2005 by 88 (26.9 per cent.). Since 1997 the number of hospital, public health medicine and community health services staff with a speciality in GUM in England has increased by 197 (21.7 per cent.) and by 28 (3.1 per cent.) between September 2003 and September 2004 (906). In addition to increasing consultant numbers, our strategic aim is to achieve greater diversity of sexual health service provision, which should help to relieve pressure on GUM consultants. This is being supported through measures such as the GUM service review, the audit of contraception services, and greater service provision outside of the GUM setting.</p>

	<p pid="b.1635W.2/1">The inclusion of sexual health in the six national health service key priorities for 2006&ndash;07 is a further demonstration that sexual health is regarded as important and mainstream. The national strategy for sexual health and HIV (2001) sets out our long term plan to improve sexual health and modernise services, and identified young people as being one of the groups most vulnerable to poor sexual health. A new sexual health campaign focusing on younger men and women was announced in the White Paper Choosing Health and this builds on previous commitments to public health information aspects of this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.2/2">This also links closely to the cross-Government teenage pregnancy strategy, which is currently running radio, targeted magazine, satellite TV and cinema adverts aimed at 15 to 17-year-olds as part of its &quot;Want Respect, Use A Condom campaign&quot;. Furthermore, the &quot;R U Thinking&quot; campaign is targeting 13 to 15-year-olds with messages encouraging delaying early sex in teenage magazine titles and online.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.2/3">Sex and relationship education (SRE) is a key part of the personal, social and health education which is taught in all schools. This is reinforced by the healthy schools programme, which sets criteria for schools to achieve healthy school status. This includes a requirement that schools have an up to date SRE policy and implement this throughout their curriculum and pastoral provision, make good use of school nurses and sexual health outreach workers and have effective referral arrangements to specialist services. To date, over 75 per cent. of schools are participating in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.2/4">Added to this is the accelerated roll-out of the national Chlamydia screening programme which targets the sexually active under-25s, currently expected to reach 80 per cent. coverage of primary care trusts in England by April 2006. We are also piloting Chlamydia screening through Boots pharmacies in London and making improvements to contraception services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1635W.2/5">In addition to this national work, PCTs are responsible for providing sexual health services and health promotion which meet the needs of their local populations. To support them in this role, the Department has published good practice guidance and recommended standards, which include specific guidance in respect of services for young people. All of these documents are available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="b.1636W.2/1">Elastic cigarettes is a term explained in The Lancet March 4 2006 paper, &quot;Secret science: tobacco industry research on smoking behaviour and cigarette toxicity&quot; by Hammond D et al. In this paper, the authors report that</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;BAT developed elastic cigarettes that produced low yields under standard testing procedure, whereas in consumers' hands they elicited more intensive smoking and provided higher concentrations of tar and nicotine to smokers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.2/3">In the paper, the term smoke elasticity is reference to a 1983 British American Tobacco (BAT) research conference in Brazil.</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.2/4">The Department is not aware of specific representations about BAT elastic cigarettes and no specific assessment therefore made. General awareness among the scientific community about misleading terms on cigarettes packs resulted in the introduction of EU Directive 2001/37/EC which lead to the banning of terms such as low tar, light, ultra-light and mild from cigarette packs sold in the United Kingdom from October 2003 and other tobacco products from October 2004.</p>
