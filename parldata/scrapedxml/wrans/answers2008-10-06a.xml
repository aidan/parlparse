	<p pid="a.2W.3/2">Some of the key lessons learned from Beijing include: placing athletes at the heart of the Games; providing a complete spectator experience; the vital role that volunteers play at the Games; an effective ticketing strategy to ensure that the majority of venues are full; and commencing detailed planning now with all key stakeholders for the Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.3/3">All stakeholder organisations are pulling together their lessons learned, and the process has been discussed by the Olympic Board. We will be sharing experiences between partners, and the culmination of this process will be a briefing session in London at the end of November by the Beijing Organising Committee (BOCOG) for the UK, and other host and bidding cities, when we will have a greater understanding of the issues involved.</p>

In Hertfordshire, the Ready for Winners Partnership Board (HRFWP), led by Hertfordshire county council has been set up to maximise the benefits from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Additionally, the &quot;Sports in the Park&quot; programme in St. Albans will form part of the region's plans for cultural events taking place over the Handover weekend in August. This will offer up to 2,000 children aged two to 12 the opportunity to be active and have fun over a period of six weeks this summer. Across the St. Albans district, children will design a handover flag that represents their community and what the Games means to them to take to the official 2012 flag raising ceremony on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-24">24 August</phrase>.

HRFWP is also developing a talented young athlete scheme and has so far channelled &pound;12,000 to support 23 young athletes up to 2012 identified by their governing bodies as having sporting talent and high potential. Each athlete will receive nutritional advice, physiotherapy assessments, individual and group training sessions, performance lifestyle advice and free membership to Hertfordshire Sports village and some other facilities in the county.</p>

	<p pid="a.13W.0/1">It has been the practice for many years to use the landing adjacent to the lower waiting hall to store furniture from the Members' and Strangers' dining rooms when they are both in use at the same time for functions sponsored by Members. These can take place between 4-6 pm each weekday, on Thursday evenings, and at times when the House is not sitting. The furniture has to be kept close to the dining rooms because there are only 30 minutes available to reset them for the evening service to Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.0/2">A study during the recess has concluded that the issue could be overcome either by accepting bookings for functions in only one of the dining rooms at any one time or by taking out of use temporarily one of the adjacent rooms used by Members. The possibilities and their implications will be reported to the Administration Committee this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.0/3">The conservation architect has advised that there has been some minor damage to the stonework on the landing.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.0/4">The fire safety manager has advised that storing furniture on the landing does present a risk to effective building evacuation; how great that is would depend on the number of people in the Palace at the time, particularly in the Committee Rooms. He advised that it would be good practice to discontinue using the landing for storage. Until the Administration Committee has had an opportunity to consider the matter, arrangements are being made to advise the fire safety manager when both rooms are being used for functions.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.2/1">In June this year Sport England published their new strategy for sport. The new strategy for 2008-11 focuses on three key areas of grassroots sport: growing sporting participation, sustaining sporting participation, and ensuring that talented people from all backgrounds have the chance to excel. I am confident that this new framework will enable us to deliver a world leading community sports system for the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.2/2"><i> </i>The Cultural Property Advice website (<a href="http://www.culturalpropertyadvice.gov.uk">www.culturalpropertyadvice.gov.uk</a>), launched by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in 2007 with support from my Department, provides advice and information to those searching for objects with an uncertain history lost or stolen during World War II and the Holocaust Era. The website includes a database of objects with uncertain provenance between 1933-45. Both this website and the department's own website provide information on the work of the Spoliation Advisory Panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/3">The Government intend to introduce legislation to allow national museums, that are currently prevented from doing so, to return works of art spoliated during the Nazi era, as recommended by the panel in 2005. We continue to look for an early legislative opportunity to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.42W.5/2"><i> </i>Arrangements for the award and management of grants are primarily matters for Sport England. Sport England has advised that it does not require, as condition of grant, a revenue tail to fund maintenance staff. It does, however, require the applicant to ensure that adequate funds are made available over the life time of the grant award, to ensure that the facility is maintained properly. Sport England has advised that where it is known that replacement of elements of the capital facility will be required within the lifetime of the award, such as a synthetic turf surface, they will seek assurance that a replacement budget is established by the awardee to ensure the replacement is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.43W.11/1">Buildings that are of special historic or architectural interest are listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Listing protects a building against unauthorized demolition, alteration or extension and ensures that its special interest is taken into account when proposals are put forward that affect its character or appearance.</p>
	<p pid="a.43W.11/2">English Heritage, the Government's statutory adviser for the historic environment, gave &pound;24 million in grants in 2007-08 to protect and encourage enjoyment of historic buildings and monuments. English Heritage recommended 564 buildings for listing, and during the year, 57 buildings were removed from the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register as their futures had been secured. English Heritage is a statutory consultee in the statutory planning process and gave advice on 17,090 consent applications in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.43W.11/3">In April 2008, the Government published a draft Heritage Protection Bill. The draft Bill contains provisions setting out a framework to unify heritage protection regimes, allow greater public involvement in decision-making and place heritage at the heart of the planning system, thereby making the system more transparent and making heritage protection easier to understand and manage.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.12/1">The Service Personnel Command Paper The Nation's Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans (Cm 7424), published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-17">17 July</phrase>, sets out the first ever cross-Government strategy for support to our service personnel, their families and veterans. The strategy will ensure that service personnel and their families are not disadvantaged when seeking access to state benefits and gives improved access to employment programmes, such as new deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.12/2">The families of service personnel already have access to the full range of benefits and services in the same way as those of non-service personnel. There are also provisions targeted specifically at family members who are accompanying service personnel overseas on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.12/3">For example, family members who are temporarily absent from Great Britain because they live with a serving member of the forces as part of a family are not disqualified from receiving incapacity benefit, disability living allowance, attendance allowance or carer's allowance. This will also apply to the employment and support allowance from October 2008. Partners of current or former armed forces personnel can also have fast-track access to the Gateway stage of the new deal for young people and new deal 25+ and, from April 2009, to Stage 3 of the revised jobseeker's allowance programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.12/4">Some spouses and civil partners who accompany their family overseas occasionally find it hard to get paid employment while there. This may adversely affect their national insurance contribution record for entitlement to a State Pension as well as access to contribution based working age benefits. A Ministerial commitment was included in the Command Paper to consider the award of National Insurance credits in these circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what assessment has been made of the financial impact on parents without care facing debt recovery action for outstanding child maintenance payments by the Child Support Agency of the sanction (a) 40 per cent. deductions on net income and (b) use of debt recovery agents.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/5" class="indent">The financial impact of recovering child maintenance debt is considered for all parties involved in a child maintenance calculation before determining a suitable repayment level. The circumstances of each individual case are considered including any representations of hardship from the non-resident parent as well as the size of the debt and any other relevant factors. Should the financial circumstances of the non-resident parent prevent immediate full repayment of the child maintenance debt then the Agency will attempt to negotiate the repayment of the child maintenance debt as quickly as possible to obtain the best possible outcome for the qualifying child and the parent with care while taking account of the circumstances of the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/6" class="indent">As a guideline the Agency's view is that a complete recovery period of up to two years is broadly acceptable if all the circumstances of the case genuinely warrant such a lengthy period; as an organisation with a statutory duty to consider the welfare of any children affected by our decisions, the Agency can only justify accepting repayment agreements of more than two years in special circumstances. In a proportion of cases, this means that a repayment agreement of up to forty per cent of net earnings, which includes any regular maintenance liability and repayment of arrears, will be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/7" class="indent">Where negotiations fail to produce an acceptable repayment offer the Agency will consider recovery through the enforcement measures available. In many cases a Deduction from Earnings Order will be imposed which requires an employer to deduct child maintenance payments at source. These deductions will not exceed forty per cent of net earnings. In cases where this is not appropriate, the Agency can apply to the courts for a liability order confirming the debt, and allowing it to pursue other legal enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/8" class="indent">The Agency also has the power to contract debt collection agencies to recover outstanding debt on its behalf as this is an area where the expertise of private agencies can be particularly effective in helping to get more money to more children. The provisions authorising another person/organisation to carry out functions relating to child support came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase>. Certain cases with outstanding debt were reviewed and where the non-resident parent failed to make an acceptable repayment offer referral was made to a debt collection agency. The process for considering the financial impact of recovering debt mirrors that used within the Child Support Agency and outlined above. There are mechanisms in place to ensure that cases are correctly handled.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.5/1">A person must be available for and actively seeking work in order to be eligible for jobseeker's allowance. A person can restrict his or her availability for work on grounds of a medical condition. This restriction could, for example, relate to the type of work or the hours they are available, but active search for employment must continue. When, as the result of a health problem, someone cannot meet these conditions, their claim for jobseeker's allowance cannot continue and he or she would normally claim incapacity benefit instead, or other benefits appropriate to their individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.5/2">Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Advisers work with customers who need more extensive support because of their health condition. They can offer help in finding work and advise customers about a range of specialised support available such as Workstep, Work preparation and Residential Training colleges and Access to Work.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.5/3">Jobseeker's allowance customers with a history of drug and alcohol misuse can volunteer for early access to the new deal gateway in order to take advantage of the more intensive support on offer. Under the flexible new deal, which will replace the mandatory new deals from October 2009, service providers can decide to offer condition management programmes as part of the tailored back to work action plans drawn up for longer term jobseeker's allowance customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.5/4">We do not currently require drug or alcohol abusers to seek treatment as a condition of receiving benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.5/5">In our Welfare Reform Green Paper &quot;No-one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility&quot; (column 7363) we announced that we will explore the case for introducing a new regime for problem drug users which provides more tailored and personalised support than is currently provided by the existing incapacity benefit or jobseeker's allowance regimes. In return for benefit payments, claimants will have a responsibility to move successfully through treatment and into employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.5/6">Currently people with a drug addiction have access to support through the &quot;progress2work&quot; initiative which is a national programme for those on any working-age benefit recovering from drugs misuse. Participants are helped with the range of their problems, such as debt, housing or family breakdown. For alcohol misusers we offer &quot;progress2work linkup&quot; in about half of Jobcentre Plus districts.</p>

The fall in the number of contracts cancelled as a result of misuse between 2003 and 2005 resulted from an increase in the standard mileage allowance in 2003 (hence fewer customer contracts being cancelled for unpaid excess mileage bills) and from an improved approach to &quot;fair wear and tear&quot; standards, especially for damage associated with mobility aids (fewer contracts being cancelled for cars falling outside of the condition standards).<br/> 3. The increase in customer contracts being cancelled since 2005 has resulted from a stronger focus on appropriate sanctions for customers using cars in any criminal activity or using cars outside of the insurance rules (e.g. allowing uninsured drivers).</td> </tr>

The loans budget is managed centrally and re-allocations are made to Jobcentre Plus budget areas quarterly and towards the end of the year. Funds are taken from some of those budget areas with a projected end of year underspend and given to other budget areas.<br/> 2. To provide comparable data, budgets are presented on the basis of the current budget area structure. In recent years, there have been many changes to the boundaries of Jobcentre Plus districts, which have led to adjustment of the budgets for the districts involved. In some cases, a district has been split and the parts merged with other districts. For the districts involved in such a situation it is not possible to give comparable budgets from April 2003. The last split took place in August 2006.<br/> 3. Community Care Grants for 2006-07 were set before the boundary change in August 2006 involving a split district, and so are not given here. Community Care Grants budgets are not reallocated during the year. However, some allocations were made from the Contingency Reserve in 2007-08. These have not been included. The budgets for 2008-09 are the same as for 2007-08.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Departmental records of budgets.</td> </tr>

The Electoral Commission informs me that between 2001 and 2007, the Commission's primary focus was on encouraging registered parties and regulated donees to comply with their statutory requirements. During that period, no record was kept of whether donations to regulated donees were reported late or on time.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.3/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) work in the education sector in Africa is guided by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which call for the achievement of universal primary education and for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. We plan to spend some &pound;214 million bilaterally on education in Africa this year (2008-09). In addition, DFID provides core funding to a range of multilateral organisations who work to develop education in Africa. A large proportion of our bilateral support is routed through national budgets, notably in Nigeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya and Rwanda. This is in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness which calls for 50 per cent. of bilateral assistance to be channelled through country systems by means of long-term general budget or sector support. There is a particular emphasis throughout our education sector programmes on increasing school attendance, and a key part of this is getting more girls into school.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/2">During the visit of President Sarkozy earlier this year, we agreed to work jointly with France to help get 16 million more children into school in Africa by 2010. We have also committed &pound;150 million to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative for 2006-8 to help countries speed up the implementation of their education plans. The Fast Track Initiative is supporting education work in 18 Africa countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/3">There is still a long way to go to achieve these MDGs in Africa, but there has been some worthwhile progress. Free primary education has brought millions of children into school: in Zambia and Tanzania, over 97 per cent. of children are now enrolled, with equal number of girls. In Lesotho, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi gender parity rates have reached 98 per cent. or more. In Ethiopia, our support helped one million more children to enter school in 2006. In Malawi, providing better toilet facilities in schools and support to teenage mothers has improved school attendance by girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/4">Our current work in the education sector across Africa is set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.5/1">Improved co-ordination is a key aim of the EU Water Initiative Africa Working Group. The Group is an integral part of the EU Water Initiative's Multi-Stakeholder Forum. The composition of the Group also encourages co-ordination, through its rotating membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.5/2">EU member states, the EC and other donors, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, participate in Africa Working Group key activities. Meetings are generally programmed as an integral part of major events, such as the recent World Water Week in Stockholm. The membership of the Africa Working Group management &quot;Troika&quot; rotates on a yearly basis between EU member states. This arrangement promotes a wide range of active involvement in the Group. For example, the UK co-Chairs the Group this year with the African Ministers Council for Water representative from Congo-Brazzaville and next year Austria will co-Chair with a South African representative. Country governments are involved in the Africa Working Group activities. For example, Ethiopia is a leader in the Group's country dialogue process which develops a strategic planning and financing framework for the water sector. Civil society, such as the Women for Water Partnership and the African Water Network, participate in regular events such as Africa Working Group meetings and the Multi-Stakeholder Forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.5/3">Co-ordination will also be improved through the new communications strategy which we have funded through our support to the Africa Working Group &quot;Troika&quot;. This strategy takes a comprehensive longer-term look at the Group's requirement.</p>

DFID is preparing a major new regional programme to facilitate trade by EAC member states. It will focus on expanding intra-regional trade through reducing the costs of trading across borders by supporting one stop border posts, customs reforms and the development of revenue sharing arrangements between countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.5/2">DFID has already been helping the Government of Uganda to implement its EAC commitments and has supported the East African Business Council to undertake a study of the EAC Customs Union implementation. This highlights the major reforms necessary to reduce the barriers to trade across East Africa. As a result of this work, a notable success is the 24 hour opening of Mombassa port to allow for more efficient processing of containers.</p>

The Bali Action Plan, which the UK signed up to last December, emphasises this when it refers to the importance of using</p>

	<p pid="a.99W.0/3">DFID is developing an integrated DRR and adaptation mainstreaming programme to be rolled out across the Department over the next year. We are also developing joint risk and vulnerability assessments, beginning in five countries in South Asia, to provide staff with the tools and skills needed to assess climate and disaster risk when designing development programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/4">DFID has also commissioned a review to assess how DRR and adaptation programming could be better aligned to identify mechanisms for joint funding and programming; and to make recommendations for addressing remaining gaps in the system. This work is in progress, but initial recommendations include: supporting more visible engagement of the DRR community in climate negotiations; promoting stronger convergence of the DRR and adaptation teams within DFID and multilateral agencies; and supporting the generation of integrated knowledge and guidance, including by documenting success stories of where integration has worked.</p>

	<p pid="a.108W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not have a working definition of 'think tank'. DFID provides funding to a number of organisations which may be involved in relevant activities, such as policy analysis and research. For example, DFID has a Programme Partnership Agreement with the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) for &pound;3.4 million over 2008-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.5/2">DFID also works with a number of other organisations, in the UK and in partner countries, involved in similar work but collation of a full list of relevant projects would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.108W.5/6" class="indent">The Civil Society Challenge Fund is open to CSOs working in development to bid for project specific funding of up to &pound;500,000. Details on individual projects are available online at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>;</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.5/7" class="indent">Country programmes and central DFID departments may provide funding to, or procure the services of, CSOs working in developing countries to carry out development activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.5/8">Summary figures on DFID funding to UK CSOs are provided in the following table.

	<p pid="a.120W.3/1">The UK Remittances Task Force was set up in 2006, with support from the Department for International Development (DFID), to pursue the Key Findings and Recommendations of the UK Remittances Working Group. Originally set at 12 months, our support to the Task Force has been extended already as a response to the need for further work to fully achieve its objectives. DFID's financial support to the Task Force is &pound;23,600 from March to December 2008. DFID also provides advice to the Task Force and regularly dialogues with its Steering Committee. We will continue to review this support on an ongoing, needs assessed basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.3/2">Estimates suggest that remittances from the UK are upwards of &pound;2.7 billion, with the largest flows going to Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Jamaica and Ghana. DFID recognises the positive impact that these money transfers can make on people's lives in developing countries, and has an active agenda to improve the developmental impact of remittances, seeking to help make remittances cheaper, safer and more accessible. When responding to a DFID funded survey in the UK, almost a third of remittance senders said that their money would be used to buy food, a fifth said it would help with medical bills and one in six reported that the funds would help pay for schooling. 80 per cent. of those surveyed said the money would make a real difference to the lives of their relatives back home.</p>

	<p pid="a.123W.2/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/2" class="italic"> (a) Inclusive development assistance</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/3">The Department for International Development (DFID) is aware of the importance of international cooperation as stated in Article 32 of the UN Convention. We understand the need to find ways to promote the inclusion of disabled people into mainstream development as well as looking for ways to build the capacity of representative organisations of disabled people. Our Civil Society Challenge Fund identifies disability as a cross-cutting issue so all applications need to demonstrate how they are engaging with disabled people. The latest round of applications saw a record number of projects with disability as the main focus (22 out of 145) which indicates that more international organisations are becoming aware of the need to promote the rights of disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/4">We are supporting several initiatives aimed at increasing the capacity of disabled people's organisations. We have a Programme Partnership Agreement (PPA) with UK- based Action on Disability and Development which is working directly with disabled people's organisations (DPOs) in eight countries across Africa and Asia. Recently we also committed to providing substantial support to a new Disability Rights Fund (DRF) set up to empower DPOs to participate effectively in the implementation and monitoring mechanisms set out in the UN Convention. This is one of the first foundations to support organisations run by disabled people in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/5">As suggested by Article 32 DFID is also looking at ways to increase the amount of disability related research. We are currently funding the Southern Africa Federation of Disabled People Research Project (SRP) which is an innovative project designed and run by disabled people in the region. This project is helping local DPOs to research issues linked to disability and poverty and is already starting to produce evidence of the kinds of barriers disabled people face when trying to access basic services.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/6" class="italic"> (b) Inclusion of disabled people in programme reviews and evaluations</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/7">All major country and thematic reviews are now quality assured to ensure they will address the exclusion of different groups. This includes disability as well as for example, gender and people affected by HIV and AIDS. Currently we are developing a new strategy for evaluation which will include reference to disability. The strategy will be available for public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.124W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports Sahrawi refugees through its share of the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office's (ECHO) budget, and contributions to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). ECHO plans to provide &euro;10 million in 2008 to support Western Saharan refugees of which the UK share is approximately &euro;1.7 million. In 2007, the UK contributed $56 million to UNHCR for its work with refugees across the world, including from Western Sahara. DFID's funding to UNHCR in 2008-09 is shortly to be agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.124W.8/1">The humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is expected to worsen further this year as inflation, economic decline and hunger increase. The Department for International Development (DFID) has already made a contribution of &pound;9 million in this financial year to the World Food Programme (WFP) for food aid and will consider making a further contribution if required. We also plan to spend &pound;10 million this year through the Protracted Relief Programme. This complements emergency food aid by supporting livelihoods and helping to prevent families from falling into destitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.8/2">Other DFID programmes provide support to Zimbabwean migrants, orphans, essential health care including maternal and infant mortality reduction, and to mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS. All DFID programmes in Zimbabwe have been designed to react rapidly to deepening humanitarian needs.</p>
