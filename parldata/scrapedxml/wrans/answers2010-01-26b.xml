	<p pid="b.713W.3/1">Major sporting events can be a magnet for the global sex and trafficking industry; this is wholly unacceptable. I am determined that traffickers will not exploit London 2012. My officials have been working with the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Service on this issue and collectively we are developing a comprehensive plan of action which will build on the considerable expertise the UK has in tackling human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.3/2">Tackling this issue is one of my top priorities. Next month when I attend the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic winter games in Vancouver I will be meeting with key representatives from the agencies responsible for tackling human trafficking and NGO support groups. Ahead of my visit to Vancouver I plan to visit Gatwick airport to view the UK multi-agency response to see how the police, UK Border Force, local social services and NGOs work in partnership to identify and target potential victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.3/3">I will ensure that the All-Party Trafficking of Women and Children group receives an update on lessons learned when I return from Vancouver next month.</p>

Provided this is achieved, the closure of Bellamy's Bar will represent a net saving to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.2/2">Although its ring-fenced cathedral repair grant scheme was ended at the end of the 2009-10 financial year, English Heritage has made clear that cathedrals are still able to apply for funding under its other grant schemes. Indeed, Lincoln cathedral was awarded &#163;250,000 last month for major fabric repairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.2/3">We are, of course, extremely grateful for all English Heritage's financial support to date but may I add, by way of a statement, that the church also warmly welcomes the recommendation from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee that cathedrals should receive direct funding from Government. Looking after cathedral and church buildings is a huge effort but it is worthwhile given the spiritual, cultural, educational and other benefits to the whole nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.2/1">The Coroners Rules in Northern Ireland require that where an inquest is necessary it must be held as soon as is practicable after the coroner has been notified of the death.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/2">The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland was extensively reorganised in 2006. The following changes have been introduced with the objective of improving service delivery:</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/3" class="indent">1. A full-time coronial judiciary was established under a senior coroner, replacing the previous structure which largely depended on part-time coroners.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/4" class="indent">2. A High Court judge was assigned to be the presiding judge for the Coroners Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/5" class="indent">3. A medical officer was appointed to provide independent medical advice to the coroners.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/6" class="indent">4. Legal officers were appointed to support the coroners in the handling of complex cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/7" class="indent">5. Administrative support to the coroners was improved, including the appointment of coroners' liaison officers whose role is to liaise with bereaved families to provide information and support throughout the coroner's investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/8" class="indent">6. An improved IT system was introduced which allows cases to be tracked effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/9" class="indent">7. Protocols have been agreed with partner agencies, including the State Pathology Department and PSNI (who investigate deaths on behalf of the coroners in Northern Ireland), setting targets for the production of reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/10">The Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Court Administration recently reported favourably on the improvements made in the Coroners Service (Coroners Service for Northern Ireland: A follow-up review of the administrative systems supporting bereaved families provided by the Coroners Service for Northern Ireland-November 2009).</p>

Therefore recruitment to the National Offender Management service (NOMS)-which is a civil service agency-or any other civil service department or agency must reflect that distinction, and NOMS must follow civil service wide procedures for managing surplus staff that have been agreed with civil service trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="b.731W.0/2">Probation boards and trusts are employers in their own right and therefore have individual recruitment and secondment policies as well as individual policies for dealing with surplus staff which have been agreed with the probation trade unions.</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.5/2">Furthermore, new research from DEFRA shows that 78 per cent. of people support having a separate food waste collection to enable food recycling, and two-thirds of households with access to a separate food waste collection use it. Penalty notices were not used in any of the contexts studied to ensure the food waste collection scheme worked.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.2/1">DEFRA expects to spend &#163;780 million on flood and coastal erosion risk management in 2010-11. This includes expenditure by local authorities (supported by Formula Grant) and the Environment Agency (through Grant in Aid). In addition, &#163;20 million of the original &#163;800 million figure for 2010-11 was brought forward into 2009-10 budgets as part of the fiscal stimulation package.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.2/2">Within the above, the Department has a retained budget for flood and coastal erosion risk management of &#163;35 million for 2010-11.

	<p pid="b.738W.2/3">Based on historical spending by local authorities, DEFRA estimates that its total expenditure on flooding and coastal erosion will be at least &#163;87 million in 2010-11. However, the need for local authorities to spend more on flood and coastal erosion risk management was recognised at the last spending review and additional funding was provided as part of the overall formula grant settlement. As Formula Grant is not ring-fenced it is for individual authorities to decide how much to spend subject to limits on overall budgets and the need for investment on other priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.2/4">The Environment Agency's Flood Defence Grant In Aid budget for 2010-11 is &#163;659 million in 2010-11. This figure also reflects the &#163;20 million brought forward to 2009-10.</p>

It is not possible to provide information that distinguishes home grown wheat grain milled for bread flour alone. The lower percentage home grown wheat in the last two years is a reflection of the lower quality of the domestic crop for milling.</p>

	<p pid="b.745W.0/1">Due to the broad nature of the question and the wide range of DEFRA policies implemented in Slough, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/2">As a local authority, Slough is obliged through statute to comply with central Government legislation. DEFRA's policy responsibilities are summarised in its departmental strategic objectives (DSOs) that have been agreed with the Treasury:</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/3" class="indent">To promote a society that is adapting to the effects of climate change, through a national programme of action and a contribution to international action.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/4" class="indent">To promote a healthy, resilient, productive and diverse natural environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/5" class="indent">To promote sustainable, low carbon and resource efficient patterns of consumption and production.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/6" class="indent">To promote an economy and a society that are resilient to environmental risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/7" class="indent">To champion sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/8" class="indent">To promote a thriving farming and food sector with an improving net environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/9" class="indent">To encourage a sustainable, secure and healthy food supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/10" class="indent">To provide socially and economically sustainable rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/11" class="indent">To be a respected department delivering efficient and high quality services and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/12">One example is that Slough has included National Indicator 192 (amount of household waste recycled or composted) and National Indicator 186 (per capita reduction in CO2 emissions in the local authority area) in its local area agreement, which will encourage it to achieve higher levels of performance in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/13">DEFRA publishes annual departmental reports which set out progress against its public service agreement targets and DSOs. The 2009 report is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/14" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/about/how/deprep/2009-report.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/about/how/deprep/2009-report.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/15">Past reports available online in the National Archives.</p>
	<p pid="b.745W.0/16">For information on a specific DEFRA policy in Slough, the Government office for the south-east is able to provide information on implementation and the benefits to the area.</p>

We are assessing whether the measures agreed at the meeting provide sufficient reassurance that ICCAT can take the necessary steps to implement what was agreed at the meeting, in order to turn around the dramatic decline in the species population. Consequently, we have not yet ruled out the need for a convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) Appendix I listing, and it certainly remains an option under consideration in the run up to the CITES Conference of Parties meeting in March this year.</p>

Spending depended on receiving acceptable bids from local authorities. A provisional allocation of capital resources for congestion TIF of around &#163;100 million in 2008-09 and &#163;200 million in 2009-10 was made in spending plans prior to start of 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="b.750W.5/3">Productivity TIF schemes are being delivered by Network Rail and the Highways Agency. The Department budgeted &#163;55.3 million for rail projects in 2008-09 which was spent by Network Rail with a further &#163;61.7 million expected to be spent in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="b.751W.2/4" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> The Department does all that it can to assist the police and the courts in detecting and prosecuting cases of unlicensed driving including driving while disqualified. A critical step has been the provision to the police of 24 hour access to accurate and up-to-date driver licensing information (including a photograph where appropriate) at the roadside to assist detection and enforcement. There are also good IT links between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the courts to assist in effective prosecution of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.2/5" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> The Home Office introduced a new offence in August 2008 of &quot;causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured&quot; which carries a custodial sentence of up to two years. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced a new offence of being a registered keeper of a vehicle for which there is no valid motor insurance, to be enforced by a procedure of continuous insurance enforcement. Further regulations are required to bring these provisions into force. The Department plans to commence delivery of the scheme in 2010-11 starting with an initial publicity campaign to raise public awareness.</p>

	<p pid="b.751W.5/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) enforcement strategy seeks to maximise collection of vehicle excise duty (VED) at minimum cost and includes proportionate action against non-compliance. DVLA enforcement activities are provided for in law and steered by a cross-Government board which meets every quarter, keeping the approach under review. The agency's enforcement and compliance systems make it more convenient than ever to pay VED but very difficult to evade. The latest national statistics estimate that DVLA collects 99.4 per cent. of all VED payable.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.5/2">DVLA also operates the Registration of Number Plate Suppliers scheme, educating suppliers of the rules and taking action against those who break the law. A recent Hampton Implementation Review by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills concluded that DVLA demonstrated good overall compliance with the Hampton principles.</p>

	<p pid="b.756W.2/1">Following the severe weather in February 2009, the UK Roads Liaison Group published a report on the lessons learnt on salt usage and supply. The Department for Transport welcomed the UKRLG report and wrote to local authority chief executives impressing on them the importance of effective winter service strategies. The UKRLG also issued revised guidance on winter service.</p>
	<p pid="b.756W.2/2">The UKRLG recommendation was that local authorities should keep six days salt capacity and that in addition the Highways Agency should hold a strategic reserve. The Highways Agency entered this winter period with 13 days' capacity and I regard this as the right response following last year's events. For local roads, it is for each local highway authority to consider what measures to take to ensure roads and pavements can be gritted, based on the guidance available to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.761W.2/1">Government's priority is to ensure that everyone who is out of work has the support they need to find a job. As part of this commitment, the Government have made up to &#163;5 billion available since November 2008 to offer substantial new support to jobseekers, and particularly young people, during the recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.2/2">In April 2009, we launched an enhanced offer to all jobseekers at day one of their claim which includes targeted group sessions in jobsearch techniques, access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies and access to additional financial support towards the costs associated with finding work. We have also quadrupled funding to the Rapid Response Service which provides advice and support to people facing redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.2/3">When they reach six months of unemployment, all jobseekers are now able to access a substantial new package of support including recruitment subsidies, work-focused training places, volunteering opportunities and support to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.2/4">Government have also introduced substantial new support to help young people during the recession, particularly through the Future Jobs Fund, where Lancashire county council have already been successful in a bid to create up to 503 Future Jobs Fund jobs in the local area which will provide valuable opportunities for people in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.2/5">The support will be further enhanced from <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January</phrase> with the introduction of the Young Person's Guarantee, which guarantees all 18 to 24-year-olds who reach six months of unemployment access to a job, training or work experience. From April 2010, young people will be required to take up one of the places on offer before they complete 10 months on benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.2/6">Young people will also be given access to a named Jobcentre Plus Personal Adviser at the start of their claim and have more time with an adviser throughout their claim. And we are offering many more young people day one access to the substantial support that is normally available at six months.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.2/7">In addition, 18 to 24-year-olds in Morecambe and Lunesdale who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months have access to the New Deal for Young People, and customers aged 25 and over who have been unemployed for 18 months have access to the New Deal 25 Plus programme.

We have also developed a range of improvements to the programme, including changes to ensure the programme helps people with mental health conditions more effectively.

	<p pid="b.768W.6/3">The CLG Group, which includes its executive agencies and selected NDPBs, reduced reported emissions from energy use by over 10 per cent. in 2008-09 compared to the previous year and has already reduced emissions from road travel by 30 per cent. compared to the Sustainable Operations (SOGE) target to reduce by 15 per cent. by 2010-11 against 2005-06 levels. Given these recent successes, it is particularly challenging to reduce emissions by a further 10 per cent. in 2010 across such a diverse estate and range of organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.768W.6/4">CLG's ongoing research and analysis, which informs its wider Carbon Reduction Delivery Plan, indicates that a further 10 per cent. reduction should be possible across its headquarter estate in 2010. These reductions are expected to be delivered by continued estate rationalisation, upgrade of lighting, heat recovery projects and more efficient operation of plant and machinery. Specific research includes assessments of estate strategies, FM and engineering practices and asset replacement opportunities. These will then be prioritised based on payback and availability of resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.768W.6/5">In assessing its approach to short term targets such as 10:10, the Department remains mindful of its long term strategy for meeting its Carbon Budget allocations, necessary to deliver the 80 per cent. reduction by 2050, as required by the Climate Change Act 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.774W.7/1">The Department's policy on historic ships was developed in response to the DCMS public consultation on 'Ships for the Nation' in 2003 and the Select Committee hearing on maritime heritage and historic ships in 2004-05. This led to the creation of the advisory committee for national historic ships in July 2006. This committee advises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on policy and priorities for the historic ships sector; co-ordinates work within the sector to assist those directly engaged in preservation; and promotes public interest in historic ships as a key component of the maritime heritage.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.7/2">The committee receives revenue funding from the Department. In addition to advising on priorities for the sector, the committee uses its funding to compile and maintain the national register of historic vessels; to provide strategic development grants to assist owners, trusts and societies responsible for vessels included on the national register.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.7/3">The register for national historic vessels is a database of over 1,000 vessels which can be used to identify and prioritise vessels that should be preserved, provide guidance on how best to allocate funding and give an early warning of any vessels that may be 'at risk'. It allows Government to identify the vessels that are of national and regional significance which may need to be prioritised for long term preservation.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.7/4">The committee has also created the 'National Ship Preservation Network' which is an online directory of organisations involved in vessel conservation, allowing owners to access up-to-date information about the skills and services available in their area. In addition to this, the committee has published a range of guidelines on preserving, conserving and deconstructing historic vessels.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.7/5">In 2007, the committee carried out a consultation entitled &quot;Understanding Historic Vessels&quot;. As a result of this, they published two guidance documents called &quot;Recording Historic Vessels&quot; and &quot;Deconstructing Historic Vessels&quot;. &quot;Recording Historic Vessels&quot; is designed to help vessel owners to create and maintain a record of their vessel so that information about the vessel can be preserved for the future. &quot;Deconstructing Historic Vessels&quot; was designed to help vessel owners carry out any necessary deconstruction work in a way that saves a valuable record of the ship's structure and operational life for future generations. These documents are freely accessible to the public on the Committee's website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.7/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/pages/advisory-papers.html">http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/pages/advisory-papers.html</a></p>
	<p pid="b.774W.7/7">There is no central register to track the use of the guidelines or the results of any recordings. It is impossible therefore to determine how many historic vessels have been recorded using the guidelines and where the vessels are located. The committee have applied the methodologies to Golden Galleon before deconstruction and to HMS Bronington (currently located in Birkenhead) ahead of a possible deconstruction programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.775W.5/2">In both the Department and the Royal Parks, management layers can be best explained by the existing grading structure. For DCMS, below the permanent secretary, there are seven grades where employees have management responsibilities as part of their normal job role. They consist of the three grade levels within the senior civil service (SCS), and then grades below SCS, grade A (upper), grade A, grade B, and grade C. The most senior grade within the Royal Parks is held by the chief executive officer and the deputy chief executive officer, both of whom are part of the senior civil service. Below them there are four grades where employees have management responsibilities as part of their normal job role. They consist of grade IV board member, grade IV non-board member, grade III and grade II.</p>

	<p pid="b.787W.2/1">Patients are routinely asked for their feedback on the support they receive to self-care and its effectiveness through the GP Tracker Survey and the IPSOS MORI self-care survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.2/2">The Department worked with Skills for Health and Skills for Care who published the &quot;Common Core Principles to Support Self Care&quot; (May 2008) setting out the skills attitudes and behaviours to support individuals to self-care. In addition a web-based training module for clinicians and other professionals is available through the national learning management system-&quot;Supporting Self Care&quot; was developed with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the Department's e-learning for Healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.2/3">Information for patients on self-care choices and service options has been made available with the development of &quot;Your health, your way&quot;. This web-based initiative on NHS Choices is supported by a patient information leaflet and information and resources for healthcare professionals. In the recent national Self Care Week (9-<phrase class="date" code="2009-11-15">15 November 2009</phrase>) which aimed to raise awareness of &quot;Your health, your way&quot; and the choices of self-care support available, visits to the website doubled.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.2/4">The Department continues to support and engage with the Expert Patients programme as one of the options to provide education for people with long terms conditions (LTCs) that can help them access services more appropriately and to self-care more effectively. This is in addition to other choices of support in terms of information about the condition, tools and equipment to help people stay independent, access to support groups, and healthy lifestyle advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.2/5">The Department's self-care strategy focuses on supporting people with LTCs through a process of care planning which enables them to take a more active and informed role in decisions about their health and well-being. This includes information, choices, shared decision making and ongoing support to self-care as part of a care planning discussion with their health-care professional. A personalised care plan, developed and regularly reviewed with a lead professional from among the team of staff who help manage their care will mean a person will have more control over the care packages they receive. In this way the chances of any unplanned emergencies or deterioration in that person's condition should be minimised. Information about care plans and care planning is included in the &quot;Your health, your way&quot; and self-care materials.</p>

	<p pid="b.788W.11/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has in place a proactive safety monitoring strategy for the swine influenza vaccines currently in use in the United Kingdom. As part of this, the MHRA established a dedicated reporting system, an adjunct to the existing Yellow Card scheme, for suspected side effects to the vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.11/2">The strategy involves daily analysis of all suspected side effect reports, a real-time statistical analysis of the data and weekly publication of its ongoing review on the MHRA website:</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.11/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/swineflu">www.mhra.gov.uk/swineflu</a></p>
	<p pid="b.788W.11/4">As well as such data arising from the UK reporting scheme, the MHRA has been fully involved in evaluating similar safety data from across Europe, as well as emerging safety data from ongoing clinical studies.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.11/5">The MHRA's analysis has so far found that the number and the nature of suspected side effects reported to date accord with expectations. The most frequently reported suspected side effects are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, redness), or are well known and common side effects of many vaccines, including the swine flu vaccines (such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle pain, fever, fatigue, headaches, swollen glands). These are generally mild and short-lasting.</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.11/6">No unexpected or serious new safety issues have been identified from UK and non-UK safety data received to date. The balance of benefits and risks for swine flu vaccines used in the UK remains positive. As with all medicines and vaccines on the UK market, the MHRA will keep the safety of swine flu vaccines under close review.</p>

	<p pid="b.791W.0/1">The training hours for fast jet pilots spent on average for each aircraft type in the Royal Air Force for the periods specified are given in the following tables. The information relates to pilots from frontline fast jet squadrons only and includes, in addition to normal frontline flying, the total hours flown while on operations, all of which include some element of training to improve pilot skills. By way of illustration approximately 40 per cent. of the Harrier and 30 per cent. of the Tornado GR4 hours in the table were actually consumed on operations. A proportion of Typhoon and Tornado F3 hours were consumed in the Falkland Islands and performing Quick Reaction Alert missions. All hours include some transit flying to operational theatres and to overseas exercises or training areas. To break down these hours between operational and training would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.791W.0/2">Average pilot flying hours for the Hawk training aircraft and the testing, evaluation and conversion training for all fast jet types are not included.</p>
	<p pid="b.791W.0/3">The reduction in flying hours for Tornado F3 in 2008-09 is attributable to the effects of the ongoing withdrawal from service of the fleet.</p>
	<p pid="b.791W.0/4">The reduction in flying hours for Tornado GR4 in 2008-09 is attributable to a variety of factors primarily the availability of aircraft for UK training as maintenance and modification activity was prioritised to deliver aircraft for operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.797W.3/2">Help for Heroes is a service charity which was established in 2007 and which raises funds to support wounded members of the armed forces in a range of different ways. As such it receives no public funding from the MOD. Help for Heroes naturally works closely with my Department on the projects that it chooses to support, but decisions on what those projects should be are a matter for the charity. We are enormously grateful for the major contributions that it is making to the welfare of our service personnel across the country. They include a grant of &#163;8 million to support the building of a new swimming pool and gym complex at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, Surrey, and financial support for the delivery, in partnership with the MOD, of a Pathfinder Army Recovery Centre in Edinburgh.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.9/1">Since 2004-05, as with all other crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs), Birmingham was allocated &#163;25,000 a year as a contribution towards funding an ASB Co-ordinator Post. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial behaviour co-ordinators' grant was pooled within the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund. This pooled budget supported the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs). As of 2008-09 Home Office funding for local authorities to tackle antisocial behaviour now form part of the general Area Based Grant (ABG) paid by the Department of Communities and Local Government. This funding has been renewed for the period 2008-11 and it is for local partnerships to agree how the grants received should be allocated against locally determined priorities, including tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.9/2">In addition, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-13">13 October 2009</phrase> the Home Secretary announced assistance to 62 priority areas where public perceptions of antisocial behaviour are highest. As Birmingham is a priority area it receives support as well as funding to provide additional services to victims and witnesses of ASB. In 2009-10, Birmingham received &#163;17,000 and &#163;20,000 to be allocated in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.9/3">There is also wider funding which contributes towards the wider cross-Government strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour, including an additional &#163;10 million announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase> by the Department for Communities and Local Government to 130 local authorities to support the fight against antisocial behaviour. Birmingham received &#163;54,000 and it is for the local authority in conjunction with the police and other partners to decide how that money can best be spent to tackle antisocial behaviour problems in the area. In addition, the Government are committed to diverting young people from crime and antisocial behaviour as demonstrated by our investment in universal services such as Sure Start Children's Centres, parenting support and positive activities as well as targeted work through the Youth Crime Action Plan (YCAP).</p>

	<p pid="b.822W.6/1">The Home Office has introduced a range of policies and initiatives since 1997. However, it is not always possible to quantify their effects particularly at constituency level. The available statistical information therefore relates to the London borough of Lambeth.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/2">In terms of police recorded crime in Lambeth, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 35 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/3" class="indent">Violence against the person: down 14 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/4" class="indent">Sexual offences: down 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/5" class="indent">Robbery: down 46 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/6" class="indent">Burglary: down 39 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/7" class="indent">Offences against vehicles: down 56 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/8" class="indent">Other theft offences: down 38 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/9" class="indent">Criminal damage: down 43 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/10" class="indent">Drug offences: up 33 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/11">Data prior to 2002-03 are not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at borough level are available prior to 1998-99. Lambeth Operational Command Unit had 1,010 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has increased by 174 since 2001. Comparisons with 1997 for Lambeth are not available. There were 170 police community support officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase> whilst there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/12">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP). The CDRP has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/13">The CDRP paved the way for the Safer Neighbourhoods initiatives where there is now a dedicated police resource in each of the 21 wards in Lambeth which were not in place in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/14">Lambeth's CDRP and wider partnership approach has been recognised as good practice and overall crime levels continue to reduce: there was a reduction in the seven consecutive years up to 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/15">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Lambeth have adopted a borough-wide controlled drinking zone which is now in operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.6/16">In 1997, there were 40 CCTV cameras in Lambeth and since then two main schemes have been developed increasing CCTV to 966 cameras. The Town Centre scheme has 133 cameras and 833 in housing estates and there are additionally Transport for London cameras.</p>

	<p pid="b.824W.6/1">Security in the UK's civil nuclear industry is stringently regulated by the security regulator, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). Operators of civil licensed sites are required by law to have in place a range of security measures required under the UK's Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 as amended. OCNS conducts routine and no notice compliance inspections to ensure that sites remain compliant. The UK's civil nuclear security regulator has, for many years, chosen to take account of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s guidelines in setting security standards at the UK's civil licensed nuclear sites. The civil licensed nuclear sites at Capenhurst and Springfields are category III nuclear sites as defined by the IAEA and in the nuclear industries security regulations and the security measures at each site meet or exceed guidelines approved by the IAEA. It is not usual for category III sites, with the exception of nuclear generating stations, to have an armed response present at them. Police officers from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary have not been routinely armed at Capenhurst and Springfields since January 2007.</p>

These estimates have been derived using data from the Jobcentre Plus 5 per cent. cohort. This is a sample of the Jobcentre Plus administrative system and as such the total number of claimants will differ from that published in the Labour Market Statistical Bulletin.</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not offer a poste restante service, and although we recommend that British citizens abroad register with our Locate service which we would also use as a key tool in any major crisis, we are aware that many people choose not to and so do not hold records of all citizens in Afghanistan. It is the responsibility of the individual or their employer to ensure that sufficient arrangements are in place for their mail and other support services in Afghanistan.</p>

Our high commission in Nicosia actively supported the initiative, hosting a networking event at the high commissioner's residence in July 2009 for members of the Cypriot business community looking to compete in the award. High commission staff were also active in promoting the awards, providing media support and advice for the Stelios Philanthropic Foundation's own public relations team and making sure the event got as much publicity as possible.</p>

Where there were divergences, both organisations have taken steps to bring salaries within the mid-market range and good progress has been made in this respect. Upwards of 85 per cent. of non-pay terms and conditions of service in most locations which completed the exercise have been aligned with local market practice immediately.

The Treaty also makes clear that members of the European Council can decide to be assisted by another Minister &quot;where the agenda so requires&quot;. The European Council at its December 2009 meeting discussed the issue, and Foreign Ministers are likely to attend the European Council at least once a year.</p>

The play areas that are delivered can be either completely new areas or existing areas which are significantly refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.6/3">Local authorities have joined the programme, and so started receiving their funding, in two phases: Wave 1 started in April 2008 and Wave 2 in April 2009. Torbay and Devon are both Wave 2 playbuilder authorities and as such are required to deliver 11 play areas each in both 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.6/4">The following tables show the capital and revenue funding allocated to Torbay and Devon during 2009-10, with indicative allocations for 2010-11 which will be confirmed in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.6/5">Decisions on where the allocated capital funding is spent within local authority boundaries are taken locally, based on grant requirements around improved play spaces being provided where they are most needed and based on a robust consultation process with local children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.6/6">We are encouraging all Members of Parliament to proactively engage with their local play capital programmes as they roll out, and we are asking local authorities to ensure that their local Members of Parliament and council elected members are appropriately consulted, and briefed, about where the capital funding is spent.</p>

	<p pid="b.844W.5/1">Raising the participation age will bring benefits for young people, the economy and wider society. Continuing in learning post 16 means young people are more likely to achieve higher levels of qualifications and to have increased earnings over their lifetime, better health and improved social skills.

This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.5/4" class="indent">Ensuring all children are prepared for success through new pupil and parent guarantees, a new secondary curriculum, one-to-one tuition and dissemination of good practice to tackle disengagement during key stage 3;</p>

We will also work with employers to ensure there is a high quality offer for young people who choose to learn alongside full-time employment;</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.5/6" class="indent">Providing young people with the support they need to participate, for instance through a learning and support agreement approach that bring together the young person's learning goals, how their needs will be met, the contribution of different agencies and the actions the young person will undertake;</p>

	<p pid="b.847W.0/1">I have not made a specific assessment of these costs but Companies House's total costs and efficiencies form part of my annual assessment of its performance. In comparison with other Government organisations, Companies House is a customer-facing delivery agency which bases its services on a modern IT platform, web-based interfaces and finance processes and resources which support its customers (such as invoice billing and credit control). These functions are not generally needed in all of the Government organisations against which Companies House is compared in the Benchmarking the Back Office report.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.0/2">Companies House is, however, working hard to realise efficiencies. The Business Plan for 2010-11 shows IT costs at 60 per cent. of those in the year benchmarked.</p>

The Digital Communications team supports policy officials and Ministers to engage and inform a broad range of audiences using digital channels which include social media. Currently four individuals are involved as a small part of their total duties in managing the Department's presence on social websites Twitter, Flickr and YouTube. On average the work is that of approximately 0.2 full-time equivalent staff.
