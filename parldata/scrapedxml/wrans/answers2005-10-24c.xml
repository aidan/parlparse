	<p pid="c.1W.9/1">Copies of the code were made available to all local authorities at the time of publication in July last year. The code provides advice for large scale land managers on how to develop a strategic approach to ragwort control. Feedback that we have had from a number of local councils during this summer indicates they are taking seriously the provisions of the code and the need to control ragwort where it poses a threat to animal welfare. Where Defra receives concerns about ragwort spreading from local authority land to land used for grazing animals or the production of conserved forage, we investigate the complaint in accordance with our enforcement procedures under the Weeds Act.</p>

A date in September 2003 was provisionally booked for the inquest, but the coroner decided to await the House of Lords judgments in two relevant cases, Middleton and Sacker which were delivered in March 2004. Staff shortages in the coroner's office prevented progress during the summer and autumn of 2004 but a further pre-inquest hearing was held on in January 2005 and, after difficulties in finding a suitable courtroom for a lengthy jury inquest, it was held between 3 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-12">12 October 2005</phrase>.</p>

The three northern regions (North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humberside) account for over 860,000 claimants, almost 40 per cent. of the English total, yet their working age population account for just 28 per cent. of the English total. Wales and Scotland also have high proportions of their working age population on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/2">High rates of inactivity will undoubtedly affect the economic performance of a region. The Government and its partners in the regions are committed to improving the economic performance of each region, which is why the ODPM, HMT and DTI have a joint Public Service Agreement (PSA) to:</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/3" class="indent">Make sustainable improvements in the economic performance of all the English regions by 2008 and over the long term reduce the persistent gap in growth rates between the regions, demonstrating progress by 2006&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/4">The Government is similarly also committed to increasing economic development and employment opportunities in Scotland and Wales and more generally works in partnership with the devolved administrations to promote prosperity in all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/5">Employment is seen as a key driver in this target and supporting incapacity benefit claimants into work is essential in reducing the employment disparities between the regions. DWP's Pathways to Work will play a crucial role in achieving this target across the whole of Great Britain and will also assist the Northern Way's target to get 100,000 people off IB by 2014. By October 2006, 11 of the 15 English Pathways will be operational in the three northern regions. In addition to this, the Northern Way will run complementary IB pilots and the first of these is due to start on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase> in the district of Easington, which has one of the highest rates of IB claimants at 19.7 per cent. (in 2004). By October 2006 the number of Pathways to Work pilots will increase to four in Wales and three in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="c.23W.8/1">The precise location of future development in the Thames Gateway during the course of the regeneration programme will be dependent on a number of factors: the land allocated in local development frameworks, the sites attracting planning applications, the success of those applications and their ability to satisfy national planning policy intentions. Exact proportions cannot be predetermined.</p>
	<p pid="c.23W.8/2">However in the Thames Gateway, as elsewhere, all new developments must have regard to national planning policies, including the national target set in Planning Policy Guidance note 3: Housing (PPG3) for 60 per cent. of additional housing, including conversions, to be built on previously developed land.</p>
	<p pid="c.23W.8/3">In the Gateway that percentage can be exceeded because there is a significant reservoir of brownfield land. The area comprises only 2 per cent. of the south east of England, but contains 17 per cent. of its brownfield land.</p>
	<p pid="c.23W.8/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's target is to deliver 80 per cent. of new development in the Thames Gateway on brownfield land, which we are presently exceeding.</p>
	<p pid="c.23W.8/5">As to the proportions of development on flood plains, flood risk assessments indicating whether it would be appropriate to develop on a site are determining factors in the eventual location of development. All development will be in line with Planning Policy Guidance note: Development and Flood Risk (PPG25), which applies a sequential risk-based approach to prevent inappropriate development in flood risk areas. To support the effective application of planning policy, the Office of the Deputy Minister is funding Strategic Flood Risk Assessments across the Thames Gateway to assess flood risk and inform planning decisions. PPG25 advises that applications for development in flood risk areas should be accompanied by a flood risk assessment appropriate to the location, scale and nature of the development which identifies the risks of flooding to and from the development, measures to be taken to reduce those risks and how any residual risk will be managed.</p>

	<p pid="c.27W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) endeavours to ensure that all our aid benefits poor people, whether provided through national governments, multilateral organisations or non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.3/2">Whenever possible, DFID provides aid to African countries through their own systems in support of their own plans. This ensures country ownership of development efforts and helps build capacity in countries to continue delivering services in the long-term. This includes means providing aid to the state in the form of Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) or support to specific sector, such as education and health.</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.3/3">DFID also recognises the important role that non-governmental organisations play in tackling poverty. For example, during 2004&ndash;05, DFID provided &pound;328 million to UK civil society organisations working in developing countries throughout the world. And more than &pound;70 million of humanitarian assistance to Africa in 2004&ndash;05 was channelled through non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.3/4">DFID plans to continue channelling aid through non-governmental organisations in a number of ways. The Civil Society Challenge Fund is DFID's main channel of support for UK-based non-government organisations. We also provide reliable funding to non-governmental organisations on the basis of agreed outcomes through Partnership Programme Agreements and our bilateral programme in Africa will continue to work with non-governmental organisations to deliver humanitarian and development assistance to poor people.</p>

	<p pid="c.27W.6/1">The humanitarian needs in Darfur are huge and major challenges remain. 1.8 million people have been displaced from their homes and 3.4 million people are relying on humanitarian assistance. The UK is at the forefront of the humanitarian effort. We have provided &pound;92 million in humanitarian assistance to Darfur since September 2003 and are the second biggest bilateral donor after the US. The UK is also leading in work with other donors to improve the co-ordination of humanitarian donor funding to Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.6/2">However, humanitarian assistance is not the solution for Darfur; only a political agreement will result in lasting improvements in the humanitarian situation in Darfur and allow people to return to their homes. To this end we fully support the African Union (AU) mediated peace talks in Abuja, at which a UK observer is present.</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.6/3">Security is also a concern and the recent deterioration in the security situation, particularly in West Darfur, could have significant impact on humanitarian relief operations. Contingency planning for disruption is underway by the humanitarian agencies and we stand ready to provide additional support if required. The UN is confident however that it can meet immediate humanitarian needs with existing resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.27W.6/4">The AU Mission also has a vital role to play in improving security, and is having a positive impact where it is deployed. The UK is fully supporting the ongoing expansion of the AU's force in Darfur to almost 8,000. We have allocated an additional &pound;19 million to help the AU achieve this, bringing the total UK contribution to the mission to almost &pound;32 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.28W.5/1">Countries will qualify for debt stock cancellation under the proposals by completing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). By definition, Completion Point HIPCs have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty reduction and sound macroeconomic management that provides confidence that the savings from debt relief will be used for poverty reduction. Good governance is part of this, with standards drawn from national strategies. Once countries have qualified for debt stock cancellation, they will get 100 per cent. irrevocable relief. There will be no ongoing conditionally.</p>
	<p pid="c.28W.5/2">Countries that have already completed the HIPC Initiative must demonstrate that they have maintained their commitment to poverty reduction and good macro-economic management in order to qualify for relief. They must therefore have remained current with their repayment obligations to the International Financial Institutions, and not have experienced serious lapses, including in governance, such that their International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes would be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.28W.5/3">In addition, extra donor resources will be provided to the World Bank and African Development Bank to compensate for the costs of the debt stock cancellation. These resources will be allocated to all poor countries through the Institutions' existing Performance Based Allocation System, thereby providing a strong incentive for good policy (including governance) and performance. The World Bank and IMF staff will also continue to monitor and report on the overall efficiency of public expenditure as well as on progress in reducing corruption and enhancing transparency in recipient countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.29W.2/1">In responding to famine, the Department for International Development (DFID) provides funding to the World Food Programme (&pound;78 million in 2004, including approx &pound;15 million through the European Community), Governments and non-governmental organisations. However, DFID also attaches considerable importance to disaster prevention. In the area of food security this includes supporting reforms in agricultural methods and promoting livelihoods that are less susceptible to the effects of famine, by working with partner governments, local communities and multilateral agencies including the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. DFID is also supporting the creation of social safety nets such as income support and social insurance, bans and grants. These aim to limit the numbers of people who require emergency food aid.</p>
	<p pid="c.29W.2/2">DFID's approach to tackling disease epidemics in the developed world is to balance prevention with reducing the impact of epidemics when they do occur. Where vaccines exist they are a very cost effective way of preventing disease. We therefore fund the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisations and Polio Eradication Initiative and also support the research and development of new vaccines and other preventive therapy for infectious diseases.</p>
	<p pid="c.29W.2/3">Our support to multilateral organisations such as the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria are designed to both prevent epidemics happening and reduce the impact once they have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="c.29W.2/4">Our bilateral programmes in the health sector are designed to strengthen health systems both to prevent and mitigate the impact of epidemics. Getting well organised communicable disease control systems in place is crucial for effectively tackling diarrhoeal diseases, pneumonia and vaccine preventable disease epidemics as well as those associated with HIV, TB and Malaria.</p>

DFID's commitment to humanitarian assistance for this year's food shortages in Malawi totals &pound;15.32 million. The UK stands ready to do more if more people need to be fed.</p>
	<p pid="c.30W.2/2">In Niger, a major humanitarian relief operation has been under way over the past three months in response to a food crisis affecting an estimated three million people, with the lives of up to 150,000 children at risk. The humanitarian operation is now working at full capacity and has helped to avert a major catastrophe. The UK has played an important part, being one of the first donors to respond when the United Nations and NGO relief agencies alerted the world to the severity of the crisis. To date, around 2.8 million people have received food aid and more than 90,000 children have received life-saving nutritional therapy. Food is also under harvest, and thanks to good rains, a bumper crop is expected. Nonetheless, the relief effort will continue in the months ahead, with priority being given to the needs of malnourished children and to those who will not benefit fully or adequately from the new harvest. Much work also remains to help those who have suffered during the crisis to recover, and in the longer term to put in place welfare safety nets and other measures to help the most impoverished people of Niger avoid further crises of this kind. DFID sent a humanitarian adviser to Niger last June, to neighbouring countries in August, and to Niger again this month. On the basis of his report, we shall be reviewing needs, and options to provide humanitarian assistance to the recovery process.</p>

	<p pid="c.31W.0/1">DFID has not had a bilateral development assistance programme with Niger during the past five years, but does provide significant support through multilateral channels such as the United Nations agencies and the EC development programme, of which the estimated UK share amounted to &pound;6.2 million in 2002. We have also provided debt relief, humanitarian assistance and small project support. Details are shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.31W.0/2">Having reached completion point under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative in April 2004, Niger is now benefiting from increased debt relief, including &pound;4.513 million (in 2004 net present value) on bilateral debts to the UK through the Paris Club. The UK will also provide US$915,190 (approximately &pound;520,000) to Niger in 2005 as part of our multilateral debt relief initiative (to be superseded from next year by debt stock cancellation as recently agreed at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
	<p pid="c.31W.0/3">In February, as part of efforts to strengthen Anglo-French cooperation on development issues in Africa, DFID agreed to provide &pound;7 million initially through the French development programme in support of Niger's basic education policy, with particular emphasis on getting more girls into primary education.</p>
	<p pid="c.31W.0/4">In recent months DFID has made a significant contribution to the food relief operation in Niger. Our total support of &pound;3.25 million is among the top three bilateral contributions, and amongst the quickest. Our funding is contributing to the general feeding of up to 1,700,000 people, nutritional therapy for up to 60,000 malnourished children, emergency health care for up to 1,750,000 vulnerable people, and emergency livestock interventions for up to 21,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="c.32W.2/2">Poverty, both rural and urban, is pervasive in Nicaragua. While the figure for rural poverty in the Atlantic coast is higher than the rural average (77 per cent. compared to 64 per cent.) there are many other regions in the country displaying similar, or worse poverty indicators. Less than 20 per cent. of Nicaragua's poor live in the Atlantic coast. DFID, therefore, makes decisions on the extent and nature of its support on the basis of the Government's commitment to tackle poverty throughout the country rather than in just one part.</p>
	<p pid="c.32W.2/3">DFID does, however, recognise the particular challenges of the Atlantic coast. We seek to tackle these through a combination of direct support to the area and through high-level dialogue with the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.32W.2/4">A significant proportion of DFID's programme directly benefits Nicaragua's Atlantic coast. Our HIV/AIDS programme has provided information and education services for specific vulnerable target groups, and has built capacity among local government and civil society to provide basic care for people living with HIV/AIDS. Part of the &pound;850,000 of support in 2005&ndash;06 to help municipal Government initiatives tackle poverty will benefit the autonomous regions on the coast. We have helped to increase visibility of the region's challenges, and its potential contribution to development, by supporting the participation of Afro-descendent youth in debates on marginalisation and the dissemination of the United Nations development programme (UNDP)'s human development report for Nicaragua's Atlantic coast. DFID support to the 2005 census is contributing to the better identification of the poverty on the coast, thereby enabling more effective targeting of resources in the future. DFID has also begun discussions with the Presidential Commission for Competitiveness to explore how the bilateral programme can support market access for small enterprises and rural producers in the region.</p>
	<p pid="c.32W.2/5">DFID uses its position as a member of the influential group of donors providing budgetary support to challenge the economic and political marginalisation of the region, and seek opportunities to demonstrate its potential contribution to national development. Participation in this group also enables DFID to advocate increased spending on social sectors and employment generation in the national budget. My visit to Nicaragua last year enabled me to press specific issues of the Atlantic coast, such as land rights, when I met with President Bolanos.</p>

	<p pid="c.34W.6/1">The scale of illegal logging and mining in Papua has, until recently, been poorly understood. An official Government of Indonesia investigation team in 2003 was turned away by the Governor of Papua. February 2005, however, saw the publication of a damning report The Last Frontier&quot; by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and local NGO Telapak, supported by DFID. This resulted from several years of undercover investigations and reported that timber theft on a massive scale was taking place in Papua, to a value of $1 billion a year, mostly exported to feed the booming timber industries in China.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.6/2">The report galvanised serious action from the Government of Indonesia, which sent a team of 1,500 people to investigate, but no high level convictions resulted. The investigation was closed after criticism in Parliament of its lack of focus, inability to reach powerful actors, and unfair scape-goating of poor rural communities. However, the Ministry of Forestry has now instigated a review of the timber licensing systems in Papua, which DFID is currently supporting.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.6/3">There have been no systematic investigations into illegal mining in Papua. In 2001, the Indonesian environmental organization Walhi brought a successful conviction against Freeport Mines for breaking environmental law and misinforming the public about its responsibility for the inadequate construction and subsequent breach of a dam below its mine site that was filled with toxic waste. The dam's breach resulted in many deaths. The conviction was later overturned on appeal.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.6/4">DFID has been supporting the work of EIA/Telapak for a number of years, through our Forestry Programme (MFP) in Indonesia. The programme is also supporting the review of current forest management systems with the Ministry of Forestry, the Papua Provincial Forest Department, local NGOs and community groups. More widely in Papua, the programme is supporting rural communities to strengthen local institutions and map their traditional land claims in order for them to better negotiate with government and private businesses over future forest land uses.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.6/5">DFID also supports a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Illegal Logging with the Government of Indonesia, which aims to tackle illegal logging in a variety of ways but has no activities specific to Papua. The Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, which DFID supports through the EU, foresees a voluntary partnership agreement with the Government of Indonesia that would restrict imports of illegal timber from Indonesia to the European Union member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.6/6">DFID continues to support EIA/Telapak through a new grant to focus specifically on Papua, building the capacity of local NGOs to fulfil a stronger watchdog role over illegal logging activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.34W.6/7">DFID does not provide support to address the problems of illegal mining.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.3/1">In the light of the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, published in July 2002, the Government do not believe that there is a pressing need for a Royal Commission into the issue of animal experimentation at the present time. The Select Committee's exhaustive inquiry lasted for over a year and took oral and written evidence from over 100 organisations and individuals, including participants from the scientific community, industry, regulators and animal welfare and animal rights organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.3/2">The Select Committee also visited universities, pharmaceutical and contract testing companies and research laboratories in the United Kingdom, France and the United States. The Select Committee concluded that it is morally acceptable to use animals in scientific procedures, but that it is morally wrong to cause them unnecessary or avoidable suffering. It also concluded that there is at present a continuing need for animal experiments both in applied research and in research aimed purely at extending knowledge. The Government share these views as, we believe, do the great majority of people in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.6/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.6/2"><i>(a)</i> Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February</phrase> this year the United Kingdom has implemented the ED Receptions Conditions Directive which lays down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in member states including the requirement to provide all new asylum claimants with an information leaflet which advises them of their rights and responsibilities and provides contact numbers for support and assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.6/3">This leaflet is available in 15 languages which covers the majority (approximately 92 per cent.) of asylum seekers. Asylum Screening Units in both Liverpool and Croydon have a pool of interpreters available for their immediate use, while ports of entry and other immigration offices will call in an interpreter to attend interviews, when required.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.6/4">All interpreters used by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) either hold a recognised public qualification such as the Diploma in Public Service Interpreting (DPSI) Law option, or have been assessed by the Metropolitan Police or the Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA). Interpreters are bound by a Code of Conduct and their performance is monitored by the IND officials.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.6/5"><i>(b)</i> The assessment made when funding for advisers to attend interviews was withdrawn in April 2004 was that their presence added little value in most cases. Where the claimant is considered to need additional support, as in the case of minors and people whose claims are considered very quickly, funding continues. There is no evidence that the changes have worked to the disadvantage of asylum claimants. Claimants can also ask for an audio recording of their substantive interviews if they are not entitled to representation at interview or lack sufficient resources to pay for their own representation, but at present only around 20 per cent. do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.40W.5/1">Clause 37 of the Identity Cards Bill provides for maximum flexibility in setting reduced fees for any group including those listed in the question. No decisions have been made on the details of any concessionary fee regime which will need to be informed by the outcome of the procurement stage. The Bill was amended in Committee to ensure that the first fee schedule for the scheme will be debated in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.40W.5/2">As to the cost of ID cards more generally, our current best estimate of the average unit cost of getting a combined passport and ID card package valid for 10 years is &pound;93.

	<p pid="c.41W.2/1">As in other countries, the number of unauthorised&quot; or illegal&quot; migrants&mdash;including failed asylum seekers&mdash;in the UK is unknown. A report by the Migration Research Unit (MRU) of University College London on Sizing the Illegally Resident Population in the UK&quot; was published last year. It reviewed the methods used by researchers and Government agencies in other countries and assessed their viability for use in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.41W.2/2">That report suggested that a method which could be applied in the UK is the residual method&quot; used in the United States. The new report details how that method has been applied in the UK. It was published by the Home Office on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. A copy of the RDS on-line report 29/05&mdash;Sizing the unauthorised (illegal) migrant population in the United Kingdom in 2001&quot; can be found at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/june_summaries.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/june_summaries.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.41W.2/3">The central estimate of the illegally resident population is 430,000. This is not broken down geographically. It must be emphasised that, while this method is one that can be used with data available for the UK, over-reliance must not be placed on this result in the absence of the means to produce other estimates using different methods.</p>

	<p pid="c.42W.5/1">In 2002 the Home Office published research into the net fiscal contribution of migrants. This was based on figures for 1999&ndash;2000 and estimated that migrants made a net fiscal contribution of &pound;2.5 billion. This research was recently updated by IPPR based on figures for 2003&ndash;04 (Sriskandarajah, Cooley and Reed: Paying their way: the fiscal contribution of immigrants in the UK, IPPR, London, 2005). This found that migrants made a relatively greater fiscal contribution than UK born residents.</p>

	<p pid="c.47W.3/1">City academies and foundation schools benefit from the full range of VAT and direct tax reliefs available to charities. They are exempt from tax on most income and capital gains when these are applied to charitable purposes, and benefit from a range of VAT reliefs. These VAT reliefs include a zero rate for construction of buildings, or parts of buildings, where at least 90 per cent. of total use will be solely for a relevant charitable purpose, such as the provision of core education. City academies and foundation schools also qualify for a reduced VAT rate of 5 per cent. when they purchase fuel and power for use in the course of their charitable non-business activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.47W.3/2">Academies and foundation schools can reclaim any VAT they have incurred that relates to taxable activities, such as extended use of school facilities for which a taxable charge is made. They can also choose to reclaim from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) any VAT costs relating to non-business use of buildings, and to account for output tax on this non-business use over a twenty year period. In addition, local education authorities can reclaim from HMRC any VAT costs they have incurred in relation to foundation schools, or any VAT costs incurred by the foundation school when making purchases as an agent of the local education authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.47W.3/3">VAT is not chargeable on the sponsorship contribution made by academy sponsors. Where an academy sponsor makes the payment wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their trade and does not acquire any capital asset in return, the expenditure is allowable for tax purposes. Alternatively, if the sponsor is itself an educational charity the sponsorship payment would be treated as qualifying charitable expenditure and the income from which the sponsorship payment is made is potentially exempt from tax.</p>

	<p pid="c.50W.5/1">The Valuation Office Agency (VOA), whose valuation officers are responsible for maintaining non-domestic rating lists, do not hold any statistics relating to the loss of revenue due to any game farms not being identified and entered into the relevant lists. The VOA believes that any significant game farms have already been identified either by the Agency, billing authorities (who are responsible for notifying the Agency) or via inquiries by animal rights organisations or the Game Farmers Association. In general, game farm assessments produce relatively low rateable values. This is because the average operation is on a relatively small scale, the area of land utilised for the actual operations is often no more than a field or part of a field, often this is transient (which may mean the operation is not treated as rateable due to the de minimis provisions relating to the exemption of agricultural land) and any rateable buildings are poorly located, minimal and of agricultural quality.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.5/2">The VOA has undertaken various initiatives over recent years to identify commercial game farms and to enter them in the non-domestic rating lists. Where the valuation officer is aware of a property that may be operating as a commercial game farm and it is not assessed for non-domestic rates, then the circumstances will be investigated by the valuation officer and action will be taken to assess the game farm, if appropriate.</p>

Intermittency has to be managed but surplus capacity is always maintained in case of plant failure for all technology.</p>

However, DTI does publish annually (at <a href="http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/chapters/reserves_index.htm">http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/chapters/reserves_index.htm</a>) estimates of recoverable UKCS oil and gas reserves. These identify reserves remaining in existing discoveries, classified according to the probability of their development, and estimates of resources in as-yet-undiscovered fields. As at the start of 2005, perhaps 22 to 28 billion barrels of oil equivalent were expected to remain. How much of that oil and gas will be produced will depend on future activity levels, which are uncertain, but it seems likely that the large majority of the UK's hydrocarbon resources will have been extracted by 2030.</p>

	<p pid="c.61W.2/1">Nuclear materials accountancy is used at UK nuclear sites to help meet statutory domestic regulations and international safeguards requirements. International safeguards requirements include the timely detection of diversion of civil nuclear material. This timeliness is a function of material type and form. Some nuclear installations therefore operate 'near real time materials accountancy' to meet this safeguards requirement. The Thorp chemical plant design included the application of statistical analysis techniques at regular intervals to its nuclear material accountancy data. This 'near real time materials accountancy' was not designed for process control and is distinct from systems for monitoring the safety and security at the plant.</p>

	<p pid="c.63W.10/1">I keep close contact with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on all policing matters in Wales. The Government are supporting a wide-ranging programme to tackle youth offending and to prevent children being drawn into crime in the first place. This includes tackling deprivation and working with families and education services, along with on-going implementation of the 10-year anti-drugs strategy. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister recently announced a major new drive to increase the take-up of parenting contracts and orders, as part of our strategy for fostering respect in society.</p>

	<p pid="c.73W.7/1">The UK, as lead nation on counter narcotics (CN), is committed to supporting the Afghan Government in the implementation of their eight pillar 2005 CN Implementation Plan and in updating their National Drug Control Strategy. The UK provides assistance across all eight pillars of the 2005 CN plan, which include building institutions, an information campaign, developing the rural economy and providing alternatives for poppy farmers, interdiction and law enforcement, criminal justice, eradication, demand reduction and the treatment of addicts, and regional cooperation.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.7/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase>, I announced new UK funding for Afghan CN in a joint press conference with Afghan CN Minister Qaderi. The UK is to provide more than &pound;270 million over the next three years. &pound;130 million of the funding will be provided by the Department for International Development with the rest coming from other Government Departments including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence. In this financial year, the UK is spending in the region of &pound;100 million on all CN activity, &pound;50 million of which is for alternative livelihoods. &pound;6 million is for eradication activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.7/3">Eradication is one of the ways of inserting risk into the Afghan drugs industry. However, it needs to be balanced with wider measures to interrupt the drugs trade, to take action against the traffickers and to build up Afghan criminal justice capacity to deal with drugs offenders. The UK does not carry out any direct eradication but provides targeting, monitoring and financial support, bilaterally and through the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). We also provided financial support to the Afghan National Police (ANP) for eradication.</p>
	<p pid="c.73W.7/4">Supported by the US, the Central Poppy Eradication Force (CPEF) and, more recently, the ANP and provincial governors have eradicated poppy this season. We understand that the final figures in the UNODC Survey for 2005 will confirm that while eradication by CPEF this year was disappointing (at around 200 hectares), eradication by governors and the ANP was more effective (around 4,800 hectares). The final UNODC survey is due to be published at any time.</p>

The high commission, as presidency, led an EU fact-finding mission to the Maldives, which met Ministers, officials and Mohamed Nasheed. Following this, the EU issued a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-02">2 September 2005</phrase>.

Further revised guidance has been placed on the DARD website on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-19">19 October 2005</phrase> and this will be disseminated to the poultry industry and will be reviewed and updated as appropriate.

In order to be awarded Qualified Teacher Status, all trainee teachers must demonstrate competences in SEN including that they know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN and that they can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties. Newly Qualified Teachers, during induction, must demonstrate they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. For in-service training, all schools have a School Development Grant which they can use for purposes such as supporting professional development in SEN, including training in Asperger's syndrome, if they feel that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.126W.0/3">Under the SEN strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; the Department has commissioned the Teacher Development Agency to carry out work to the value of &pound;1.1 million over the period 2005&ndash;08 to strengthen teachers' SEN skills. This includes work to strengthen the SEN training infrastructure by creating a network of SEN tutors in order to encourage the sharing of expertise.</p>

	<p pid="c.127W.0/1">In March 2005 jointly with the Department of Health, the Department published guidance Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings&quot; to help schools and their employers develop and put in place policies on the management of pupils' medicines and on supporting pupils with medical needs. However there is no legal requirement on local authorities or schools to have such policies in place. The guidance provides some basic information on some common conditions, including asthma, and encourages schools to develop an environment that is asthma friendly. In particular, the guidance recommends that all schools should have an asthma policy as an integral part of their policy on medicines and medical needs. The guidance also recommends all staff, particularly PE teachers, should have training or be provided with information about asthma once a year so that they can support children in all aspects of school life including physical activities when appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.130W.2/1">We have received a number of representations from academies about the VAT position and funding for VAT costs, and are discussing the issues with them and the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. My officials have also had discussions with officials from HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="c.130W.2/2">VAT is not chargeable on the construction of academy buildings, or parts of these buildings, that are used exclusively for core education activities and/or for community use where no charge is made. VAT relief also applies to those parts of the building used for community activities where any charge is made, provided this does not exceed 10 per cent. of the total use. Long standing agreements with our European partners, which govern the application of VAT reliefs throughout the EU, mean that while we can maintain the existing relief for the construction of charitable buildings, relief cannot be extended further.</p>
	<p pid="c.130W.2/3">For academy buildings to be available for community use without restriction, VAT would have to be paid on the costs of the relevant parts of the building. However, in such cases an academy would be able reclaim VAT that related to taxable business use of the building. An academy would also be able to choose to reclaim VAT that relates to non-business use of the building and to account for output tax over the economic lifetime of the building. This would allow the academy to spread any VAT costs relating to non-business use of its buildings over a 20 year period.</p>

	<p pid="c.135W.5/1">The Department has received a small number of letters from providers who have made representations through their local Members of Parliament. Each correspondent has received a full response outlining details of the reforms. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is leading on implementing the reforms and received one representation from the Association of Learning Providers (ALP) in July 2005. The LSC has invited the ALP to join the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) Management Board and has consulted a range of providers through visits, workshops and attending Work Based Learning Provider meetings.</p>
	<p pid="c.135W.5/2">The extension of EMA to unwaged trainees should not be regarded as simply the replacement of the training allowance by EMA. It is a full package of financial support which will extend EMA to unwaged trainees and extend child benefit and child tax credit to their parents/carers. This will mean more money for the majority of unwaged trainees and their families, which are typically low to middle income households. Currently, the parents/carers of unwaged trainees cannot claim child benefit for them and lose income tested family benefits because the training allowance is treated as income for benefit assessment purposes. Those young people who are estranged from their parents/carers, and entitled to claim benefits in their own right, will also be much better off as they will be able to claim income support in addition to their EMA. Currently, these young people lose out because the training allowance is treated as income in assessing their entitlement to income support.</p>
	<p pid="c.135W.5/3">There was strong support from many respondents to the Government's public consultation in 2004 to extend the same package of support to unwaged trainees as was currently available to those who stay on in full time education.</p>

	<p pid="c.136W.6/1">In March 2005 the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced &pound;115 million Boost for Modern Foreign Languages&quot;, providing support for language teaching and learning for this and the next 2 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.6/2">For primary schools the funding will provide continuing support for initial and existing teacher training as well as training for support staff. To date we have trained 1,200 new primary teachers with a specialism in languages. Next month we will publish in hard copy and online our Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages, which sets out learning objectives for the four years of Key Stage 2. It will be supported by training, guidance and a planning tool.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.6/3">The funding will support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11&ndash;18 year olds, including alternative qualifications and vocational options at Key Stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies. We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.6/4">The funding will also allow language colleges to extend the role they play in supporting local primary and secondary schools in delivering language programmes. Last month the new languages recognition scheme, the Languages Ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is available in eight languages. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date more than 250 centres&mdash;including local authorities and Specialist Language Colleges&mdash;have registered to take part in the scheme.</p>

The strategy has produced some materials aimed at improving core literacy and numeracy skills amongst boys. In 2005&ndash;06 we will be investing a total of &pound;156 million to support schools and local authorities in raising standards for all pupils through the Secondary National Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.141W.2/2">The Department also supports a range of other initiatives aimed at raising the attainment of boys. For example, the Breakthrough Programme for Raising Boys' Achievement, in partnership with the National Primary Care Trust, focuses on sustainable changes to teaching and learning systems to help achieve pupils' potential. Playing for Success Centres use football and other sports to boost skills and motivation amongst pupils, particularly boys.</p>

	<p pid="c.145W.5/1">We are aware of the booklet, 'Talking World Class', published by CILT, the National Centre for Languages and how it highlights the impact of language skills on the UK economy and questions how well equipped UK companies are to do business in other languages. One feature of the booklet is the survey which shows an aggregate of non-mother tongue skills in each of the participating 28 countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.5/2">Our National Languages Strategy, published in December 2002, recognises the critical role that business can play in influencing young people's career choices, extending opportunities and promoting the value and importance of languages in the workplace. That is why we have funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to work with employers to embed language skills into wider social and economic agendas, to extend employer engagement, and to stimulate and support the match of need by provision of training for their employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.5/3">CILT is also funded by the Sector Skills Development Agency to create a Languages Strategy for the Skills for Business Network to ensure that Sector Skills Councils and employers take languages into account in their business planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.5/4">The Department has also funded the British Chambers of Commerce to manage a programme of regional seminars to promote the value of languages for small and medium sized business and to raise the profile of the National Languages Strategy and the Regional Languages Networks with employers across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.5/5">To raise awareness among young people of how languages can increase their employability prospects the Department has funded CILT to publish a suite of materials&mdash;Languages Work. A key purpose of the materials is to make sure that key stage 3 pupils understand the importance of language skills in today's workplace and to provide them with the information about possible careers with languages so that they can make an informed choice about continuing to learn languages at key stage 4 and beyond. The cornerstone of our National Languages Strategy is to provide all pupils throughout key stage 2 with the opportunity to learn languages by the end of the decade. By introducing languages at an early age we believe that more young people will be enthused to choose to continue to learn languages beyond age 14, benefit from acquiring these marketable skills in their working lives and contribute to the country's global competitiveness.</p>

	<p pid="c.146W.2/1">As part of the 2002 Spending Review, the Government allocated &pound;3.5 million to develop child contact centres. Of this, approximately &pound;2.5 million was allocated to establish 14 new supervised child contact centres in England. Funding is administered and monitored on behalf of the Department for Education and Skills through the National Association of Child Contact Centres (NACCC) and the National Children's Homes (NCH). From the &pound;3.5 million, approximately &pound;0.5 million was allocated to support NACCC in implementing a set of national accreditation standards for all its member centres and to fund training for the 14 new centres. The Department made available in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 a fund of &pound;0.4 million to help sustain existing child contact centres. This is also administered by NACCC.</p>
	<p pid="c.146W.2/2">Both NACCC and the NCH are required to submit reports to the Department on each of the 14 centres against agreed performance measures, including the numbers of referrals. The National Association of Child Contact Centres takes responsibility for the collection of statistics, which enables it to develop an informed national perspective. A further sum totalling &pound;7.5 million has been allocated for the period 2006&ndash;07 to 2007&ndash;08 for services which support child contact, including those delivered by child contact centres. The DFES will be working with CAFCASS, the National Association of Child Contact Centres and other service providers to identify options for the most effective use of these resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.152W.5/1">We have already taken steps to maximise parental satisfaction with the admissions process. Co-ordination of the secondary school admissions process has resulted in most multiple offers of school places being eliminated, resulting in a greater number of children being made an offer of a school place than would have received them at the same stage in the process in earlier years. Additionally, we have included a number of proposals in the draft School Admissions Code of Practice to make the system more transparent and fairer for parents. The intention is to put parents at the centre of the admissions process and to give them a greater choice as to where their children go to school, which can only be a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="c.152W.5/2">We also believe that allowing successful and popular schools to expand more quickly and more easily gives schools freedom to strengthen and develop in the direction they think appropriate in order to meet the needs of their local communities. That is why, as part of a broad spectrum of reform, we introduced new regulations in August to streamline the process for those schools that decide they have the capacity to expand.</p>

	<p pid="c.154W.2/1">The Department ceased sending publications automatically to both primary and secondary schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. Discussions with local authorities and school head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications (guidance, teaching materials and forms) they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.2/2">We have given schools this choice by introducing the online ordering system which enables schools to choose whether to download electronic copies or order the paper based publications they need at the right time for them and in the multiples they require. A fortnightly email service to schools informs them of new and important publications.</p>

	<p pid="c.154W.5/2">We strongly support the expansion of successful and popular schools. We have therefore provided that all maintained schools, including maintained special schools, may publish their own proposals to increase pupil numbers. We have also introduced a presumption that proposals by successful and popular secondary schools should be approved by the local School Organisation Committee or Schools Adjudicator. This will enable more parents to be able to gain a place for their child at the school of their choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.5/3">In addition, as part of their strategic planning for Building Schools for the Future (BSF), authorities are required to draw up a vision for the future of education provision in the area. This vision needs to demonstrate that their planning maximises the opportunity for parents to place their children into the school of their choice, and reduces surplus places where parents do not wish to send their children. BSF provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.154W.5/4">Since the beginning of October 2004 the following proposals to increase pupil numbers by 27 or more places have been published.</p>

This includes several initiatives to help boost the number of men in the workforce. For example, earlier this year we undertook regional press and radio advertising which used positive images of men working in the sector. We have produced a video for men considering working in early years. We have also commissioned the Daycare Trust to work with local authorities to enhance their efforts to promote the recruitment of men in their local labour markets.</p>

	<p pid="c.172W.2/1">The redeveloped sterile services centre based in King George's Hospital, Ilford and serving other national health service trusts in North East London, opened earlier this year. Twelve joint venture projects involving 63 NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts have advertised for private sector partners in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Union (OJEU) and are at various stages of the procurement. The most advanced is the project involving the Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, which announced its preferred bidder earlier this year and is working towards awarding the contract by the end of this year. Service commencement is expected in the autumn of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.172W.2/2">Six projects involving some 20 NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts have signed collaboration agreements and are preparing outline business cases prior to advertising in the OJEU later this year. We expect a total of some 100 NHS trusts to adopt a joint venture solution within the mixed economy for sterile services. We cannot, however, be exact about those that have not yet signed collaboration agreements. We have made provision for further NHS trusts to join a collaboration up to four years after contract commencement. These projects are managed locally, with local teams taking decisions such as when to advertise in the OJEU.</p>

	<p pid="c.175W.5/2">As part of the Food Standards Agency's (FSA) commitment to openness and transparency, all its open board meetings are webcast on the internet as a matter of course. Decisions on whether to webcast other meetings are taken on a case by case basis. The board meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="">15 September</phrase> was viewed live via the internet by at least 368 people. Other people may have watched the recording subsequently. One question was submitted by email from Chris Whitehouse of Consumers for Health Choice: 'Assuming that the Board adopts the recommendations under Item 5 in relation to the Food Supplements Directive, what specific strategy do they have for achieving the objectives specified'. This question was addressed in the question and answer session by the chief executive, who said that, if the FSA's advice was accepted by Ministers, the FSA would be seeking to influence those officials in the commission drafting the proposals on which the negotiations would be based. The full answer can be viewed at:</p>

	<p pid="c.175W.5/4">The Department conducted its first webcast on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>, World No Tobacco Day. The webcast, aimed at policy-makers and local groups that help smokers to quit, included coverage of the international conference held with the World Health Organisation supported by a short film showing a local stop smoking support group. This initiative was an important first step in broadening access to information and exploiting online channels. The Department's next webcast will be a first for Government. In the spirit of open government, the Department will broadcast policy making, live, from the deciding national event in the Your Health, Your Care, Your Say&quot; consultation on improving community health and care services in Birmingham on <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase>. This webcast will give the public, national health service staff, charities and special interest groups, the chance to see 1,000 people debating and shaping future policy on health care outside hospitals. The webcast will be accessible from the Department's website live on the day and is likely to be available via the website for some time thereafter to enable the outcome to be compared with the resulting White Paper when this is published at the turn of the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.178W.0/13">1. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data is ungrossed).</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.0/14">2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.0/15">3. Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</p>

	<p pid="c.183W.6/1">The Government have shown the importance it attaches to supporting children who care for parents with a mental illness, through the 1999 national service framework for mental health (NSFMH), the NHS Plan (2000), and the 2004 national service framework for children, young people and maternity services (NSFC).</p>
	<p pid="c.183W.6/2">The NSFMH sets out national standards, future aims and priorities for mental health services in England over a 10-year period. Specifically, standard six, Caring about carers&quot;, identifies the needs of all individuals who provide substantial care for a person on a care plan approach. This is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/09/05/66/04090566.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/09/05/66/04090566.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.183W.6/3">The NSF is also supported by the NHS Plan (2000) which sets a target of having 700 carer support workers in place by the end of 2004: by the end of March 2005, 654 (more than 93 per cent., of this target) carer support workers were in post, which represents a very significant achievement.</p>
	<p pid="c.183W.6/4">Standard two of the NSFC&mdash;Supporting parenting&mdash;recognises that special circumstances exist in some families, including parental mental illness and where children may be unpaid carers. This NSF identifies the need for support to those children who are carers and is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/09/05/66/04090566.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/09/05/66/04090566.pdf</a>.</p>

Support has been available nationally through the essential small pharmacy scheme. This has, subject to certain conditions, provided a guaranteed minimum income to support a pharmacy which might otherwise be unviable. From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, arrangements will change so that pharmacies within the scheme currently can either contract locally, again subject to conditions, with their NHS primary care trust for the provision of their services and continue to receive additional financial support or choose to be within the general provisions and payment system of the new contractual framework.</p>

	<p pid="c.189W.2/4">We will decide, in the light of work by the HPA and of other developments such as the World Health Organisation's adoption of new international health regulations, how to take the review forward. Our aim will be to consider whether and how the law could be modernised to ensure protection of the public while respecting the rights of the individual.

	<p pid="c.190W.8/1">A number of epidemiological studies have been conducted to examine potential adverse effects in babies of women who take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) antidepressants, including paroxetine (brand name Seroxat), either in the first three months of pregnancy or at any time during pregnancy. The majority of these studies have not provided evidence of an increased risk of birth defects with SSRI antidepressants such as paroxetine.</p>
	<p pid="c.190W.8/2">Recently, initial results from a new study conducted by the Seroxat manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, suggest that paroxetine may increase the risk of birth defects. On receiving these new data, the Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency promptly sought expert advice from the independent scientific advisory committee, the committee on safety of medicines (CSM). The CSM has requested that further analyses should be conducted and additional information sought before a conclusion can be reached on whether or not paroxetine increases the risk of congenital malformations. In the meantime the product information for paroxetine is being updated Europe-wide to reflect these new data.</p>
	<p pid="c.190W.8/3">If Seroxat is taken by women in late pregnancy, it is recognised that it may cause withdrawal reactions/serotonergic effects in newborns and the product information for patients has appropriate warnings.</p>
	<p pid="c.190W.8/4">Current advice is that paroxetine should only be used in pregnancy when strictly indicated and only if the expected benefit to the mother is thought to be greater than any potential risk to the foetus.</p>
