The National Audit Office record the cost of auditing the accounts of those bodies, and of the value for money studies they undertake, but no information is held on the cost of auditing the bodies' activities in specific regions of the world. However, during the year to July 2006, as part of their audit of the main Departments involved in Africa, NAO staff visited Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda to audit various UK government activities in those countries.</p>

The most recent comparisons were included in their report in 2004 on the effectiveness of the National Audit Office's work in the context of achievements against the office's target of securing for the taxpayer &pound;8 savings for every &pound;1 spent.

It is for the relevant authority in each state to determine what items are prohibited at its airports from being carried in passengers' hand baggage. The International Civil Aviation Organisation offers advice to contracting states in this regard, and the UK and other states are working with ICAO to update that advice. Within the European Union there is a common list of prohibited items which applies at EU airports. This list, available at <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction">http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction</a>.do?reference=IP/04/59&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0%3Cuage=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en is presently being amended in light of the recent aviation security alert in the UK.

	<p pid="b.682W.11/1">In the event of disruption to the MOT computerisation service, there are currently two business continuity procedures which are available to garages to ensure that they can continue to test vehicles. One militates against a failure of the local garage computer equipment whilst the other militates against a large scale database or telephone outage. There should therefore be very few circumstances under which garages incur either <i> (a)</i> loss of earnings or <i> (b)</i> additional costs as a result of technical difficulties with the MOT computerisation system. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) would however, consider claims for compensation where a garage could demonstrate that it had suffered financially as a result of these business continuity procedures being unavailable.</p>

	<p pid="b.685W.0/1">The CO2 impacts of road schemes approved through the Targeted Programme of Improvements (TPI) and Local Transport Plans (LTPs) form part of the Department's normal approval processes for major transport schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.0/2">The Department's National Transport Model (NTM) has been used to estimate the CO2 impact of road improvements at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.0/3">The road build included in our national modelling is the Highway Agency's (HA) illustrative forward programme of schemes. This includes those schemes since 2000 in the TPI, plus an estimate of schemes that may make their way into the TPI going forward.</p>

The carbon added from just the current TPI would, therefore, be somewhat less than this, although that from local transport plans might increase it.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.0/5">The TPI schemes were also appraised at an individual level. CO2 emission estimates for the HA's motorway and trunk road schemes, in the TPI (which was first launched in 1998) are given where data is currently available.

	<p pid="b.692W.2/1">Approximately 65 per cent. of breeding pigs (290,000 sows and gilts) are kept in farrowing crates for part of the production cycle. There are strict time limits for the length of time that sows can be kept in farrowing crates. The farrowing crates protect piglets from crushing by the sow&mdash;one of the largest causes of pig mortality. We feel it is important to protect the welfare of the piglet as well as the sow.</p>

DEFRA has funded research to investigate and develop viable farrowing systems that do not confine the sow, but provide adequate protection to piglets.

It remains the case that results need to be replicated consistently under commercial conditions. As yet, the risk of piglet mortality in alternative farrowing systems remains unacceptably high.</p>

	<p pid="b.693W.2/1">We would prefer to avoid the close confinement of all sows, but there are currently no free-farrowing systems suitable for widespread commercial adoption. Farrowing crates protect piglets from being crushed by the sow, one of the largest causes of pig mortality. The time limit on how long sows may be kept in farrowing crates is from seven days before the predicted day of farrowing until the piglets are weaned. After this period, sows must be moved back to loose housing accommodation in which they are free to turn round easily.</p>

	<p pid="b.693W.5/1">The population abundance and density of basking sharks in any sea area of the world is not known. Monitoring of the UK population of basking sharks has largely been based on sightings of sharks feeding on plankton near the sea surface during spring and summer. Three public sighting recording schemes are presently under way in the UK (The Marine Conservation Society Basking Shark Watch; Seaquest South-West and Solway Shark Watch). The MCS scheme has been running for 20 years and it has observed over 24,000 animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/2">Current research (by the Marine Biological Association/Cefas) on basking sharks is using modern satellite telemetry to provide valuable information on movements and behaviour of basking sharks in the north-east Atlantic. Information uncovered to date on the geographical movement of individual sharks suggest that despite making long-distance movements they remain in the vicinity of the continental shelf around the UK, Ireland and northern France. These findings have been consolidated with sightings data from UK charities (MCS, IFAW, Shark Trust, Wildlife Trusts, Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust) as part of a three-year Esmee Fairbairn Foundation-funded grant to MBA. The project is bringing together in a single database all recent data on basking shark distribution and this means that it is now possible to undertake comprehensive analyses of trends.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/3">Nevertheless, there is no current reliable population estimate for basking sharks in UK (or the European) waters. This is due to the difficulties in relating surface sightings to actual population size. While the broad distribution patterns of basking sharks in UK waters are being uncovered by sightings data, new research using telemetry data suggests there are considerable differences in the density distributions of the animal, with animals 60 times more likely to be at the surface (and thus sighted) in mixed water fronts than stratified water fronts. Genetic research is also under way to determine whether populations of basking sharks are discrete or if there is population mixing between the N-E Atlantic region and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.694W.2/1">Basking sharks are protected in British territorial waters under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This gives the shark protection out to 12 nautical miles.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.2/2">It is difficult to designate specific areas for basking sharks given their mobility in UK waters. This would be more appropriate if we are able to identify areas which are key to these animals' life cycle, such as, important feeding grounds or breeding grounds, or known mating areas that the animal consistently return to. At present, we do not know enough about these animals. A provision is currently being considered as part of the marine bill to designate marine protected areas. This means that, as our scientific knowledge improves we will be able to adapt our approach to the conservation of this species, which may include the designation of marine protected areas if deemed appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.695W.3/1">As part of our overall strategy for improving sustainability and reducing the impact of climate change, the Government support the use of biomass sources for the generation of heat and electricity.

	<p pid="b.695W.3/7">In 2004, the Government commissioned a Biomass Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, to identify the barriers to developing bio-energy and to recommend ways to overcome the problems. They published their report in October 2005. In April 2006, the Government published its response<sup>(1)</sup> to the Task Force's report. This response accepts that energy from crops, trees and waste can make a strong contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sets out 12 key initiatives and over 60 associated actions to make this happen. A number of the initiatives have already begun, and we published initial information on these in April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.8/1">Crematoria are regulated by local authorities under the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 (PPC). As such, they are subject to the provisions and limit values for all key emissions using the best available techniques (BAT). Statutory guidance on BAT is set out in Defra's Process Guidance Note PG5/2, which was reviewed and revised in 2004 and can be found at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/lapc/pgnotes/pdf/pg5-02.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/lapc/pgnotes/pdf/pg5-02.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.8/2">Considerable improvements have already been made to crematoria emissions under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which the PPC Regulations now replace. The latest guidance is aimed at reducing mercury emissions from all crematoria by 50 per cent. by the end of 2012, using an innovative burden sharing approach developed with the sector. I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October</phrase>, in a departmental press notice, our findings that the approach was proving successful, although we will be continuing to monitor the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.8/3">I am pleased to be able to announce that we will be issuing revised guidance to local authority regulators that we consider a lower temperature of 800<sup>(o)</sup>C, rather than 850<sup>(o)</sup>C, to be adequate to deal with emissions where crematoria are fitted with abatement equipment to achieve our required 50 per cent. reduction in mercury emissions. This will help reduce fuel usage and CO2 emissions. We will be discussing further with the cremation sector how to obtain evidence of whether any similar measures can be taken for crematoria not fitted with abatement, without compromising environmental protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.707W.5/1">Since the public inquiry over the A34 Newbury bypass, knowledge of the Desmoulins Whorl snail distribution, ecology and conservation status has improved considerably. This has been achieved both through research and surveys (contracted by the former English Nature) and work undertaken by members of the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, including work undertaken in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.707W.5/2">The species is much more widespread in the UK than it was formerly thought to be and has been found in new areas of some other European countries. This is likely to be a result of under-recording in the past rather than an increase in its population. It is also less fastidious in its habitat requirements and less restricted to riparian areas than was previously thought.</p>
	<p pid="b.707W.5/3">Its populations fluctuate considerably at individual sites, depending on the wetness of the season and, consequently, its numbers on some parts of some sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) have been reduced in recent drought years.</p>
	<p pid="b.707W.5/4">Rack Marsh, Hunts Green and Bagnor Island all form part of the Kennet and Lambourn SSSI and Boxford Watermeadow is a separate SSSI. Both sites are assessed as being in favourable condition. Whilst there have been population fluctuations of the snail, including absence on some of the drier areas, healthy populations remain elsewhere in the Kennet and Lambourn confluence floodplain both inside and outside the SSSIs.</p>
	<p pid="b.707W.5/5">This variation is to be expected, given the species' response to the humidity of its environment. Precise numbers are not recorded each year as this would be highly resource-intensive and unlikely to give meaningful results. However the Environment Agency and the Department for Transport have undertaken monitoring in a number of areas in the Kennet and Lambourn confluence floodplain.</p>
	<p pid="b.707W.5/6">This Department has not received any representations concerning the Desmoulins Whorl snail following the completion of the A34 Newbury bypass.</p>

	<p pid="b.711W.8/1">At the beginning of each year, the United Kingdom receives a fixed percentage of the total allowable catch for each quota stock. Fisheries Administrations then calculate the UK quota which will be distributed to producer organisations and most other groups based on the aggregate of the fixed quota allocations (FQA) units held by members within each group. The membership of producer organisations mainly involves over 10 metre vessels. Members of the under 10 metre fleet, which fish against the under 10 metre pool of quota, do not hold FQA units with their licences. Instead, units are held on a nominal &quot;dummy&quot; licence and the aggregate of these are used to calculate the opening allocation for these vessels. Some adjustments are then made to the quota which members might otherwise receive to boost their share of the UK quota for certain stocks before their opening quota is set.</p>

	<p pid="b.714W.8/1">I have recently written again to the Environment Ministers of all European Union (EU) member states that are not currently members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), and to those seeking accession to the EU, to encourage support for the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, and for the United Kingdom's policies on whaling. Furthermore, I also raised the issue of IWC membership at the recent Environment Council meeting in Luxembourg.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.8/2">Defra officials also ensure that Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts in the relevant capitals are briefed, and engage in discussion with their counterparts on whaling at every appropriate opportunity. This ensures that these countries are in no doubt of the importance that the UK places on whale conservation.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.8/3">We shall continue to encourage more conservation minded countries to join the IWC as soon as possible, in order to reverse the pro-whaling majority.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.8/4">The UK and its allies have taken every opportunity to try to persuade new anti-whaling countries to join the IWC, with some success; six have joined in the last two years.</p>

	<p pid="b.718W.0/1">There are various factors (such as social impacts, technical issues, protection of the environment, land use, transport, availability of radioactive waste treatment and disposal facilities and economic factors) that may need to be considered in any future decision about moving conditioned radioactive wastes between licensed nuclear sites. The desire to avoid excessive transportation of materials is an important consideration but must be balanced with all the other relevant factors on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.723W.8/1">Recycling is strongly promoted by a range of Government policies and we have set demanding targets, both nationally and locally, for household waste recycling and composting. However, these targets are not material-specific. The Waste Strategy review consultation, which we carried out earlier this year, also included proposals to set much more ambitious household waste recycling and composting targets, to reach 40 per cent. by 2010 and 50 per cent. by 2020. As well as encouraging more sustainable resource use, increasing recycling rates helps divert waste from landfill and therefore contributes to our efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Local authorities' ever diminishing landfill allowances, allocated under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme, also provide a strong incentive to divert greater amounts of biodegradable waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.8/2">Plastics can present a challenge for recycling as there are a number of different types in use, each requiring separate collection (or separation after collection) and treatment facilities to recycle. It inevitably takes time for this capacity to develop. However, more demanding recycling targets will mean authorities will be compelled to turn their attention to the more difficult waste streams, including plastics.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.8/3">Under the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003, all local authorities in England will be required to collect at least two types of recyclable waste from all households in their area by the end of 2010. Most households already receive this, or a better, level of service.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.8/4">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), funded by Defra and the devolved administrations, is working to promote sustainable waste management by creating stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products, including plastics and compost. WRAP's Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE) programme helps local authorities improve the efficiency of their recycling services. This includes advice to those planning to introduce a new scheme or the collection of a new material such as plastic.</p>

This includes the regulation of water abstraction from sources of supply including rivers, lakes, canals and underground sources through a system of licensing, to minimise damage to the environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.733W.12/2">The Greater London authority: The Government's Final Proposals for Additional Powers and Responsibilities for the Mayor and Assembly, concluded that the creation of a Single London Waste Authority responsible for waste disposal would not generate significant cost savings, and could even increase the costs of dealing with London's waste. Further information is available on the Department for Communities and Local Government's website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1501733">http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1501733</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/3">We are making good progress towards achieving our Gershon efficiency savings on waste. Provisional figures for environmental services indicate that &pound;245 million per annum of efficiency gains are expected to be achieved in 2006-07 (&pound;55 million of which is expected to be achieved within London). This puts us well ahead of schedule to meet the &pound;299 million per annum target for environmental services in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/4">Defra will continue to facilitate efficiencies across England (including London) through:</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/5" class="indent">(i) The Waste Implementation Programme which includes work-streams providing standard documentation, toolkits, best practice case studies, funding to local authorities for consultancy work, advice on technology choices, good quality data and help with Private Finance Initiatives and other funding arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/6" class="indent">(ii) The new Waste Infrastructure Development Programme (WIDP). WIDP aims to complement and expand on Defra's current efforts to comply with European Union Landfill Directive targets by:</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/7" class="indent">(a) establishing the scale of residual waste treatment infrastructure required to meet the landfill Directive targets in 2010, 2013 and beyond and accurately monitoring the ongoing delivery of projects in order to stay abreast of continuing requirements; and</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/8" class="indent">(b) developing and implementing measures which will accelerate the delivery of the necessary residual waste treatment infrastructure in a timely, value-for-money and affordable manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/9" class="indent">(iii) Support to the Regional Centres of Excellence&mdash;which have been drafting a national action plan on Environmental Services efficiency, supported by regional action plans;</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/10" class="indent">(iv) The Waste and Resources Action Programme, which is funded by Defra and provides a wide range of support and best practice to local authorities on reducing and recycling waste;</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.12/11" class="indent">(v) Other enablers, such as the Office of Government Commerce on procurement, and local authorities sharing best practice including through the Beacon council scheme.</p>

DEFRA can no longer justify retaining these staff when there is no work for them to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.2/5" class="indent">46 have taken voluntary redundancy since April;</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.2/6" class="indent">12 are on temporary loan or experience posting or secondment and will not be issued with notice at this stage; and</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.2/8">Those issued with notice will have six months notice of redundancy during which efforts to redeploy and retrain will continue. The Department remains committed to making every effort to avoid compulsory redundancy, however in this case, the conclusion has been reached that there is no option and nothing to be gained by any further delay. Consultation with departmental and national unions has taken place, and the Department has followed the guidelines issued to all civil service departments to avoid compulsory redundancies wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.6/2">Detailed information on the production of biofuels in the UK in the year 2000 is not held centrally, but the total amount produced is likely to have been very small. In July 2002, the Government introduced a 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive for biodiesel, and in January 2005 it introduced a similar fuel duty incentive for bioethanol. These have led to a steady increase in UK biofuel sales, which in September 2006 were running at some 25 million litres a month. Approximately two-thirds of current sales are made up of biodiesel, the great majority of which is produced in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.6/3">The Government announced in November 2005 that they would introduce a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, the effect of which will be to create a large new market for biofuels in the UK. This has led to a significant amount of investment in new UK biofuel production facilities. There are currently two major biodiesel production plants in operation in the UK (the ArgentEnergy plant near Motherwell and the Biofuels Corporation plant in Teesside), which between them are capable of producing some 300 million litres of high quality biodiesel a year, some of which is exported. A number of other biodiesel plants are at the planning and construction stage, including a Greenergy plant at Immingham which is due to come on stream in 2007. No bioethanol is yet produced in the UK, although a number of plants are at the planning and construction stage, including a British Sugar plant at Wissington (Norfolk) and a Green Spirit plant at Henstridge (Somerset).</p>

	<p pid="b.744W.2/2">I have met the administrators to discuss their preliminary findings. The administrators have issued some information by way of press releases and by updating the Farepak website. They are required to report their appointment to the creditors (so far as they are aware of their addresses) within 28 days of their appointment, unless the court directs otherwise. They are also required within three months of the date of their appointment (or such other period as the court may allow) to put their proposals for achieving the purpose of the administration to the creditors for consideration.</p>

The Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs is meeting the Chief Executive of the Office of Fair Trading to ask the OFT to reassess the regulatory framework which applies to Christmas club companies such as Farepak, and whether changes are needed in that framework.

	<p pid="b.754W.3/1">It has long been the parliamentary convention that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have come from Back-Bench Members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes. The Government believe this should still be the case. It is therefore a matter for Parliament to decide whether the current time limit should be changed. The Government have no plans to change the law on abortion.</p>

	<p pid="b.755W.0/14">Part of the increase in cases of &quot;A. baumannii&quot; reflects the increase in the proportion of cases of acinetobacter bloodstream infections in which the organism has been fully identified to species level (51 per cent. in 2001, 62 per cent. in 2005). &quot;A. baumannii' is one of the less difficult species to identify and both this and clinical concern have probably contributed to increased reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.0/15">Two multi-resistant clones of &quot;A. baumannii&quot; (Southeast clone, OXA-23 Clone 1) have affected hospitals in the United Kingdom in the past few years.

	<p pid="b.755W.0/16">The HPA has advised hospitals to implement urgently robust infection control measures to prevent spread of these clones, and is currently undertaking an analysis of outcomes, in order to identify optimum treatment for those patients who become infected<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.0/17">A multi-resistant strain of &quot;A. baumannii&quot;, known as the T strain, has been isolated from casualties returning to the United Kingdom from Iraq<sup>(5 )</sup>but the exact source has not been identified.

	<p pid="b.757W.6/1">From 2000 to 2005, funding of &pound;125 million for the provision of digital hearing aids was ring-fenced through the modernising hearing aid services programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/2">In 2005-06, funding for digital hearing aids was given to individual primary care trusts (PCTs) who had the authority to make decisions about the allocation of resources for audiology services according to the needs of the populations they serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/3">In 2006-07, the Department allocated national health service central revenue budgets on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July 2006</phrase>. This amounted to a total allocation of &pound;5.5 billion across all the strategic health authorities (SHAs) and is the aggregate value of all the individual allocations from many different budgets, including audiology. It is the responsibility of SHAs to reach agreement with their local NHS trusts and PCTs over the allocation of these resources to best meet local need. In addition, capital allocations for audiology services in 2006-07 amounted to &pound;26 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/4">A partnership between the Department of Health, RNID and the audiology professional bodies has developed a new four-year BSc (Hons) in audiology. This will help to address the national shortage of audiologists; currently there are 348 audiology students on eight BSc audiology courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/5">The public private-partnership (PPP) is proving to be very successful and has recently been extended to March 2007. The latest data for October 2006 shows that about 50,000 patients have completed pathways through PPP. NHS trusts benefit from the increased capacity, competitive pricing and quality of service provision available through the PPP.</p>
	<p pid="b.757W.6/6">In order to provide digital hearing aids at an affordable cost to the NHS, contracts have been negotiated by the NHS Procurement and Supply Agency with certain manufacturers. NHS audiologists can choose from a range of aids on contract for different types and levels of hearing loss. This enables the NHS to treat more patients from the funds available.</p>

	<p pid="b.758W.8/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published clinical guidance in May 2004 (updated October 2006 to reflect new evidence) on &quot;The classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer in primary, secondary and tertiary care&quot;. This provides clear guidance to health professionals on how to identify and manage patients who are, or are concerned that they may be, at increased risk of developing breast cancer because of their family history. The guidance has raised awareness among health professionals of the need to consider the possibility of genetic risk in women with a family history of the disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.8/2">The Department is also currently jointly funding, with Macmillan Cancer Support, pilot services in seven sites, for people at risk of, or concerned about, familial cancer. The model offers a continuum of advice and care involving primary care, local cancer services and specialised genetic and cancer services to provide consistent management of individuals in the appropriate setting according to their level of risk. These aim to provide better, more patient focused services for those concerned about their inherited risk of developing cancer by ensuring health care professionals along the patient pathway have relevant information to support and inform patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.761W.3/1">None. In general, guidance on issues of practice is a matter for the appropriate professional or regulatory bodies. In addition, local national health service organisations may decide to issue guidance to help practitioners deal with issues which are of particular relevance to their local population.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.3/2">The Human Genetics Commission support the need for proper provision of education and information about marriage within a kin-ship group. This should entail access to counselling and support, preferably in the individual's or couple's preferred language, and a no-blame approach that enables at-risk couples to come forward for testing. Those wanting specific advice on their individual risk should consult a clinical geneticist or genetic counsellor in their local NHS regional genetics centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.3/3">From next year the curriculum for trainee general practitioners will include learning objectives to equip them to refer patients at risk of genetic conditions appropriately and to appreciate the importance of considering a patient's cultural and religious background and beliefs concerning inheritance in providing care. These have been developed by the Royal College of General Practitioners in partnership with the NHS national genetics education and development centre, an initiative funded by the Department to identify health care practitioners' genetics educational needs and encourage the integration of genetics into pre- and post- registration courses and continuing professional development.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.0/19">The previous system of patient registration does not operate under the new regulations. Information will be available in due course via the NHS BSA on the numbers of patients who receive care or treatment from national health service primary care dentists on one or more occasions within a given period of time. This will provide a measure that is broadly similar to that of patient registration under the former system of GDS. We expect the first information to be available later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.764W.0/1">If a dentist holds a national health service contract, misleading a patient about the range of treatments available is a breach of that contract. Where primary care trusts (PCTs) have evidence that a dentist has misled patients in this way there are a range of possible actions culminating potentially in termination of the dentist's NHS contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.0/2">The General Dental Council's (GDCs) guidance &quot;Maintaining Standards&quot; requires dentists, whether providing NHS services or not, to make clear to patients the nature of the contract and in particular whether the patient is being accepted for private or NHS treatment. Non-compliance with these standards potentially puts a dentist's GDC registration at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.0/3">Information for patients about NHS treatment and eligibility is widely available. Local information is held by each PCT. Many also run help lines dedicated to advising callers on how to access NHS dental services locally. At national level, NHS Direct can give callers information on their nearest dental practice offering NHS treatment. Patients can also access this information on line at NHS.UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.0/4">There are no plans to monitor the numbers of patients using private dental care. As with private medical care, this is a matter for the individual. However, access to NHS dental treatment is monitored. The first information following the reforms on the number of people accessing NHS dental services is expected to be available later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.765W.2/1">If a dentist holds a national health service contract, misleading a patient about the range of treatments available is a breach of that contract. Where primary care trusts have evidence that a dentist has misled patients in this way, there are a range of possible actions culminating potentially in termination of the dentist's NHS contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.2/2">The General Dental Council's (GDCs) guidance &quot;Maintaining Standards&quot; requires dentists, whether providing NHS services or not, to make clear to patients the nature of the contract and in particular whether the patient is being accepted for private or NHS treatment. Non-compliance with these standards potentially puts a dentist's GDC registration at risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.774W.8/1">The national rules scheme for homeopathic products was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-01">1 September 2006</phrase>. It complements current arrangements for the authorisation of homeopathic products used for minor symptoms or conditions within the tradition of homeopathy practiced in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.8/2">Before the introduction of the new scheme, homeopathic products either held product licences of right (PLRs) or were registered under a simplified scheme. PLR licences were issued to all medicinal products on the market at the time that the Medicines Act 1968 was implemented in 1971. Homeopathic PLRs are allowed to carry descriptions of the symptom or condition that the product is used to treat, called indications. In 1992 European Union legislation introduced a simplified scheme for homeopathic products, so-called because the safety and quality of products have to be demonstrated, but there is no requirement to demonstrate efficacy. The simplified scheme is restricted to products for oral and external use and does not allow indications.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.8/3">Products authorised under the new national rules scheme will comply with all the requirements placed on conventional medicines, with the exception of those relating to preclinical tests and clinical trials. This will enhance the information available to consumers on homeopathic products authorised under the new scheme while continuing to ensure their safety and quality. The new scheme will also enable products to carry indications for minor symptoms or conditions. In addition, over the next seven years the homeopathic PLRs will be reviewed.</p>

	<p pid="b.775W.5/1">Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug that is authorised in children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment should be under the supervision of a specialist in childhood behavioural disorders. Its safety is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in conjunction with other European regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.775W.5/2">Stimulants such as methylphenidate are recognised to cause cardiovascular adverse effects such as tachycardia or palpitations, (increased or fast heart rate), arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm), changes in blood pressure (usually increased) and angina. There are warnings about these potential risks in the United Kingdom (UK) product information for methylphenidate, which also states that these products should not be used in patients with certain heart conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.775W.5/3">Concerns have arisen about the risk of serious cardiovascular events (including sudden deaths) in association with stimulant treatment in children and adolescents with structural heart defects. Although it is recognised that some serious heart conditions alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, in the United States the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested that the product information for stimulant medications, including methylphenidate, be amended to reflect this risk and to advise that they should not be used in those with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities and also to strengthen warnings about the risk of other cardiovascular adverse effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.775W.5/4">The MHRA, with other European regulatory authorities, has also carefully evaluated the available data relating to the reports of sudden death in children with structural heart defects and taken into account the work of the United States FDA. As a result of these Europe wide discussions, the product information for methylphenidate is being updated accordingly to advise about serious cardiovascular adverse effects and to recommend that methylphenidate should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities. This will result in alignment of UK and European recommendations with those of the FDA.</p>

	<p pid="b.776W.5/4">An update document, SN 2001(06), was published in March 2001, which covered the potential interference with medical devices by TETRA radio systems employed by the emergency services and media broadcasts from hospital premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.776W.5/5">In July 2004 guidance on the MHRA website, which referenced DB 9702 and DB 1999(02), advised that healthcare providers should actively manage the use of radio frequency spectrum on their own sites, and consider the potential effects of communication equipment on all medical devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.776W.5/6">The most recent MHRA website advice published is &quot;Frequently asked questions on the use of mobile phones in hospitals&quot;. This has links to the other MHRA publications on the effects of mobile phones on medical equipment.</p>

We have set a target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by 2008 and each acute trust has its own target. The Department and its partner organisations have developed a range of mutually reinforcing activities that ensure combating the spread of MRSA is embedded in everyday procedures and policies, in particular:</p>
	<p pid="b.777W.2/2" class="indent">all acute trusts are signed-up to the &quot;Saving Lives&quot; package of best practice which, if implemented in full, should combat MRSA spread in the acute sector.

	<p pid="b.777W.2/8">The Department does not allocate specific funds to the NHS to tackle MRSA, as this is part of the NHS's mainstream activity. The MRSA/cleaner hospitals programme, which co-ordinates and resources actions and joint working aimed at delivering the target, including the provision of tailored support, spent &pound;1,300,000 in 2005-06 and has been allocated &pound;2,780,000 this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.779W.2/1">Baroness Morgan of Drefelin is leading work by a number of national patient organisations to develop national voices. In their recent publication, &quot;Are you being heard?&quot;, they stated that the project's basic function is to provide a mechanism for existing voices to come together for greater effect on policymaking at national level. The publication also states membership will be open to national organisations in the first instance but could perhaps open up to local organisation and individuals in the future.</p>

It is expected that the FBC will be available for the Department to review by the end of the year. Production of an FBC is in the normal course of business and is a step that must be taken by all trusts with PFI schemes in order to transparently demonstrate, among other aspects, that the capacity and affordability assumptions underpinning a scheme are robust. The particular concerns the FBC will need to address are that the future income generation assumptions from the release of assets consequent on the scheme are sound and, that bed number assumptions are compatible with the economy wide capacity planning being undertaken by the SHA.</p>

The Taliban and drug traffickers share a common interest in resisting the Afghan Government and coalition forces. The Taliban are also attempting to exploit the continued existence of the drugs trade to undermine the central Government's authority. Given these links we continue to monitor their development and to support the Afghan Government in disrupting them.</p>

	<p pid="b.796W.12/1">The 1975 Social Security Act required all occupational pension schemes to introduce pensions for widows who married their husbands after they retired from service. The change was introduced in April 1978 for future service only. The change for widowers was not introduced until April 1989. Widows of men who joined the armed forces after April 1978 and widowers of women who joined after 1989 are not affected by this issue and are eligible for pension benefits in respect of their entire service.</p>
	<p pid="b.796W.12/2">The Government Actuary confirmed a figure of &pound;50 million to extend benefits to all post-retirement widows and widowers in the armed forces pension scheme 1975 (AFPS 75) as part of the review which led to the introduction of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004. This figure should not be viewed in isolation: if the concession were to be made for affected members of AFPS 75, there would be pressure to extend it across other public sector pension schemes at an estimated cost of between &pound;300 million and &pound;500 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.796W.12/3">The cost for AFPS 75 represented the total capitalised value of future widows' and widowers' benefits which would be payable if marriages after leaving service were treated on the same basis as if the marriage had taken place in service. The value has been assessed using data relating to membership of pensioners and deferred pensioners of AFPS 75 and marriage patterns adopted for costing the scheme as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.797W.2/1">To meet the requirement for a medium protected patrol vehicle, a number of factors were taken into consideration. These included mine protection, vehicle capacity and payload, and the ability to be modified to meet the demanding UK protection requirements in the fastest possible time.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.2/2">A wide range of vehicles were briefly considered but discounted because we judged that they could not be modified to meet the UK requirement in the necessary timescale. Three options were considered in detail: the ADI Bushmaster, the BAES OMC RG-31 and the Cougar, which is manufactured by Force Protection Inc. The Cougar was selected and will be known as MASTIFF when in service with the United Kingdom armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.798W.2/1">The RG-31 Mamba was procured in the mid-late 1990s to meet Urgent Operational Requirements for specialist vehicles for use by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams in the Balkans. It was replaced in service by the Mine Protected Vehicle in 2001-02. The RG31 Mamba suffered from safety and reliability problems caused by the additional weight of the appliqu&eacute; armour affecting the vehicle's steering and braking systems. These problems were exacerbated by a lack of commonality between the vehicles, which were bought in three separate batches, and poor availability of spare parts.</p>

	<p pid="b.801W.2/1">The recently published report on the Defence Committee inquiry &quot;Educating Service Children&quot; (HC1054 published <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-06">6 September 2006</phrase>) has recommended research be conducted on the take-up of continuity of education allowance. The formal Government response to this report will be made shortly. I refer the hon. Member to the Third Memorandum from the MOD made to the Committee for their inquiry (HC1054 Ev77-78). This includes background on why the demographic profile of service personnel by age, rank and length of service will have an impact on take-up and explains that it may be more meaningful to consider the age of a child and their stage of education rather than the age/rank profile of a service person.</p>

	<p pid="b.802W.6/1">The Defence Logistics Organisation continues to work extremely hard to ensure that sufficient supplies and ammunition are delivered to our forces in Afghanistan. They ensure that in the vast majority of cases adequate re-supply to theatre takes place in a timely fashion.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.6/2">In the case of ammunition, there have been occasional instances where units in remote locations have exhausted supplies of a particular ammunition type during a specific attack or operation. At no time, though, have troops on the ground run out of all ammunition types available to them. In such instances, ground forces are re-supplied by helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.6/3">In the case of food supplies, most of our troops are fed to a very high standard by the Royal Logistic Corps. In some of the more remote locations this service will not always be available. In such instances, troops are supplied with nutritious, fit-for-purpose ration packs, which can also be augmented by local supplies.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.6/4">It is departmental policy that all troops deploying to Op HERRICK are provided with enhanced combat body armour (ECBA) as standard. In addition, Kestrel and Osprey variants of body armour, which provide additional protection, are available against specific threats and for specific roles, such as top cover sentry duty. The current combination of ECBA, Osprey and Kestrel provides Commanders with a flexible system of personal protection so that personnel can conduct their tasks effectively, while retaining a level of protection commensurate with the threat assessment. Such flexibility is deemed important because Commanders need to balance the benefits of increased protection body armour against risks such as constraint of movement.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.5/2">The UK remains firmly committed to our membership of both the Organisation Conjointe de Coop&eacute;ration en Matiere D'Armement (OCCAR) and the European Defence Agency (EDA). These two organisations have differing purposes and memberships, and complement each other.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.5/3">OCCAR is a project management organisation, managing a number of collaborative armament acquisition programmes, including the A400M programme. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK are members. OCCAR programmes are open to participation by non-member nations.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.5/4">The EDA does not manage collaborative acquisition programmes. It works to promote and enhance such collaboration, by providing contractual services for collaborative research projects, through the identification of common military requirements, and by improving the transparency of the European Defence Equipment Market. All EU member states except Denmark are members of the EDA, and there is also an administrative agreement with Norway, enabling their involvement in EDA facilitated projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.806W.5/5" class="indent">A competition has been launched under the Private Finance Initiative, joint with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, for the provision of a UK-based peacetime helicopter Search and Rescue capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.5/6" class="indent">A programme of work, known as the Lift Advanced Concept Phase, is being undertaken to determine how best to invest further in the battlefield helicopter Lift capability, including the balance between Medium and Large lift aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.5/7" class="indent">On Chinook Mk3, we continue to work with Boeing to identify a robust, affordable and value for money approach before taking decisions on how best to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.5/8" class="indent">The Apache Attack Helicopter is presently being successfully deployed on operations and work is ongoing to determine how this capability can be best sustained through-life, including investigations to extend the out-of-service date of the aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.5/9">We also keep under constant review how best to sustain and refresh the helicopter capability provided to operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.5/10">In addition, we are also pursuing work with a number of helicopter suppliers to implement revised and novel arrangements to support our current platforms through long-term, partnered contracts that require industry to provide serviceable aircraft at the front line. These arrangements have already been contracted for Sea King, Merlin and Chinook aircraft. Similar arrangements are being explored for other aircraft and we intend to focus efforts on ensuring convergence and that lessons are learnt, shared and implemented.</p>

	<p pid="b.811W.6/1">It is not possible to provide details of how many personnel in each unit stationed in Iraq speak Arabic or have received formal Arabic language education as the information is not held centrally and to collate the information would be at disproportionate cost. However, PJHQ have identified a formal requirement for 30 official interpreters. These are both civilian contractors and military personnel. I should stress this does not include locally employed personnel, many of whom provide interpretation and translation services and those individuals who might speak Arabic but are not official interpreters.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.6/2">In terms of troops receiving Arabic instruction, there are three courses specialising in Iraqi language training open to troops prior to deployment to Iraq; Survival Standard (one soldier per sub-unit/four gunners per squadron), Basic Patrol Arabic (Junior Commanders and soldiers) and Operational Linguist. Details of those deployed to Iraq that have undertaken this training is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.811W.6/3">All personnel deploying to Iraq will receive some form of language training in the form of their unit level pre-deployment training, known as Cascade training. Once deployed, further continuation training for all ranks is conducted. In addition, every soldier is issued with a language card which is taught during pre-deployment training.</p>

The 'Green Book' provides details of how correspondents should apply for operational media assignments. Applications for operational assignments are assessed on a case by case basis and decisions to approve applications are based on a range of factors, such as the ability of the military to facilitate the media visit. The MOD aims at all times to ensure a fair and balanced approach by ensuring that a wide a variety of responsible media organisations are represented.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-11-06b.91288.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-11-06b.812W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" colnum="812W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061106/text/61106w0029.htm#06110740000682">
	<p pid="b.812W.6/1">The MOD uses the Medical Employment Standard (MES) as the main measure of outcome of its medical treatment including for mental health. The MES gives an indication of the employability of Service patients from the beginning (diagnosis) through to the end of their care pathway. The MES is derived from a medical assessment of the patient's illness, the treatment course required and various occupational factors. The MES indicates whether the Service person can carry out full service, serve in some restricted form/role for a temporary period or, in some cases, a permanent basis or whether they should be discharged from the Service on medical grounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.6/2">With regard to outcomes, in the majority of cases, personnel treated at the MOD's Departments of Community Mental Health are able to return to Service. Medical discharge rates for mental health conditions are low&mdash;out of 2000 personnel medically discharged annually from the UK armed forces, only about 150 will have a mental health problem. Of these, 20-25 will meet the criteria to be diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.6/3">With regard to veterans, upon leaving the armed forces or on demobilisation for reservists it is the long established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. This has been the case since 1948 under successive Governments. Responsibility for assessment of mental healthcare for veterans provided by the NHS rests with the UK Health Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.6/4">For veterans who are also war pensioners, under the War Pensions Scheme the MOD has a discretionary power to meet the cost of any necessary expenses in respect of the medical, surgical or rehabilitative treatment of ex-members of the armed forces that arise wholly or mainly arise as a result of the disablement due to service, before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. It cannot be used to fund treatment provided under other UK legislation. Where appropriate &quot;remedial treatment&quot; at homes run by the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society (Combat Stress) is funded by this route for pensioned psychological conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.6/5">Over the last few years research evidence of effective best practice treatment and interventions for mental health disorders has been published and officials of MOD, the UK Health Departments and Combat Stress are currently working to develop and implement a new community mental health service for veterans. This will involve public, private and charitable providers working together to deliver evidence based interventions and will be subject to appropriate clinical governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.6/6">In addition, the department recently announced that reservists demobilised since January 2003 will be entitled to a mental health assessment by Defence Medical Services personnel, and out-patient treatment if appropriate. A further announcement will be made later this year to confirm the details of the service that will be provided including the location(s) at which the assessments will be provided, and the date on which the service will commence.</p>

	<p pid="b.818W.2/13">The use of animals is only a very small aspect of the overall military research programme. The role of Dstl protecting the UK and its armed forces requires it to answer questions and develop solutions to problems that cannot currently be addressed without the use of animals in research. The use of animals is only undertaken if there is no suitable non-animal system which can be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.818W.2/14">Dstl continually seeks alternatives to working with animals and specifically addresses ways in which animal use can be reduced and refined.</p>
	<p pid="b.818W.2/15">Dstl pays particular attention to the relative strengths and weaknesses of different animal models. Species selection is a critical feature in optimising the confidence with which animal-derived data can be extrapolated to man. Non-human primates are reserved for pivotal bridging studies designed to answer questions primarily concerned with nervous system function, behaviour and aspects of immunology.</p>
	<p pid="b.818W.2/16">Over the last five years non-human primates (marmosets or rhesus monkeys) have been involved in research:</p>

	<p pid="b.821W.5/1">The armed forces pension schemes are final salary based, non-contributory, contracted-out occupational pension schemes open to most members of the armed forces. The MOD does, however, make a substantial contribution into the schemes each year for current members, currently the overall contribution equates to 24.8 per cent. of the armed forces pay bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.5/2">The non-contributory nature of the schemes was last reviewed as part of the major overhaul of the schemes which were introduced through the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004. The Government decided against an employee's contribution at that time because of the complexity of introducing a contributory scheme alongside a non contributory scheme, the administrative complexity and the cost of the change, the impact on personnel of issuing different rates of pay for the same job and the effect on morale, recruitment and retention (HC1155 dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-25">25 July 2002</phrase>). The changes made as a result of the review addressed the matter of long term affordability, such as increases in longevity, by rebalancing the provision to take account of modern pension practices and legislative change, and by changing the preserved pension ages.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.5/3">The Armed Forces Pay Review Body, in their recommendations on the total remuneration package for the armed forces, makes an adjustment to comparator earnings figures to take account of the higher relative value of the armed forces pension scheme benefits against that of pension schemes of comparator private sector organisations. The non-contributory nature of the scheme is one of the factors taken in to account. The level of the adjustment made is currently 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.5/4">The MOD has not previously made an estimate of the annual revenue yield from introducing an employee contribution of 6 per cent. Taking the armed forces pay bill for 2005-06 as a basis for the calculation, a 6 per cent. employee contribution would equate to &pound;342 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.822W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence fully publicised Project Haven in the national media and in ex-service organisations publications, along with information on our websites. All material advised how an individual could make a claim to correct their tax status. In Project Scribe there was no national media campaign; however, information about the error regarding Armed Forces Pension Scheme invaliding pensions, was sent to all individuals who were in receipt of a War Pensions Scheme disablement pension, widows or widowers pension, in the form of a &quot;War Pensions Newsletter&quot;. This group of pensioners were at risk and therefore they were advised how to make a claim. In addition, information was posted on our websites, and towards the end of the review ex-service organisations kindly published details about the error and how to make a claim in their publications.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.2/2">In both projects individuals were not invited to make a claim for compensation but to contact the Department to correct the tax status or level of their pension and claim any back payments of pension or tax. Once an individual had been identified as receiving incorrect payments etc. interest was paid in accordance with Government Accounting and HM Revenue and Customs rules and additional recompense as agreed by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.2/3">This publicity was considered the most appropriate at the time the errors were established and during the review period. There are no plans to increase the level of awareness for Projects Haven and Scribe as we are confident that we have identified all those affected and have made the necessary corrections plus interest and compensation payments where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.2/4">The criteria for the payment of compensation in Project Haven and Scribe was set out in written ministerial statements on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 130WS, and <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-15">15 June 2004</phrase>, <i> Official Report, </i>column 26WS, respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.2/5">In his written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 60-61WS, my predecessor reported that some 5,500 pension awards under both projects had been corrected at a cost of &pound;32.4 million plus some &pound;18.2 million paid in compensation. Approximately 1,600 individuals whose pension or tax status was corrected did not receive compensation. There are a number of reasons why an individual may not have received compensation, for example, an individual's pension was recorded as &quot;taxable&quot;, however, as the value of the pension was below the tax threshold, they had not paid tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.822W.2/6">The Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) was responsible for assessing the entitlement to compensation in each case according to the methodology set by the Department. There are no independent procedures in place to ensure that the individual's assessment is correct; however, AFPAA's own internal project team undertook an audit on a proportion of the cases. The compensation methodology was available to all individuals and if an individual considers that this has not been followed AFPAA will investigate and provide a detailed breakdown of the compensation. Likewise where an individual has not received compensation and they consider that they should have, the appeal will be considered initially under the Department's statutory Internal Dispute Resolution procedures. Following this appeal route an individual may seek the services of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service and the pensions ombudsman, both of whom are independent.</p>

	<p pid="b.824W.3/1">The two key outputs of the Defence Medical Services (DMS) are medical support to deployed operations, and the provision of health care to the armed forces to ensure that the maximum possible numbers of armed forces personnel are fit for purpose. The DMS will continue to deliver both outputs, working where appropriate with coalition partners, the NHS, private health care providers and the charity sector. The DMS have met all operational requirements placed on them. Medical support to deployed operations is absolutely vital and there is no question of British forces deploying on military operations without the appropriate medical support.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.3/2">The current official, formally endorsed DMS manning requirement figures were drawn up as a consequence of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in 1998. Since then, however, overall defence planning assumptions have changed and DMS manning requirement figures have evolved. In order to support the defence planning assumptions contained within Defence Strategic Guidance 03, the Defence Medical Capability (DMC) Phase 2 Study was carried out. The DMC study produced interim revised DMS manning requirement figures which more accurately reflect defence planning assumptions and have thus overtaken the SDR figures. Indeed, the Ministry of Defence has previously released elements of the interim revised manning requirements, in anticipation of a new definitive set of figures (as in a previous answer to the hon. Member for the Forest of Dean on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1402W).</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.3/3">However, the DMC figures are themselves only interim. The overall DMS manning requirement is currently under review against the strategic requirement, and the figures will change. I anticipate that new endorsed DMS manning requirement figures will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.3/4">The following table show the manning levels as at July 2006 in the specialties of general medical practitioners, nurses and dental officers (requirement figures shown are the SDR figures and the DMC figures, but as explained, these are being revised):</p>

In addition, pre-deployment planning covers social and cultural issues, including specific gender issues that should be taken into account. The MOD has also commissioned an audit of the existing training provision, against both the resolution itself and the training outcomes identified in the UN's own training package on the resolution. The results of the audit should allow us to show more clearly how training is compliant, while also helping us identify any further training needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.830W.11/1">Total Managed Expenditure (TME), the Government's preferred measure of expenditure drawn from the National Accounts, nets employee pension contributions off gross expenditure on pensions paid. This means that an increase in employee contribution rates without any commensurate increase in salaries or pension benefits would reduce TME. Government receipts, which finance TME, are unaffected by pension contributions, as these net off within TME.</p>
	<p pid="b.830W.11/2">Contributions that employees make to funded public service pension schemes, such as the Local Government Pension Scheme and funded pension schemes in the wider public sector, are treated as income to the individual funds and are not netted off in TME as described above.</p>

The participating Departments purchase at least 2.5 per cent. of their extramural R and D from SMEs. The value of contracts made with SMEs was &pound;269.1 million, representing 10.6 per cent. of the baseline budget. SBRI figures for 2005-06 will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.835W.0/2">Developing effective Afghan National Security Forces is crucial to lasting stability in Afghanistan. So far, good progress has been made, with the Afghan Minister for Defence recently stating that there are now 34,000 officers, NCOs and soldiers in the Afghan National Army (ANA). The ANA is ethnically balanced and well trained, factors that contribute to the high regard it is held in by the population. Those troops deployed in Helmand have fought bravely and effectively alongside our own, enduring considerable sacrifice in pursuit of their own country's security. ANA leadership and capabilities are developing well but it will take time and continued support before they are ready to take on this task independently.</p>

	<p pid="b.835W.3/1">The Algerian people voted for the 'Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation' in a referendum in 2005. The Charter, which came into force in February 2006, granted an amnesty to those convicted of terrorist offences or who were prepared to surrender themselves to the security services. The amnesty also extended to government security forces. More than 2,000 terrorist prisoners have since been released under the Charter. In addition the Charter provides for the families of victims of terrorism to register the disappearance or death of their relative and obtain compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.835W.3/2">The EU issued a statement when the Charter was adopted welcoming the participation of the Algerian people in the referendum and expressing the hope that Algeria will achieve lasting peace and reconciliation, based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and ongoing consultations with its citizens.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary met Foreign Minister Li in September and underlined the importance of UK-China partnership on the challenges of achieving climate and energy security. She did not address specifically emissions from underground coal fire, but she did address how to meet China's energy efficiency and security interests. Discussions were focussed on how to reduce CO2 emissions through the deployment of clean technology for burning coal, such as carbon capture and storage and the UK funded initiative to demonstrate near zero emissions coal in China.</p>

As part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) outreach activities to widen and deepen its policy engagement with UK regions and faith communities to help deliver the UK's international strategic priorities, we visit areas with significant minority ethnic communities where we meet UK civil society, including local businessmen and women and attend events organised by them. A wide range of people, including representatives of local businesses, are invited to attend events such as seminars in different areas of the UK, aimed at raising awareness of what the FCO does and why it matters. The FCO has also been represented at various ethnic business awards ceremonies held in London but attended by representatives of regional businesses. One of the objectives for all these events is to try to break down stereotypes of FCO staff and to encourage applications which will make our work force more diverse. Events involving business/faith for the period 2005-06 to date (the period for which figures are available) are listed as follows. More than one event was scheduled on certain days, in the interests of value for money. FCO officials could provide further information on outreach on request from my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="b.844W.8/1">The nature of Iran's nuclear programme, its history of concealment, its continuing failure to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its refusal to take the steps required by the IAEA Board and UN Security Council have all contributed to international concern that its ambitions may not be, as it claims, solely peaceful.</p>

While Iran's enrichment activities would also help it develop the capability to produce fissile material suitable for use as fuel in power reactors, Iran has no production technology that would enable it to manufacture fuel from any enriched material, nor&mdash;with the exception of a reactor being built at Bushehr, for which Russia is contracted to supply fuel for 10 years&mdash;any power reactors (operational or in construction) requiring fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.844W.8/3">The IAEA Director General, Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei, has produced regular reports since 2003 on Iran's nuclear programme. They have outlined serious outstanding questions that Iran needs to resolve. These include: how Iran came to possess and what use it made of a document on casting uranium hemispheres, whose only application is in nuclear weapons; why Iran conducted experiments on Polonium 210, which has virtually no civil use but can be used as a neutron initiator in nuclear weapons; why Iran's military has been involved in what it claims is a purely civil programme; and why Iran is constructing a heavy water research reactor for which there is little apparent civil need, yet which would be ideally suited for the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. Successive IAEA reports have made clear that Iran is failing to co-operate fully in answering these questions.

	<p pid="b.847W.5/1">Our embassy in Chisinau reports regularly on the political and economic situation in Moldova. We have also seen recent reports from the International Monetary Fund and the Economist Intelligence Unit on the Moldovan economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.5/2">Economic growth has slowed recently due to the impact of sharp increases in the gas price, and the continuing ban on wine exports to Russia. Despite these factors, we expect Moldova to achieve modest growth of 3 per cent. in 2006, down from 6 per cent. predicted earlier in the year, followed by a slight recovery in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.5/3">Moldova remains heavily dependent on remittances from Moldovans working overseas. Currently estimated at roughly US $l billion, remittances account for over 30 per cent. of gross domestic product (GDP), and through import taxes provided some 56 per cent. of the state budget. This has enabled the Government to run fiscal surpluses over the last few years, amounts they have used for repaying the principles on their debt. On the downside, this has meant significant proportion of the Moldovan labour force is productively employed outside of the country, leading to serious shortages in skilled labour.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.5/4">Moldova's debt remains high, but has fallen sharply in recent years from 100 per cent. of GDP in 2001, to 55 per cent. in 2005. In addition, Moldova received debt treatment from the Paris Club in early 2006, which has reduced debt service to the Paris Club by nearly 60 per cent.. The UK is not a creditor. The total stock of debt looks set to continue to decline over the next few years, despite the slowdown in economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.5/5">While generally sound fiscal and monetary policies are being pursued by the authorities, inflation has accelerated to 14 per cent. year-on-year on the back of continuing high remittances, rapid increases in real wages, increasing funds from donors and hikes in energy prices. As both remittances and gas prices are likely to rise again next year, the amount of disinflation the authorities will be able to achieve during 2007 will be limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.5/6">The combined effect of the wine ban and the gas price increase, however, means that we expect to see a worsening of Moldova's external position, with its current account deficit set to rise to around 18 per cent. of GDP in 2006, up from 5.6 per cent. in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.848W.5/1">We understand that following irresponsible accusations in recent weeks in the Sri Lankan media of partisanship, and the apparent failure of the Sri Lankan government to regularise the status of their in-country staff, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) felt unable to operate safely in the Jaffna peninsula and withdrew from the area in mid-October. Given the security and humanitarian situation in Jaffna, where it is reported that over 50,000 of the civilian population has been displaced, and the wide international recognition of the impartial work of MSF in conflict areas this is regrettable. Our High Commission in Colombo raised concerns about MSF's position with Sri Lankan government ministers in early October.</p>
	<p pid="b.848W.5/2">The withdrawal of MSF will unfortunately have a severe impact in the north of the Jaffna peninsula where there is already a shortage of basic medical services and supplies and patients may now have to travel to Jaffna city itself for medical treatment. We continue to urge all parties to allow relief workers and essential supplies access to all conflict affected areas to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the continuing violence.</p>

	<p pid="b.863W.9/2">The Government consulted on this proposal in their publication &quot;Control of Noise from Civil Aircraft&quot; before &quot;The Future of Air Transport White Paper&quot; in 2003. Our conclusion, following consultation, was that such involvement of local authorities in small airports' noise control measures would be too bureaucratic. Not all local authorities in which an airport is situated would be resourced to take a fully informed view of an airport's proposals; there may also be conflicts between the interests of the authority that played host to the airport, and other neighbouring authorities whose residents were also affected by the presence of the airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.863W.9/3">However, it is possible for airports voluntarily to enter into binding agreements with local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.874W.0/1">The estimated number of qualified home inspectors required after June 2007 to satisfy demand, on a full time equivalent basis would be approximately 2,200. Based on the range of current industry working practises, this means between 2,500 to 4,500 individual Home Inspectors would be required.</p>

	<p pid="b.874W.3/1">The price of the pack will be determined by the market, not Government. For the purposes of preparing the RIA published in June we have assumed that costs will be similar to costs currently charged for similar products, although we expect competition and innovation will lead to a reduction in these prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.3/2">The full Home Condition Report (HCR) will be similar in content the existing mid-range survey on the market, The Homebuyers Survey and Valuation, which costs about &pound;400 plus VAT on average across the country as a whole. The actual cost of the HCR will be determined by the market and this will depend, as now, on the size, condition and location of the property. We expect competition in the market to ensure that costs are held down.</p>

Therefore home inspectors will still be needed and job opportunities for home inspectors remain for those who have undertaken training.

The modelling took into account rising incomes over the period and this analysis contributed to the decision to set an ambition to increase housing supply to a level of 200,000 annual net additions by 2016. It looked at long term prices, rather than short term pressures in individual locations.

	<p pid="b.879W.1/1">The Social HomeBuy scheme is a new programme for secure and assured tenants of participating local authorities and housing associations. To qualify individuals must have been public sector tenants for at least two years (five years for tenancies granted on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January 2005</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.1/2">Four housing associations (Notting Hill Housing Trust, Guinness Trust, Sovereign Housing Group and Places for People) and one local authority, the London borough of Southwark has begun to pilot the new Social HomeBuy scheme. The pilots were launched in late 2005 by inviting expressions of interest. The next stage was for landlords to supply key information to the potential purchasers who had expressed an interest on property values and likely costs, so that they could decide whether they wished to make a formal application. The first applications and sales are now starting to come through. Transactions typically take longer than house sales because landlords also carry out affordability checks to ensure purchasers can sustain home ownership. Over 150 applications are in the pipeline, with five sales completed and more expected shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.1/3">Of the five sales completed so far, three have been in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, one was in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the remaining one was in Chorley in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.1/4">A further 38 housing associations intend to offer the Social HomeBuy scheme from April 2007. The names of these housing associations are set out as follows. In addition the Housing Corporation announced details on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase> of a further bidding round for housing associations to be funded to offer the scheme which will start on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October</phrase>. A number of local authorities in London and elsewhere are also working up plans for pilots.</p>

There are reported to be 4,470 home inspector candidates who are either in, or have completed their training.</p>
	<p pid="b.881W.3/2">A report commissioned by the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and carried out by National Energy Services concluded that there is also a potential pool of suitably skilled individuals prepared to undergo training and become qualified as domestic energy assessors, who could produce EPCs. Training courses offering such a qualification are expected to be available in early 2007, with candidates able to qualify in time for June 2007. Therefore there are plenty of available candidates to prevent a shortage or any impact on the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.885W.8/1">The current national statutory overcrowding standards (the Room Standard and the Space Standard) are set out in Part X of the Housing Act 1985 which restates standards that have remained unchanged since 1935. Under the Housing Act a dwelling is overcrowded if either of the standards is contravened:</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.8/2" class="indent">The Room Standard is breached if two people of opposite sexes who are not living together as husband and wife must sleep in the same room. Living rooms and kitchens as well as bedrooms can be treated as available sleeping accommodation. Children under 10 do not count.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.8/3" class="indent">The Space Standard specifies the number of people who may sleep in a dwelling according to the number of rooms and their floor area. Two calculations are required and the lower number applies. Babies under one year do not count, and children under 10 count as half.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.8/4">The Government have recently consulted on updating the statutory standards. Recent estimates of overcrowding based on the statutory standard are not available because the underlying data is not collected systematically. A one-off estimate was made in 2003 that there were approximately 20,000 households across the whole of England that were in conditions of overcrowding that breached the statutory standard. This estimate was based on data from the Survey of English Housing for the period 2000-01 to 2002-03 and from the 2001 English House Condition Survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.8/5">The Bedroom Standard has been used as the statistical benchmark (for example, in the Survey of English Housing) for measuring overcrowding since the 1960s. It differs considerably from the statutory standards. About 525,000 households are currently overcrowded by the Bedroom Standard. This is about 2.5 per cent. of households.</p>
	<p pid="b.885W.8/6">DCLG uses both the statutory standards, the bedrooms standards, as well as other indicators of housing stress, such as rates of temporary accommodation, to inform decisions about resources for additional housing supply.</p>

However, the final decision on the number of proposals that will be implemented will depend crucially on the content of local authority submissions and the potential impact on public expenditure totals if these proposals were approved. This expected maximum number would not preclude the Government from deciding to implement more if they offered good value for money and were affordable.</p>

	<p pid="b.900W.5/1">The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) holds limited information about heating in domestic properties. When arriving at a banding for council tax purposes the presence or absence of heating would only be relevant in those comparatively rare cases where this would significantly affect the property's value. The Automated Valuation Model, developed for the (now postponed) 2007 revaluation, does not therefore treat the presence or absence of heating as a significant factor. The VGA's records provide for the recording of this information if it becomes available. At present fewer than 0.1 per cent. of properties are recorded as not having heating.</p>

PPS10 requires all planning authorities to prepare and deliver planning strategies that help deliver sustainable development though driving waste management up the waste hierarchy, with a preference for reduction, re-use, recycling and composting, using waste as source of energy and, where these are not practicable, only looking to disposal as the last option to be considered. PPS10 requires that where disposal of waste has to take place planning authorities should enable this in one of the nearest appropriate installations. It also advises that when selecting sites suitable for waste management facilities, authorities should assess them against the capacity of existing and potential transport infrastructure to support the sustainable movement of waste, and products arising from resource recovery, seeking where practicable and beneficial to use modes other I than road transport.</p>

	<p pid="b.901W.3/1">The International Energy Agency estimates that about 2.4 billion people worldwide depend on traditional biomass such as charcoal, wood and straw to meet their daily household cooking and heating needs. This is often burnt inefficiently and is a source of indoor smoke pollution. It causes ill-health, especially for women and children who tend to receive most exposure. The World Health Organisation estimates that 1.5 million deaths a year in developing countries are attributable to indoor smoke, with millions more suffering from chronic respiratory illness. Solutions include more efficient cooking stoves, cleaner fuels and proper ventilation. Changes in behaviour through better awareness of the dangers can also make a significant difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.3/2">According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), air pollution and possibly second-hand tobacco smoke are to blame for an estimated 42 per cent. of lower respiratory infections in developing countries. The UK has pledged to increase its share for the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), providing approximately &pound;140 million over the next four years. The GEF supports sustainable energy and transportation initiatives that reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.3/3">However, lower respiratory infections in developing countries are mainly associated with indoor air pollution related largely to household solid fuel use. The International Energy Agency estimates that about 2.4 billion people worldwide depend on traditional biomass such as charcoal, wood and straw to meet their daily household cooking and heating needs. The smoke produced causes ill-health, especially for women and children who tend to receive most exposure. Around 1.5 million deaths a year occur in developing countries attributable to indoor smoke, with millions more suffering from chronic respiratory illness. The solutions include improved more efficient cooking stoves, cleaner fuels and proper ventilation. Changes in use behaviour through better awareness of the dangers can also make a significant difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.3/4">DFID is the second largest contributor to the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP). We have made core contributions to ESMAP of &pound;0.5 million in each of the last four years. In 2002, we agreed with the Bank that household fuel and health be taken up as a major theme. As a result, the programme has worked in five developing countries, looking at health impacts, improved cooking stoves and cleaner fuels. An example is DFID funding in 2002 of approximately &pound;0.5 million for an ESMAP programme in four provinces in China on new stove and ventilation technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.3/5">The UK also supports the work of Practical Action (previously the Intermediate Technology Development Group), the Partnership on Clean Indoor Air (PCIA) and the Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP). These include programmes that aim to improve energy access and reduce the huge environmental costs of solid fuels.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.2/1">There is no single model for the structure and activities of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan. This is largely due to the number of different nationalities involved in managing PRTs: there are currently 24 PRTs (25 as of <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase> when Turkey establishes itself in Wardak) involving 25 nations. Since the concept began in 2002, there has been limited strategic guidance from the Government of Afghanistan or the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) as to the role or mandate of PRTs and individual nations have interpreted approaches independently. However, the recent expansion of ISAF has brought a considerable improvement in coherence and consistency, and regular PRT workshops have proven useful ways to share best practice and learn lessons.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.2/2">In July 2005 DFID commissioned the King's Fund to conduct a review of the UK's involvement in Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan. This review involved field visits to the PRTs in Bamyan, Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-Sharif, as well as extensive interviews in Kabul and Bagram Airbase. The review concluded that the sheer number of PRTs operating in Afghanistan made it hard to form a single conclusion on their effectiveness or impact. The review highlighted the variation in national interpretation, of the PRT mandate, with significant differentials in PRTs approaches to development, funding allocations, and combinations of civilian and military personnel. The Kings Fund highlighted that PRTs naturally adopt a different emphasis from each other, shaped by the political environment and the PRT internal institutional context.</p>
	<p pid="b.902W.2/3">ISAF has recently prepared a PRT Handbook which is undergoing final revision and has worked hard to enhance consistency across PRTs in future. We have contacted ISAF to find whether a broader assessment has been made on the social and economic impact of PRTs nationally. No such data is currently available.</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.5/1">The UK Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) (referred to in answer, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1887W to which DFID has committed &pound;4 million) is managed by the Helmand Executive Group, consisting of members of four UK Government Departments, with financial accountability resting with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK has deployed a Quick Impact Project Manager to Helmand to manage the GCPP financial systems on behalf of all Government Departments. DFID has deployed one Development Adviser to work alongside other Government Departments in Helmand province.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.5/2">The &pound;30 million committed to the Helmand Agricultural Rural Development Programme (HARDP) is implemented by the Government of Afghanistan. This is an important way of strengthening Government systems and building effective state institutions that will be able to continue to meet Afghanistan's development needs. This is managed by the three-person Livelihoods Team in Kabul, who work closely with the Ministry of Reconstruction and Rural Development (MRRD) and the Ministry of Finance in Kabul to ensure proper implementation. In the delivery of HARDP all procurement for services is undertaken by the Ministry of Reconstruction and Rural Development (MRRD) using recently adopted Government of Afghanistan procedures, which are based on World Bank procurement best practice. MRRD is responsible for identification, selection and appointment of Facilitating Partners. This is carried out through a competitive bidding process.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.5/3">DFID funds are channelled through Crown Agents Financial Services Limited (CAFSL). The Ministry of Finance and MRRD will be required to provide annual audited statements by the Government of Afghanistan Auditor General, with copies to DFID. This will provide assurance that the funds are transferred for the purposes specified in the agreement with the Government of Afghanistan. The existing National Priority Programmes were set up following international accounting and auditing procedures, and there are oversight mechanisms already in place which will provide adequate reassurance that fiduciary risks are being managed.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.5/4">Referring to the &pound;3 million funding to the Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF), this is similarly managed by DFID Afghanistan. Lead agencies implementing projects under RALF (i.e. Mercy Corps implementing the Restorative Agriculture and Rural Economy (RARE) Research Project in Helmand) account to the International Centre for Agriculture and Rural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) on utilisation of project funds. ICARDA account for utilisation of programme funds (including funds allocated to individual projects) to DFID, reporting on a six monthly basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.5/1">Globally, around 800 million people do not get enough to eat. Malnutrition is a factor in over half the under-5 deaths in developing countries, 150 million children under 5 are underweight. More than 20 million low birth weight (LBW) babies are born each year. LBW babies are more likely to die in infancy, suffer from stunted growth, and ultimately suffer reduced working ability and earnings as adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/2">DFID is working with developing countries and the international community to reduce hunger and improve livelihoods. One way to do this is through supporting programmes that help increase the amount and availability of food that people produce in poor countries. This increases the food supply and in turn lowers prices. This helps those very poor people who rely on the market to get access to cheaper food. Between 2004-05, the UK provided nearly &pound;124 million in direct support to agriculture in poor countries. DFID is also working to improve child health by improving access to basic services such as health, education and water and sanitation, by promoting critical investment in infrastructure, such as clinics, clean water and market access roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/3">340 million new cases of largely treatable sexually transmitted infections occur annually, 100 million of them among young people. 58 million people are infected with HIV. 20 million have died, and in sub-Saharan Africa it is the leading cause of death. Women and young people are particularly vulnerable. Fewer than one in five people at risk have access to prevention information. Improving sexual and reproductive health through improved information, services and commodity supplies is among the most cost-effective of all development investments and is central to DFID's strategy. It saves and improves lives, slows the spread of HIV and AIDS, reduces poverty and encourages gender equality. Changes in sexual behaviour through better awareness of the dangers can make a significant difference. DFID's &quot;Taking Action&quot; the UK strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world commits the UK to an increase in our spending to at least &pound;1.5 billion and offers financial and practical support to governments in improving treatment, care and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/4">The DFID-supported Joint Monitoring Programme of September 2006, estimated that spending to achieve the water MDG target needs to increase by one third and needs to double to achieve the sanitation target. These figures mask huge regional variations, with Ethiopia needing to increase its efforts in water by a factor of 13.5; DRC by 4.8 and Mozambique by 3.3 if the target is to be reached.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/5">This is why in the recent White paper, &quot;Making governance work for the poor&quot;, DFID committed to doubling our direct spending on water and sanitation in Africa to &pound;95 million per year by 2007-08 and more than doubling again to &pound;200 million per year by 2010-11. We are directly involved in seven African countries (Ethiopia, DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia), and through our funding of other agencies' programmes, including the World Bank, the EU and the African and Asian Development Banks, we reach many other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/6">We support the EU Water Initiative, which aims to make the aid provided by the EU member states more effective. EU member states provide the largest funding in the water sector to Africa. We also support the EU Water Facility, which through funding of &euro;230 million aims to make drinking water available to an additional 10 million people and basic sanitation to 5 million by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/7">The International Energy Agency estimates that about 2.4 billion people worldwide depend on traditional biomass such as charcoal, wood and straw to meet their daily household cooking and heating needs. This is often burnt inefficiently and is a source of indoor smoke pollution. It causes ill-health, especially for women and children who tend to receive most exposure. The World Health Organisation estimates that 1.5 million deaths a year in developing countries are attributable to indoor smoke, with millions more suffering from chronic respiratory illness. Solutions include improved more efficient cooking stoves, cleaner fuels and proper ventilation. Changes in behaviour through better awareness of the dangers can also make a significant difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/8">DFID is the second largest contributor to the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP). We have made core contributions to ESMAP of &pound;0.5 million in each of the last four years. In 2002, we agreed with the World Bank that household fuel and health be taken up as a major theme. As a result, the programme has worked in five developing countries, looking at health impacts, improved cooking stoves and cleaner fuels. An example is DFID funding in 2002 of approximately &pound;0.5m for an ESMAP programme in four provinces in China on new stove and ventilation technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/9">The UK also supports the work of Practical Action (previously the Intermediate Technology Development Group), the Partnership on Clean Indoor Air (PCIA) and the Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP). These include programmes that aim to improve energy access and reduce the huge environmental costs of solid fuels.</p>

	<p pid="b.911W.5/1">Many countries have succeeded in improving the health and well-being of children. However the number of children dying before their fifth birthday remains high. In 1980 an estimated 13 million children died each year; over two decades later in 2004 this figure had reduced to 10.5 million deaths in childhood. Unfortunately where least progress has been made is in saving the lives of newborns&mdash;40 per cent. of all childhood deaths take place in the first 28 days of life, and most of these in the first day or week of life. If current trends continue, Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 will not be achieved until 2045&mdash;over 30 years late.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.5/2">Most child deaths are preventable and could be avoided by delivering basic services and supplies to families, young people and communities. For example: improving water supplies and sanitation; increasing the use of mosquito repellent bed nets to protect children from malaria; improving maternal health care, increasing emphasis on breastfeeding and improved nutrition and immunisation programmes. Improving access to basic health services requires that hospitals and health centres have well-trained doctors, nurses and midwives as well as the medicines and equipment to do their job.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.5/3">The health of babies and children can also be improved by preventing HIV infection in girls and women and by making sure that HIV infected women have access to treatment and care in pregnancy, child birth and beyond. The UK Government's view is that improving the health of children (MDG 4) goes hand in hand with improving the health of their mothers (MDG 5).</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.5/4">The UK wants to make faster progress towards both these MDGs. We are working with many countries, including India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Nigeria to achieve this. In Kenya, DFID committed &pound;19.6 million to a programme providing 11 million bed nets treated with insecticide. They will be available to over 75 per cent. of the vulnerable population by 2007-08, allowing them to sleep safely and free from malaria. It is estimated that the lives of 167,000 children will be saved as a result. In Bangladesh, maternal health is the first objective of a new US$ 4.3 billion health sector-wide programme which DFID is contributing &pound;100 million over five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.5/5">DFID also contributes to global projects such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) which could save the lives of five million children by 2015, and a further five million after that as they are immunised. The UK has promised $2.6 billion (&pound;1.3 billion).</p>

	<p pid="b.912W.2/1">DFID has undertaken four major IT projects since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.2/2">The Human Resource system had a projected supplier cost at tender of &pound;1.18 million and was due to be implemented in 30 months. The first four modules were implemented in 36 months at a total supplier cost of &pound;1.22 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.2/3">The HR system project was superseded by an HR Transformation project which aims to radically change the way HR services are delivered and improve people management. The HR Transformation project was initiated in March 2005 and has a budget of &pound;6.5 million. It is primarily a business change project but it includes enhancements to the existing HR system and a number of smaller IT enabled components. The planned completion date is March 2008. The project is currently on track to deliver to time and budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.2/4">The contract for the Quest Electronic Document and Records Management project was signed in March 2004. The main rollout was originally estimated to be completed in December 2005. Detailed planning carried out in early 2005 led to a revised target date of March 2006, which was met. The projected supplier base cost at tender was &pound;8.98 million. The projected total supplier cost is now &pound;11.52 million, which includes implementation of a number of options available under the original contract but not included in the base cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.2/5">The Aries Finance, Procurement and Reporting System, had a projected base supplier cost at tender of &pound;11 million and is due to be implemented in 36 months.

	<p pid="b.912W.2/6">DFID has also undertaken a number of small IT related projects. However, our central records do not distinguish IT contracts, so provision of details for all of these projects would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.2/1">DFID's involvement in the assessment and management of the impacts of large-scale mining projects on all vulnerable groups&mdash;including women, children, indigenous peoples and the poor&mdash;is indirect. We aim to influence the development of the systems and procedures used by the international financial institutions, in which we are 'shareholders'. They do invest directly in such projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/2">DFID has not itself undertaken specific assessments on the impact of large-scale mining on women, indigenous peoples or equity in developing countries, but is working to ensure effective systems are in place internationally to do this.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/3">We recognise that women, indigenous peoples and the poor can be disproportionately affected by negative social and environmental impacts of all scales of mining, large and small, and can be excluded from the economic benefits. As with any development, it is critical that the impacts on vulnerable groups are taken into account. We are working for this to be a routine requirement of mining project assessment and operating procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/4">DFID has contributed to the development of environmental and social safeguard policies and procedures being implemented by the World Bank and its private sector arm&mdash;the International Finance Corporation. This includes policies on environmental and social assessment and the involvement of indigenous peoples and others in decision making.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/5">DFID has provided financial support and leadership for the work of the World Bank hosted Communities and Small scale Mining (CASM) initiative. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that women comprise up to 30 per cent. of the 13-20 million people directly engaged in small-scale, informal sector mining. They work predominantly in the hazardous mineral processing areas such as manual ore grinding, and use of mercury for gold extraction. CASM has provided grants for women's projects, for example helping set up the African Women in Mining Network, and helping develop gender components of mainly World Bank projects in Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. It has also supported workshops and conferences on women in mining, for example in Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Peru. It is now preparing guidance notes on managing gender issues in mining.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/6">Tackling inequality is an integral part of our work in all countries. DFID is working with several mineral resource rich developing country partners (for example the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Angola, and Sierra Leone) addressing issues including economic diversification, fairer terms and conditions for mine workers, minerals sector governance, public-private sector alliances and generally enhancing the contribution of mineral resource exploitation to growth, poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid="b.915W.0/1">DFID provides considerable support for the purchase and distribution of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) through a number of programme and health sector approaches, including budgetary support to developing countries. Information in the form requested is not held centrally by DFID, because our support for ITNs is usually provided as part of a larger package of measures to improve health and combat malaria.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/2">DFID supports the World Health Organisation, the Roll Bank Malaria partnership, UNICEF and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), which all help finance the purchase and distribution of ITNs in developing countries. The UK has, for example, doubled its funding to the GFATM for 2006 and 2007 to &pound;100 million annually, subject to performance. The GFATM has become a major source of funding for ITNs globally and expects to have financed the purchase of 109 million bed nets in its five funding rounds to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/3">DFID's bilateral programmes support countries to develop strong and sustainable health services that are able to scale-up the coverage of services including access to ITNs. In some countries, funding is provided as part of our overall support for poverty reduction and implementation of health sector plans. In such settings, it is not possible to attribute the number of nets to a particular donor. What we are interested in seeing is overall national increases in the distribution and use of bed nets, and many countries are making good progress in promoting ITN use.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/4">DFID does provide direct support specifically for provision of ITNs in several countries. For example, In Kenya, DFID has committed &pound;47.4 million for social marketing of ITNs, with the goal of reaching 60 per cent. coverage of children under five and 40 per cent. coverage of pregnant women by the end of 2007, by selling 11.1 million nets at highly subsidised and affordable prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/5">In Ghana, our support has helped procure 1.8 million long-lasting insecticide treated nets through UNICEF for free distribution to children under two years of age as part of the November 2006 measles campaign. In Democratic Republic of Congo, one million nets have been distributed over a period of four years from 2003 to 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/6">In Malawi, delivery of ITNs is combined with other services. A nationwide programme has been in operation through antenatal services since 2002. More than 100,000 ITNs have been delivered every month since the programme began, and solid results achieved. ITN coverage of under-fives has risen from around 8 per cent. in 2000 to more than 60 per cent. in some districts in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/7">In Tanzania ITNs are being rolled-out through a subsidised voucher scheme for pregnant women involving over 3,000 service delivery outlets. This is enabling more women to access ITNs, and is helping create more demand for local production.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/8">All of these efforts are contributing to widespread use of ITNs as a vital element of the effort to combat malaria. DFID will continue to play a full part in supporting the wider availability and use of ITNs.</p>

DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will continue to use every opportunity to influence other PBC members to agree to full civil society participation, both at the PBC meetings in New York and, importantly, in the PBC coordination meetings in Sierra Leone and Burundi. In parallel, we will also continue to lobby national governments in both countries to recognise the valuable contribution national civil society can make to building peace.</p>

	<p pid="b.920W.3/1">We announced the setting up of a dedicated benefit simplification unit on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December 2005</phrase>, at the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) hearing into the National Audit Office report &quot;Dealing with the complexity of the benefit system&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-18">18 November 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.3/2">The unit's role is to act as a catalyst in driving forward simplification across the benefits system, by challenging existing complexity and ensuring that the need to bear down on complexity is at the heart of future benefit design and delivery. As a first step, the unit published &quot;Simplification: Guide to Best Practice&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-04">4 May 2006</phrase>. Copies have been placed in the Library. The unit is now working to help embed best practice and over the summer has run a series of roadshows to raise awareness of the simplification agenda across the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.3/3">Progress on simplification will be reported on annually in the departmental report, and the effectiveness of the unit will be reflected in the extent to which key performance indicators are met across the Department, where these indicators are partly dependent on the complexity of the system. The unit is also looking at whether it is possible to produce a reliable set of indicators to measure future progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.3/4">The unit was fully staffed by the end of July 2006 (including a secondee from Citizens Advice). There were no specific setup costs, as permanent staff were drawn from within the Department. Total running costs over the period January 2006 to September 2006 were &pound;207,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.924W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the discontinuation of the Benefit Processing Replacement Programme (BPRP), with reference to (a) aborted investment costs and (b) replacement provision of information.

	<p pid="b.924W.2/4" class="indent">Press estimates of the expenditure on the BPRP have considerably overstated the loss to public funds, because a significant proportion of its output to date is capable of being recycled.

	<p pid="b.924W.2/5" class="indent">Having formally closed the BPR Programme, we are currently undertaking a major planning exercise to support the delivery of the proposed Employment and Support Allowance.

We cannot break these figures down between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

	<p pid="b.927W.0/2">No estimates have been made as the Disability Discrimination Act does not set objective standards of compliance against which implementation may be measured. Instead, the Act requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to enable disabled people to access their services. What is reasonable for a particular service provider will depend on all the circumstances of the individual case. Factors such as the cost of the adjustment, its practicability, and the extent of the service provider's financial and other resources may all be taken into account in determining what is reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/3">However, the Department has undertaken a series of research projects to monitor how employers and service providers are responding to their duties under the Act. Research from 2003<sup>(1)</sup> looked at organisations' preparations for the 2004 duties requiring service providers to make reasonable adjustments; this found that over 70 per cent. of organisations had made adjustments to assist disabled customers. At the turn of the year we will be publishing new research on organisations' responses to the DDA which will include an updated look at adjustments made for disabled customers by service providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.934W.5/2">The Social Fund Cold Weather Payments scheme was introduced in October 1988. It replaced a similar but not identical scheme which had begun in December 1986. No data is held for help given to pensioners in 1986 under this system.</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/3">In 1996 help for pensioners was given through the Social Fund Cold Weather Payments scheme. Cold Weather Payments are made when the average temperature has been recorded as, or forecast to be, 0<sup>(0)</sup>C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the eligible customer's postcode. A Cold Weather Payment of &pound;8.50 is made for each week the temperature is triggered. These payments are not limited to pensioners. In total &pound;61.6m was paid out to all recipients in 1995-96.</p>
	<p pid="b.934W.5/4">In 2005-06 the amount paid in Winter Fuel Payments to people aged 60 or over was &pound;2 billion and a further &pound;5.6 million in Cold Weather Payments was paid to eligible pensioner households. The amount of Winter Fuel Payment a person receives depends on their age and whether there are other eligible people in the household. People aged 60-79 receive up to &pound;200 and people aged 80 or over receive up to &pound;300.</p>

	<p pid="b.945W.2/2">During 2004 and 2005 EHS received between 1,000 and 1,200 reports of illegal dumping of waste each year. This year to date, 1,206 reports have been received. A minimum of 250,000 tonnes of household waste from the Republic of Ireland has been illegal disposed of in Northern Ireland to date.

EHS is also in the process of introducing a computer system known as 'Fly Capture' that will record and track all reported incidents. The system has proved very useful in GB with the publicity surrounding levels of fly-tipping and the costs of dealing with it arising from this source. If district councils take up the offer of the use of this system, appropriate data should be available for Northern Ireland within a year.</p>

A comparable survey has been carried out in Great Britain since 1992-93, and this GB survey has now been expanded into a UK survey, including the Northern Ireland data.  2. The Northern Ireland sample size has been enhanced to allow more detailed analysis.  3. A variety of definitions of household income are available from the survey. Gross income is used here.  4. Three years of the survey are combined to ensure an acceptable sample size.  5. Because three years of the survey have been combined, the significance of the &pound;300 limit for households is not constant, due to price inflation and increases in general income over time.  <i> Source:</i>  Family Resources Survey.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.950W.2/4" class="indent">I can advise that all vehicle restraint systems installed on the public road network in Northern Ireland comply with European Standard EN 1317. There is relatively little wire rope safety fencing erected on the Northern Ireland road network and statistical analysis of collision data has not identified any problems in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.2/5" class="indent">Whilst Roads Service has not undertaken any specific research to evaluate the safety implications for motorcyclists, I can advise that the Government (DfT) Advisory Group on Motorcycling reported in 2004 that the Transport Research Laboratory had undertaken some evaluation of safety fences. I understand the conclusion from this work was that all types of barrier pose some form of risk for motorcyclists, but wire rope is no more of a risk than other types of post and beam barriers.</p>

Northern Ireland has had the enabling power since 1998 to introduce a scheme similar to the rural rate relief scheme which operates in Great Britain. Both the Executive and direct rule Ministers decided not to introduce it because analysis showed it did not suit Northern Ireland's more dispersed settlement pattern. It would also potentially have an unfavourable impact from both an equality and New TSN perspective.</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-06">6 November 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what the approximate cost and length of time would be for DRD Roads Service to construct the dualling of the A26 road between Glarryford and the A44 Drones Junction. As this issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/4" class="indent">You will be aware that the improvement to dual carriageway standard of the A26 Glarryford to A44 Drones Road project is one of the Strategic Road Improvements identified in the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/5" class="indent">The A26 scheme is in the Roads Service's Forward Planning Schedule. Schemes within this schedule are expected to be implemented within the next 5-10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/6" class="indent">Civil Engineering Consultants, Arup were commissioned in April 2006 to assist with the development of the project through to the selection of a preferred route and completion of the statutory procedures (Environmental Statement, Direction Order and Vesting Order). On successful completion of the statutory procedures and an economic appraisal, the scheme will be taken forward to procurement and construction. Subject to the availability of funding at the time, the commencement of that stage is currently anticipated to be early 2010, with completion likely to be late 2012/early 2013. Comprehensive consultation with the public, other interested bodies and public representatives will take place throughout the development of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.0/7" class="indent">The expanded Strategic Road Improvement Programme 2015 Consultation Document, published earlier this year, estimated the cost of the project to be &pound;33M (at 2005 prices). As work progresses on the project more detail and constraints will be identified and timescales and estimates may be adjusted to suit.</p>

This will be accompanied by a duty on the Chief Inspector of Schools to report, as part of routine school inspections, on the contribution made by schools in this respect. Inspectors will judge this by assessing the extent to which learners contribute to community cohesion and the effectiveness of the links made by the school with other providers, services, employers and other organisations to promote well-being and community cohesion. Where inspectors identify underperformance, they will make recommendations on which the school will be expected to respond. School Improvement Partners will challenge and support the school in making any necessary improvements and parents will be informed about progress through the School Profile. Where the underperformance extends to other aspects of the school's work, there may be circumstances in which inspectors return to monitor the school's progress in securing improvement.</p>

A QCA survey in March 2006 found that over 90 per cent. of schools have enterprise in their school development plans, or will have next year, and nearly 90 per cent. have, or will have next year, a written school policy on enterprise. So we have made good progress, and we have established the national Schools' Enterprise Education Network to help all schools to make further progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.962W.2/1">There are five different bodies involved. The budgets allocated to each body cover all of their activities, including both programme funds, which consumes the overwhelming proportion and their administrative running costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/2">The principal funding body for higher education institutions is the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). HEFCE funding for HE institutions includes resources for the management and administration by the institutions themselves. The budget HEFCE was allocated for 2006-07 was &pound;6,564 million and the current staffing complement is 245 full-time equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/3">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (IDA) provides funding to higher education institutions for a number of activities to support the agency's objectives, in particular for initial teacher training. The budget allocated for the agency for 2006-07 was &pound;717.1 million and the current staffing complement is 322 full-time equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/4">Only a very small proportion of the budget or staff of the remaining three bodies, Ofsted, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI), either funds HE institutions or funds activity to regulate them.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/5">The total budget allocated for Ofsted for 2006-07 was &pound;204 million and it has 2,100 staff. The budget allocated to the LSC for 2006-07 was &pound;10,458 million for 4,085 staff. The LSC is currently undertaking a radical restructuring exercise designed to streamline the existing organisation at both national and local level, which is expected to lead to significant savings in running costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/6">ALI's inspection remit, including that which affects the regulation and administration of HE institutions, will be taken over by new Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills from April 2007, but the total budget they were allocated for 2006-07 was &pound;24 million, with 221 staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/7">We closely monitor all of these bodies to ensure their running costs are kept to the minimum consistent with cost effective operation&mdash;and require them to minimise the regulatory burden they impose on HE institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.962W.2/8">In addition, the Higher Education Regulation Review Group (HERRG) has recently been reappointed for a further two year period; HERRG is the independent gatekeeper group for higher education. It is comprised of senior managers and administrators from HE institutions, with an independent chair, and works with Government Departments and their agencies to review all the bureaucratic demands they make on HE institutions, to help ensure these are the minimum consistent with effective accountability.</p>

	<p pid="b.968W.0/1">The 2005/06 School Sport Survey found that, overall, 37 per cent. of pupils in schools within a school sport partnership took part in inter-school sports competitions during the last academic year&mdash;a 6 per cent. rise on 2004/05. The following table sets out the percentage of pupils in each local authority area taking part in inter-school sports competitions during the academic year 2005/06. Direct comparisons between local authority areas are not appropriate as the number of schools in school sport partnerships, and the length of time they have been within partnerships, differs. The results only report on pupils who attend schools within school sport partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="b.970W.2/2">My officials and I have regular discussions with the Treasury to discuss PE and sport. Our overall aim, a joint DfES/DCMS public service agreement target, is to increase the percentage of 5 to16-year-olds who take part in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. By 2010, we want to offer all children four hours of sport a week. We are investing over &pound;1.5 billion in the five years to 2008 to transform PE and school sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.2/3">We have already exceeded the 2006 target. The 2005/06 school sport survey found that 80 per cent. of pupils in the 16,880 schools which took part in the survey were doing at least two hours. This is an increase of 29 per cent. on 2003/04. The survey found that almost all schools (97 per cent.) hold a competitive sports day and the percentage of years 2-11 pupils participating in sports clubs linked to their schools has increased from 22 per cent. in 2003/04 to 27 per cent. this year. Copies of the results of the survey have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.2/4">We currently have in place the strongest ever protection of school playing fields and, for the second year running, the number of new playing fields created has been greater than the number sold off.</p>

	<p pid="b.974W.0/1">All pupils, including those with SEN, are benefiting from the significant increases in investment in education funding under this Government. Total revenue funding per pupil has increased nationally by &pound;1,440 in real terms between 1997-98 and 2006-07. By 2007-08 the increase over 1997-98 will have reached over &pound;1,630 per pupil in real terms. More resources are going into schools to support children with SEN&mdash;LA indicative figures show spending rising from &pound;3.5 billion in 2003-04 to over &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/2">The school funding settlement for 2006-08 provides a national average increase in the dedicated schools grant of 6.8 per cent. per pupil this year (compared with authorities' spending in 2005-06) and a further increase of 6.7 per cent. per pupil for 2007-08. The settlement gives schools everywhere the secure and predictable base they need to deliver a wider and more personalised offer to all their pupils. Decisions on funding for subsequent years will be dependent upon the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR07).</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/3">DSG is a ring-fenced grant. It is paid to local authorities, who must use it for the purposes of their schools budget. It is for each local authority to distribute funding to its schools using its locally agreed formula, and it is for schools' governing bodies to decide how to spend their available resources. We believe that schools are best placed to make decisions about support arrangements for pupils experiencing barriers to their learning. They can intervene early and make effective arrangements promptly and flexibly, within the whole school context.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/4">The Education Act 1996 states that schools must use their best endeavours to make suitable provision for all pupils with SEN. For children with statements, LAs, in partnership with schools, must ensure that the provision specified in the statement can be delivered. The annual review ensures that the continued effectiveness of the statement is monitored and evaluated at least annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/5">The SEN code of practice provides detailed guidance to schools and LAs on their respective responsibilities. In addition, the &quot;Special Educational Needs (Provision of Information by LEAs) (England) Regulations 2001&quot;, require LAs to set out what they expect schools to provide from their budgets for children with SEN but without statements and what LAs expect to provide themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/6">The Department's 2004 guidance &quot;The Management of SEN Expenditure&quot; recommended the accountability arrangements that should be in place in order to secure positive outcomes for children with special educational needs. The guidance proposed a framework covering: school information and performance data; school self-evaluation; evaluation meetings and accountability to parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/7">All schools are required to complete a self-evaluation form (SEF), drawing on improved data and supported by inspection, to identify areas where there is a need to improve performance. School improvement partners (SIPs) will challenge and support schools. The focus on a continuing cycle of school improvement should ensure that the progress of all children is kept under review and they receive appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.0/8">Collaboration is proving to be a very effective way of addressing school improvement, teaching and learning, and other organisational issues. SEN is certainly one area that can benefit from a partnership approach of both schools and possibly other organisations. However, we believe that schools must have the freedom to make spending decisions and to decide whether they take part in partnership activity, based on their specific local needs. For this reason, from April 2006 the majority of funding to support collaborative work now goes directly to schools as part of their school development grant. The way schools decide to use this funding is therefore a matter for local decision.</p>
