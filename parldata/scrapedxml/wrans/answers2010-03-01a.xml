	<p pid="a.838W.0/1">UK support is focused on building Afghan counter-narcotics law enforcement capacity, strengthening Afghan institutions, and providing alternative livelihoods for farmers. We are seeing progress. The number of narco barons being arrested and convicted, often by Afghan institutions mentored by UK experts, is increasing, This year, in Helmand, Governor Mangal has overseen the distribution of wheat seed to over 40,000 households in the 'Food Zone' and is overseeing the distribution of seed for summer crops to 27,000 households.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.0/2">There have been dramatic falls in opium cultivation in Afghanistan in recent years-19 per cent. in 2008 and a further 22 per cent. in 2009. Although we cannot be complacent, we believe farmers are at least in part responding to improvements in governance and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.0/3">The UK remains committed to the fight against the Afghan drugs trade, as a key component of our Afghan counter-insurgency and state-building effort. The drugs trade creates and funds the corruption which undermines the legitimacy of the Afghan state and provides a critical source of revenue for the Taleban.</p>

In so far as authorities are owners and occupiers of property, they have the same powers to control foxes as any other owner or occupier. They also have a general discretionary power under the Local Government Act 2000 that enables them to take any action to promote social, economic or environmental well-being as long as there is no specific statutory prohibition.</p>

	<p pid="a.854W.2/1">The UK has strict controls on importing rabies susceptible animals from other countries-six-months quarantine for some cases, or vaccination followed by a six-month waiting period for certain travelling pets. These controls offer good protection against a rabies outbreak, whether in domestic animals, livestock or wildlife, including urban foxes.</p>

	<p pid="a.860W.5/1">The Department for Transport (DFT) does not routinely hold transport statistics on a parliamentary constituency basis. The Department provides Transport for London (TfL) with a block grant to fund transport delivery in London. This grant has more than doubled in the last nine years, rising to almost &#163;3 billion in 2009-10. Drawing on these and other resources, the Mayor is responsible for publishing and, through TfL, implementing a transport strategy for London, while the boroughs are required to publish local implementation plans which set out how they will contribute to the Mayor's strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/2">The additional funding that has been made available has helped deliver 1,089 million passenger journeys on the tube in 2008-9, the highest ever. London Underground's scheduled service is now its largest ever, and in 2008-09 96.4 per cent. was run, the best annual result for 14 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/3">Bus services in London have also improved. 2,247 million passenger journeys were made in 2008-09 and patronage grew by almost 47 per cent. between 1997-98 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/4">Rail routes serving Hackney North and Stoke Newington have also improved. Served by National Express East Anglia, this franchise has seen punctuality increase from 85 per cent. to 91 per cent. since 2004, over 450 carriages have been refurbished and many stations have been upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/5">On the roads, national targets to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent. and reduce the number of &quot;slight&quot; casualties by 10 per cent. (compared to the period 1994-98) by 2010 were largely exceeded by TfL by 2004, leading to TfL setting themselves new targets of 50 per cent. and 25 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/6">There have also been improvements to cycling across London. In May 2010 TfL will launch its cycle hire scheme and construction of the cycle superhighways is now under way; one route will run from Tottenham to the City through Hackney. TfL report that cycling now accounts for 2 per cent. of trips in London compared to 1.2 per cent. in 2000, and between 2000-01 and 2007-08 TfL's automatic cycle counters reported an increase in cyclists of 91 per cent.</p>

The table shows the total number of offenders who had been classified during each full 12-month period. Some offenders would have been classified as prolific and other priority offenders during the course of the years shown, and others de-classified during the years shown, in accordance with local selection and de-selection criteria.

	<p pid="a.892W.6/1">The overwhelming majority of cold weather payments are paid automatically. When the Department for Work and Pensions is notified of a qualifying cold weather period a computer scan is run over the following weekend. Payments are made into customer's bank accounts on the following Wednesday. The only exception to this is where the Department is notified on a Friday. In these cases the scan will not be run on the weekend immediately following but will be picked up the next weekend. This is considered a reasonable period to prevent hardship.</p>

Equal consideration was also given to the penalty principles set out by Professor Richard B.

	<p pid="a.895W.0/1">Our strategy since 1997 has been to target help on the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/2">We have a good track record of reducing pensioner poverty. In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners in relative poverty than in 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs). Today's pensioners are less likely to be living in relative poverty after housing costs than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/3">In 1997, the poorest pensioners, who received Income Support, lived on around &#163;69 a week (equivalent to &#163;98 a week in today's prices). Today pension credit ensures that no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week or &#163;198.45 a week for couples). This represents an increase in income by almost a third in real terms. And many of those on pension credit will also be entitled to additional support through housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/4">The Pension, Disability and Carers Service continue to promote take-up of benefits for those entitled. This involves data matching to identify entitled non-recipients, home visits for vulnerable customers, targeted local marketing and media campaigns, a simple claim process involving telephones as well as paper claims and ever closer working with partner organisations. The Department is also looking at innovative ways of using information that we already hold to make payments of pension credit more automatically to entitled non-recipients.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/5">In the Pensions Act 2007, we made a commitment to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with average earnings over the long-term. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has commented that without this, it is likely there would be significant increases in pensioner poverty in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/6">We have also made a commitment to re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. This will benefit almost 12 million pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/7">The Government use a basket of three key thresholds of income, after housing costs, to measure pensioner poverty. The most commonly used figures relate to those with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income, after housing costs. However, the Department does not have a commitment to eradicate pensioner poverty in the same way it does for child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/8">The Work and Pensions Select Committee report on its inquiry into tackling pensioner poverty, which was published in July 2009, recommended that the Government should make its commitment to tackling pensioner poverty explicit and formally commit to eradicating pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/9">After fully considering this recommendation we do not believe that establishing a formal target for the eradication of pensioner poverty would be the right approach. It is entirely right that the Government should commit itself to the eradication of child poverty, but the context for pensioners is not the same. Pensioners' incomes are affected by the work, caring and saving that they have undertaken during their working lives. The Government believe that this &quot;something for something&quot; contributory principle, whereby people are rewarded for their positive engagement with society during their lives is a critical component of our system of support for older people. Through our pension reform we are putting in place a framework which will enable people to build up a decent pension from the state and provide a foundation for further saving. We need to make sure that our policies balance cost, poverty alleviation and maintaining incentives to save.</p>
	<p pid="a.895W.0/10">We believe that our reforms will achieve this balance and that our published Public Service Agreement, which explicitly commits to &quot;Tackle poverty and to promote greater independence and well-being in later life&quot;, is the right framework for tackling pensioner poverty and we will continue to report progress against this indicator.</p>

	<p pid="a.896W.2/1">The Government use a basket of three key thresholds of income, after housing costs, to measure pensioner poverty. The most commonly used figures relate to those with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income, after housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/2">Estimates of the number of pensioners who have been lifted out of poverty are not available, as each year different households are surveyed to produce low income statistics that are published in the Households Below Average Income series. However, information is available about the net change in the number of pensioners with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/3">These figures only allow a breakdown of the overall numbers in poverty at Government Office Region level. Therefore, information is available for the West Midlands Government Office Region, but not available for the Coventry South constituency. Three-year averages are used to report regional statistics as single-year estimates are subject to volatility. Figures are quoted to the nearest 100,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/4">In the three-year period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 there were around 300,000 pensioners in the West Midlands with incomes below the 60 per cent contemporary median (equivalent to 28 per cent of pensioners in the region). The latest information relates to the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 in which there were around 200,000 pensioners in poverty (18 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/5">Since 1997-2000, there has been a reduction of around 100,000 pensioners in the West Midlands Government Office Region with incomes below 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income. This equates to a 10 percentage point reduction in pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/6">At a national level, we do not need to use the three-year averages and can use the individual yearly figures. However, figures for 1997-98 cover Great Britain only, as Northern Ireland data did not become available until the following year.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/7">In 1997-98 there were around 2.9 million pensioners in poverty in Great Britain, which equates to around 29 per cent. of all pensioners. The 2007-08 UK figures show that around 2.0 million pensioners were in poverty, equating to around 18 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.896W.2/8">Between 1997-98 and 2007-08 the number of pensioners with incomes below 60 per cent of the contemporary median income reduced by around 900,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.2/1">The proposed 2.5 per cent increase in the rate of the basic State Pension from April 2010 will not be applied to increments payable to those recipients who have deferred their State Pension. The Retail Prices Index showed that prices had fallen for the 12 months ending in September 2009. Given this evidence the Government have decided to maintain the value of increments at 2009-10 rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.2/2">People with increments who deferred their State Pension for at least one year since 2005 get a State Pension that is 10.4 per cent. higher than if they had not deferred. They will also benefit from the 2.5 per cent. increase in the basic State Pension announced at the pre-Budget report. We are writing to every individual in receipt of State Pension with an uprating notification which clearly states that, while basic State Pension is increasing by 2.5 per cent., increments and additional pension are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.2/3">In addition, the increase in the basic State Pension will be reflected in the value of increments being accrued by those who are currently deferring their State Pension.</p>

The changes in methodology were recognised as improvements and as such the statistics from 2005 are classified as National Statistics.

	<p pid="a.905W.6/1">Setting of prices, including the level of differential between peak and off-peak charges on an Economy 7 type tariff, is a commercial decision for the company concerned. It is for Ofgem to consider whether pricing is appropriate, and it can take action if it decides that it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.6/2">Gas and electricity suppliers currently have up to 65 working days to notify their customers that a price increase has taken place. We think it is unacceptable for customers to be informed of price rises so late. Ofgem has committed to consulting on the matter before Easter. We have also amended the Energy Bill during its passage through the House of Commons to include powers for the Government to set the period within which energy companies must inform customers of changes to their tariffs should Ofgem be unable to address the issue in a timely fashion.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.5/1">Since 2002, through the Government's flagship tool for delivering household energy and carbon savings, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and its predecessors, over 6 million households have been helped with insulation measures with almost three million of these in a priority group of vulnerable households. Between April 2008 and June 2009 over 22,000 households received solid wall insulation measures. We are currently revising some of the delivery schemes (principally CERT) to ensure that household insulation work continues at increased rates to reach the target by December 2011.</p>

The pilot is expected to be completed in 2010. The pilot will assess the effectiveness of the insulation products against a variety of criteria, including cost of installation, energy savings and customer satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.5/3">The Government's Household Energy Management strategy, to be published shortly, will discuss how we are to meet our ambitious energy efficiency targets, including the delivery of measures such a solid wall insulation, and the need to address delivery in a fair way that takes account of the needs of the vulnerable and fuel poor.</p>

	<p pid="a.911W.2/1">It is not possible to provide a meaningful average cost for MCS certification of installer companies, as the costs for installer companies to become certificated under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) are dependent on a number of factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.0/16" class="indent">The ACT ON CO2 campaign encourages energy efficiency in the home through the use of advertising (broadcast, online and press), digital media, outreach events, PR and partnerships with appropriate commercial organisations. Typically this promotion encourages a range of behaviours from simple actions like turning down thermostats, turning off electrical appliances fully and using energy efficient light bulbs to more substantial measures like loft and cavity wall insulation. The current burst of advertising on insulation launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase> and will run to mid-March 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.0/17" class="indent">Schemes such as Warm Front, Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP) and the Decent Homes Standard reduce the demand for energy by improving home energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.0/18" class="indent">CERT requires energy suppliers to meet at least 40 per cent. of their obligation by promoting and installing measures in the homes of a priority group of vulnerable consumers in receipt of qualifying benefits or people aged over 70 years. Measures are only reported at a GB level and details for the work carried out in Essex and Castle Point are therefore not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.0/19" class="indent">A regulatory framework has been introduced that: promotes competition as the main driver to ensure downward pressure on prices for consumers; improves licence conditions; and strengthens Ofgem's powers through the Energy Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.0/20" class="indent">Measures such as the winter fuel payments and cold weather payments-alongside the wider tax and benefit system and through benefit entitlement checks (BECs) under the Warm Front Scheme-have raised real incomes. Since 2005, Warm Front has carried out almost 900 BECs in Castle point, identifying eligibility for a previously unclaimed benefit in over 350 households-leading to an average increase of &#163;31.09p in weekly income.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.0/21" class="indent">We have also introduced legislation to implement mandated social price support schemes once the current voluntary agreement with suppliers comes to an end in 2011. These schemes will provide more of the most vulnerable consumers with help towards their energy costs. We have said that we are minded to focus the majority of the additional resources on older pensioner households on the lowest incomes as these households tend to have a high incidence of fuel poverty-over 50 per cent. of fuel poor households have a person over 60 living in them; their circumstances are relatively stable; and they are at the greatest risk of excess winter deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.0/22">The fuel poverty review which was announced in January 2009, has been looking across all three drivers of fuel poverty (income, energy prices and energy efficiency) and particularly the key issue of how we can more effectively identify and target assistance at the most vulnerable households.</p>

	<p pid="a.919W.0/1">The Common Minimum Standards (CMS) summarise Government policy affecting the procurement of built environments. Government do not centrally monitor procuring organisations' implementation of that policy. One of the standards is for clients to include a contract clause requiring individuals in their supply teams to be registered on the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS), a trade body run by CSCS Ltd., or to be able to prove their competence in some other appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid="a.919W.0/2">CSCS is managed under contract by CITB-ConstructionSkilis, a sector skills body. The rules and scheme criteria are set by the scheme's owners and Government have no involvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.2/1">Article 12 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings requires that the assistance measures detailed in its sections (1) and (2) are provided to individuals identified as victims to a 'reasonable grounds' standard of proof. Access to this type of assistance is therefore provided to identified victims of trafficking through support providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.2/2">From 2003 to 2009 the Government invested &#163;5.8 million in the POPPY Project to provide specialist accommodation and support to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. A further investment of &#163;3.9 million over the current and next financial year funds specialist accommodation and support for victims of all forms of human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.2/3">To assist in the identification of potential victims of human trafficking and to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment from the outset, the Office for Criminal Justice Reform has published a new toolkit, which provides advice and support to frontline practitioners who may come into contact with victims.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.5/1">The following table shows, on a national level basis for each calendar year from 2000 to 2008, the following:</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.5/8">The Ministry of Justice are also unable to provide information on how many people have been summoned for jury service more than once. This is because jurors are selected on a completely random basis using the electoral voting registers supplied annually by each local authority. As the electoral registers are updated annually and due to the randomness of jury selection there is potential for some members of the public to be called for jury service more than once while some may never be called.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.5/9">Members of the public summoned for jury service cannot decline to carry out jury service. However, a juror can apply to defer their jury service to a more suitable date within the forthcoming 12-month period if the original date is not convenient. Jurors can apply to be excused from jury service but their application must show good cause why they should be excused from attending.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.5/1">By the end of 2009 the total useable operational capacity of the prison estate was 85,986.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice aims to increase prison capacity to 96,000 places by 2014 through the prison capacity programme. These places are being provided through the building of new prisons as well as expansion of existing ones and more effective use of the estate. Over 3,600 new places will be delivered in 2010 and around 1,400 new places in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.5/3">Capacity estimates are subject to change due to the number of existing prison places which may need to be taken out of use in the future for maintenance purposes. The precise numbers and delivery timings of new prison places will also depend on construction schedules and prioritisation within the prison estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.5/4">The Ministry of Justice produces annual projections of the prison population, most recently in August 2009. These project the prison population under three different scenarios, based on different assumptions about future sentencing trends: the medium scenario assumes no increases or decreases in custody rates or determinate sentence lengths. The high/low scenarios reflect a 1 per cent. annual increase/decrease in custody rates and a 0.5 per cent. increase/decrease in the average (determinate) custodial sentence lengths.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.5/5">Other impacts included in the projections, such as those of legislation and processes, are applied equally to all scenarios. These cover the anticipated effect of policy and process initiatives that have agreed implementation timetables. These assumptions and anticipated effects have remained unchanged since last year projections.</p>

	<p pid="a.943W.9/1">The Treasury Solicitor's Department was instructed in the following number of applications for judicial reviews in each of the last three years:</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/2" class="indent">2007: 4,756</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/3" class="indent">2008: 4,823</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/4" class="indent">2009: 6,293.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/5">Specific data on how many such reviews were upheld in whole or in part in each such year are not maintained by the Treasury Solicitor's Department. The information requested can therefore be provided but only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/6">The Administrative Court Office does not retain the information sought in this question. However, it is able to produce information on cases in which a Government Department is shown as first defendant. Where a Government Department is named as a subsequent defendant this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The figures the Administrative Court Office has for cases where a central Government Department was named as first defendant over the last three years are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/7" class="indent">2007: 4,614</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/8" class="indent">2008: 4,877</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/9" class="indent">2009: 6,886.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/10">With regard to the number of these cases where the application was upheld, in whole or in part, this information is not held and, again, could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the Administrative Court Office's case management system can identify the number of cases each year where Government Departments were named as first defendant and where the judicial review was granted following a substantive hearing. These figures are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/11" class="indent">2007: 13</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/12" class="indent">2008: 12</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/13" class="indent">2009: 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.9/14">These figures should be treated with considerable caution, since they relate only to the outcome of substantive hearings (not to the outcome of applications at permission stage). A number of cases settle either when permission to apply for judicial review is granted or shortly before the matter is heard substantively.</p>

Ministers have since met with the Mayor, council members and council officers over the course of the intervention to discuss the progress of the improvement agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.0/4">Ministers issued a direction on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March 2009</phrase>, requiring the council to establish an Improvement Board to advise, scrutinise and challenge the council in their improvement planning and work. This has met on a monthly basis, and included officials from DCSF and GOYH in an observer capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.0/5">Since August 2009, a monthly Performance Challenge meeting chaired by GOYH has run alongside the Improvement Board, and included council members and officers and DCSF officials in its membership; this meeting was designed to provide more detailed scrutiny, challenge and support to specific performance areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.0/6">A new Children's Board (succeeding the Improvement Board), which met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-29">29 January 2010</phrase>, is designed to advise and support the council's and partners' strategic leadership of children's services; DCSF and GOYH representatives attend in an observer capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.0/7">Safeguarding children and child protection were the primary focus of these meetings; responses to Serious Case Reviews were included in the discussion where relevant.</p>

	<p pid="a.946W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-19">19 February 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.3/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.3/4" class="indent">Detailed information about the professional experience of inspectors in relation to special educational needs and physical disability is not held electronically. However, given that almost all education and training settings have pupils and students with special educational needs and disabilities, and that virtually all inspectors of schools have been teachers, it is almost certain that all of these inspectors have professional experience of working with such pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.3/5" class="indent">All inspectors are provided with training on inspecting provision for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. Ofsted has recently prepared a training update for all school inspectors. HMI have undertaken this training and the material is currently being prepared for the inspection service providers for use with additional inspectors. Fifty-four HMI and 259 additional inspectors who inspect schools have a specialism in special educational needs and disabilities. These numbers include 10 HMI and 102 additional inspectors with a specialism in physical disability. Some of these inspectors have come from specialist backgrounds; for example, they were formerly teachers or headteachers in special schools or mainstream schools that have specially resourced provision, and others have gained expertise through their work as inspectors. Ofsted is currently preparing updated training for all specialist inspectors. This training will be undertaken from the start of the summer term. In addition, an extensive specialist resource pack for inspecting provision for special educational needs in mainstream and special schools is being revised. This material will also be provided for inspectors from the summer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.3/6" class="indent">Ofsted is committed to making every effort to deploy specialist inspectors to inspect specialist provision in mainstream and special schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.3/7" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Vernon Coaker MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and placed in the library in both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.953W.5/1">Communities and Local Government's Sustainable Operations Policy requires all equipment to be switched off when not in use. We are ensuring that this is being done by fitting timers and sensors to all non-networked equipment, using a centralised Building Energy Management System (BEMS), and conducting an ongoing energy efficiency awareness campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.5/2">However, the Department does not intend to specifically participate in Earth Hour's switch off. CLG's office lighting system is 15 years old and has reached the end of its useful life. Consequently, a proportion of its movement sensors have failed and some lights no longer switch off automatically. To address this, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive office lighting upgrade which is expected to achieve over 50 per cent. savings in lighting energy. Full participation in Earth Hour's switch off before the completion of this replacement project would involve initiating a total building power shutdown and this would be disproportionately expensive.</p>

Setting a target for all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016 by raising energy efficiency standards under Part L of the Building Regulations with interim steps in 2010 and 2013.

	<p pid="a.962W.0/2">The council tax base projections used in the 2008-09 to 2010-11 Provisional Settlements were calculated in November 2007 and took into account tax base data from October 2005 and 2007. These projections used the latest data available at the time of the three-year settlement's original calculation and were calculated on a consistent basis for all local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.0/3">One of the principles of multi-year settlements is the provision of more predictability and certainty in relation to the funding that we provide to local government, so that authorities can plan and manage their budgets better. Reopening the settlement to change data for an authority would undermine this principle as it would also change the distribution of formula grant for all local authorities. For this reason, where a three-year settlement is in operation, we have a clearly stated policy of only changing published provisional local government finance reports under entirely exceptional circumstances.

	<p pid="a.976W.0/16" class="indent">The nature of the Agency's work means that there is a need for some staff to undertake business travel on occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/17" class="indent">Given the substantial impact that travel costs have on the Agency's budget, and to minimise environmental damage through CO2 emissions, business travel should be kept to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/18" class="indent">Budget Holders, line managers, staff and finance all have a role to play and this section sets out these roles.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/19" class="indentitalic"> Budget Holders</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/20" class="indent">The role of Budget holders, in particular Business Team Managers, is to make sure that:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/21" class="indent">budget estimates for travel and subsistence are based on a critical and realistic assessment of need</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/22" class="indent">line managers work within the budget ceiling</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/23" class="indent">there is flexibility in the allocation of funds between line managers</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/24" class="indent">regular information is made available to enable effective management of staff travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/25" class="indent">staff take full advantage of the services and discounts available from departmental travel providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/26" class="indentitalic"> Line managers</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/27" class="indent">Line managers are responsible for:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/28" class="indent">day-to-day authorisation of travel requests (where they have specific delegated authority)</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/29" class="indent">day-to-day approval of claims</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/30" class="indent">keeping the cost of travel and subsistence within their delegated authorities</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/31" class="indent">deciding who carries out particular tasks involving travel</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/32" class="indent">communicating the need to plan travel responsibly and minimise travel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/33" class="indent">As part of their role line managers need to consider whether travelling is really necessary to meet specific work objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/34" class="indent">If travel is absolutely necessary, particular attention should be paid to:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/35" class="indent">the number and grades of staff travelling</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/36" class="indent">the frequency and duration of travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/37" class="indent">Line managers are responsible for deciding who carries out specific travel-related activities, and should ensure that travel is conducted by the most suitable method available, with consideration for the cost incurred and the environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/38" class="indent">Line managers should use the information on claim forms to check:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/39" class="indent">the agreed method of travel was used</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/40" class="indent">allowances claimed are correct and comply with departmental rules</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/41" class="indent">overall costs (in time and money) were kept to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/42" class="indent">Line managers must make sure that staff:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/43" class="indent">inform them of the purpose and details of all visits in advance of booking travel, to help control costs</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/44" class="indent">plan travel efficiently, for instance arranging a full day's appointments in one location</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/45" class="indent">rather than visit on two successive part-days</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/46" class="indent">plan itineraries to reduce costs and/or mileage</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/47" class="indent">book early to secure whatever cheaper fares are available and take advantage of offers available through recognised booking agents and operators</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/48" class="indentitalic"> Travellers and travel bookers</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/49" class="indent">Travellers and travel bookers must make sure that any staff travel arrangements make the best overall use of official time, fares and subsistence. It is the responsibility of the traveller to ensure that they have adequate funds, the correct form is completed (with receipts attached) and to obtain authorisation before submitting to finance for payment. Payment may be delayed if the form is not completed adequately.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/50" class="indent">In order to choose the most appropriate method of travel, travellers should bear in mind the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/51" class="indent">Staff who would normally qualify for first-class rail travel should consider travelling second class where the dearer fare offers no practical advantage, eg for short journeys and for longer journeys on routes which are known not to be crowded.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/52" class="indent">For staff required to travel 6500 miles or more by car each year it is as cheap to provide a lease car as to pay standard rate mileage allowance. For staff with an annual mileage of 9000 miles and above, a lease car can provide savings of up to a third.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/53" class="indent">Self-drive hire as a short-term measure may sometimes be the most economical option.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/54" class="indent">Taxis can be cost-effective for short journeys. Used discriminately, they can save much official time, especially with more than one person travelling. However, travellers should make sensible choices based on comparisons with available public transport before opting for travel by taxi.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/55" class="indent">Car sharing will substantially reduce travel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/56" class="indent">For longer journeys travel by air is usually cheaper, taking into account savings in travelling time and overnight subsistence. Similarly, overnight sleeper services can cut travel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/57" class="indent">Where there is a need to work on a Journey rail travel offers advantages which may outweigh the savings from cheaper forms of travel</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/58" class="indent">All staff should try and share examples of best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/59" class="indentitalic"> Finance</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/60" class="indent">It is the responsibility of the Finance team to:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.0/61" class="indent">check that claims follow guidance and that they have received all the necessary documentation required to make payment and to enable the correct Business Team and service to be charged-and follow up any insufficient documentation;</p>

	<p pid="a.978W.5/1">The new employment rights introduced in April 2003 gave parents of children under six and disabled children under 18 the right to request flexible working; this was extended to carers in April 2007 and parents of children aged 16 and under in April 2009. There are no requirements for either employers or employees to notify the department when requests are made to work flexibly. The department does not have the requested information for the past 12 months, nor does the department have evidence on the number of requests accepted or rejected by carers since 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.5/2">However, the department conducts periodic sample surveys to estimate the proportions of employees making requests to change their regular working hours and the proportion of such requests accepted or rejected. The most recent employee survey (Third Work Life Balance Employees' Survey) was conducted in 2006, before the implementation of the extension of the right to request to carers. Table 1 presents the findings from the 2006 Survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.5/3">Employees with parental responsibilities (defined as having dependent children aged under 19). In 2006, 20 per cent. of working parents (employees with dependent children undue nine years old) had made a request to change their regular working pattern during the previous two years, and 80% of requests had been accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.5/4">Employees with adult caring responsibilities (defined as looking after sick, disabled or elderly adults). In 2006, 26 per cent. of employees with adult caring responsibilities had made a request to change their working pattern, with 79 per cent. of requests accepted (11 per cent. rejected).</p>

	<p pid="a.983W.8/1">Data for earnings are not available at the county or constituency level because of small sample sizes at these levels in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.8/2">Due to rounding in the conversion of payroll data into hourly wage rates and small sample sizes for 16 to 17 and 18 to 21-year-olds in ASHE, it is not possible at the regional level to infer the number of employees earning exactly at the national minimum wage (NMW) with sufficient certainty. However it is possible to estimate the number who were paid at or below the NMW.</p>
	<p pid="a.983W.8/3">At the Government office region level the most recent figure from BIS analysis of the 2009 ASHE indicates the number of jobholders who were paid at or below the NMW in April 2009 in the east of England region was 64,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.984W.2/1">The proposed changes to the current charitable statutory exemptions for the public performance of recorded and broadcast music will apply to music used in divine worship by the Church of England or places of worship as certified. However, as part of this process, Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL), the organisation who license the public performance and broadcast of sound recordings, have agreed to implement a voluntary exemption for the use of broadcast and recorded music not only as part of divine worship anywhere but also for all religious ceremonies, civil ceremonies and civil partnership ceremonies; domestic/family occasions such as wedding parties; residential homes/hospices (not including staff areas); hospital wards and medical therapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.2/2">The Government fully consulted on this matter, taking into account legal advice and an impact assessment prepared by Europe Economics, and negotiated a number of safeguards including a system of joint licensing, a code of practice and an independent complaints ombudsman. I have been involved at all key stages of the consultation and officials have kept me informed throughout. I considered this matter extensively before writing to the Economic Development Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-02">2 July 2009</phrase> for clearance. I received clearance for the publication of the Government response and the proposed repeal of the charitable exemptions on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-24">24 July 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.6/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the Authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated February 2010:</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/3" class="indent">As the Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking pursuant to the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-27">27 January 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-01-27.796"><i> Official Report,</i> column 796</phrase>, on the 2011 Census, whether the evidential basis for the statement that the value of the census is &#163;700 million will be placed in the Library; and by what methodology such evidence was gathered. (318329)</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/4" class="indent">The quantified benefit of the census is currently estimated to be &#163;750 million. However, this is considered to be a very significant under-estimate. A full business case for the 2011 Census has been produced and scrutinised by HM Treasury and the Office of Government Commerce. It is due to be published this Spring and will be available on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website. The business case clearly demonstrates the unique value of the census, and that the benefits of having the information far outweigh the costs of its collection and processing and formed the basis for the Minister's statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/5" class="indent">ONS provided further information on this point to the Lord's Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments in October 2009 when the Committee examined the Draft Census (England and Wales) Order 2009, which was included in their 29th Report of Session 2008-2009 (Appendix 1) published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-05">5 November 2009</phrase>. The relevant sections of this stated that:</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/6" class="indent">A wide range of users rely heavily on census results for a countless range of purposes. The six broad purposes for which they use census data are:</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/7" class="indent">resource allocation;</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/8" class="indent">targeting investment;</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/9" class="indent">service planning;</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/10" class="indent">policy making and monitoring;</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/11" class="indent">academic and market research; and</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/12" class="indent">as a benchmark for other National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/13" class="indent">Extensive work has been undertaken to quantify the benefits of the census in financial terms. For example, if census data were not available, the &#163;82 billion allocated each year by the Department of Health to each Primary Care Trust (PCT), would be based on data using existing information available within the NHS. Detailed analysis has shown that using such lower quality data sources would result in over &#163;800 million being misallocated per year, with some individual PCTs gaining, or losing, to the tune of millions of pounds. Clearly, the net cost to HM Treasury of such misallocation would be zero, but the costs to society would be significant, resulting in significant discrepancies in the services available in different areas. Clearly, attributing a financial value to this cost to society is very difficult, but using standard economic methods that work on the premise that &quot;a pound in your pocket is worth more if you're poor than if you're rich,&quot; a cost to society of &#163;600 million over the decade has been estimated. Adding in similar quantified benefits for funding allocations to local authorities from the Department for Communities and Local Government, and private sector benefits (assessed through improved decision making about the location of retail stores and the use of census data by market researchers) the quantified benefits of the census amount to over &#163;750 million over the decade between censuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/14" class="indent">Furthermore these quantified benefits relate to only three of the six types of use of census data. When considering that over 500 organisations responded to the census topics consultation, that there are a further three very significant key uses of census data and that the Online Neighbourhood Statistics Service (just one route of access to census data) has over 100,000 hits per month, the unquantified benefits will be very substantial.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/15" class="indent">The quantified discounted benefit of circa &#163;750 million is therefore considered to be a very significant under-estimate.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.2/3" class="indent">Excepted charities with an income below &#163;100,000 are regulated by, but not registered with, the Charity Commission (although there is provision in the Charities Act 2006 for them to register voluntarily). The main groups of these charities are Parochial Church Councils, churches from certain Christian religious denominations, local scout and guide groups, and armed forces service non-public funds. Exception is conferred by Order of the Commission or the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.2/4" class="indent">Exempt charities, which are not registered with the Charity Commission and are currently not subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Charity Commission. Examples of such charities include universities, Boards of Trustees of certain museums and galleries, Kew Gardens, and charitable Industrial and Provident Societies. Most categories of exempt charities are defined by Schedule 2 to the Charities Act 1993 (&quot;the 1993 Act&quot;). In a few cases, exempt status has been conferred on some charities by other Acts of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.988W.2/5">The Charities Act 2006 contains provisions to improve the regulation of exempt charities as charities. Some groups of exempt charities will remain exempt but with an existing &quot;principal regulator&quot; promoting charity law compliance. Other groups of exempt charities will cease to be exempt and will become excepted charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.990W.9/1">The total printing and production costs of Smarter Government were &#163;37,292 including the distribution of hard copies to Parliament and the Stationery Office. A bespoke multimedia website was also designed at a cost of &#163;6,972.54. The content was produced internally by civil servants, and it is not possible to disaggregate this cost from the cost of other work undertaken by these officials. The only promotion costs incurred were the printing of two banners at &#163;792.</p>
