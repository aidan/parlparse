	<p pid=".1W.3/1">My hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Commons) and I represented the UK at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-12-22">22 December 2004</phrase>. Fisheries Ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also present.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/2">The main items for decision were on fisheries. The Council agreed on Total Allowable Catches and quotas for 2005 and on related measures. Much of the discussion at Council centred on the need for further measures to protect depleted cod stocks.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/3">The Commission had proposed a series of closed areas in the North Sea. Ministers, however, were not convinced of the case for the Commission's proposal which would have significant impact on the fishing industry but without clear benefit for the North Sea cod stock. The UK believes that closed areas have a part to play in fisheries management and we indicated at the Council that we would be willing to consider more radical measures, including closed areas, if the scientific advice on the state of stocks justified such an approach.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/4">The Council agreed a general reduction in fishing days within the North Sea, west of Scotland, and Eastern Channel to protect cod stocks. However, in recognition of the role that large mesh gear plays in reducing catches of juvenile fish, the Council agreed that fishermen using mesh of 120 mm mesh should receive an extra day, subject to administrative sanctions for infringements. The UK's mixed cod/haddock/whiting fleet already uses 120 mm and will, therefore continue to be able to fish for 15 days per month as soon as the new arrangements are in place.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/5">The Council also agreed to implement UK proposals for improved controls to ensure that illegal landings do not undermine cod recovery and for scientific monitoring of discarding. The European Commission will present detailed proposals to improve control and enforcement in early 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/6">The Council agreed to apply days at sea limits to the western Channel to protect the sole stock. Fishermen fishing with beam trawls or fixed nets will be restricted to 20 days fishing in the area per month.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/7">Ministers agreed that the closure to demersal fishing of an area to the West of Scotland (the 'windsock' closure) should continue in the same form as in 2004. For the sixth successive year, there will be a closure on the western Irish Sea in the spring to protect the spawning stock. The UK reached a bilateral agreement with Ireland to take forward a review of the Irish Sea closure with industry participation. Fishermen who spend most of their time in the Irish Sea will receive one additional fishing day (instead of two in 2004) in recognition of the reduction in effort as a result of the closure. The Council also agreed to implement a proposal from the UK, French and Irish industries for a cod spawning closure in the area between south west England and Ireland from January to March. However at the request of Belgium, there will be a derogation for beam trawlers in January.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/8">The UK (TACs) secured at the Council a number of increases in Total Allowable Catches in commercially important stocks where there was scientific evidence that previous TACs were out of line with the real abundance of the stocks. This meant that fishermen were having to unnecessarily discard catches with no conservation benefit. The stocks concerned were:</p>

	<p pid=".1W.3/21"><sup>(1)</sup> With the prospect of a further increase with agreement on management measures early in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/22">The Council also reached agreement on cuts in fishing effort and quotas on deep sea stocks. A closed area will be introduced to protect orange roughy which is thought to be particularly at risk. There will be a review of management arrangements for deep sea stocks in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/23">The European Commission presented a Communication on simplification of the Common Fisheries Policy and this will be followed by an action plan next year.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/24">On agriculture, the Presidency reported on two conferences that had considered the handling of animal disease outbreaks, including zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), from both the financial and disease control angles. The Commission indicated that it would be taking forward work in this area with a view to developing a more strategic approach to animal health. I strongly supported this initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/25">The Council held an orientation debate on measures to deal with illegally logged timber imports. I joined a number of delegations in welcoming progress in this area while noting that further work to counter attempts at circumvention of EU controls was needed. I also welcomed the Commission's intention to work closely with interested NGOs on this subject.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/26">The Council endorsed conclusions on the application of cross compliance conditions in the reformed CAP. Member states agreed to review the working of these provisions in the light of further experience.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/27">The Agriculture Commissioner informed the Council of her intention to prepare a paper reflecting on the possibilities for further simplification of the CAP; it would come to the Council towards the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/28">Under other business, Hungary, supported by several producing member states, expressed concern about the protection of geographical indications for wine in the EU/Australia wine agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/29">Sweden sought views from the Commission on its plans for proposals to improve the welfare of farmed livestock and the Commission indicated that further work on pig welfare would be undertaken in 2005 and proposals on broiler and laying hen welfare were also likely.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/30">Over lunch, Ministers discussed the current state of play in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations and Commissioner Fischer Boel reported on her recent contacts with other parties in Geneva.</p>

	<p pid=".3W.2/1">The Department has not received any representations on this subject in the recent past.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/2">However, we are aware that a report has recently been published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health suggesting such a relationship. The report evaluated childhood cancer by linking residence and migration of children who had fatal tumours (who died 1966&ndash;80) with emission data from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) data for 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/3">The Department of Health has advised as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The Committee on Carcinogenicity (COG) set up a review of cancer in children at its November 2004 meeting. The Committee has recommended a number of follow-up pieces of work which includes a review of published papers on environmental exposures and childhood leukaemia. The new paper from Professor Knox on childhood leukaemia and air pollutants will be considered as part of this review.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".3W.2/5">One of the issues the COC will need to consider is the validity of the assessment of exposure for children who died in 1966&ndash;80 based on emission maps for the year 2001. The magnitude and location of pollution sources is likely to have changed dramatically between these two periods. For instance, emissions of the two pollutants suggested as posing the greatest risk, 1,3-butadiene and carbon monoxide, declined by 64 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively between 1990 and 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.2/1">The intention to include an Animal Welfare Bill in the Government's legislative programme was announced in the Queen's Speech. The Bill will provide new protection for captive and domestic animals in England and Wales, and will replace the current legislation&mdash;the Protection of Animals Act 1911&mdash;which already provides substantial protection against animal abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/2">New EU rules on welfare in transport have recently been published&mdash;Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of <phrase class="date" code="">22 December</phrase> on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97, <i>Official Journal</i> L 3/1&ndash;44 of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-05">5 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/3">The UK supported this new Regulation as it contains much to help improve animal welfare in transport, such as improved enforcement of the rules, better protection for horses and new training and authorisation procedures for drivers. The EU Regulation applies from January 2007; with competence certification for drivers and attendants taking effect from January 2008. Until then, we will continue to ensure that animals are transported strictly in accordance with the current rules.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.2/1">I understand the Environment Agency is currently undertaking a major strategic study (the River Ouse 'Project Appraisal Guidance (PAG) 2' Study) which will examine the need to provide improved flood protection including to properties in York. The outcome of the draft report is due for public consultation in spring 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.2/2">The Yorkshire Regional Flood Defence Committee long-term plan (up to 2013&ndash;14) has allocated an initial sum of &pound;30 million to implement improvements identified in the strategy. Some of these improvements will benefit York city. A more accurate estimate will only be possible when the results of the final strategy report are released later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.2/3">Approximately &pound;270,000 will be spent in 2004&ndash;05 and in future years, on maintaining and improving the condition of flood defences for the benefit of York. (This work includes grass cutting on banks, controlling vermin and routine maintenance and improvement of the extensive mechanical and electrical equipment which forms part of the flood defences, as well as more extensive repairs to the flood defences as identified in the regular, programmed inspections.)</p>
	<p pid=".10W.2/4">Extensive improvements have recently been carried out to refurbish the pumps at the Foss Barrier, to repair the flood defences at North Street and to the Clifton Ings barrier bank. The total cost of the works carried out since the floods of autumn 2000 is over &pound;500,000.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.2/5">Maintenance of and improvements to the flood warning system for York, flood mapping, development control activity, strategic planning and other costs amount to approximately &pound;400,000 to &pound;500,000 per annum, including in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.2/6">The flood warning service for York is comprehensive and staged. Depending on the projected levels in the River Ouse, different warnings are issued to serve different parts of the city. The Environment Agency's knowledge of the catchment area enables warnings to be provided well in excess of two hours before the actual flooding occurs, thereby allowing recipients to take action to protect their property and possessions.</p>

These significant reductions need to be properly planned and managed and experience suggests that a steady reduction over a period of years is likely to be the most effective way to achieve the reductions needed.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.5/2">To help local authorities meet their landfill directive targets the Government will introduce a Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme in England on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. The primary aim of the scheme is to give authorities as much flexibility as possible in reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill, while reassuring Government that the necessary progress towards achieving the directive's targets is being made.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.5/3">The scheme is not intended to inflict major new costs on local authorities not provided for in spending reviews, either by imposing unnecessary penalties or forcing them to take part in trading against their will. It is designed as a tool to help local authorities meet the required reductions in the most cost-effective way and it will allow them to share the burden of meeting the reduction targets.</p>

The first stage of the process is for the relevant highway authority to apply to Defra to have an area designated.

	<p pid=".16W.3/1">The African Union (AU) Summit in Libreville on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January</phrase> was a meeting of the Peace and Security Council (PSC). As far as I am aware, there were no specific proposals for humanitarian or other development assistance made. The subsequent communiqu&eacute; set out the Council's position on the situation in Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. DFID's assessment of these is set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/2" class="italic">(I) Sudan</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/3">DFID shares the AU's concern regarding the humanitarian situation in Sudan.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/4">DFID concurs with the AU's call for an end to violations of the humanitarian ceasefire as well their call to cease attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/5">DFID supports the call for the right of return of all IDP's and refugees affected by the conflicted, but the UK strongly condemns any forced relocations. The UK Ambassador to Sudan has made representations to the Government of Sudan to adhere to its obligations and commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding on Darfur with the International Organisation for Migration, which prohibits involuntary movement of internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/6">With the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Abuja Protocols, the UK has worked hard alongside the AU and UN to ensure that there is the political will among the warring parties to allow humanitarian agencies to do their work. Through its direct support of both the AU monitoring mission and United Nations Security Co-ordinator (UNSECOORD) the UK has sought to provide the effective infrastructure and manpower to achieve this. Since April 2003, the UK has allocated &pound;118.5 million on humanitarian operations in Sudan and its Darfur region, as well as &pound;14 million in support of the AU monitoring mission. It is continuing its support for the next financial year with a commitment of &pound;100 million for Sudan of which &pound;50 million is towards the UN Workplan.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/7" class="italic">(II) Cote d'Ivoire</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/8">The United Kingdom is working closely with the countries of the Africa Union and other members of the international community in support of a durable political settlement in Cote d'Ivoire. DFID welcomes the endorsement of President Mbeki's peace plan at the AU Peace and Security Council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January</phrase>, and we hope that the AU's commitment to peace will encourage all sides to work together to bring about a sustainable peace in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/9">DFID is continuing to monitor the humanitarian situation. During 2004, we provided &pound;1.55 million in humanitarian assistance through international agencies and non-governmental organizations working there.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/10" class="italic">(III) the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</p>
	<p pid=".16W.3/11">The focus was on how to deal with the continuing tensions between the DRC and Rwanda, rather than a consideration of humanitarian, reconstruction and long-term development issues. The Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) welcome the commitments made by the AU to continue to support the DRC peace process and to work towards improving relations between DRC and Rwanda.</p>

	<p pid=".17W.2/1">Recording accurate expenditure on HIV and AIDS is difficult because of the cross-cutting nature of many HIV and AIDS initiatives and of the range of methods used to channel development assistance, including direct budget support to governments and via multilateral organisations. DFID is currently working on ways to better account for expenditure in this area and revised figures may be issued later in the year. The following are estimated figures for bilateral and multilateral independently.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.2/2">In 2003&ndash;04, DFID's bilateral expenditure on projects that targeted HIV and AIDS, was &pound;297 million. This figure reflects all projects that were recorded as having a primary or significant focus on HIV and AIDS or reproductive health. It should be noted that some of these projects will also have had a primary or significant focus on other sectoral areas such as education or health systems development.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.2/3">In addition, expenditure which focused on AIDS through multilateral organisations was estimated at &pound;48 million. This is based on the share of spending which multilateral organisations, supported by DFID, said they directed towards AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.2/4">The overall spend is likely to be in excess of &pound;345 million, as further money has been spent on AIDS directly by partner governments receiving 'Poverty Reduction Budget Support' (PRBS) from the UK. DFID is currently in the process of developing a methodology for estimating the proportion likely to be spent on HIV and AIDS activities, though this exercise is not yet complete.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.2/1">The UK Government allocated &pound;10 million through DFID to meet immediate flood emergency needs of the floods in July 2004. &pound;5 million of this was channelled through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and &pound;5 million through the World Food Programme (WFP). Supporting these two organisations ensured that both food and non-food emergency needs of those affected by the flood were met. This initial &pound;10 million provided food packages of rice, pulses, oil, salt and nutritionally fortified high-energy biscuits; and non-food support, including shelter and agricultural support (such as provision of seedlings) to over 900,000 families (4.5 million people) affected by the floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/2">In August the United Nations launched its Consolidated Appeal for $210 million (&pound;117 million) to meet relief and recovery needs for the next 6 months. Again, the UK Government acted swiftly to meet the extensive recovery and rehabilitation needs of Bangladesh. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-18">18 August</phrase>, DFID's Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, (Mr. Thomas), announced an additional &pound;15 million through DFID for Bangladesh to support the repair, replacement and maintenance of roads and bridges; to provide food, shelter, clean water, sanitation, medial supplies; and to provide funds for cash-for-work programmes to give people affected by the floods the opportunity to earn income to help recover from the floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/3">From this &pound;15 million, &pound;1 million has been channelled to the World Food Programme to support their provision of food to those affected by the floods. &pound;2 million has been channelled through the UNDP to provide temporary and longer-term shelter to flood affected families, working in partnership with the Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED). Another &pound;4 million has been channelled through the UNDP to support NGO-managed 'cash-for-work' programmes. &pound;2 million has been channelled to the World Health Organisation (WHO) through the UNDP to provide medical supplies to maternal and child welfare centres and urban clinics. &pound;2 million has been channelled through the UNDP to United Nations Children's Fund (UNCIEF) to work with the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) to restore access to safe water and sanitation facilities. The final &pound;4 million was provided to the Government of Bangladesh's Roads and Highways Department to support their request for emergency financing for roads, bridges and culverts damaged by the recent floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/4">A further &pound;4 million was channelled to the World Food Programme's Emergency Response Programme (EMOP) in October 2004. This will enable the poorest flood victims to have continued access to food during the period of scarcity, which has followed the floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/5">Staff from the DFID Bangladesh office were extensively involved in responding to the floods in 2004 but no other personnel were involved.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/6">The UK Government expenditure that is channelled through the European Commission and the multilateral development banks has also contributed to the total humanitarian assistance. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO) provided $5.3 million through the UN Flash Appeal, $230 million is being provided through the World Bank and $180 million through the Asian Development Bank as loans to the Government of Bangladesh for a post-flood recovery and assistance programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".19W.2/1">Displaced people are among the poorest and most marginalised people in Burma and are often located in areas where DFID or international agencies have little or no access. Therefore reliable statistics on Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from the Karen and Karenni States are unavailable. DFID cannot access these areas freely and have not made an independent assessment on the number of people displaced. However in October 2004, the Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) estimated that the number of people displaced from their homes in Burma was at least 526,000 in total.</p>
	<p pid=".19W.2/2">Securing increased access to these vulnerable areas is an important objective of DFID. DFID is currently working with international organisations such as the UN to encourage the Burmese authorities to do this. DFID is currently providing &pound;500,000 to support the International Committee of the Red Cross, who have been gradually increasing their access and are now operating in significant areas of the Eastern Burma.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.5/1">Iraqi health care faces enormous and longstanding challenges which pre-date the 2003 conflict. However, the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) has already taken a number of positive steps to strengthen public health services. For example, funding to the health service has increased significantly since April 2003. In addition, through the multi-donor trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank, about $1 billion is available for Iraqi priorities in health and other sectors. Salaries have improved and charges largely abolished, providing free access to health care for all. The Iraqi Ministry of Health, with support from the United Nations, has also developed a set of Planning Guidelines for 2005 which set out national priorities and the objectives and standards that the Ministry expect to achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.5/2">DFID support is focussed on primary health care, through the provision of professional advice to the Ministry of Health in Baghdad and Basra, and a &pound;5 million grant through the World Health Organisation (WHO). Additional DFID support for health services in Iraq is channelled through the multi-donor trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank. DFID has made an initial contribution of &pound;70 million to these trust funds.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-01-24.208729.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-01-24.23W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/727" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="23W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050124/text/50124w07.htm#50124w07.html_spnew4">
	<p pid=".23W.2/1">The most recent national survey of nutritional status conducted in Iraq took place in the second quarter of 2004 by the Iraqi Central Office of Statistics and Information Technology, with technical support from the Fafo Institute for Applied International Studies, Norway. This survey found that 7.5 per cent. of children under five years old were acutely malnourished, defined as low weight for a given height. A UNICEF survey conducted in 2000 found that 6.4 per cent. of children of the same age group were acutely malnourished. Another survey was subsequently conducted in 2002 but it was not nationally representative, and therefore direct comparisons are not valid.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.2/2">All surveys are subject to a certain amount of imprecision and it is not possible to state whether the apparent increase from 6.4 per cent. to 7.5 per cent. reflects a real trend. General child malnutrition&mdash;defined as weight for age&mdash;showed a marked improvement over the same period, falling from 17.3 per cent. to 11.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".23W.2/3">Reducing levels of acute malnutrition means ensuring that adequate supplies of food reach the poorest families whilst also working to tackle poverty and ensure equitable distribution of wealth in the long term. DFID helped to ensure that Iraq's Public Distribution System (PDS) for food was re-established quickly after the conflict in 2003. DFID is now supporting the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) in the development of economic policies which will protect the poorest in Iraq who are dependent on the PDS, whilst reducing the economic distortions created by distributing food, virtually free, to the entire population. The PDS currently accounts for 12.5 per cent. of Iraqi Government expenditure. DFID is also developing a programme aimed at strengthening Iraqi Government capacity to implement pro-poor employment and social protection policies. In addition, DFID programmes in employment generation and political participation are aimed at reducing poverty and ensuring that the needs of the most vulnerable in Iraq are addressed in Government policies.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.0/1">The most recent research focusing on health and mortality in Iraq has been published by Medact, a non-governmental organisation, and by The Lancet.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/2">The Medact report, published in November 2004, was critical of the Iraqi health system, but recognised that the institutional weaknesses were longstanding and pre-date the 2003 conflict and that the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) was addressing these. Medact also acknowledged that health data on Iraq are patchy, often unreliable and that their consultants were unable to visit Iraq to collect field data due to the security situation. The Iraqi MoH has issued a swift and strong rebuttal of the Medact report.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/3">Improving health services presents major challenges and will take time. Despite security constraints, steady progress is being made, and many more hospitals are now functioning and have better access to medicines. Since the Medact survey was conducted the MoH have produced Planning Guidelines for 2005, with support from donors, to meet these challenges. The UN and World Bank managed multi-donor trust funds provide support to the health sector, focusing on the improvement of emergency and primary health care services, which affect the poorest and most vulnerable. DFID has contributed &pound;70 million to the multi-donor trust funds and has also provided technical assistance to the MoH.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/4">The Lancet article of <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-29">29 October 2004</phrase>, looked at mortality in Iraq.

	<p pid=".24W.3/1">The Iraqi Ministry of Finance has reported that it began to distribute welfare payments of $100 to Fallujan families from seven bank branches on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-13">13 January</phrase>. Information is not available on how many families have received this payment to date.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.3/2">US military forces began making payments of $200 to Fallujan families on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-13">13 January</phrase>. By <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January</phrase> they had issued 32,546 payments amounting to approximately $6.5 million. Since the estimated number of Fallujan households is around 36,000, the US military anticipate completing payments soon.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.3/3">DFID's response to the needs of the people of Fallujah has been through the deployment of advisers to the Iraqi Interim Government on humanitarian, health and coordination issues. One consultant was contracted specifically to work on humanitarian coordination in and around Fallujah. Other DFID staff and consultants, either already in Iraq or assigned from headquarters, also contributed to the effort. The cost of this work is being absorbed within existing programmes. Direct financial support for the people of Fallujah, and for the reconstruction of the city, is being provided largely from Iraqi and United States sources.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.3/4">The Iraqi Ministry of Health assessed the needs of Fallujah's displaced population and provided additional staff and medical supplies to the clinics and hospitals in the areas where most of those people were living. Fallujah General Hospital and two primary care clinics in Fallujah are open to provide care for people returning to the city.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.8/1">The Department for International Development has committed &pound;75 million towards immediate humanitarian needs. This assistance is being channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement, non-governmental organisations and by DFID direct action. Of this, &pound;40 million has been pledged as the UK contribution to the UN Flash Appeal. Requests for support from non-governmental organisations are still being received and we are continuing our direct action in support of priority needs.

The UK is also providing Gift Aid relief on the money donated by the British public so far, which could be worth some &pound;15 million. In addition to this, our share of the proposed package of up to &euro;450 million from the European Community budget for immediate and longer-term relief is &euro;90 million (approx. &pound;63 million).</p>
	<p pid=".28W.8/3">On debt relief, Sri Lanka has been added to the list of countries eligible for the UK's multilateral debt relief initiative. The UK will pay 10 per cent. of its debt service costs to the International Development Association (IDA) which amounts to approximately US $5.5 million in 2005, $5.8 million in 2006 and $6.2 million in 2007.</p>

We reported progress towards this target in the second annual report on the delivery of the PFV Strategy, published in October 2004. The percentage of new vehicles sold in 2003 emitting less than 100 g/km CO <sub>2</sub> was less than 0.1 per cent., although 3 per cent. of new cars sold emitted less than 120 g/km CO <sub>2</sub> &mdash;a significant increase on the previous year.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.2/2">The rate of progress in future years will depend, among other things, on how quickly new technologies are developed and introduced, and on the nature of any further EU-wide targets on new car fuel efficiency. We will monitor the situation closely and keep the existing package of measures under review to ensure that it is delivering the progress required, working closely with stakeholders including the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership. The scope for new measures will be considered carefully as part of the Review of the Climate Change Programme which is currently under way.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.2/1">Charges and other conditions applying to designated parking spaces will be set out in the relevant traffic authority's parking order for the spaces concerned. Exemptions from charges, for example for permit holders (usually residents) or for emergency services' and statutory undertakers' vehicles when carrying out their duties, may be included, but it is the authority's responsibility to decide what exemptions, if any, are appropriate in each case. We do not hold information centrally on where particular categories of vehicles, including trade vans servicing private houses, have been considered for, or the subject of, such exemptions.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.2/2">Parking fines or penalty charges are payable where vehicles are parked in contravention of the traffic regulation orders, e.g. yellow lines, or parking order conditions. Again it is for the traffic authority to decide whether exemptions, such as those mentioned above, to any parking restrictions should be provided in the orders. In general, any exceptions would usually be kept to a minimum otherwise they could detract from the purpose for which the restrictions were made and make enforcement more difficult. Vehicles covered by such an exemption in the relevant order would not be liable for a fine or penalty.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.5/1">I have not commissioned or evaluated any recent research on the risk to the marine environment in UK coastal waters from single hull tankers.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.5/2">However, the UK has played a key role in both the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the EU in negotiating an acceleration of a programme to phase-out single hull tankers from world trade, while ensuring continuity of energy supply. The IMO has recently agreed to an accelerated programme, under which the large majority of single hull tankers will have been phased out by the end of 2010. Single hull tankers which will be under 25 years of age at the end of 2010 will be allowed to continue in service until the end of 2015, or on reaching age 25 if earlier, but only if they first pass a rigorous assessment of their condition. Based on the IMO agreement, there is a EU Regulation, now in force, which prohibits single hull tankers entering or leaving EU ports and anchorages when carrying heavy grades of oil as cargo.</p>

We have recently committed some &pound;15,000 to help fund a meeting of the CITES Tiger Enforcement Task Force to co-ordinate action to combat the illicit trade in Asian big cat skins. We have also made &pound;20,000 available to assist the Indian Government in establishing a Wildlife Crime Cell to help address the illegal trade in wildlife in that country.</p>

There is also a dedicated Customs enforcement team at Heathrow Airport responsible for enforcing the international controls in CITES species. We also monitor the major internet sites and take enforcement action where possible illegal sales of wildlife items are identified. Internet crime is one of the growth areas that I have asked the National Wildlife Crime Intelligence Unit to focus particular attention on.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.5/1">Most of the matters for which the Department is responsible in England have been devolved in Wales to the National Assembly for Wales. However, there are some reserved areas in which the Government has introduced initiatives which affect the Clwyd, South constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/2">The Licensing Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 repealed those parts of the Licensing Act 1964 which allowed the local government electorate in the counties and county boroughs of Wales to requisition polls to decide whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays. This has removed the uncertainty which businesses in Wales, including those in Clwyd South, faced, allowing them to exercise long-term planning. It also removes a costly administrative burden on local authorities and an artificial difference in licensing controls between Wales and England, which prevented businesses and customers exercising freedom of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/3">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Clwyd South, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/4">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Clwyd, South has benefited from over 280 awards totalling over &pound;5.6 million. Of these, 70 awards worth over &pound;1.5 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.0/1">Access by children to films in video/DVD format and computer games is controlled by the Video Recordings Act 1984, under which supplying videos, DVDs or games classified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to those who do not meet the age requirements is punishable by a fine of up to &pound;5,000, a prison sentence of up to six months, or both. The Cinemas Act 1985, provides for the licensing of cinemas by local authorities, and under these arrangements controls on access by children to cinemas can be stipulated. In 2003, only 32 (or 2 per cent.) of the 1,484 computer games published depicted 'gross violence' and therefore required legal classification by the BBFC.

	<p pid=".50W.5/2">Ministry of Defence officials in Gibraltar first received correspondence from Marrache and Company, the solicitors acting for the Gibraltar Services Police Association (GSPSA), in February 2004. MOD officials have been involved in a long exchange of correspondence with the solicitors in which they have consistently set out the Department's intention to recover the over-payment. Marrache and Company have had a copy of the letter from MOD officials to the GSPSA, which sets out the Department's position in detail, since February 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.9/1">The ability to man the five battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland will depend on a number of factors. It is not possible to predict its establishment until it is clear what roles the battalions of the regiment will be assigned. Recruitment to the Scottish Division has recently been slightly depressed not least by coverage of 'Save the Regiment' campaigns. However, assuming that the establishment of the future battalions remains broadly similar to current levels and a return to the recruiting levels achieved in recent years, levels of enlistment to the Royal Regiment of Scotland should be sufficient to sustain five battalions.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.3/4">One of these options involves pilot work to look at the &quot;block grant&quot; approach, whereby tenants pay an affordable rent for their accommodation, assisted through the housing benefit scheme where appropriate, with the extra costs funded by way of a direct central Government grant.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>, we published the report &quot;A Stepping Stone to Employment&quot; with the findings of the independent research commissioned by my Department into the first two years of operation of the permitted work rules. Copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.8/2">The permitted work rules allow people with health conditions and disabilities to try out paid work while remaining on benefits, as a stepping stone to full-time work. The research showed that people on incapacity benefits participating in permitted work have been helped to return to full-time jobs and many of those surveyed found that their health conditions were not the barriers to work that they originally thought.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.8/3">The Chancellor announced changes to the rules in the pre-Budget report based on the key findings of the research. Our overall intention is to bring more people into permitted work with the eventual aim of progressing into full-time employment. Therefore, we will be introducing measures to improve permitted work by raising greater awareness of the provision and encouraging more people to take advantage of the scheme; there will be more regular face-to-face contact with personal advisers and staff will get new guidance and training materials. The rules will be simplified by allowing all participants an initial period of 52 weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.8/4">However, we are also acknowledging the position of those least likely to progress into full-time work. We are exploring ways to allow people with progressive conditions to be able to continue permitted work beyond the initial 52 weeks without being limited to earnings of &pound;20.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.0/2">Estimates of the number of pensioners with low income under a different policy, such as that described in the question, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. However, using the Department's Policy Simulation Model for 2004&ndash;05 it has been estimated that the effect of paying the maximum rate of basic state pension to all pensioners is a reduction in the order of five percentage points of the proportion of pensioner couples with incomes below 60 per cent. of median income, on both the &quot;before housing costs&quot; and on the &quot;after housing costs&quot; measures. The proportion of single female pensioners and single male pensioners on low income is estimated to remain broadly unchanged as a result of paying the full amount of basic state pension to all pensioners.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.3/1">As I said in this House on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>, the Agreement was not set in stone when first signed and it was clearly always the intention that certain elements would be open to change; the commitment to review and report on its operation, which was written into the Agreement itself, would have made no sense otherwise. Equally, certain fundamental aspects of the Agreement have always been regarded by the Governments and the other parties who supported it as fundamental, and not open to change.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.3/2">We do not envisage any textual amendment of the Agreement at all. But, as the hon. Lady will have seen, our proposals would involve a number of changes in the way the Agreement operates.</p>

	<p pid=".65W.4/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".65W.4/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary Question about the condition of Northern Ireland's water infrastructure and the main cause of the failure of that infrastructure to meet EU Directive standards (208414). I have been asked to reply as the issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid=".65W.4/4" class="indent">Water Service's second Asset Management Plan (NIAMP2), which was completed in 2003, identified that &pound;2.9 billion needs to be invested over the next 20 years to modernise the existing water and sewerage infrastructure. NIAMP2 assessed the condition of the Water Service's above ground assets including treatment works, pumping stations, etc. and less than 5 per cent. were considered to be in poor condition or functionally unsound. While the condition of the above ground assets is generally good, many of the current treatment works were not designed to meet the more stringent standards associated with current EU Directives. The upgrading of water and wastewater treatment works accounts for &pound;1 billion of the total investment required. It is much more difficult to define the condition of below ground assets, but use of an industry recognised statistical model identified an investment need for this asset group of almost double that required for above ground assets. Over two-thirds of this below ground investment is attributable to keeping the networks in a serviceable condition over the 20 year period.</p>
	<p pid=".65W.4/5" class="indent">The failure of the water and sewerage infrastructure to meet current EU Directives relates mainly to the fact that many of the current treatment works need to be upgraded. New treatment processes associated with new technology are often needed to meet the quality standards associated with current EU Directives. Priority is at present being given to upgrading water and wastewater treatment works and it is planned to accelerate spending on network refurbishment within the next few years as the treatment works upgrading programme nears completion.</p>

	<p pid=".66W.9/1">The 10-Year Childcare Strategy, published in December 2004, set out the Government's vision for every child to have the best start in life and for parents to have more choice about how to balance work and family life.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.9/2">Our long-term aim is for affordable, flexible, high quality child care to be available for all families with children under 14. We are making substantial additional investment in early years and child care over the next three years: the Sure Start budget will more than double from this year to 2007&ndash;08. This includes a new Transformation Fund of &pound;125 million a year from 2006&ndash;07, which will support investment in high quality, affordable and sustainable child care.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.9/3">Parents on low and middle incomes will continue to have their child care costs subsidised through tax credits. From April 2005 the maximum child care element of the working tax credit will increase from &pound;135 to &pound;175 for one child and from &pound;200 to &pound;300 for two or more children. Eligible parents will be able to claim up to 70 per cent. of these limits; this will increase to 80 per cent. from April 2006. These changes should benefit 20,000 families straight away and many more over time.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.9/4">From 2006 the 12.5 hour free entitlement to early education for 33 weeks per year will extended to cover 38 weeks a year for all three and four&ndash;year-olds. From 2007 the free entitlement will begin to increase to 15 hours per week with all children receiving 15 hours by 2010, as a step towards a goal of 20 hours per week. Parents will have the flexibility to use the free entitlement across a minimum of three days. In addition, we will pilot an extension of free, part time early education to 12,000 two-year-olds in disadvantaged areas by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.9/5">We will establish 2,500 children's centres by 2008, and all young children and their families in the most disadvantaged areas will have access to the high quality integrated services children's centres provide. The 10-Year Strategy sets out a commitment to 3,500 centres by 2010&mdash;one in every community.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.9/6">In London, from next year, my Department will be working with the Greater London Authority to test a range of approaches aimed at improving the accessibility and affordability of good quality child care for parents on lower incomes through supply side subsidy. These pilots should benefit more than 10,000 families.</p>

Funding will be used to provide support at school level to enable the delivery of a set of core services including school age child care. We realise that schools cannot deliver the child care offer on their own and we are encouraging them to work in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers and other schools to deliver child care. Local authorities will be able to advise schools of wider groups, agencies and services that are willing to work in partnership to develop extended services.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.8/5">My Department is also providing logistical support. The Extended Schools Prospectus, which is due to be launched shortly will set out the vision for extended schools, including child care to schools, local authorities, key stakeholders and the private and voluntary sector. It will draw on the practical experience of schools already delivering services, providing 'how to' advice and case studies on a range of issues, including working with local partners. The prospectus will be available on the teachernet website, so that it can be updated with new issues as they emerge (<a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools">www. teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools</a>).</p>

	<p pid=".70W.2/43">Expenditure will include those in need of protection. Data on Local Authority Personal Social Services expenditure is available at: <a href="http://www.publications.doh.gov.uk/public/pssstat.htm">http://www.publications. doh.gov.uk/public/pss stat.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/44">For 2005&ndash;06 the Government are making available &pound;4,284 million for children's social services through formula spending and grants, an increase of 7.6 per cent. on 2004&ndash;05. Councils are free to decide how much of these resources to use on child protection services.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/45">In addition, the DfES is responsible for section 64 grants for children's social services. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills, through the Safeguarding Children and Supporting Families Grants Scheme (section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 as amended), has power to make grants to voluntary organisations in England whose activities support the DfES's policy priorities for children's social care. Grants may be paid for up to three years.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/46">The grants are discretionary and terms and conditions agreed by Ministers and HM Treasury apply. Competition for the available funds is always very strong, and priority is given to applications with innovative proposals of national significance that will complement statutory services and so help secure provision of high quality children's social care.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/47">The DfES values its partnership with the voluntary and community sector across the whole of children's social care. Making effective use of Safeguarding Children and Supporting Families Grants and other powers at national and local level is central to this relationship.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/48">The total budget for the Safeguarding Children and Supporting Families Grants Scheme in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;4.2 million including existing grants. Of this, we expect approximately &pound;1.67 million to be available for new grant awards in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/49">Of the 127 applications received in the 2004&ndash;05 Round, Minister awarded 47 grants totalling &pound;2.812 million.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/50">Furthermore, the Local Authority Social Services Letter (2003)7 announced the introduction of the Safeguarding Children Specific Formula Grant of &pound;90 million. It also announced a capital grant of &pound;10 million to support the development of information technology systems for children's social services. The &pound;10 million was the first tranche of a total grant of &pound;30 million payable in 2004&ndash;05, 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07.</p>

Our long term investment includes a guarantee of child care being available from 8 am to 6 pm, all year round, for all parents of children aged five to 11. The guarantee will help the very varied needs of children and families. Obviously we do not expect most children to spend all their time in school when schools are open for longer, but parents will be able to choose hours which meet their needs and the needs of their children. We expect at least half of parents to benefit from this offer by 2008, and all by 2010. By 2008, at least a third of all secondary schools will be open from 8 am to 6 pm, all year round offering a range of activities for 11 to14 year olds. By 2010, all secondary schools will be part of a network offering this provision. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local childminders.</p>

	<p pid=".79W.5/1">The Government's aim is that all vulnerable children should be able to access good quality education. The Standards Fund Vulnerable Children Grant was introduced in the 2003&ndash;04 financial year to help local education authorities (LEAs) to achieve this aim.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/2">The key groups whose needs the Vulnerable Children Grant is designed to address are: looked after children; children who are unable to attend school because of medical needs; gypsy/traveller children; asylum seekers, young carers, school refusers, teenage parents and young offenders. This list is not prescriptive or exclusive. Many of these children will face multiple challenges, sometimes including homelessness. The grant may be used by LEAs to meet the needs of any vulnerable children identified by them as needing support, including those who are homeless. This discretionary approach allows local needs to be addressed more flexibly and responsively than would be possible using central direction.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.5/3">In November last year the Department published an evaluation of the Vulnerable Children Grant undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). One of the key findings of the report was that the grant had enabled LEAs to provide support for a variety of vulnerable groups. The NFER reported that in some LEAs surveyed the grant had been used to support children who are socially vulnerable, for example children living in vulnerable accommodation such as women's refuges, or children who were the subject of family breakdown or changes in home circumstances.</p>

This guidance covered the aims of education service provision and the contribution which qualified teachers of the deaf could make, working alongside health and other professionals.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.5/3">Since then, additional material has been made available through our Early Support Programme. This includes a monitoring protocol to check the progress which deaf children make in the first three years or so after deafness has been identified, an information booklet on deafness for parents and a service audit tool for supporting the development and improvement of services for disabled children under three and their families.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.0/1">Over the past few years the Department has both commissioned and jointly funded external studies to examine benefits and potential barriers for outdoor education; outdoor learning, including fieldwork; out-of-classroom learning, including museums and galleries and residential experiences; and out-of-hours learning. We may commission further research into specific aspects of some or all of these. We have no plans to ask Ofsted to survey outdoor education in all schools. We have not made an assessment of the role of out-of-classroom learning in increasing physical activity or inclusivity in schools. We have not sent any guidance to Academies on outdoor learning.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.0/2">We are in talks with the NASUWT regarding their long-standing concerns about out of classroom safety. In particular, we are investigating with them what else we could do to help local authorities and schools ensure that investigations following pupil accidents are fair to school staff, as well as to pupils and their parents. The National Curriculum has statutory requirements in PE and geography for all pupils to experience learning outside the classroom. We are developing further practical steps to encourage schools to expand provision for all pupils, across and beyond the National Curriculum, including trips and visits.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.11/2">To demonstrate what this could mean, we developed exemplar designs for schools fit for the 21st century. The exemplars show how to create high quality, modern school buildings with the latest integrated ICT systems. They show how to provide attractive, imaginative and stimulating environments, which are also safe and secure places for children to learn in. These are some of the requirements that are needed in a school for the future. They should also be inclusive, so that no child is left out and all can achieve their full potential, and be open to wider use, strengthening schools connection with their local communities. Overall, the transformation of the secondary school estate will help to raise standards and will play a crucial part in our ambitious programme of educational reform.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.2/1">The Further Education funding system is different to schools. Funding is paid for learning aims as well as an entitlement per 16 to 18 payment.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/2">Under the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC's) funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels in a sixth form college and a further education college to a student in the 2004/05 academic year will be &pound;3,045. This figure comprises &pound;766 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, and &pound;747 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/3">Under the LSC's funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels to a student at an English maintained secondary school will be &pound;3,212. This figure comprises &pound;785 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, &pound;750 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme, and &pound;107 for each student to meet additional employers' contributions to teachers' pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/4">These figures do not represent all funding that colleges and school sixth forms receive and are not directly comparable. For example the further education funding rates include consolidated funds for pay and staff training that are not reflected in the school sixth form rates. Also, in each case additional funding may also be available to take account of the higher costs of delivering learning in particular geographical areas, in higher cost subjects, or to students with particular disadvantages or individual needs.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/5">It is expected that base funding rates per qualification will be increased by 4 per cent. for school sixth forms and by 5 per cent. for further education colleges, on a broadly comparable basis, in 2005/06. LSC will decide funding rates for each academic year nearer the time in light of the funding it has available and where priorities lie.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/6">The Department is discussing with the LSC how to take forward the next stage of the Skills Strategy from 2006/07, including the roll out of a National Employer Training Programme, and more broadly how the increases in funding from the 2004 Spending Review are applied, and until those discussions are concluded it will not be possible to set out precise forecasts of FE funding per learner.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.2/1">The majority of funding for schools is distributed according to a locally agreed formula which will include factors for SEN and deprivation. Most pupils with SEN are in mainstream schools and are funded through their authority's local funding formula. This enables schools to intervene early and make good arrangements to meet children's needs while ensuring that these pupils are fully included. It is for local authorities to decide how best to distribute their funding.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.2/2">Up to 2003&ndash;04 a grant for special educational needs was paid to all local education authorities through the Standards Fund; North Yorkshire's allocation was &pound;788,153; of which 50 per cent. was government grant and 50 per cent. contributed by the local authority. In 2004&ndash;05, this allocation was increased by 4 per cent. to &pound;819,679 for North Yorkshire. In 2004&ndash;05 a number of previously separate grants for schools including the grant for SEN were brought together within a single grant&mdash;the School Development Grant. This grant is allocated to schools to use for any purpose to promote school improvement, including special educational needs. In 2003&ndash;04 LEAs could retain 50 per cent. of the SEN grant for central support for special educational needs. In 2004&ndash;05, LEAs are allowed to retain the same cash amount from their schools development grant for these purposes.</p>

However, changes we are introducing for the 2005/06 academic year will pro-rate the amount of fee support that a part-time student receives to the intensity of their part-time study. This Government are the only one to have provided support for part-time students. Prior to academic year 1998/99 no financial support of any kind was available to them. Since then we have introduced schemes which have enabled some part-time students to have their tuition fees met, to qualify for disabled students' allowances and to take out loans to cover course costs. In 2004/05 a new package of grants was introduced and this is being improved on further in 2005/06.</p>

As part of the LAA, Sure Start local programme funding would not be ring fenced.</p>

Kent CC will also be expected to continue to involve parents, children and community groups in the planning and delivery of services, and that will be reflected in the assessment of their performance. If Kent decide not to include Sure Start local programme funding within the local area agreement then the Sure Start local programmes revenue grant will be paid to the programmes' accountable bodies as in earlier years.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.5/1">Sure Start Local Programmes are area-based programmes bringing together health and family support services with play, learning and child care opportunities to give young children living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged communities the best possible start in life. Some programmes with large numbers of homeless families in their catchment areas have specifically targeted the needs of homeless families, for example by providing play and advice sessions for children living in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.5/2">The experience of local programmes and other services has shown that Sure Start, with its combination of universal and targeted services and focus on outreach, has been effective in reaching groups such as homeless families who often fall through the service network. By providing them with information and support, services encourage such groups to access services. Many Sure Start services have also supported mainstream services to reach out to and be more responsive to the particular needs of homeless families.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.5/3">A major evaluation of Sure Start Local Programmes began in January 2001. This is looking at: the impact of the programme in the short, medium and long-term; access and quality of services; and its cost-effectiveness. One aspect will be to assess the outreach and home visiting services in place within programmes and the methods being developed to meet the needs of hard- to-reach families. Information will be available in summer 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.5/4">The Government's 10-year strategy for child care, announced in December 2004, aims to provide every family with easy access to integrated services through children's centres and extended schools in their local community. They will build on the success of Local Programmes and other initiatives for young children and families. 2,500 centres will be in place by 2008, and 3,500 by 2010. They will be proactive in reaching out to ensure that families who do not access services readily, including homeless families, nonetheless receive the help and support they need.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.5/5">The Sure Start Unit is continuing to develop approaches for piloting, from April 2006, ways of ensuring that particularly disadvantaged 2-year-old children, including homeless children, receive Sure Start services.</p>

	<p pid=".97W.6/1">Antisocial behaviour is defined in the Part 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for the purposes of seeking Anti-social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) as behaviour that is likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress. For the purposes of seeking a Housing Injunction under Section 153A of the Housing Act 1996 antisocial behaviour is defined as conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance. It is important to note that both definitions relate specifically to these legislative measures and are not to be taken as general definitions of what constitutes anti-social behaviour.</p>

The term 'antisocial behaviour' includes a variety of behaviour covering a whole complex of selfish and unacceptable activity that can blight the quality of community life. Other terms such as 'nuisance', 'neighbour disputes' and 'disorder' are also used to describe some of this behaviour. A legal definition of behaving in an antisocial manner is found in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, this definition is used in relation to anti-social behaviour orders.

	<p pid=".108W.8/2">The Immigration and Nationality Department's (IND) criminal casework team recruited an additional 16 staff in November 2004 to ensure that the deportation cases are considered at an earlier stage into the sentence and to afford those being detained greater priority. It is additionally currently recruiting a further seven immigration officers to increase the number of surgery visits conducted across the Prison Service estate in order to complete applications for replacement passports at an earlier stage where they have been lost or destroyed.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.5/2">We recognise that advocacy services are an important element in supporting victims of domestic violence, both in and outside the criminal justice system. It is important that there is a range of services for all victims of domestic violence locally, including advocacy provision, which is the responsibility of local partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.5/3">Each partnership is required to produce a strategy every three years for reducing crime and disorder in their area, following an audit to establish need. These audits were undertaken earlier this year, and partnerships should now be identifying what the needs of their local communities are, including for services addressing domestic violence. They will then set out how these needs will be met in their three year strategies, bearing in mind their budgets, which come from a range of sources. There is no ring fenced funding for domestic violence advocacy services from the Home Office, though the Department allocated those local partnerships with responsibility for crime and disorder &pound;74 million in 2004&ndash;05 through the Building Safer Communities Fund. Among a variety of interventions, this could be spent on domestic violence services.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.5/4">How local services are then commissioned is a matter for local areas, though we would recommend that they consider working in partnership with voluntary and community organisations where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.5/5">The precise remit of individual advocacy services will be based on identified local need, and may include a range of emotional, legal and practical support.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.5/6">To support partnerships in developing their three year strategies and considering the range of domestic violence services that might be appropriate in their area, we have recently launched 'Developing Domestic Violence Partnerships: A Guide for Partnerships', which includes a section on advocacy and where partnerships can go for further advice. The guidance can be found at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/domesticviolence46.doc">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/domesticviolence46.doc</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.6/1">Chip and PIN is a finance and retail industry initiative that aims to reduce plastic card fraud by requiring card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a PIN rather than signing a receipt. At the same time the introduction of microchips into cards will help prevent the production of counterfeit cards (skimming). The public trial of Chip and PIN was a success and national roll out has now started, with a view to the majority of card transactions being Chip and PIN by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.6/2">The Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimates that without Chip and PIN card fraud might have risen to &pound;1 billion by the end of the decade.

	<p pid=".116W.2/2">The biometric requirements for the identity card are not yet complete. However, it is expected that the applicant will be required to attend an enrolment centre in order to have images of other biometrics, such as fingerprints and irises recorded.

The measures in the Bill will make small and sensible adjustments to existing legislation.

	<p pid=".120W.0/2">Although we have started to explore what longer term organisational change might be needed to deliver NOMS in its final state, detailed feasibility work and further consultation will be needed before decisions are made. Creating a 'central spine' of accountability from offender managers to the National Offender Manager is crucial to implementing the Carter reforms and we are now looking at organisational models which will deliver this. We are discussing with the Probation Boards Association the changes to the role of Boards which it is likely will be involved, and will continue to be open in planning the &quot;end state&quot; for NOMS.</p>

The case for cooperation between sectors, for instance through a consortium rests on value for money.

	<p pid=".120W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-26">26 April 2002</phrase>, the Government launched a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit (the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit(DCPCU) based in London, which works closely with the banking industry to reduce organised card and cheque fraud, using intelligence largely provided by the card industry. The Home Office funded 25 per cent. of the unit's costs (&pound;1.4 million over two years) during the pilot with the remainder being met by the card industry. An independent evaluation of the unit showed that it had been successful in detecting or preventing a significant amount of cheque and credit card fraud. Government are delighted that the unit is now continuing with full financial support provided by the card industry. The Home Office continues to chair the Steering Group.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.6/2">We have been encouraging financial and retail sectors to work towards early implementation of more secure systems to combat fraud. This includes Chip and PIN, a finance and retail industry initiative that aims to reduce plastic card fraud by requiring card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a PIN rather than signing a receipt. At the same time the introduction of microchips into cards will help prevent the production of counterfeit cards (skimming). The public trial of Chip and PIN was a success and national roll out is under way.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.6/3">The Home Office publishes fraud prevention advice on its website and has launched a website to combat internet fraud. The e-tailing mini site forms part of the crime reduction website and provides information to help both consumers and businesses protect themselves when buying and selling over the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.6/4">The Home Office has also published, jointly with APACS, a leaflet for members of the public about safe credit card use. Supplies of the leaflet have been sent to all police forces and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership's in England and Wales. It is also available on the Home Office website.</p>

	<p pid=".122W.0/2">The United Kingdom Passport Service is working on detailed proposals for implementing this requirement, including establishing a network of new offices where the interview will be held. While these proposals are not yet finalised, the aim, using a 70&ndash;80 office model, would be that nearly 97 per cent. of applicants would have an interview office within 20 miles of their home, 2.4 per cent. would be in a 20&ndash;40 mile radius with only 0.7 per cent. having to travel further than 40 miles. Wherever possible, applicants will be given the flexibility to choose when and where they are interviewed within the network, and we will, as far as practicable, manage office opening hours to suit applicant demand. For those in more remote areas of the UK, we are considering the practicality of mobile facilities or peripatetic staff. We have no plans at present to provide financial assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy that would be developed over the coming year. It can be summarised as, &quot;Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons&quot;. This follows extensive consultations including those with the Howard League, Prison Reform Trust, Inquest, the Youth Justice Board, Prisons and Probations Ombudsman, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Samaritans and the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.5/2">This strategy builds on the three-year safer custody strategy that ran from April 2001 and has a close relationship with issues of resettlement, detoxification, health, purposeful activity, as well as staff attitudes, leadership and training. Key achievements were the setting up of suicide prevention co-ordinators or equivalents in all prisons across the estate, an investment of over &pound;21 million at six 'safer local' pilot sites and the development of a safer prison design, including &quot;safer cells&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.5/3">Clearly, all self-inflicted deaths in prison are deeply regrettable. To accompany the three-year safer custody strategy, a target was set for reducing the rate of self- inflicted deaths per 100,000 prisoners from the 1999&ndash;2000 figure of 141 to 112.8 by 2004&ndash;05. A rate of about 130 deaths per 100,000 is projected for 2004&ndash;05. The prisoner targets are being reconsidered in the light of experience.</p>

	<p pid=".127W.0/63">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy that would be developed over the coming year. It can be summarised as, &quot;Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons&quot;. It has a close relationship with issues of resettlement, detoxification, health, purposeful activity and staff training.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.0/64">The strategy recognises that prisoners are at particular risk of harming themselves in their early period in custody, when they are coping with issues of fear of imprisonment, detoxification or the impact of arrest on their family. Equally such risk is heightened when a prisoner's custodial status changes, for example when convicted or sentenced.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.0/65">Remand prisoners form a large proportion of the prisoners in early custody and are therefore subject to a number of assessments and policies designed to enhance their safety. Any new prisoner or one whose status has changed has an interview with a reception healthcare screener, who looks for signs that a prisoner may self-harm. Induction sessions for new prisoners emphasise the support that is available, from staff, health care and other specialists, and from prisoner peer supporters such as insiders or Samaritans-trained listeners. The importance of maintaining contact with family and employers, and providing support to prisoners in respect of maintaining their housing, is further emphasised through the Custody to Work programme.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.0/66">The Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) are working closely together to prevent the suicides of young people held in their care. The YJB funds a dedicated juvenile outreach team to specifically assist juvenile establishments further develop and maintain their local suicide and self-harm prevention strategies. As part of the national Prison Service suicide prevention strategy, a separate (but linked) strategy is being developed for juveniles.</p>

	<p pid=".132W.11/1">The issue of appropriate accommodation is addressed prior to an offender's release as part of his licence conditions; this could include consideration for approved premises. For offenders who potentially pose a risk of harm to the public, this is managed under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), which include local housing authorities and registered social landlords as part of the duty to co-operate.</p>

Finding employment is managed by local arrangement and suitability of any such employment is evaluated. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for disqualification orders, which make it a criminal offence for convicted sex offenders to seek employment that would provide unsupervised access to children.</p>

	<p pid=".133W.2/1">The main risk created by overcrowding is that prisoners do not complete offending behaviour programmes to which they have been assigned because they are transferred to another establishment before the programme is completed. It is well understood in the Prison Service that prisoners who have started an offending behaviour programme should not be moved before the programme is completed.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.2/2">The Prison Service monitors the delivery of all offending behaviour programmes for the proportion of prisoners who do not complete. The number of prisoners who start but do not complete the Sex Offender Treatment Programme is small and reasons include illness, breach of group rules and the offender voluntarily withdrawing. We believe that the number who do not complete because of overcrowding is negligible.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.0/1">Ratifying the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families would require a number of changes to UK legislation. The Convention would give migrants the same access to public funds and services as British citizens, regardless of their length of stay in the UK. Changes would be required to enable these migrant workers to access benefits, housing, education and social services.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/2">Overseas nationals who are granted settlement in the UK are entitled to claim income-related benefits and non-contributory benefits and to access social housing in the same way as a British citizen. Individuals coming to the UK for employment have to support themselves and any dependants without recourse to public funds. However, state school education and treatment under the NHS do not qualify as public funds under the Immigration Rules. So migrant workers without settlement do have access to state education services and, as long as they remain in employment, NHS services. We believe that to extend this access to all benefits before these workers are settled in the UK would act as an unnecessary &quot;pull factor&quot; and undermine immigration controls.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/3">We have no plans to ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. The rights of migrant workers are already protected in UK law, including under the Human Rights Act 1998 and we believe we have struck the right balance between the need for immigration control and the protection of the interests and rights of migrant workers.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.5/1">At Report Stage of the Mental Capacity Bill the Government undertook to amend the Bill in two key areas. The amendments fulfilling these commitments have now been tabled for debate at Committee in the House of Lords. They provide additional reassurance sought by the House in two key areas. The first amendment relates to decisions about life-sustaining treatment in the context of best interests determinations for people who lack capacity. It provides that when someone is making a decision about whether the provision of life-sustaining treatment is in the best interests of a person lacking capacity, he cannot be motivated by any desire that the person lacking capacity should die&mdash;for whatever reason. The amendment tabled in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase> will replace the existing clause 4(5). It states:</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;Where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment he must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about his death.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/3">This emphasises that the person assessing best interests must look only at the treatment which might be given, for example its possible benefits and burdens. He must not bring into the process any wish or desire to end the person's life. This should lay to rest any lingering doubt that the Bill will permit euthanasia.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/4">The second area of amendments concerns advance decisions to refuse treatment. The amendments tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase> mean that an advance decision will have no application to any treatment which a doctor considers necessary to sustain life unless strict formalities have been complied with. These are that the decision must be in writing, signed and witnessed. In addition, there must be an express statement that the decision stands &quot;even if life is at risk&quot;. These amendments build on the already significant safeguards in the Bill surrounding advance decisions, and respond in particular to points raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>

	<p pid=".146W.5/2">The United Kingdom has one of the strictest and most transparent arms export licensing systems of any country. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. The criteria include our commitment not to issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. The Government will also exercise special caution and vigilance in issuing licences to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established by the competent bodies of the UN, the Council of Europe or by the EU.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.11/1">Free trade unions can have a vital role to play in the development of democracy, human rights and economic prosperity. The Foreign arid Commonwealth Office (FCO) has sought to promote the development of free trade unions in many parts of the world. For example, the FCO has supported the development of better labour market practices through programmes within the Global Opportunities Fund. These countries have included China, Serbia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The delivery of the programmes has often involved close working between the FCO and the UK trade unions. The FCO has also provided logistical support and briefing to UK trade unions in their own work in seeking to promote the development of free trade unions in various countries. These have included Iraq, China, Zimbabwe, the Occupied Territories and Israel. The FCO has established a strong partnership with the Trades Union Congress in Britain in support of many of these activities and initiatives. For example, the FCO set up a conference for regional trades unionists in Antigua in 2004 in close consultation with the TUC.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.2/1">The UK plays a key role in international efforts to combat illegal logging and to encourage sustainable forest management. This will be an objective for our presidencies of the G8 and EU in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/2">The UK is working with EU partners on the development of the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. This includes the development of EU legislation to prevent illegal timber from entering into the European market and negotiation of Voluntary Partnership Agreements with key timber producing countries. These agreements will require partner countries to establish schemes to licence legally produced timber. Timber originating in FLEGT partner countries will not be permitted to be imported into the EU without such licences. The UK also supports Forest Law Enforcement and Governance regional initiatives in Africa and Asia to help developing countries strengthen their forest governance and trade.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.2/3">As part of this overall approach, the UK Government have been seeking, since July 2000, to purchase their timber from legal and sustainable sources and have been promoting the benefits of this policy to other countries, particularly those that import significant quantities of timber.</p>

Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.2/1">The UK is a leading supporter of greater transparency at the IMF and World Bank, and has held extensive discussions with the IMF and World Bank to encourage publication of minutes, lending and policy decisions, and more transparent decision-making. These discussions have taken place at ministerial level through the Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development, and at official level through the UK's Executive Director at the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".164W.2/2">There has been significant progress in recent years, with the agreement in 2003 of new IMF guidelines which presume publication of all surveillance, programme and policy documents. Programmes which involve exceptional access to fund resources will not normally be approved unless authorities agree to publish programme documents. In addition, the IMF board's agenda is made public in advance, and decisions are published through Public Information Notices. Discussions are ongoing at the World Bank on the extension of their transparency policy. The Treasury's Annual Report to Parliament on the UK and the IMF, and DFID's Report on the UK and the World Bank, will set out in greater detail the UK's position on transparency in these two institutions.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.12/1">We are committed to supporting all national health service staff, including those least-well qualified, to realise their potential; to the benefit of the NHS, their communities, and themselves. The workforce development strategy, the &quot;Skills Escalator&quot;, is one way in which NHS employers can do this.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.12/2">The &quot;Skills Escalator&quot; is about attracting and enabling a wider range of people to work within the NHS and giving those already in the NHS the opportunity to develop and enhance their skills and take on new and more challenging roles.

	<p pid=".171W.12/3">The NHS Plan (July 2000) pledged major investment to develop staff who do not have professional qualifications. During the three years from April 2003, over &pound;180 million will be invested in support of NHS learning accounts, national vocational qualifications (NVQs), adult literacy, numeracy and language skills (Skills for Life) development. This investment will support learning opportunities for up to 240,000 staff.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.12/4">Between April 2001 and September 2002 more than 43,000 staff accessed either a NHS learning account or NVQ training&mdash;of which over 21,000 undertook NVQ training to levels 2 or 3. Between April 2003 and March 2004 this rose to more than 65,000 staff accessing an NHS learning account and more than 34,000 undertaking NVQ training to levels 2 or 3.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.12/5">For social care, funding of &pound;15 million is being provided through the Topss England national training strategy grant, with the aim of having an additional 300,000 social care staff qualified to NVQ2 or higher by 2006. Funding is also provided to local councils through the national training strategy grant.</p>

These included support for secure access using smartcards and user authentication, patient demographic information and the protocols for secure messaging, data storage and retrieval. Alongside these elements of the NHS care record, the application for electronic appointment booking for patients went live in early adopter sites in July 2004. Work is now well advanced to introduce electronic prescriptions during early 2005, with the core application delivered for integration testing by the end of 2004 as planned. The new national network is now on track to deliver, and probably exceed, contracted broadband connections by the end of March 2005. Progress has also been made on other national programme for information technology (NPfIT) services, particularly the roll out of the quality management and analysis system (QMAS) application to support the general medical service contract and the implementation of the new contract with Cable and Wireless to deliver the &quot;Contact&quot; e-mail service.</p>

	<p pid=".173W.3/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) develops its guidance after careful consideration of the available evidence, and in close consultation with patient groups, professional organisations and the pharmaceutical industry. Where new drugs are referred to NICE for appraisal, it monitors the licensing position closely and schedules the appraisal so that guidance follows as soon as possible after the granting of a licence. Other sources of advice are available in advance of publication of full NICE guidance, including Medicines Resource Centre publications produced by the National Prescribing Centre and funded by NICE.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.3/2">In August 1999, the Department issued Health Service Circular 1999/176, which asks national health service bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the technology first became available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of the available evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".174W.0/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) controls the advertising, sale and supply of medicines on the United Kingdom market by regulation and enforcement of these regulations. Websites based overseas do not fall within UK jurisdiction and are therefore outside the MHRA's control. Although the MHRA cannot compel a foreign website to comply with UK domestic legislation, if there is a breach, details of the site will be passed on by the MHRA to overseas enforcement authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".174W.0/2">The MHRA is currently investigating 43 cases involving sale of medicines via the internet. In addition, 30 sites have been identified as being hosted overseas and are being forwarded to the appropriate national regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".174W.0/3">There is no restriction on the importation of medicines for personal consumption, unless they contain substances subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Where Her Majesty's Customs and Excise detect importations of medicines and the quantities involved seem inconsistent with amounts for personal use, Customs officials alert the MHRA on the grounds of public interest. Representatives from Customs and MHRA are engaged in on-going discussions about how this process might be strengthened.</p>

An integral part of &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; is the NHS knowledge and skills framework, which defines and describes the knowledge and skills which individuals need to apply in their work in order to deliver quality services.

	<p pid=".185W.0/1">The NHS Plan announced that the Department would provide an additional &pound;20 million per year to establish a national cancer research network. The National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) and the National Translational Cancer Research Network were established as a result. The NCRN is currently providing NHS infrastructural support for 11 trials in ovarian cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.0/2">The research costs of these trials are being met by public, private and charity sector funders. The Medical Research Council (MRC) is meeting some or all of the costs of five, including the &pound;8.7 million United Kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.0/3">The Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality, improvement, and service development in the NHS. Research on identifying potentially significant diagnostic factors for ovarian cancer in primary care was commissioned in 2001 and &pound;130,000 has been spent on it.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.0/4">Over 75 per cent, of the Department's total expenditure on health research is devolved to and managed by NHS organisations. Details of individual projects, including more than sixty ovarian cancer research studies, can be found on the national research register at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/research">www.dh.gov.uk/research</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".187W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, funding responsibility for health services in the publicly run prisons in England was transferred from the Home Office to the Department. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, at the beginning of a staged process, 18 national health service primary care trusts (PCTs) assumed commissioning responsibility for health services in 34 prisons. By April 2006, that commissioning responsibility will be fully devolved to PCTs and, in some cases, the PCT will also be the health care provider. Prisons and their NHS partners are now expected to work together to determine how best to meet prisoners' health needs. The Government are committing significant additional resources to facilitate the transfer of commissioning responsibility to the NHS. Revenue investment will have risen by over &pound;40 million a year by 2005&ndash;06, an increase of more than a third over the 2002&ndash;03 baseline. The Prison Service is investing around &pound;20 million a year over the same period to rebuild and refurbish prison health care facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".187W.5/2">Policy development advice and support is available from the central prison health team and also the regional prison health leads, whose roles will become integrated in strategic health authorities after 2006. Additionally, there is a learning network, facilitated by the university of Birmingham, where health care staff and PCT commissioners are encouraged to share good practice and participate in learning sets and themed workshops. National and local guidance documents are available on the internet and distributed through local channels.</p>

	<p pid=".189W.0/1">The national health service prostate cancer programme was launched in September 2000 and set out the Government's commitment to improve early detection of prostate cancer, to improve treatment and care for prostate cancer patients and to enhance research into prostate cancer. Since the launch, significant progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/2">The prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP) has been set up to ensure that all men considering a test for prostate cancer are given information on the benefits, limitations and risks associated with having a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/3">We have issued clinical best practice so that PSA testing is performed to an explicit quality standard and that there is a systematic and standardised follow-up for those men with a high PSA level.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/4">Raising public awareness of prostate cancer is one of the key challenges for the future. We want men to know what their prostate is, what is does and what can go wrong with it. However, we have to raise public awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety and worry.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/5">Thanks to the work of the prostate cancer advisory group we now have, for the first time, a definitive set of key messages for the general public, which include prostate cancer and in such a way as not to cause unnecessary anxiety.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/6">The key messages have been agreed by 20 organisations, including charities, patient groups and professional bodies, as well as the Department and can be fed into existing and future communications vehicles or as stand alone messages.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/7">We have provided funding for the following organisations to increase public awareness of prostate cancer:</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/8" class="indent">In 2003&ndash;04 we provided &pound;30,000 to the Men's Health Forum to help fund its publication, the Men and Cancer manual.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/9" class="indent">We have provided &pound;135,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase available information about prostate cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/10" class="indent">We are providing &pound;105,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to improve awareness of the risks and symptoms of prostate cancer in African and Afro-Caribbean men in Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/11" class="indent">We are working with the voluntary sector to develop a national prostate cancer website and have provided &pound;100,000 of funding. It is expected that the website will be launched this summer.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/12">We are also working to both increase and improve clinical knowledge of prostate cancer. In April 2000, we published referral guidelines for suspected cancer to help general practitioners identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer and who therefore require urgent assessment by a specialist. The guidelines included a section on prostate cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/13">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently reviewing this guidance and an update is due to be published in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/14">The PCRMP has produced a booklet, called, The PSA test and prostate cancer: Information for primary care. This booklet provides GPs with an easy reference source on prostate cancer, from risk factors to treatment. The booklet was produced after consultation with GPs, primary care cancer leads and an expert advisory group.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/15">In September 2002, NICE published guidance on urological cancers, including prostate cancer. This guidance covers all aspects of cancer care for urological cancer patients and is aimed at helping all of those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing cancer services to ensure high quality services.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/16">As well as this guidance NICE is developing guidelines for the clinical management of prostate cancer and an overview of brachytherapy as an interventional procedure for prostate cancer. NICE is also appraising two prostate cancer drugs, Docetaxel and Atrasentan.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/17">The cancer services collaborative has been working with urology teams across the country to improve access to care and to streamline the delivery of care.</p>
	<p pid=".189W.0/18">We have also increased twenty-fold research funding for prostate cancer since 1999&ndash;2000; from &pound;200,000 to &pound;4.2million for 2003&ndash;04. This level of funding will be maintained, subject to the quality of research proposals.</p>

	<p pid=".190W.2/1">The proposals for legislation set out in the White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&mdash;Making Healthy choices easier&quot; to shift the balance in favour of smoke-free enclosed public places and workplaces were based on the scientific evidence of harm from second hand smoke and the views from the public. In preparation of the proposals, we took full account of the latest scientific and medical evidence of the risk to health from exposure to second hand smoke, as set out in the report from the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, which was published alongside the White Paper. Many of the studies covered look at the effects on non-smokers of living with smokers.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.2/2">We took full account of the views of the public, as expressed in over 150,000 responses to the public consultation on public health, in preparing our proposals. While protecting the right of the majority to go out for a meal or a drink without damage, inconvenience or pollution from second hand smoke, the proposals also provide a degree of choice for the minority. We believe that this is a sensible solution that balances the protection of the majority with the personal freedom of the minority in England.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.2/3">We have made an assessment of the impact that smoking in public places would have in a reduction in smoking prevalence, which would thereby have a beneficial impact of reducing smoke at home. We will continue to act on the issue of second hand smoke in the home and have already taken action through the hard hitting campaign launched last year depicting the dangers of smoking around babies and children.</p>

	<p pid=".199W.2/1">The Coal Producers Federation (COALPRO) has made representations to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister about Minerals Planning Guidance Note 3 &quot;Coal mining and colliery spoil disposal&quot;. It suggested that the test of the circumstances within which it is appropriate to permit opencast coal applications in paragraph 8 of MPG3 has sometimes been misinterpreted and that this has contributed to the significant decrease in new planning permissions for open cast coal extraction in England in recent years. It also considered that policies in some draft Regional Planning Guidance and local planning documents prepared by Minerals Planning Authorities do not accord with that national guidance, for example by applying a double test of environmental acceptability and local community benefits whereas these are specified as alternatives in MPG3. On careful reading, the meaning of this paragraph should be clear, and at present there are no plans to review MPG3. However officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, together with those in the relevant Government Offices, will continue to examine and comment on regional and local planning documents to help ensure that these conform to national policy on this and other matters dealt with in MPG3.</p>

	<p pid=".201W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has always been clear that we would issue an Amending Report for the 2003&ndash;04 settlement to incorporate the revised 2001 population estimates. It is only fair that authorities should receive the correct amount of grant relative to the updated population estimates.

	<p pid=".203W.2/1">The Housing Act 2004, which received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-18">18 November 2004</phrase>, makes a number of changes to the Right to Buy scheme set out in Part V of the Housing Act 1985. It:</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/2" class="indent">extends the initial qualification period from two years to five years for new tenants, although they will then qualify for the same amount of discount as under the current rules&mdash;i.e. after the five years, 35 per cent. for a house or 50 per cent. for a flat</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/3" class="indent">extends the period after sale during which landlords may require owners to repay some or all of their discount on early resale, from three years to five years</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/4" class="indent">makes it clear that landlords have discretion to waive repayment of discount, to address cases where repayment could involve genuine hardship (the Government will issue guidance on this)</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/5" class="indent">requires the amount of discount repaid to be a percentage of the resale value of the property (less the value of any improvements made by the owner since exercising their Right to Buy) rather than the current flat rate basis</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/6" class="indent">shortens from 12 months to three months the period after which a landlord may serve on a tenant a 'first notice to complete'</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/7" class="indent">allows landlords to suspend the Right to Buy for up to five years on dwellings scheduled for demolition, or to exempt such dwellings from the Right to Buy altogether if they are due to be demolished within two years</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/8" class="indent">requires tenants who agree to resell their homes to companies within the discount repayment period (a 'deferred resale agreement') to repay some or all of their Right to Buy discount</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/9" class="indent">requires owners who wish to resell properties within 10 years of their being sold under the Right to Buy to offer them back to a local social landlord (the local authority or a registered social landlord) at market value. Landlords have always been able to do this for properties in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, and areas designated as 'rural' for this purpose, of which there are now 35. The Act extends this power to other areas. The Government will specify procedures and timescales in regulations, which will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/10" class="indent">requires landlords to give their tenants information on the costs and responsibilities of home ownership. The Government will specify the matters on which information is to given in an order, which will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/11" class="indent">enables landlords of secure tenants to seek an order suspending the right to buy for a specified period in respect of the tenancy on the grounds of anti-social behaviour</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/12" class="indent">ends the little-used Rent to Mortgage scheme from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase> (eight months after Royal Assent)</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/13" class="indent">transfers jurisdiction over appeals by tenants denied the Right to Buy on the grounds that their homes are particularly suitable for occupation by elderly persons from the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, to residential property tribunals in England. This will take place on a date to be determined by the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, which is likely to be in the spring of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/14">All these changes except the last three came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January 2005</phrase>. Mostly, they do not affect applications for the Right to Buy made before that date, apart from the following:</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/15" class="indent">the extended qualification period does not apply to existing tenants</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/16" class="indent">landlords have been given discretion to waive the repayment of discount in respect of disposals which take place after <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/17" class="indent">provisions relating to deferred resale agreements apply to any agreements made after <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/18" class="indent">information for tenants will be provided to all tenants regardless of whether an application has been made for the Right to Buy or not; and</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/19" class="indent">the transfer of jurisdiction for elderly exclusion appeals will be dependent upon the date of the appeal rather than the date of the Right to Buy application.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/20">The changes automatically apply to the Preserved Right to Buy (available to tenants transferred with their homes from local authorities to registered social landlords, mainly under large-scale voluntary transfer arrangements) (see section 171C of the Housing Act 1985), also and, with the exception of the last two, to the Right to Acquire scheme (see section 17 of the Housing Act 1996). Provision has to be made to continue orders suspending the Right to Buy because of antisocial behaviour in cases where the tenant ceases to be a secure tenant, but has a Preserved Right to Buy or the Right to Acquire, so that their right to purchase their home is still suspended.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/21">The Preserved Right to Buy regulations and to the Right to Acquire regulations will be replaced with new regulations which reflect these changes. These will be made and laid before Parliament as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".205W.2/2">The new Supporting People distribution formula was specifically developed for the Supporting People programme and takes into account levels of deprivation, population and social economic factors within an authority.</p>
	<p pid=".205W.2/3">Detailed information on the formula and its use is available on the Supporting People web site at: <a href="http://www.spkweb.org.uk/Subjects/Finance/Distributionformula/">http://www.spkweb.org.uk/Subjects/Finance/Distribution formula/</a></p>
