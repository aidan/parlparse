	<p pid=".1W.3/1">My hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Commons) and I represented the UK at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-12-22">22 December 2004</phrase>. Fisheries Ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also present.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/2">The main items for decision were on fisheries. The Council agreed on Total Allowable Catches and quotas for 2005 and on related measures. Much of the discussion at Council centred on the need for further measures to protect depleted cod stocks.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/3">The Commission had proposed a series of closed areas in the North Sea. Ministers, however, were not convinced of the case for the Commission's proposal which would have significant impact on the fishing industry but without clear benefit for the North Sea cod stock. The UK believes that closed areas have a part to play in fisheries management and we indicated at the Council that we would be willing to consider more radical measures, including closed areas, if the scientific advice on the state of stocks justified such an approach.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/4">The Council agreed a general reduction in fishing days within the North Sea, west of Scotland, and Eastern Channel to protect cod stocks. However, in recognition of the role that large mesh gear plays in reducing catches of juvenile fish, the Council agreed that fishermen using mesh of 120 mm mesh should receive an extra day, subject to administrative sanctions for infringements. The UK's mixed cod/haddock/whiting fleet already uses 120 mm and will, therefore continue to be able to fish for 15 days per month as soon as the new arrangements are in place.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/5">The Council also agreed to implement UK proposals for improved controls to ensure that illegal landings do not undermine cod recovery and for scientific monitoring of discarding. The European Commission will present detailed proposals to improve control and enforcement in early 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/6">The Council agreed to apply days at sea limits to the western Channel to protect the sole stock. Fishermen fishing with beam trawls or fixed nets will be restricted to 20 days fishing in the area per month.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/7">Ministers agreed that the closure to demersal fishing of an area to the West of Scotland (the 'windsock' closure) should continue in the same form as in 2004. For the sixth successive year, there will be a closure on the western Irish Sea in the spring to protect the spawning stock. The UK reached a bilateral agreement with Ireland to take forward a review of the Irish Sea closure with industry participation. Fishermen who spend most of their time in the Irish Sea will receive one additional fishing day (instead of two in 2004) in recognition of the reduction in effort as a result of the closure. The Council also agreed to implement a proposal from the UK, French and Irish industries for a cod spawning closure in the area between south west England and Ireland from January to March. However at the request of Belgium, there will be a derogation for beam trawlers in January.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/8">The UK (TACs) secured at the Council a number of increases in Total Allowable Catches in commercially important stocks where there was scientific evidence that previous TACs were out of line with the real abundance of the stocks. This meant that fishermen were having to unnecessarily discard catches with no conservation benefit. The stocks concerned were:</p>

	</table>
	<p pid=".1W.3/21"><sup>(1)</sup> With the prospect of a further increase with agreement on management measures early in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/22">The Council also reached agreement on cuts in fishing effort and quotas on deep sea stocks. A closed area will be introduced to protect orange roughy which is thought to be particularly at risk. There will be a review of management arrangements for deep sea stocks in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/23">The European Commission presented a Communication on simplification of the Common Fisheries Policy and this will be followed by an action plan next year.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/24">On agriculture, the Presidency reported on two conferences that had considered the handling of animal disease outbreaks, including zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), from both the financial and disease control angles. The Commission indicated that it would be taking forward work in this area with a view to developing a more strategic approach to animal health. I strongly supported this initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/25">The Council held an orientation debate on measures to deal with illegally logged timber imports. I joined a number of delegations in welcoming progress in this area while noting that further work to counter attempts at circumvention of EU controls was needed. I also welcomed the Commission's intention to work closely with interested NGOs on this subject.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/26">The Council endorsed conclusions on the application of cross compliance conditions in the reformed CAP. Member states agreed to review the working of these provisions in the light of further experience.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/27">The Agriculture Commissioner informed the Council of her intention to prepare a paper reflecting on the possibilities for further simplification of the CAP; it would come to the Council towards the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/28">Under other business, Hungary, supported by several producing member states, expressed concern about the protection of geographical indications for wine in the EU/Australia wine agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/29">Sweden sought views from the Commission on its plans for proposals to improve the welfare of farmed livestock and the Commission indicated that further work on pig welfare would be undertaken in 2005 and proposals on broiler and laying hen welfare were also likely.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/30">Over lunch, Ministers discussed the current state of play in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations and Commissioner Fischer Boel reported on her recent contacts with other parties in Geneva.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.2/1">The UK Government allocated &pound;10 million through DFID to meet immediate flood emergency needs of the floods in July 2004. &pound;5 million of this was channelled through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and &pound;5 million through the World Food Programme (WFP). Supporting these two organisations ensured that both food and non-food emergency needs of those affected by the flood were met. This initial &pound;10 million provided food packages of rice, pulses, oil, salt and nutritionally fortified high-energy biscuits; and non-food support, including shelter and agricultural support (such as provision of seedlings) to over 900,000 families (4.5 million people) affected by the floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/2">In August the United Nations launched its Consolidated Appeal for $210 million (&pound;117 million) to meet relief and recovery needs for the next 6 months. Again, the UK Government acted swiftly to meet the extensive recovery and rehabilitation needs of Bangladesh. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-18">18 August</phrase>, DFID's Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, (Mr. Thomas), announced an additional &pound;15 million through DFID for Bangladesh to support the repair, replacement and maintenance of roads and bridges; to provide food, shelter, clean water, sanitation, medial supplies; and to provide funds for cash-for-work programmes to give people affected by the floods the opportunity to earn income to help recover from the floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/3">From this &pound;15 million, &pound;1 million has been channelled to the World Food Programme to support their provision of food to those affected by the floods. &pound;2 million has been channelled through the UNDP to provide temporary and longer-term shelter to flood affected families, working in partnership with the Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED). Another &pound;4 million has been channelled through the UNDP to support NGO-managed 'cash-for-work' programmes. &pound;2 million has been channelled to the World Health Organisation (WHO) through the UNDP to provide medical supplies to maternal and child welfare centres and urban clinics. &pound;2 million has been channelled through the UNDP to United Nations Children's Fund (UNCIEF) to work with the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) to restore access to safe water and sanitation facilities. The final &pound;4 million was provided to the Government of Bangladesh's Roads and Highways Department to support their request for emergency financing for roads, bridges and culverts damaged by the recent floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/4">A further &pound;4 million was channelled to the World Food Programme's Emergency Response Programme (EMOP) in October 2004. This will enable the poorest flood victims to have continued access to food during the period of scarcity, which has followed the floods.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/5">Staff from the DFID Bangladesh office were extensively involved in responding to the floods in 2004 but no other personnel were involved.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.2/6">The UK Government expenditure that is channelled through the European Commission and the multilateral development banks has also contributed to the total humanitarian assistance. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO) provided $5.3 million through the UN Flash Appeal, $230 million is being provided through the World Bank and $180 million through the Asian Development Bank as loans to the Government of Bangladesh for a post-flood recovery and assistance programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.0/1">The most recent research focusing on health and mortality in Iraq has been published by Medact, a non-governmental organisation, and by The Lancet.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/2">The Medact report, published in November 2004, was critical of the Iraqi health system, but recognised that the institutional weaknesses were longstanding and pre-date the 2003 conflict and that the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) was addressing these. Medact also acknowledged that health data on Iraq are patchy, often unreliable and that their consultants were unable to visit Iraq to collect field data due to the security situation. The Iraqi MoH has issued a swift and strong rebuttal of the Medact report.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/3">Improving health services presents major challenges and will take time. Despite security constraints, steady progress is being made, and many more hospitals are now functioning and have better access to medicines. Since the Medact survey was conducted the MoH have produced Planning Guidelines for 2005, with support from donors, to meet these challenges. The UN and World Bank managed multi-donor trust funds provide support to the health sector, focusing on the improvement of emergency and primary health care services, which affect the poorest and most vulnerable. DFID has contributed &pound;70 million to the multi-donor trust funds and has also provided technical assistance to the MoH.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/4">The Lancet article of <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-29">29 October 2004</phrase>, looked at mortality in Iraq. As the Foreign Secretary explained in his written statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-17">17 November 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-11-17.93"><i>Official Report</i>, column 93WS</phrase>, the Government believe that the Iraqi authorities remain in the best position to monitor the casualties of their nationals.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.5/1">Most of the matters for which the Department is responsible in England have been devolved in Wales to the National Assembly for Wales. However, there are some reserved areas in which the Government has introduced initiatives which affect the Clwyd, South constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/2">The Licensing Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 repealed those parts of the Licensing Act 1964 which allowed the local government electorate in the counties and county boroughs of Wales to requisition polls to decide whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays. This has removed the uncertainty which businesses in Wales, including those in Clwyd South, faced, allowing them to exercise long-term planning. It also removes a costly administrative burden on local authorities and an artificial difference in licensing controls between Wales and England, which prevented businesses and customers exercising freedom of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/3">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Clwyd South, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/4">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Clwyd, South has benefited from over 280 awards totalling over &pound;5.6 million. Of these, 70 awards worth over &pound;1.5 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999.</p>

MOD officials have been involved in a long exchange of correspondence with the solicitors in which they have consistently set out the Department's intention to recover the over-payment. Marrache and Company have had a copy of the letter from MOD officials to the GSPSA, which sets out the Department's position in detail, since February 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.8/1">For 2004&ndash;06 &pound;31 million of sustainability funding is available within the General Sure Start Grant to support child care providers in disadvantaged areas. In addition to this the &pound;170 million Delivery Support Fund element of the Grant can also be used to support all providers experiencing sustainability problems, including pre-school and playgroups.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.8/2">All existing child care providers can access the support of the dedicated Business Support Officer located within each local authority, for advice and guidance on financial issues and business planning for the future, to ensure long term sustainability.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.8/3">As announced in our 10-Year Strategy, our long-term aim is for affordable, flexible, high quality child care to be available for all families with children under 14 (under 16 for children with special needs). We are making substantial additional investment in early years and child care over the next three years. This includes a new Transformation Fund of &pound;125 million a year from April 2006, which will support investment in high quality, affordable and sustainable child care.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.8/4">My Department is providing financial support for the development of extended schools, including the school age child care offer through local authorities. Funding will be used to provide support at school level to enable the delivery of a set of core services including school age child care. We realise that schools cannot deliver the child care offer on their own and we are encouraging them to work in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers and other schools to deliver child care. Local authorities will be able to advise schools of wider groups, agencies and services that are willing to work in partnership to develop extended services.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.8/5">My Department is also providing logistical support. The Extended Schools Prospectus, which is due to be launched shortly will set out the vision for extended schools, including child care to schools, local authorities, key stakeholders and the private and voluntary sector. It will draw on the practical experience of schools already delivering services, providing 'how to' advice and case studies on a range of issues, including working with local partners. The prospectus will be available on the teachernet website, so that it can be updated with new issues as they emerge (<a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools">www. teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools</a>).</p>

	<p pid=".70W.2/44">For 2005&ndash;06 the Government are making available &pound;4,284 million for children's social services through formula spending and grants, an increase of 7.6 per cent. on 2004&ndash;05. Councils are free to decide how much of these resources to use on child protection services.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/45">In addition, the DfES is responsible for section 64 grants for children's social services. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills, through the Safeguarding Children and Supporting Families Grants Scheme (section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 as amended), has power to make grants to voluntary organisations in England whose activities support the DfES's policy priorities for children's social care. Grants may be paid for up to three years.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/46">The grants are discretionary and terms and conditions agreed by Ministers and HM Treasury apply. Competition for the available funds is always very strong, and priority is given to applications with innovative proposals of national significance that will complement statutory services and so help secure provision of high quality children's social care.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/47">The DfES values its partnership with the voluntary and community sector across the whole of children's social care. Making effective use of Safeguarding Children and Supporting Families Grants and other powers at national and local level is central to this relationship.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/48">The total budget for the Safeguarding Children and Supporting Families Grants Scheme in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;4.2 million including existing grants. Of this, we expect approximately &pound;1.67 million to be available for new grant awards in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/49">Of the 127 applications received in the 2004&ndash;05 Round, Minister awarded 47 grants totalling &pound;2.812 million.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.2/50">Furthermore, the Local Authority Social Services Letter (2003)7 announced the introduction of the Safeguarding Children Specific Formula Grant of &pound;90 million. It also announced a capital grant of &pound;10 million to support the development of information technology systems for children's social services. The &pound;10 million was the first tranche of a total grant of &pound;30 million payable in 2004&ndash;05, 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.2/1">Government's vision for every child to have the best start in life and for parents to have more choice about how to balance work and family life. Our long term aim is for affordable, flexible, high quality child care to be available for all families with children under 14. We are making substantial additional investment in early years and child care over the next three years: the Sure Start budget will more than double from this year to 2007&ndash;08. This includes a new Transformation Fund of &pound;125 million a year from 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/2">The aim of the Transformation Fund is to ensure a more sustainable approach to investment in child care. The fund will be distributed to local authorities from April 2006. The fund will complement the child care funding already available and support investment by local authorities in high quality, affordable, flexible and sustainable child care provision.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/3">Options for making best possible use of this additional revenue are currently under discussion. We are reviewing the domestic and international experience of investing to support the quality and sustainability of child care, and the lessons learned will be used to inform decisions on how the Transformation Fund should be spent. An announcement will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".98W.2/1">As part of the initial screening process asylum seekers are required to provide proof of residence at a particular address. Residence at that address is then made a condition of their temporary admission into the United Kingdom, to which other conditions may be added, principally a requirement that the asylum seeker reports regularly to the Immigration Service (IS) at a dedicated reporting centre or local police station. Verification of the place of residence occurs during reporting. In addition, The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) make regular checks, including personal visits, to ensure that individuals still reside at the recorded address.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/2">IND maintains a central database containing the information supplied, which is also included in the individual Home Office (HO) file. All applicants, and their representatives, are informed of the obligation to notify the HO of any subsequent change of address throughout the asylum process. This may be done either, in writing or, in person to the nearest IS reporting centre or local enforcement office.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.2/1">In the early years of the scheme, the large majority of ID cards will be issued as people renew or apply for passports. As the case for upgrading the security of passports is well understood and supported by the general public, the Government does not anticipate any significant public resistance.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/2">When the Government announced its policy to proceed with a scheme in November 2003, it stated that in considering any decision to move to compulsion it would want to be confident that roll out during the first phase had delivered significant coverage of the population and that there was clear public acceptance for the principle of a compulsory ID card which would be used to access free public services.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.3/1">Contestability within the National Offender Management Service includes both competition and cooperation between sectors. We are keen to encourage all sectors to compete for the delivery of the full range of services for offenders and to increase the number of private companies and voluntary and community bodies involved. The case for cooperation between sectors, for instance through a consortium rests on value for money. When the contestability model is in full operation, we expect to see probation services and prisons within a given region combining to procure services in a way that will improve value for money, drive up quality and achieve consistency of service for offenders in custody and the community.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.8/21">There is no official data relating to the most common cause of delays in seeking such court orders in the courts. Once a notice of closure has been served upon a premises the court hearing has to be heard within 48 hours. There are no reports of this legal requirement not being met. Feedback from police and others involved in closures made so far are very positive about the process.</p>

	<p pid=".143W.5/1">At Report Stage of the Mental Capacity Bill the Government undertook to amend the Bill in two key areas. The amendments fulfilling these commitments have now been tabled for debate at Committee in the House of Lords. They provide additional reassurance sought by the House in two key areas. The first amendment relates to decisions about life-sustaining treatment in the context of best interests determinations for people who lack capacity. It provides that when someone is making a decision about whether the provision of life-sustaining treatment is in the best interests of a person lacking capacity, he cannot be motivated by any desire that the person lacking capacity should die&mdash;for whatever reason. The amendment tabled in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase> will replace the existing clause 4(5). It states:</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;Where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment he must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about his death.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/3">This emphasises that the person assessing best interests must look only at the treatment which might be given, for example its possible benefits and burdens. He must not bring into the process any wish or desire to end the person's life. This should lay to rest any lingering doubt that the Bill will permit euthanasia.</p>
	<p pid=".143W.5/4">The second area of amendments concerns advance decisions to refuse treatment. The amendments tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January</phrase> mean that an advance decision will have no application to any treatment which a doctor considers necessary to sustain life unless strict formalities have been complied with. These are that the decision must be in writing, signed and witnessed. In addition, there must be an express statement that the decision stands &quot;even if life is at risk&quot;. These amendments build on the already significant safeguards in the Bill surrounding advance decisions, and respond in particular to points raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>

The initial emergency needs have been met by the Burmese regime and by the aid community. The assessment of the scale of impact by the Tsunami Assistance Co-ordination Group (chaired by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and made up of representatives of the UN organisations and various other international NGOs) is in line with the Burmese Government's own findings with a death toll of approximately 60&ndash;80 people.

	<p pid=".148W.11/1">Free trade unions can have a vital role to play in the development of democracy, human rights and economic prosperity. The Foreign arid Commonwealth Office (FCO) has sought to promote the development of free trade unions in many parts of the world. For example, the FCO has supported the development of better labour market practices through programmes within the Global Opportunities Fund. These countries have included China, Serbia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The delivery of the programmes has often involved close working between the FCO and the UK trade unions. The FCO has also provided logistical support and briefing to UK trade unions in their own work in seeking to promote the development of free trade unions in various countries. These have included Iraq, China, Zimbabwe, the Occupied Territories and Israel. The FCO has established a strong partnership with the Trades Union Congress in Britain in support of many of these activities and initiatives. For example, the FCO set up a conference for regional trades unionists in Antigua in 2004 in close consultation with the TUC.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.2/2">The UK is working with EU partners on the development of the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. This includes the development of EU legislation to prevent illegal timber from entering into the European market and negotiation of Voluntary Partnership Agreements with key timber producing countries. These agreements will require partner countries to establish schemes to licence legally produced timber. Timber originating in FLEGT partner countries will not be permitted to be imported into the EU without such licences.

	<p pid=".153W.0/4" class="indent">The latest year for which figures are available is 2003. Figures in the attached table show number of deaths where the underlying cause of death indicated a condition directly related to alcohol use, in the years 1999 to 2003 among residents in the former Health Authority of North Staffordshire and the Unitary Authority of Stoke on Trent.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.0/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.2/1">The UK is a leading supporter of greater transparency at the IMF and World Bank, and has held extensive discussions with the IMF and World Bank to encourage publication of minutes, lending and policy decisions, and more transparent decision-making. These discussions have taken place at ministerial level through the Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development, and at official level through the UK's Executive Director at the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".164W.2/2">There has been significant progress in recent years, with the agreement in 2003 of new IMF guidelines which presume publication of all surveillance, programme and policy documents. Programmes which involve exceptional access to fund resources will not normally be approved unless authorities agree to publish programme documents. In addition, the IMF board's agenda is made public in advance, and decisions are published through Public Information Notices. Discussions are ongoing at the World Bank on the extension of their transparency policy. The Treasury's Annual Report to Parliament on the UK and the IMF, and DFID's Report on the UK and the World Bank, will set out in greater detail the UK's position on transparency in these two institutions.</p>

	<p pid=".174W.0/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) controls the advertising, sale and supply of medicines on the United Kingdom market by regulation and enforcement of these regulations. Websites based overseas do not fall within UK jurisdiction and are therefore outside the MHRA's control. Although the MHRA cannot compel a foreign website to comply with UK domestic legislation, if there is a breach, details of the site will be passed on by the MHRA to overseas enforcement authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".174W.0/2">The MHRA is currently investigating 43 cases involving sale of medicines via the internet. In addition, 30 sites have been identified as being hosted overseas and are being forwarded to the appropriate national regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".174W.0/3">There is no restriction on the importation of medicines for personal consumption, unless they contain substances subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Where Her Majesty's Customs and Excise detect importations of medicines and the quantities involved seem inconsistent with amounts for personal use, Customs officials alert the MHRA on the grounds of public interest. Representatives from Customs and MHRA are engaged in on-going discussions about how this process might be strengthened.</p>

	<p pid=".203W.2/1">The Housing Act 2004, which received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-18">18 November 2004</phrase>, makes a number of changes to the Right to Buy scheme set out in Part V of the Housing Act 1985. It:</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/2" class="indent">extends the initial qualification period from two years to five years for new tenants, although they will then qualify for the same amount of discount as under the current rules&mdash;i.e. after the five years, 35 per cent. for a house or 50 per cent. for a flat</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/3" class="indent">extends the period after sale during which landlords may require owners to repay some or all of their discount on early resale, from three years to five years</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/4" class="indent">makes it clear that landlords have discretion to waive repayment of discount, to address cases where repayment could involve genuine hardship (the Government will issue guidance on this)</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/5" class="indent">requires the amount of discount repaid to be a percentage of the resale value of the property (less the value of any improvements made by the owner since exercising their Right to Buy) rather than the current flat rate basis</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/6" class="indent">shortens from 12 months to three months the period after which a landlord may serve on a tenant a 'first notice to complete'</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/7" class="indent">allows landlords to suspend the Right to Buy for up to five years on dwellings scheduled for demolition, or to exempt such dwellings from the Right to Buy altogether if they are due to be demolished within two years</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/8" class="indent">requires tenants who agree to resell their homes to companies within the discount repayment period (a 'deferred resale agreement') to repay some or all of their Right to Buy discount</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/9" class="indent">requires owners who wish to resell properties within 10 years of their being sold under the Right to Buy to offer them back to a local social landlord (the local authority or a registered social landlord) at market value. Landlords have always been able to do this for properties in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, and areas designated as 'rural' for this purpose, of which there are now 35. The Act extends this power to other areas. The Government will specify procedures and timescales in regulations, which will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/10" class="indent">requires landlords to give their tenants information on the costs and responsibilities of home ownership. The Government will specify the matters on which information is to given in an order, which will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/11" class="indent">enables landlords of secure tenants to seek an order suspending the right to buy for a specified period in respect of the tenancy on the grounds of anti-social behaviour</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/12" class="indent">ends the little-used Rent to Mortgage scheme from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase> (eight months after Royal Assent)</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/13" class="indent">transfers jurisdiction over appeals by tenants denied the Right to Buy on the grounds that their homes are particularly suitable for occupation by elderly persons from the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, to residential property tribunals in England. This will take place on a date to be determined by the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, which is likely to be in the spring of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/14">All these changes except the last three came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-18">18 January 2005</phrase>. Mostly, they do not affect applications for the Right to Buy made before that date, apart from the following:</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/15" class="indent">the extended qualification period does not apply to existing tenants</p>

	<p pid=".203W.2/20">The changes automatically apply to the Preserved Right to Buy (available to tenants transferred with their homes from local authorities to registered social landlords, mainly under large-scale voluntary transfer arrangements) (see section 171C of the Housing Act 1985), also and, with the exception of the last two, to the Right to Acquire scheme (see section 17 of the Housing Act 1996). Provision has to be made to continue orders suspending the Right to Buy because of antisocial behaviour in cases where the tenant ceases to be a secure tenant, but has a Preserved Right to Buy or the Right to Acquire, so that their right to purchase their home is still suspended.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/21">The Preserved Right to Buy regulations and to the Right to Acquire regulations will be replaced with new regulations which reflect these changes. These will be made and laid before Parliament as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".205W.2/1">Supporting People grant allocations in 2005&ndash;06 have been informed by the use of a needs based distribution formula which aims to ensure that funding better reflects relative need.</p>
	<p pid=".205W.2/2">The new Supporting People distribution formula was specifically developed for the Supporting People programme and takes into account levels of deprivation, population and social economic factors within an authority.</p>
	<p pid=".205W.2/3">Detailed information on the formula and its use is available on the Supporting People web site at: <a href="http://www.spkweb.org.uk/Subjects/Finance/Distributionformula/">http://www.spkweb.org.uk/Subjects/Finance/Distribution formula/</a></p>
