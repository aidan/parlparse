	<p pid=".657W.6/1">The Government has invested over &pound;3 billion Exchequer and lottery funding in sport since 1997. Government policy is to marry mass participation with sporting excellence, as illustrated by the 45 County Sports Partnerships, comprising local authorities, schools, governing bodies of sport and the voluntary sector, established to generate competitive and grass roots sport. Community sport has also benefited from unprecedented investment in facilities, improving community access. To complement this, the Government is investing in coaching and volunteering to deliver community activities. For children and young people the Government is investing almost &pound;120 million this year to deliver the entitlement to high quality PE and School Sport.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.2/1">Prior to the publication of the White Paper on licensing reform in April 2000 (Cm 4696), the Association of Chief Police Officers (&quot;ACPO&quot;) were thoroughly consulted on the related development of the policy. Following the publication of the White Paper, ACPO, the Association of Police Superintendents' Association and the Police Federation engaged in the public consultation, as well as several individual police forces. In developing the legal instructions for the Licensing Bill, ACPO provided advice to officials in weekly meetings. In July 2002, a Licensing Bill Advisory Group was formed which included a wide range of stakeholders, including ACPO, and assisted the Government in preparing the Bill. The Group met on a weekly basis and continued to meet regularly throughout the Bill's parliamentary stages. Since Royal Assent in July 2003, this Group has continued to meet on a monthly basis to discuss issues relating to the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003. In addition, during the House of Commons stages of the Licensing Bill, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State also met ACPO to discuss underage drinking and the way in which the Bill dealt with children and the then Minister responsible, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/978" name="Kim Howells">the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase>, also met ACPO to discuss other general licensing issues. More recently, I have met the police in a Working Group which is examining issues relating to alcohol related violent crime.</p>

	<p pid=".665W.9/1">I have assumed that my hon. Friend has in mind the National Audit Office Report on Operation Telic, which reported that approximately 200,000 sets of Enhanced Combat Body Armour had been issued since the Kosovo campaign in 1999, but seemed to have disappeared.</p>
	<p pid=".665W.9/2">I should explain that the figure quoted in the NAO report was an estimate provided for the NAO inquiry of the equivalent number of sets of body armour that would have been issued since 1999. However, the body armour ensemble is not usually issued as a complete set. Instead, units request the number of components required to make up the sets they need (covers, fillers and ceramic plates). The fillers and covers are accounted for as items of consumable stock and are, therefore, usually disposed of locally when they wear out, although items may be returned to stock and re-issued if undamaged. Due to their value, the plates, when surplus to unit requirements and serviceable, are returned to stock for re-issue as the need arises.</p>
	<p pid=".665W.9/3">In light of the concern raised about the supply of body armour, the Defence Logistics Organisation conducted an audit of Enhanced Combat Body Armour The audit has provided a picture of our current holdings. It shows that current stock holdings account for 66 per cent. of the total number of Enhanced Combat Body Armour components procured since 1992. The remainder will have been consumed over this period as a result of wear and tear, and operational loss.</p>

Military personnel breaking these rules are dealt with under the relevant military disciplinary procedures and, depending on the offence, UK criminal law.

	<p pid=".675W.0/1">The question of whether any areas of Iraq are within the jurisdiction of the UK for the purposes of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) are matters in issue in the current cases before the High Court brought by the families of 13 Iraqi civilians. The Government's position in those cases is that ECHR rights have no application in Iraq. The applicability of the Geneva Conventions and of UN Security Council Resolution 1511 are not matters that turn upon whether jurisdiction is being exercised. Resolution 1511 is a binding Security Council resolution and therefore binds the UK and all other UN member states. The mandate given to the multi-national force to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq in resolution 1511 applies to UK forces in those areas where they are operating. The UK accepts that the Geneva Conventions apply to the conduct of UK forces engaged in an armed conflict and that in some areas of southern Iraq, UK forces are exercising sufficient control as an occupying force for the purpose of the application of the Geneva Convention IV.</p>

As part of that process, the UN are helping the Iraqis to produce a political parties law which will provide the legal basis for the activities of Iraqi political parties. This and the Transitional Administrative Law will provide the framework in which Iraqis will be free to form political parties and to compete in elections. The Department for International Development have created a Political Participation Fund for Iraq to increase the opportunities for Iraqi citizens to participate in the democratic process. It is now for the Iraqis to decide what sort of political parties they wish to develop within the legal framework being established.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.3/1">I have had no specific representations concerning the pay gap between men and women in Hampshire. However I have ongoing dialogue with trade unions, employers and others including the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) and Opportunity Now concerning action to tackle the gender pay gap. For example, last week I met with over 40 trade union women from across the country to discuss this issue and identify action which builds on what we have already achieved. We have made it easier for employers to pay fairly through EOC toolkits, which have been well received. Recent EOC research shows a significant increase in the number of large organisations undertaking pay reviews which suggest we are on track to meet our Public Service Agreement target of 35 per cent. by April 2006. 41 per cent. of those that had carried out a pay review or were planning to do one said that government policy and publicity had influenced them.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.9/1">I have commissioned no specific research into the impact of a long working hours culture on women's employment and promotion prospects, however last year my Department published &quot;Working Long Hours: a review of the evidence&quot; which was commissioned from the Institute for Employment Studies. It is available on the internet at hppt://<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar">www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.9/2">Its main findings are that 11 per cent. of employees in the UK work long hours (over 48 hours per week). There are clear gender differences with men more likely to work long hours than women. Two thirds of women who work long hours are in managerial and professional occupations (23 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively).</p>
	<p pid=".679W.9/3">Through the Work-Life Balance Campaign and the introduction of the right to request flexible working, my Department has sought to demonstrate the benefits of alternative work patterns. Employers who pursue family friendly policies and provide their employees with choice about how they work, report greater motivation and productivity and a reduction in recruitment and retention costs.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.9/4">In April my Department published research complied by the Office for National Statistics on the first year of the flexible working law. It showed that overall the new flexible working law is proving to have been a huge success. Many more flexible working requests (86 per cent.) are being either fully or partly accepted by employers compared to the rate immediately prior to the new law (77 per cent.). The study can be found at the website mentioned above. 11 per cent. of flexible working requests made since April 2003 were declined, which represents a near halving of the rate of refusal by employers compared with the previous two years. And it suggests the new law has significantly increased employers' willingness to consider employee requests.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.9/5">The Second Work-Life Balance Baseline Survey of Employers published in 2003 showed that more than nine out of 10 employers agree that people will work best when they can strike a healthy balance between work and the rest of their lives. The report is also available at the website mentioned above. The report also revealed an increase in the provision of flexible working time practices by employers. Significantly this increase was not confined to workplaces of a particular size or in a particular sector or industry.</p>

	<p pid=".680W.3/1">The Department of Trade and Industry attaches great importance to protecting children from illegal or harmful material on the internet. The Government are primarily addressing it through the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet. The Department takes part in the activities of the Task Force, and in particular, supports cooperation between Government, law enforcement, industry and other stakeholders to develop self-regulatory responses to problems arising, in order to strengthen the take-up of the internet and the growth of e-commerce. We strongly support the work of the industry-led Internet Watch Foundation.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/2">Child protection on the internet is a common challenge in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. The UK's approach has served as the model for the EU's main programme to tackle it, the Safer Internet Programme. Since 1999, Safer Internet has funded over   130 projects across Europe bringing together Government, industry, law enforcement and child protection agencies in the following streams of activity:</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/3" class="indent">hotlines: Safer Internet supports at least one hotline along the lines of the UK's Internet Watch Foundation in each of 17 countries in Europe, allowing users to report internet content they regard as illegal or harmful. INHOPE, based in the UK, is the European hotline coordinating body, responsible for monitoring standards and spreading best practice for these hotlines.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/4" class="indent">rating and filtering technology: the programme encourages the development of software that empowers users to filter or otherwise limit the amount of unwanted material they receive, as well as ways to measure and benchmark its performance.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/5" class="indent">promoting cooperation: it has created European-level forums to drive consensus on the challenges and solutions among experts from industry, law enforcement, government, educators, consumer groups, child welfare and other NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/6" class="indent">raising awareness: support is offered to initiatives at country, regional or other levels to inform parents and educators of means to use the internet more safely, using techniques based largely on practice developed by members of the Home Office Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/7">UK companies and NGOs are very well represented among the participants in the various projects, and some of them act as coordinators at European level (e.g. for best practice for ways of promoting awareness of self-help techniques).</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/8">In March 2004, the European Commission adopted a proposal for Safer Internet Plus, a programme to continue these activities for the next four years. It will increase the international reach of the UK's model approach because it will particularly encourage hotlines and awareness activity in the 10 new member states, and provide resources for the EU to pursue effective cooperation and solutions in international forums and with third countries, especially those which are the origins of a large proportion of illegal, harmful or unwanted material, such as child pornography and spam.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/9">The Government also take opportunities to raise the profile of a cooperative approach to online child protection in international discussions: for example, at the conclusion of the first phase of the United Nations sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003, the UK, working with its EU partners, strongly supported a statement to the effect that</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/10" class="indent">&quot;all actors in the Information Society should take appropriate actions and preventive measures, as determined by law, against abusive uses of ICTs, such as . . . all forms of child abuse, including paedophilia and child pornography . . .&quot; (Declaration of Principles, para. 59).</p>
	<p pid=".680W.3/11">As part of its strategy to promote a globally competitive environment for electronic communications businesses, the Department has developed a number of dialogues with other countries' regulators, officials and industry representatives. These discussions have frequently covered the implications of offensive or harmful online material. The Internet Watch Foundation and other leading UK players take part to give a first hand account of the UK's cooperative approach, and also actively pursue their own extensive international contacts, supported wherever possible by the Department of Trade and Industry and other Departments. In addition, meetings recently arranged or to take place within the framework of dialogues with the United States, Japan and Australia will address cooperative solutions to the issue of unsolicited messages (or &quot;spam&quot;), some of which can be linked to child pornography.</p>

No vote was taken. The UK supported the proposed investment in the BTC pipeline as it was felt that both the IFC and EBRD had fully complied with their polices and procedures. DFID also supported the project due to the potential developmental benefits that it will bring to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.10/2">Although DFID supported the provision of loans for this pipeline, DFID recognises that complex, large-scale projects of this nature raise difficult issues and present risks, including the weak governance environment and the potential social and environmental impacts of the pipeline, which will need to be carefully managed. It is important that both the International Financial Institutions (IFI)s and the international community remain engaged with the implementation of the project going forward so that we can ensure that commitments are delivered. DFID therefore expects the International Finance Corporation (IFC) management to ensure regular independent consultation on monitoring the implementation of the project; encourage enhanced transparency of revenue management; and demonstrate how IFC has learnt from the project.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.8/1">The 2000 poverty data are not directly comparable with the 1998 baseline data in these two regions because of significant changes to the raw data used to estimate the poverty figures. This, combined with the inherent uncertainty associated with the data and the small time period being considered, means the available data does not allow an accurate assessment of progress. However, the data does point to a reduction in poverty. More details are provided in the following paragraphs.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/2">Progress towards these poverty reduction targets is measured using the proportion of the population living in absolute poverty (defined as less than an international $1 a day). The data comes from the World Bank, which publishes estimates in their annual Global Economic Prospects report. Each year the World Bank provides the data for the latest year (currently 2000), and revises the data for 1990.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/3">Estimates for past years can change because additional or updated data is included in the analysis, or the estimation methodology is updated.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/4">Usually this results in a relatively small change to the data for previous years. However, this year there were substantial changes to the China and India data. These populous countries have a large impact on the East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia regional figures.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/5">In China, data on household expenditure instead of income was used for the first time (this has not been available before). Expenditure data is considered more reliable than income data for poverty analysis as expenditure tends to be more accurately reported by households than income. In India, data from an additional household survey was included in the analysis. This additional data, and other more minor methodological changes, resulted in a significant reduction to the poverty figures in East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia for both 1990 and the latest year when compared with the estimates available last year.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/6">The World Bank does not currently update figures for the years between the latest year and 1990. Hence we do not have 1998 poverty figures that have been estimated using the additional data sets. This means the 1998 baseline data is not directly comparable with the 2000 data published in the Departmental Report.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/7">There are many problems with the accuracy and reliability of this data. However, it is still the best internationally comparable measure of absolute poverty currently available. DFID is working with the World Bank to improve the quality of this data.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.8/8">More information on the methodology is available in Chapter 1 of the World Bank's 2004 Global Economic Prospects: <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/gep2004/chapter1.pdf">http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/gep2004/chapter1.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".688W.2/1">The Government of Vietnam has made rapid progress in reducing poverty in recent years and in maintaining a high rate of economic growth. The number of people living in poverty halved from 58 per cent. in 1993 to 29 per cent. in 2002 and economic growth has averaged at approximately 7 per cent. over the last 10 years. Despite this, approximately 23 million people still live below the poverty line and an estimated 8.8 million live in hunger. However, health and education indicators are at similar levels to those normally seen in a country with a per capita income two or three times higher than Vietnam's.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.2/2">This progress is a result of the Government of Vietnam's sustained commitment to development and poverty reduction. Recognising this, DFID has rapidly increased it's programme in Vietnam from &pound;19 million in 2002&ndash;03 to an expected spend of up to &pound;60 million by 2005&ndash;06. The programme supports the Government of Vietnam's own poverty reduction and growth strategy, and DFID works very closely with the Government and other donors to ensure that we achieve the maximum impact of our resources. Copies of DFID's new Country Assistance Plan for Vietnam have been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.2/3">DFID also supports poverty reduction in Vietnam through our contributions to the European Commission development budget (currently approximately 18 per cent. of the total budget). The EC spent 22.7 million Euros in Vietnam in 2002 (UK contribution: 4.1 million Euros), and is likely to spend 101 million Euros between 2002 and 2004 (UK contribution: 18.2 million Euros).</p>

	<p pid=".692W.10/2">We have made two sets of significant changes to the regulation of child care since the national standards for under 8s day care and childminding came into force in the summer of 2001. First, in April 2003, we introduced regulations enabling the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), the national registration authority for child care in England, to suspend a provider's registration in certain circumstances, for example, where there were concerns about their suitability to look after children. Second, the national standards and associated regulations were revised in September 2003, following a public consultation. Amongst the changes were new rules allowing childminders to care for more babies and preventing them from smacking or smoking in front of the children in their care. At this time we also extended the registration requirements to child care provided by schools, which had previously been exempt.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.10/3">Further changes to improve the regulation of child care are under consultation at present and are planned for introduction in September 2004.</p>

Effectively, it extends the powers of Schedule 7 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to allow LEAs to respond to a direction to provide for an additional number of pupils by either holding a competition for a new school, or using their other powers for the reorganisation of schools.</p>

	<p pid=".707W.0/1">This information is not held in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/2">Within the context of the statutory National Curriculum, where Physical Education (PE) is compulsory for pupils aged 5&ndash;16, it is for individual schools to use their budgets as they judge appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/3">The Government are investing more than &pound;1 billion in England to transform PE, school sport and club links. The funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of 5&ndash;16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/4">The Department is providing just over &pound;440,000 to support the delivery of a School Sport Partnership in Lancashire LEA area. The partnerships includes five secondary and 21 primary schools and provides enhanced sports opportunities for all young people to ensure that their pupils spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and School Sport. A key objective for all School Sport Partnerships is to ensure that the improvements and enhanced opportunities that they deliver are sustainable and embedded within schools to ensure a lasting legacy. The New Opportunities Fund has provided schools in the Lancashire LEA area with nearly 12 million specifically to enhance PE and school sport facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.0/5">Latest research, published by the Departments on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-04">4 March 2004</phrase> shows that 68 per cent. of pupils in schools that have been in a Partnership for three years, are taking up the two hour entitlement, rising to 90 per cent. at Key Stage 3. Data has been collected from the remaining partnerships and will be published in April.</p>

In this case, the Academy Trust' will own the buildings for as long as the Academy remains in operation. If the Academy ceases to exist, ownership of the Academy land, and any buildings on it, will revert to the previous owner, which would be either the LEA or the voluntary aided sector body.</p>

	<p pid=".712W.5/3">The standards for the Induction Support Programme for those awarded QTS require that newly qualified teachers can demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement, and, in consultation with the SEN co-ordinator, contribute to the preparation and implementation of individual education plans or the equivalent.</p>
	<p pid=".712W.5/4">Once qualified, teachers are expected to identify their developmental needs through performance management arrangements, and to address identified needs, including improving their teaching skills in the area of SEN, by undertaking appropriate professional development.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.2/2">The Government have set a target to reduce under 18 conceptions by 50 per cent. by 2010. To achieve this, each local authority has developed a local 10 year strategy, with reduction targets of between 40 and 60 per cent. Based on the best available international research, local strategies adopt a multifaceted approach, which includes a range of measures: to help young people resist peer pressure to have early sex; to improve the quality of sex and relationship education and access to effective contraceptive services; and to involve parents and the wider community. Research published in February 2003 by the Health Development Agency further endorses this approach.</p>

	<p pid=".714W.9/1">The Department promotes the use of electric cars in a number of ways. The PowerShift programme provides grants towards the purchase of electric vehicles and the New Vehicle Technology Fund is currently supporting the demonstration of several electric vehicles. The Government also provides fiscal incentives. Electric vehicles are subject to zero vehicle excise duty, an enhanced capital allowance rate of 100 per cent. in the first year and lower personal benefit in kind tax liability. PowerShift approved electric vehicles are also exempt from the London Congestion Charge.</p>

	<p pid=".716W.0/1">The interim findings of an environmental study, undertaken by the Highways Agency, to look at options for improving the length of A417 from Cowley to Brockworth were published in a pamphlet in March 2003. The tunnel option was discarded as a result of its high cost (at around &pound;200 million), environmental impact and the implications for road safety. In the light of this the Highways Agency was asked to continue work on various surface options. This work is continuing in liaison with the statutory environmental bodies and other stakeholders. I expect to receive further advice on these options later this year. I will then consider the way forward and make an announcement.</p>

	<p pid=".717W.2/1">The choice between alternative road scheme options is made by Ministers, not regional assemblies. However, through the regional planning process, the programme of multi-modal and road based studies, and the Highways Agency's consultation processes, we have obtained the views of regional assemblies on all trunk road and motorway schemes considered for entry to the Targeted Programme of Improvements, including, where relevant, their views on the choice between alternative scheme options. Given the number of schemes that have been subject to these processes since the establishment of the Targeted Programme of Improvements, it is not practicable to list all of the occasions on which the views of the regional assemblies have been sought or the dates of assembly meetings at which scheme proposals and alternative scheme options have been considered.</p>

However, where any councillor has a personal 'and' prejudicial interest in any issue to be discussed by a local authority (whether or not in a planning committee), he or she should consider whether the provisions in the relevant authority's Code of Conduct affect their ability to speak in debate on such representations and require them to withdraw from that committee. In making their decision, they may wish to take the advice of their authorities' monitoring officers or the Standards Board for England. In the case of planning committees, they may also wish to consider the Local Government Association's Guidance Note to local planning authorities on preparing Codes of Conduct for councillors and officers specifically involved in planning matters, &quot;Probity in Planning (Update): the role of councillors and officers&quot;. This Guidance Note recognises the importance of expressing local concerns in the planning system, while not calling into question the impartiality and integrity of councillors, and ensuring that planning applications are seen to be processed and determined in an open and fair manner.</p>

Blackpool's allocations in the period 1997 to 2003&ndash;04 have risen by 109 per cent. In addition to this welcome increase there is support through the Community Housing Task Force and Government Office for the North West to help the local authority and its tenants to choose the best strategy for long-term improvement.</p>

It is typically incurred by the various DWP Businesses to mark the launch of significant initiatives&mdash;for example: the introduction of New Deal 50+; the national introduction of New Deal for Partners; launching call centres for jobseekers; implementation of Employment Zones; and launch of ONE pilots in conjunction with local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors.</p>

But it has been estimated that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will require an extra US$50 billion more in aid every year until 2015.

	<p pid=".745W.2/6" class="indent">Jobcentre vacancy statistics were withdrawn from National Statistics in September 2001 as a result of distortions to the data, which occurred following the introduction of new administrative procedures by Jobcentre Plus.

	<p pid=".747W.2/1">The tonnage tax review is currently considering a number of representations from professional advisors, industry bodies, companies and Unions. These cover diverse areas of the regime, including the range of vessels covered by the regime, the training link, and numerous technical points. The impact of the regime on British shipping is being assessed. Certainly there has been a very positive effect on the registration of ships under the UK flag.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.2/2">In particular, the review is also addressing the impact of revisions to the EU State Aid guidelines for maritime transport that were issued in January 2004. Discussions, primarily on the changes that will be necessary as a result of the changes to the guidelines continue between officials at the Inland Revenue and Department for Transport with industry bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.2/3">I expect that a number of proposals for revision of the scheme will be put forward in due course, but at this stage it is not possible to give a firm date by which the review will be completed.</p>

This is because of the effect of paragraph 5 schedule 3 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Schedule 3 also prohibits local authorities from providing support to European Economic Area (EEA) nationals under other provisions including section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000, section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 and section 17 of the Children Act 1989. However, schedule 3 does not prevent the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty if, and to the extent that, its exercise or performance is necessary for the purpose of avoiding a breach of a person's convention rights or a person's rights under the Community Treaties.</p>

Asylum seekers from the eight eastern European accession countries, namely the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia (&quot;the A8 countries&quot;), will generally be able to take up employment in the UK, providing they register under the Worker Registration Scheme, which will become operational from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. Once they have secured employment and registered under the scheme asylum seekers from the A8 countries may become eligible for family tax credit and child benefit. If they are on low incomes they can also access housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.0/4">Part time workers may also be eligible for income based Job Seekers Allowance or Income Support, provided they meet the usual conditions for those benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.0/5">Maltese and Cypriot nationals will have the same rights as existing EEA nationals. If they are seeking work they have the right to reside and look for work for six months. If they satisfy the Habitual Residence Test they will be eligible to apply for income related benefits and for social housing and homelessness assistance. Maltese and Cypriot nationals who are not economically active will only have a right to reside if they are self sufficient and are not placing an unreasonable burden on UK social assistance funds.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.0/6">Our position is clear, as EU citizens these people are able to work and cannot be maintained at public expense. They gain from being a part of the EU but must become self supporting or return home.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.0/7">NASS wrote to people in early April to explain their options and then visited many of them at home giving a further opportunity to explain why they would not be able to make alternative arrangements.

	<p pid=".754W.8/1">The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) undertook research to identify the most suitable areas for the dispersal of asylum seekers. The aim was to establish cluster areas where there was already an ethnic minority community or where it was believed the area   was capable of sustaining a new community. Other   factors taken into consideration included the availability of support services able to assist newly arrived asylum seekers. It was always acknowledged that not all areas would be suitable for dispersal and, with regard to Northern Ireland, the research identified both a low population of ethnic minorities and a lack of available support services. While the area was not designated as a dispersal area it was agreed that those making their application for asylum in Northern Ireland could remain there if they requested it. Others making their application elsewhere can opt to live with family and friends in Northern Ireland and receive subsistence only support from NASS.</p>

In 1992, following the withdrawal of routine Customs and Excise attendance from ports where they had traditionally operated an immigration control on behalf of the Immigration Service, then Ministers introduced a new policy for immigration coverage of small ports and airports. This policy was later developed with the introduction of new powers in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 enabling a more flexible approach to the operation of the immigration control. Under the Act carriers are obliged to notify the UK Immigration Service in advance of all passengers subject to control. The passengers will then be cleared by the Immigration Service either by attending the port or remotely; the decision being based on all the available intelligence.</p>

	<p pid=".758W.2/1">The Government have recognised for some time that preventing the arrival in the UK of those who would not qualify to enter or remain must be a key element of its immigration control strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.2/2">The increasing involvement of organised crime in illegal immigration led to the creation in 2000 of Reflex, the multi-agency forum which brings together key law enforcement players including the Immigration Service, as well as relevant Government Departments and the Security Services, under the chair of the National Crime Squad.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.5/4">The Government are currently legislating to make disposing of travel documents without reasonable excuse a criminal offence. In addition a pilot is planned for airlines to scan travel documents at points abroad and supply copies to the UK Immigration Service. This will deter those who might otherwise destroy their documents en route.</p>

Individuals have had advance warning of the fact that they are no longer eligible for support but if they cannot avail themselves of these options without a violation of their Convention rights, they can approach NASS or their local authority to explain why. NASS will consider such representations from such individuals and will consider offering temporary support until that assessment is concluded. NASS have asked local authorities to consider matters relating to Interim Provisions cases in a similar manner and will consider reimbursing costs of continuing support for the short period of time it will take to make an assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".776W.3/1">&quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; (CM 6020) published in November 2003 made it clear that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases, held by the public or private sector, in order to help establish that an application for a card is genuine. This followed recommendations on identity verification included in the Cabinet Office study on Identity Fraud, published in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".776W.3/2">The data-sharing gateways which may be approved by Parliament in clause 11 of the draft Identity Cards Bill will only be used when processing applications for an identity card or for related purposes (for example, issuing a replacement) to ensure that the person who applies to register is the person he or she claims to be. These powers do not confer any general right to share data for wider purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".776W.3/3">In order to allow for testing of the identity cards scheme in advance of the first cards being issued, these data sharing powers could be piloted but it is not possible to give further detail at this stage as detailed work on implementation of an identity cards scheme is not at the stage where we can be definitive about these timings. Use of the powers on a pilot basis would require Parliament's consent.</p>

We introduced an amendment to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Bill during Lords' Committee Stage, which creates a right of appeal on a point of law in respect of bail decisions by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) in cases involving a person detained under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This mirrors the existing right of appeal in respect of SIAC determinations where a person has appealed against the decision to certify them as a suspected international terrorist.</p>

	<p pid=".787W.2/1">Assaulting a public sector worker in the course of his or her duty is an extremely serious matter. Magistrates courts' guidelines emphasise that assault against &quot;a victim serving the public&quot; should be considered an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes. The Sentencing Guidelines Council will draft a new set of consolidated sentencing guidelines for use in all criminal courts. We anticipate this would similarly include references to whether the victim was at the time of the offence working with the public. We believe this is the right way to deal with such offences.</p>

This project has been established to ensure the Department meets the environmental targets set out in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. A review of existing initiatives and policies has been undertaken and a gap analysis produced to enable the development of individual work streams to address sustainable development targets. Progress against these individual work streams is being made and is monitored and reviewed regularly.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.2/2">We have also made significant progress towards sustainable development targets on reducing crime and the fear of crime, and increasing voluntary and community activity. The British Crime Survey (BCS) data shows that vehicle thefts fell by 38 per cent. and burglary by 29 per cent. between 1991 and 2002&ndash;03. Recorded crime fell by 23 per cent. and burglary in dwellings by 17 per cent. between 1990 and 2002&ndash;03 and that the fear of crime is now lower than the levels in the 2001 British Crime Survey. The number of people engaged in community participation has increased by more than 6 per cent. to 1.6 million since 2001.</p>

The length of the temporary suspension of the arrangements for those, in Sofia, seeking visas for managed migration schemes will be as short as possible. The impact on those wishing to seek entry to the UK legitimately under managed migration routes is a matter of regret. However, we consider that this temporary suspension was the right action in the circumstances and crucial to public confidence in the integrity of our immigration system.</p>

	<p pid=".789W.2/2">A review of the Victim's Charter was completed in 2003. The Charter will be replaced by a statutory Code of Practice for victims, which is enabled by, and one of the key measures in, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill currently before Parliament. The Code will place obligations on criminal justice agencies to provide specific services, within prescribed time scales, to victims of crime, irrespective of where the crime takes place.</p>
	<p pid=".789W.2/3">As part of the review, my officials had discussions with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). HSE is further developing the existing arrangements for liaison with victims, and bereaved families, of work-related incidents so as to mirror, as far as resources and remit allow, the kinds of services the Code will deliver. However, as the Code's primary purpose is to set out the obligations of criminal justice agencies to victims of crime, the HSE, along with other organisations which have interactions with victims in a broader sense, was considered outside of its scope. My officials will remain in close touch with their counterparts in the HSE to ensure that best practice continues to be shared.</p>

	<p pid=".790W.11/15">It is important to note that a report of an adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Other factors such as the time since a drug was first marketed, media interest or regulatory action can also influence the frequency of reporting. This means that reporting rates based on numbers of spontaneous reports and numbers of prescriptions are not true measures of the frequency of reactions or a firm basis for comparisons between drug substances or classes.</p>

	<p pid=".793W.9/2">The Government are committed to rebuilding and restoring national health service dentistry to improve the oral health of the nation. Overall expenditure on dental services, covering both general dental services (CDS) and personal dental services (PDS) and the associated income from dental charges, is expected to rise in 2004&ndash;05. However, in drawing up the estimate for this early stage in the year, provision for primary dental services has been split initially between section D (GDS) of the estimate and section A (aggregate provision for strategic health authority and primary care trust budgets and central allocations). This is because an increasing number of dental practices are converting from general dental practice contracts to PDS contracts. PDS contracts are funded from discretionary allocations delegated to PCTs, whereas GDS are funded from a national, non-discretionary budget.</p>
	<p pid=".793W.9/3">The balance of provision between the two sections of the estimate, and the associated charge income, will be adjusted at a supplementary estimate stage when the level of conversion from the GDS to the PDS over the coming 12 months is known. As a non-discretionary service, provision for the GDS will be adjusted to reflect the volume of dentistry delivered by general dental practitioners.</p>

	<p pid=".794W.5/1">The latest available information for Hampshire shows that there were 288 dental practices and 635 dentists providing national health service dental services in the general dental services or personal dental services.</p>
	<p pid=".794W.5/2">In the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Strategic Health Authority there were 62 dentists working full or part-time in the Community Dental Service area (a whole time equivalent of 42) and, in the hospital dental service, there were 57 dentists (48 whole-time equivalent). Information on the number of practices is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".794W.5/3">Information is not available on the number of hours worked as general dental practitioners are independent contractors who are able to vary the amount of NHS dentistry they do and to vary their working week.</p>
	<p pid=".794W.5/4">We are currently taking forward major reforms of NHS dentistry through proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. Under these proposals, primary care trusts (PCT) will have a duty to secure the provision of primary dental services. With these new responsibilities will go the &pound;1.3 billion financial resources (2003&ndash;04) currently held centrally. The reforms will give a better deal for patients, for dentists and for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".794W.5/5">In the run up to the changes, we have provided new investment totalling &pound;90 million to improve NHS dentistry. &pound;59 million will support access, and strategic health authorities have been advised of their shares and are working with their PCTs to address access issues. &pound;30 million is to support information technology and the balance of &pound;1 million will support organisational development locally.</p>
	<p pid=".794W.5/6">The PCTs in Hampshire are working closely with their strategic health authority (Hampshire and Isle of   Wight) supported by the shadow special health authority (dentistry) to improve local dental access using their share of the access funds: some &pound;1.64 million in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

At a local level, the whole of the South West Peninsula Strategic Health Authority area has been identified as an &quot;Options for Change&quot; field site and dentists are increasingly opting for the new ways of working that personal dental services allows. A total of 18 practices across the South West Peninsula, including two in Plymouth, have now adopted local contracts with their primary care trusts under &quot;Options for Change&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".797W.2/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence's (NICE) consultation document on dental recall intervals does not constitute its formal guidance: the recommendations are preliminary and may change after the consultation. Dentists will be expected to follow the final advice, which NICE is expected to publish later this year. This may mean that patients with low risk of disease are seen less frequently than now.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.2/2">We have also set up a working group under the   chairmanship of Harry Cayton, the Department's director for patients and the public, to recommend a new patient charge system. This group has now reported and we are considering its recommendations. We hope to publish the report in due course.</p>

Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the national health service. Over the years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, these plans mean that expenditure on the NHS will increase on average by 7.4 per cent., a year over and   above inflation.

	<p pid=".800W.3/1">The provisional amount in parliamentary estimates that has been allocated to the office of the independent regulator for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;5 million. Negotiations on the actual amount of the budget for 2004&ndash;05 are nearing completion. The office of the independent regulator is currently classified by the Cabinet Office as an executive non-departmental public body of the Department, and therefore for future financial years the Department will allocate funds based on costed business plans provided by the chairman of the independent regulator each year for inclusion in the departmental vote.</p>
	<p pid=".800W.3/2">The chairman of the independent regulator is the accounting officer and is responsible for ensuring that the public funds for which he is responsible are properly managed and safeguarded, and are used in line with the regulator's statutory functions and responsibilities. This   includes a duty to exercise functions effectively, efficiently and economically.</p>

Since the appointment of Aidan Halligan, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, as joint senior responsible owner and director general for NPfIT, plans are in hand to improve and review the formal arrangements for engaging with key stakeholders across the national health service. This will include a frontline support academy and wider patient groups and an announcement will be made later in summer.</p>

	<p pid=".813W.2/1">Training plans are still evolving as is to be expected when approaching a phased programme of implementation and roll out of new applications, systems and services. The training requirements are not solely related to the national programme for information technology in the national health service in England (NPfIT) as general IT skills are now an everyday element for any public service and service based organisation. The European computer driving licence is helping to improve general skills across the NHS. The move to e-learning and development and the NHS University will both create more demand for computer and online skills and provide more channels and solutions to bring training to people.</p>
	<p pid=".813W.2/2">As we complete the more detailed plans for each geographical cluster and local service provider contract, we can map out the extent of IT support for clinical practice and patient care over the phased implementation of NPfIT. This will generate clearer training requirements and will enable us to consider the most appropriate ways of providing training and development and produce firmer costs.</p>

The number of dentists electing to train in specialties like orthodontics is related to the number of undergraduates training as dentists relative to the demand for dental care. We have recently completed the first review of the dental workforce since 1987 and will shortly be announcing the results including the implications for the intake of undergraduates to dental schools in England.</p>

However, the Department is driving forward a major programme of work to improve equality of access to all national health service treatment and care services. Maximum waiting times have fallen over the past few years and will continue to do so. By the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant will fall to three months and the maximum wait for inpatient treatment will fall to six months.</p>
	<p pid=".824W.0/3">The Department is developing a national service framework for long term conditions, which will focus on   improving services for people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's Disease. The Department has also commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to prepare guidelines for the diagnosis, management and treatment of Parkinson's disease in primary and secondary care. We expect that the guidelines will be published in spring 2006.</p>
