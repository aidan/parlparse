	<p pid="b.1117W.3/1">The Government announced in the Budget in March 2007 that a competition to build the UK's first commercial scale demonstration of carbon capture and storage will take place. As indicated in the recent &quot;Energy White Paper&quot;, the competition is expected to launch in November and we intend that it will be up and running sometime between 2011 and 2014. Current indications are that we will be among the first&mdash;if not the first&mdash;in the world to do this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.3/2">The Government are also working towards a regulatory regime which will manage the safe and reliable storage of CO2 and does not conflict with international agreements. We currently expect to consult on UK regulation of CCS in November.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.3/3">Regulatory work also includes amendments to international conventions and working towards the inclusion of CCS in the EU ETS. The UK has already taken the lead in proposing and securing amendments to the London convention and OSPAR treaties which legalise CO2 storage beneath the seabed, a major step towards enabling the implementation of CCS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.3/4">With Norway we have established a taskforce to establish the underlying principles for CO2 storage in the North sea basin. The work of the taskforce is progressing well and has already produced its first deliverable, a report on a set of common principles for the regulation and management for storing CO2 in geological formations beneath the seabed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.3/5">DBERR also supports research and development for carbon capture and storage (CCS) through the Technology programme. During 2005-06 some &pound;3.5 million was set aside for Carbon Abatement Technologies of which &pound;2.3 million has been allocated to CCS. This funding will continue through 2007 at which stage the new arrangements for the Technology Strategy Board and Energy Technologies Institute will be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.3/6">Additionally &pound;35 million has been allocated for the demonstration of components for CCS technologies. To date some &pound;1.4 million of those funds has been set aside for one project.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.3/7">Funding is also made available by the Research Councils. The following table outlines their expenditure on CCS research to date:</p>

Any projects which go ahead following the competition to build the UK's first commercial-scale demonstration of Carbon Capture and Storage, announced in Budget 2007, will have to satisfy the relevant regulatory, planning and environmental requirements. In addition, the Energy White Paper committed Government to consult on what their power station consents policy should be with regard to carbon-capture readiness by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1121W.3/1">Over the past decade the Government have placed the objective of improving the UK's productivity performance at the heart of economic strategy and the policy agenda, which has successfully narrowed the productivity gap with our major industrial competitors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1121W.3/2">Going forward, a wide programme of reforms has been designed under the Government's framework of five drivers of productivity in order to make further progress. My Department contributes to policies under all five drivers of productivity, but has particular responsibility for taking forward reforms under the enterprise and competition drivers. For example, under the enterprise driver, ongoing work on the Better Regulation Agenda and the Simplification programme, which my Department is leading, will help to create a better framework within which business can operate. Implementing the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which received Royal Assent last year will also contribute to reducing the administrative burdens on business, and at the same time, increase transparency and improve confidence of investors in the UK economy.</p>

This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). A sector breakdown for combined LA and school based expenditure is not available from 2002-03 and consequently this table shows the total LA recurrent expenditure (except youth and community) per pupil by LA since 1995-96.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 Outturn forms collected by the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the Outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the line.<br/> 3. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included for 1999-2000 onwards. For 1998-99 onwards other LA maintained pupils are included in the pupil count. This includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained school drawn from the DfES Annual School Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> 4. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10 and are subject to change by the LA.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1130W.7/2">The UK does not fit helicopters specifically for the medical role but rather has dedicated and fully equipped specialist medical teams that can use any helicopter. There is always a helicopter available to deploy these teams in an emergency. In addition UK forces have access to the medical evacuation capabilities of ISAF and coalition partners in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1137W.3/1">Our mental health services are configured to provide community-based mental health care in line with national best practice, providing assessment and treatment in line with the guidelines and standards set by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the National Service Frameworks. We do this primarily through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental healthcare. The geographical location of care is dependent on many factors, including the clinical need and where the service man or women is currently serving. The geographically closest DCMH to Stockport is situated at Donnington near Telford.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.3/2">In-patient care, when necessary, is provided in psychiatric units belonging to the Priory Group, through a central contract with MOD. The geographically closest Priory Group Facility used by the MOD is the Priory hospital, Altrincham.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.3/3">Any mobilised servicemen or women injured on operational deployment is entitled to, and will receive the same level of medical treatment and support, irrespective of whether they are members of the regular or reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.3/4">Once demobilised it is a long established tradition that reserve forces' medical welfare becomes the responsibility of their own local NHS primary care trust and the majority of veterans' physical and mental health needs are met by these provisions. However, the MOD recognises that it has an expertise to offer in certain specific circumstances, and in November 2006 launched the Reserves Mental Health programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.3/5">The RMHP is open to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> following an overseas operational deployment as a reservist, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Under the RMHP, we liaise with the individual's GP and offer a mental health assessment at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire. If diagnosed to have an operational-related mental health condition, we then offer out-patient treatment at one of the DCMHs (e.g. Donnington). If more acute cases present, the Defence Medical Services will assist in obtaining access to NHS in-patient treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1138W.5/1">In 2006-07, there were 6,400 enlistments to the Territorial Army ranks. Ex-regular soldiers and TA who rejoin are exempt from phase 1 training due to their previous experience, and some specialists e.g. medics undertake separate training in support of their civilian professional qualifications. Moreover, some personnel take more than 12 months to complete their training. There is, therefore, no direct correlation between enlistments and phase 1/phase 2 passes in any given period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1139W.2/1">Energy suppliers play a key role in delivering energy efficiency to household consumers through the Government's Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) scheme, which requires them to meet targets for promoting improvements in household energy efficiency. Of the 4.6 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) savings identified in the 2006 Climate Change Programme for the household sector, suppliers will be responsible for 1.9 MtC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1139W.2/2">The first phase of the EEC ran from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, delivering 0.3 MtC annually by 2010. The second phase of the EEC runs from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> and is expected to save 0.5 MtC annually by 2010. We are currently consulting on the third phase, now known as the Carbon Emissions Reductions Target (CERT), which is expected to deliver a further 1.1 MtC annually by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1139W.2/3">The 2007 Energy White Paper reaffirms the Government's commitment to maintain some form of obligation on household energy suppliers until at least 2020, with an ambition level at least equal to that under the forthcoming CERT. This will save around 3-4 MtC over the decade from 2011.</p>

The Committee has concluded that washing or peeling fruit is not required as a protection against pesticide residues. When deciding whether pesticides should be approved for use in the UK, the Committee makes no assumption that fruit will be washed or peeled. Moreover, monitoring of fruit and vegetables (both UK-produced and imported) indicates that the pesticide residues which occur in these foods are highly unlikely to pose a risk to human health.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.6/9">The processes for determining annual pay and bonus awards for FCO staff follow a timetable which reaches a conclusion in late July. We will not therefore be in a position to supply figures for annual bonuses paid during the 2007 pay round until August. I will write to the hon. Member as soon as this information is available and will place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.6/10">The FCO uses non-consolidated, non-pensionable, performance-related bonuses to encourage high performance. Since 2002, we have paid annual bonuses to staff in the delegated grades based on appraisal evidence of annual performance. The highest bonus for staff in these grades will be &pound;1,850 in 2007. Managers may also nominate staff in the delegated grades to receive small awards, devolved bonuses, for particular exceptional achievements in year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.6/11">Bonus arrangements for staff in the senior management structure (SMS) have followed a framework set for Whitehall Departments by the Cabinet Office since 2004. We use SMS bonuses to reward excellent performance during the year. They are based on a judgment by pay committees of how well an individual has performed relative to their peers. Those who have delivered the best results, and shown real leadership in doing so, receive the biggest bonuses. Those who have delivered least receive nothing. In accordance with the Cabinet Office guidelines, Departments may spend a sum equivalent to 7.6 per cent. of their SMS pay budget on non-consolidated bonuses for SMS staff in 2007.</p>

However, as I recently made clear in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June 2007</phrase>,<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-06-13.296"><i> Official Report,</i> column 296WH</phrase>, the Government believe it is vital to provide &quot;thinking space&quot; for officials and others involved in drafting policy documents. They should not feel constrained in presenting their ideas because they fear these will be made public. This principle is specifically recognised in the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.6/1">The UK Government support the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS) whose goal is to secure a sustainable decrease in cultivation, production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs, with a view to complete and sustainable elimination. The NDCS sets out four national priorities: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment of problem drug users; developing state institutions at the central and provincial level vital to the delivery of the overall counter-narcotics strategy; and strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods that free farmers and other rural workers from dependence on poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/2">DFID has lead responsibility within HMG for delivering the fourth NDCS priority, providing &pound;77 million from 2005-07 to support the development of legal rural livelihoods. The majority of these resources have been channelled through the Government of Afghanistan's own National Priority Programmes. This helps to ensure that other measures designed to discourage poppy growing are effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/3">There is no one single crop which will replace poppy, and therefore DFID has provided &pound;3 million to support research into a range of alternatives including high value crops such as mint and saffron. Traditional alternatives include crops such as wheat and</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/4">onions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/5">But alternatives to poppy come not only in the form of different crops. They can often be non-farm activities such as clothes-making and shopkeeping. The Government of Afghanistan's Microfinance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA) have provided over &pound;133 million worth of small loans to 364,786 Afghan families to help them invest in their own licit businesses. MISFA operates in 23 provinces, including Helmand. DFID has provided &pound;15 million to MISFA since March 2004. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/6">DFID also provided &pound;18 million in 2005-06 to the Government of Afghanistan's National Rural Access Programme (NRAP), which has so far built or repaired over 9,000 km of roads&mdash;essential for rural farmers to access markets. So far the programme has generated over 13 million days of labour for Afghans. NRAP operates in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/7">DFID has also provided &pound;42.6 million in total for the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and is providing &pound;10.6 million to roll out NSP in Helmand province (2006-09). NSP is helping elected Community Development Councils (CDCs), representing over 17,000 communities across Afghanistan, identify development priorities in their areas and then receive grants to undertake the work. This broader social development can help instil essential trust in the Government of Afghanistan among poppy farmers. NSP has funded over 28,000 projects in agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power supply, transport, and water supply. NSP currently operates in all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.6/8">DFID is making a contribution of &pound;22.7 million over three years (as part of an overall UK Government contribution of &pound;30 million) to the Government of Afghanistan's Counter Narcotics Trust Fund. The fund is designed to bring funding for counter narcotics into the national budget, and give Afghans greater responsibility for managing the drugs problem.</p>

At that ceremony I took the Oath of Allegiance, the Official Oath of Office as required by the Promissory Oaths Act 1868 (&quot;the 1868 Act&quot;) and the new Oath required by section 17 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (&quot;the CRA 2005&quot;) in open Court in the presence of the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and the senior judiciary. The Oaths were:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/2" class="italic"> Oath of Allegiance:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/3" class="indent">I John Whitaker Straw do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her heirs and successors, according to law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/4" class="italic"> Official Oath:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/5" class="indent">I John Whitaker Straw do swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second in the Office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/6" class="italic"> The new Oath:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/7" class="indent">I John Whitaker Straw, do swear that in the Office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain I will respect the rule of law, defend the independence of the judiciary and discharge my duty to ensure provision of resources for the efficient and effective support of the courts for which I am responsible. So help me God.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.5/8">Prior to the coming into force of the CRA 2005 the Oaths taken, were those prescribed in Part 1 of the 1868 Act. The Oath of Allegiance and Official Oath are still taken in accordance with sections 2, 3 and 5 of the 1868 Act. However the requirement that the Lord Chancellor take the Judicial Oath in the form prescribed by section 6 and the second part of the Schedule to the 1868 Act was obviated by section 17 and Schedule 17 of the CRA 2005 which prescribed a new Oath as set out earlier in this answer. The long-standing format of the ceremonial was therefore amended to take account of the legislative changes which reflect the fact that the holder of the office of Lord Chancellor is no longer head of the judiciary and safeguards the interests of the judiciary as set out in the new Oath.</p>

	<p pid="b.1171W.11/1">The difference in these targets reflects a number of differences between publicly and privately operated prisons. Prisons operated by the private sector are generally of newer design and construction and have larger cells that can accommodate extra beds: many older public sector prisons have smaller cells that cannot accommodate extra beds. Some privately operated prisons were designed with scope to increase regime facilities in case of overcrowding while many public sector prisons have limited capacity to increase regime services. The private sector also has, proportionately, more local prisons, which have traditionally been more overcrowded than other types of prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175W.5/1">Rape and serious sexual assaults are some of the most serious crimes that police have to investigate, especially with regard to the traumatic effect it has on the victims. Historically there have been a significant number of victims who initially report rapes to police but who later decide they do not wish to pursue the investigation through to court. These cases therefore form a major element of the number not proceeding to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). In addition a significant proportion of those that do proceed to the PPS subsequently fail and go no further due to lack of evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/2">PSNI are seeking to improve performance in such investigations in a number of ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/3" class="indent">PSNI have recently contributed to a multi-agency sexual violence strategy. One important aspect of this work is the proposed establishment of a specialist sexual assault referral centre. The improvement in services and support to victims, together with the more effective ways of retaining forensic evidence, is expected to increase the number of prosecutions;</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/4" class="indent">An internal review has recently been carried out into the way the child abuse and rape enquiry (CARE) teams carry out their investigations. As a result, the PSNI are planning later this year to restructure these investigations by establishing specialist teams whose sole task will be to investigate rape and other serious sexual assaults;</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/5" class="indent">PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service have recently begun to analyse a number of rape investigations in order that they continue to develop models of best investigative practice. In particular, attention will focus upon case building and the significant number of cases that currently do not make the threshold for prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1183W.9/3">The withdrawal of IBAs and ABAs is not an isolated measure. The Budget also announced cuts in both the basic rate of income tax and the main rate of corporation tax and the introduction of a new annual investment allowance (AIA) of &pound;50,000 for business investment from 2008. The specific impact that these reforms will have on agricultural spending, or spending in any other industry cannot therefore be easily assessed or viewed in isolation. Taken as a whole, however, these reforms to the business and personal tax systems are designed to deliver increases in investment and growth overall.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide my hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to rely to your questions about employment agencies and employment businesses that advertise vacancies through Jobcentre Plus; and what proportion of those agencies and businesses have signed the Diversity Matters pledge. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/4" class="indent">The number of vacancies placed by employment agencies and businesses in May 2007 was 23,414. This equates to 38.2 per cent. of all jobs notified to Jobcentre Plus. We do not differentiate between employment agencies and employment businesses for the purpose of recording vacancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus will only accept vacancies from recruitment agencies if they sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA) agreeing to the terms for using our services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/6" class="indent">The SLA specifies that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/7" class="indent">only genuine vacancies will be advertised through the Jobcentre Plus website;</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/8" class="indent">the vacancy is compliant with all UK legislation and employment law;</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/9" class="indent">the vacancy has not been placed with the intention of compiling a register;</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/10" class="indent">the agency has a contract with the employer in respect of the vacancy;</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/11" class="indent">the agency must supply details of pay, conditions and the end employer; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/12" class="indent">no charges will be made to our customers as a result of applying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/13" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus takes these conditions very seriously and will investigate any complaints that individual agencies are not complying with the terms of the SLA. This ultimately could lead to us terminating service with a recruitment agency in breach of their agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/14" class="indent">Since its launch in October 2005 around 600 agencies have signed up to the Diversity Matters Pledge administered by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. However, we do not know how many of these agencies use Jobcentre Plus to advertise their vacancies and therefore are not able to specify the proportion using Jobcentre Plus that have signed the Diversity Matters pledge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190W.0/15" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>
