	<p pid="d.468W.8/1">Tax is a matter for Treasury Ministers. All taxes are kept under review and any changes are announced by the Chancellor as part of the Budget process. The Government are committed to creating the best possible environment for a sustainable private sector led economic recovery. A competitive tax system is at the heart of our approach, but other factors (such as the levels of interest and exchange rates, which in turn depend on sound public finances) are also very important too.</p>
	<p pid="d.468W.8/2">While the Government will consider carefully proposals for new reliefs that might assist the tourism and hospitality industry, the financial position we inherited means we must give priority to maintaining our fiscal base. So there are no current plans to assess the impact that the application of reduced VAT rates in France, Spain and the Netherlands has on the hotel and restaurant sectors in those countries.</p>

	<p pid="d.473W.2/1">National nature reserves make an important and valuable contribution to the Government's biodiversity objectives, and to the public's understanding and appreciation of the natural environment. We need to look for ways to ensure that future management enhances their contribution, both at the national and local levels.</p>
	<p pid="d.473W.2/2">We have been investigating different management options and have involved civil society partners in these discussions, and will consult on these in due course. Cost reduction is not the primary driver for this exercise and no estimate has been made of any savings which might result. A number of wildlife charities have expressed an interest in being involved in the process, but pending a more formal process, only one has specifically requested to acquire a national nature reserve. Many nature reserves are already managed by local, charitable or private bodies and while we continue to analyse the costs and benefits of different approaches to government-run sites, we have made no firm decisions about the role that the big society will play in the future of these important places.</p>
	<p pid="d.473W.2/3">The great majority (98% by area) of national nature reserves are also designated as sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) and so are among our most precious wildlife sites. We will not take any risks with their future. Safeguards for biodiversity and other public benefits that these areas bring will remain no matter where ownership lies.</p>

Additional policies to be implemented by the Government, such as the Green Deal, support for the world's first commercial scale CCS demonstration, and the roll-out of smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress.

	<p pid="d.477W.6/1">Chapter 3 of the International Energy Agency's report is a valuable analysis, which provides a thorough overview of possible future scenarios for world oil markets between 2009 and 2035. These are based on current policies (&quot;Current Policies Scenario&quot;); policies consistent with commitments announced by individual countries (&quot;New Policies Scenario&quot;); and policies consistent with meeting a two degree climate change goal (&quot;450 Scenario&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="d.477W.6/2">The differences between these scenarios highlight that the outlook for oil is highly sensitive to policy action to curb rising demand and emissions. Under the Current Policies scenario oil import prices reach $135/barrel in 2035; under the New Policies scenario $113/barrel; and under the 450 Scenario $90/barrel. Under the New Policies scenario demand continues to grow steadily to 2035. All of the growth comes from non-OECD countries (57% from China alone), mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels. The main sources of increased oil production include Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Brazil and the Caspian region. The role of unconventional oil (particularly Canadian oil sands and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil) is expected to expand rapidly, enabling it to meet about 10% of world oil demand in all three scenarios by 2035.</p>
	<p pid="d.477W.6/3">The scenarios underline the importance of our policies to promote investment in oil production, enhance price stability through greater transparency and producer-consumer dialogue, and encourage low carbon growth to constrain demand as well as reduce CO2 emissions.</p>

Ofgem will also be looking into issues concerning tariff complexity and consumer engagement.</p>
	<p pid="d.478W.3/2">These reforms included a set of overarching standards of conduct, regarding how suppliers deal with consumers on issues such as the complexity of products, which Ofgem expects the suppliers to adhere to.</p>

In 2008, the latest year for which data are available, we estimate that EfW plant produce 0.54 kt carbon dioxide equivalent per GWh (equivalent to 0.54 kg per kWh).

	<p pid="d.482W.8/1">I have seen no evidence to suggest that the low temperatures experienced since November 2010 have had any effect on wind turbine energy production. National Grid data indicate that generating output from operationally metered wind turbines (which account for 40% of wind generating capacity) was 67% higher in November and December than in July and August. This is likely to be due to relatively higher average wind speeds in early November, and an increase in wind power capacity.</p>

	<p pid="d.482W.11/1">The Department estimates that the net savings from wind power in 2009 were 5.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is based on an assessment of the weighted average carbon dioxide emissions of the fossil fuel mix in that year. It takes account of the effect of intermittency on the efficiency of plant used for back-up during times that wind-power was not available. Emissions from the electricity supply system, including from supplies used for back-up, are measured via the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The 2010 figure will be available following publication of the Digest of UK Energy Statistics, at the end of July 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.499W.2/1">The Government's Mortgage Rescue Scheme aims to help vulnerable homeowners who are at risk of repossession to remain in their home. This includes Homebuy purchasers who bought their home with the assistance of an equity loan. Eligible applicants are homeowners with dependent children, elderly and vulnerable groups who cannot afford their mortgage payments and who would be legally entitled to homelessness assistance if repossessed. Applicants for the scheme are considered by local authorities as part of their homelessness prevention duties.</p>
	<p pid="d.499W.2/2">Homebuy purchasers who buy on a shared ownership basis are not eligible for assistance under the Mortgage Rescue Scheme because they already have additional protections through the support offered by housing associations, including flexible tenure arrangements under which their housing association landlord may buy back some or all of the shared owner's equity. Housing associations may reinvest capital grant to provide flexible tenure and, if this is not available, apply to the Homes and Communities Agency for funding on a case by case basis in order to assist a shared owner who meets the eligibility criteria for the national scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.507W.9/1">The Government remain committed to doing all that is reasonably practicable to help eradicate fuel poverty and we are currently considering the ways in which we can make further progress towards our 2016 (2018 in Wales) fuel poverty target.</p>
	<p pid="d.507W.9/2">The cold weather payment scheme provides financial support for the most vulnerable during periods of exceptionally cold weather. So far this winter we have provided over &#163;440 million of support across the UK through the scheme. In addition, this Government have made permanent the previously temporary increase to &#163;25 in the weekly cold weather payment amount.</p>
	<p pid="d.507W.9/3">The Government have also made a commitment to protect financial support provided via the winter fuel payment, which makes a significant contribution towards winter fuel bills. For winter 2010-11, individuals who have reached women's state pension age will receive this payment worth &#163;250 for households with someone aged up to 79, and &#163;400 for households with someone aged 80 or over. Each winter we spend around &#163;2.7 billion on more than 12 million payments.</p>
	<p pid="d.507W.9/4">My Department works closely with other Government Departments on this issue and has regular discussions with other Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="d.509W.2/1">We continue to support the principle that tenants in the private rented sector should be responsible for managing their rental payments. There are safeguards in place so that housing benefit can be paid to the landlord if the tenant is unable or unlikely to pay their rent. Benefit is also paid direct to the landlord if the tenant is in arrears by eight weeks' rent.</p>
	<p pid="d.509W.2/2">From April 2011 we are widening local authority discretion to pay housing benefit direct to the landlord only if it would help the customer secure a new tenancy or remain in their current home at a reduced rent. We will work closely with local authorities to ensure this provision is used in very specific circumstances where landlords are reducing rents to a level that is affordable for customers.</p>

	<p pid="d.519W.5/1">The Department is in the process of developing a model to estimate the impact of changes to Support for Mortgage Interest on the number of repossessions. However, any estimates will always be limited since detailed case-by-case information, such as arrears at the start of a claim, is not collected by the Department. Furthermore, the relationship between arrears and continued home ownership is a complex one dependent on more than the level of Support for Mortgage Interest payable.</p>

We estimate this will mean that the average person reaching state pension age in 2011 will receive an additional &#163;15,000 in basic state pension over their retirement than they would have done under the old prices link.</p>

The Government intend to reflect on the arguments made during the passage of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, and set out their plans once there is greater clarity on the composition of the second Chamber, including how many Ministers would be drawn from there.

This includes the Fixed-term Parliaments Bill and the Scotland Bill, which gives effect to proposals from the Calman Commission. The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, to introduce a referendum on using the Alternative Vote for elections to this House, as well as fewer and more equal sized constituencies, has been passed by the House of Commons.

	<p pid="d.529W.0/1">Commodity index funds have become popular vehicles for speculation and investment in commodity markets in recent years. It is difficult to be definitive about the role of speculation in agricultural price spikes. Food supply and prices in developing countries are affected by a number of factors including global energy prices, global stock levels, the size of harvests, changes in exchange rates and national agricultural trade and marketing policies. On balance we are sceptical about the degree to which speculation played a significant causal role in 2007-08. The Government continue to monitor relevant research in this area with interest.</p>

As I saw for myself on my recent visit DFID has contributed to a number of gains in education in Nigeria including improving access to nearly 800 schools to help increase the number of girls in school; helping nearly 2,000 women from rural areas of northern Nigeria to undertake teacher training; and providing training to improve the management of 2,000 schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.533W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck:</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what steps are being taken to ensure that the 2011 Census captures accurate population data for areas with high levels of (a) ethnic and cultural diversity and (b) population change. (33175)</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/4" class="indent">The objective of the 2011 Census is to provide high quality, value for money population statistics as required by key users, on a consistent and comparable basis, for small areas and small population groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/5" class="indent">In preparing for the 2011 Census, ONS recognised changes in society and technology that have taken place in the last 10 years (including increasing numbers of migrants, students, an ageing population, changing work patterns and complex living patterns). ONS has also addressed the key lessons learned from 2001, and the small number of localised concerns about 2001 Census population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/6" class="indentitalic"> New questions</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/7" class="indent">Extensive research and testing has been undertaken in the development of new questions for the 2011 Census which reflect user demand for information about changes in society. There are six new questions including details of any second address which will demonstrate where people actually spend their time and use public services. This will improve the population counts in those local authority areas that have a high proportion of people who live in the area during the week for work, but who return to another residential address at weekends. Additional questions about national identity, intention of migrants to stay and citizenship will support a more detailed understanding of migration and population change.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/8" class="indentitalic"> Online completion</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/9" class="indent">In 2011 there is an option to complete a questionnaire online for the first time, quickly and securely. This may particularly appeal to some harder to count groups such as young adults, students and the visually impaired.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/10" class="indentitalic"> Resources targeted towards harder to count areas</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/11" class="indent">ONS is recruiting 35,000 field staff for the field operation. A high proportion of field staff has been allocated to those areas that evidence shows are harder to enumerate, particularly inner city areas, and areas of high migration and population change. During the field operation, all questionnaire returns will be tracked and, where levels of response are low, additional field staff will be deployed to provide help on the doorstep and to collect the outstanding questionnaires. The amount of resource directed towards collecting outstanding questionnaires is three times greater than that in 2001 overall and four times greater in London and some other urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/12" class="indentitalic"> Recruitment of field staff</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/13" class="indent">Recruitment of the field force has been outsourced to Capita, an organisation with expertise and experience of large scale recruitment. Good progress is being made, with high numbers and quality of applicants. We are working with local authorities and community groups to encourage applications for census jobs from ethnic minority populations or from candidates with specific language skills and with local knowledge of the areas in which they will work. We are looking to make full use of their language skills and the support they can provide for local communities groups. We specify that additional languages are desirable for all posts, and information about any staff with language skills will be provided to their field managers. This should enable them to manage their team on a local basis and move staff to any particular area where their language skills will be of most use. This approach worked well in the Census Rehearsal in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/14" class="indentitalic"> Community liaison</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/15" class="indent">ONS is placing more emphasis on community engagement for the 2011 Census than in any previous census. Local area managers are promoting the census in their areas and engaging directly with local groups. As part of ONS's local engagement activity, a number of community panels have been set up to help develop community engagement plans for each target population group. These plans will be used by all area managers and community advisors to engage more effectively with the black and minority ethnic populations and other diverse communities, such as short-term migrants. ONS appointed 41 community advisors (with language skills) in August 2010, 24 of whom are working in London, to encourage the involvement of black and minority ethnic population groups in the 2011 Census. Community advisors will support the area managers in liaising with community groups representative of the target population groups.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/16" class="indentitalic"> Assistance in place to help people complete their questionnaires</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/17" class="indent">ONS has set up a wide range of measures to help people during the 2011 Census. There is a telephone help centre and an online help website. By accessing these facilities, the public will be able to find out more information about the census, get answers to questions that they may have, or arrange for field staff to visit their homes to help them with their questionnaire or collect completed ones. Such assistance will be available in 56 different languages.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/18" class="indent">We are also working with a wide range of bodies including local authorities, community groups and charities to see how they can help us engage with those people who may need more help to complete their questionnaires, and to try and arrange events to help people complete their questionnaires. Such events are designed to compliment the different assistance already on offer to those people within communities who have difficulty in completing their census questionnaires. Such difficulties may arise because of disability, literacy or language issues. It is envisaged that such events will be run by volunteers trained to assist with the completion of questionnaires and to answer questions on the 2011 Census in general. Guidance on running such events, as well as training, has been prepared by ONS.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/19" class="indentitalic"> Publicity and community media</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/20" class="indent">ONS is increasing publicity and communication with a wide range of stakeholders and the general public. ONS plans to use different methods depending on the audience needing to be targeted. There will be a national advertising campaign including TV, press, radio, and online advertising as well as billboards, and transport advertising (such as tube, bus etc). Publicity will also be tailored to reach many target population groups such as black and minority ethnic groups and young people. As London has a large concentration of these groups it will benefit, in particular, from this approach.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.2/21" class="indent">The publicity campaign will focus on the importance of the census in identifying the needs of different communities so that local and national government, and other service providers, can deliver what the community needs. The campaign puts this principle at the very centre of all communication and marketing.</p>

	<p pid="d.546W.8/1">The cost of introducing the essential quality requirements detailed in Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 01-05 should be minimal as they are very similar to the standards set in guidance on decontamination issued by the British Dental Association (BDA) with the support of the Department in 2003. For practices already compliant with the BDA guidance, the only capital costs incurred would be for the installation of an extra sink for rinsing of instruments.</p>
	<p pid="d.546W.8/2">The recent Dental National Dental Decontamination Survey, which took place very soon after HTM 01-05 was published, demonstrated that 70% of practices in England were already compliant with these essential quality requirements, with approximately 20% very close to compliance. This demonstrates that for the majority of practices, compliance with the HTM 01-05 guidance has not been problematic.</p>

	<p pid="d.549W.2/4">In determining the selection of the final indicators for the framework, the Department considered all suggestions and comments received through the public consultation, and analysed all potential indicators against a set of criteria. As part of this process, we have considered outcomes measures relating to readmission rates for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Detailed explanations of the rationales for the selection of the outcomes and indicators are set out in chapter 2 of 'The NHS Outcomes Framework 2011/12' (pages 10-32).</p>
	<p pid="d.549W.2/5">The outcomes and indicators have been chosen with a view to creating a balanced set of national outcome goals, which reflect the breadth of treatment activity for which the national health service is responsible. It will therefore, not be possible to include outcome indicators for all specific diseases and long-term conditions. Instead, where appropriate, indicators have been selected which seek to capture those outcomes that an individual with any condition would consider important.</p>

	<p pid="d.550W.2/2">It is the responsibility of the national health service and its local partners, including social service departments, to ensure that no patient remains in a hospital bed for longer than clinically necessary, and that any ongoing care and support can begin promptly and the individual is restored to independent living in the community as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.550W.2/3">This requires better working across the NHS and social care and so we have provided the funding and clear direction in the NHS Operating Framework for the NHS and local government to make this happen.

From April, this will rise to &#163;150 million and after that, &#163;300 million each year has been earmarked for re-ablement up to March 2015. The NHS Operating Framework 2011-12 requires the NHS to work with its social care partners in developing plans for investing in re-ablement services.</p>

	<p pid="d.567W.6/1">The window for peace in the middle east is closing as the facts on the ground change: there is an urgent need for progress to secure a two state solution, based on 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the future capital of two states and with a fair settlement for refugees. This is important for Israelis, for Palestinians and for the international community, including the UK. We understand the depth of Israeli security concerns. But the strength of our friendship means that we can and must say frankly that we were disappointed that Israel did not renew the freeze on settlement construction and that peace talks are currently on hold. We will continue to work with the United States, the parties to the conflict and with our EU and UN partners to return to direct negotiations to achieve a two state solution.</p>

	<p pid="d.568W.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary welcomed the UN Secretary-General's establishment of a panel of inquiry, and both Israel and Turkey's commitment to participate. The panel has an important role to play in investigating and resolving the dispute over the Gaza flotilla incident and preventing future recurrence. It is also vital that the existing national investigations proceed swiftly, transparently and rigorously to ensure full accountability.</p>

The most urgent priority is to tackle the record budget deficit to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery.

	<p pid="d.583W.5/1">Katherine Jenkins and James Blunt were due to fly to Afghanistan on a civilian chartered aircraft on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-20">20 December 2010</phrase>. Due to a technical issue a spare part was required. Unfortunately, by the time it took to arrive and once a time to enter European airspace was reallocated (which was beyond our control), the crew had exceeded their duty time, necessitating the cancellation of the flight. With the general disruption to the airbridge and to civilian flights into and out of the UK as a result of snow, they were understandably unable to rearrange their schedules. Therefore regrettably, the visit did not take place.</p>

	<p pid="d.588W.1/1">No assessment of the kind requested can be made as future movements of the retail price index and consumer price index rates are not known.</p>
	<p pid="d.588W.1/2">Such is the scale of the country's economic problems that we inherited, no part of society-not even the armed forces-can be fully exempt from the need to find ways to reduce the budget deficit, and some tough policy decisions have therefore had to be made. Armed forces pensions and compensation benefits cannot be treated in isolation from other public sector schemes and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="d.588W.1/3">The emergency Budget announced that from April 2011 the indexation of benefits, tax credits and the state second pension will be based on the consumer prices index (CPI) instead of the retail price index (RPI). This change will also apply to public service pensions through the statutory link to the indexation of the additional pensions in long-term benefits. This link has been in place since 1979.</p>
	<p pid="d.588W.1/4">Legislation which governs the uprating of pensions requires consideration to be given to increases in the general level of prices estimated in such manner as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions thinks fit-and therefore contemplates that different methods of doing so may be used from time to time. The Government consider that CPI, already used to set the inflation target for the Bank of England, is the appropriate index to use going forward, and will provide protection against inflation. Unlike the RPI, the way the index is constructed is designed to take account of the fact that consumers will tend to 'shop around', switching to cheaper alternatives when relative prices for similar goods change.</p>
	<p pid="d.588W.1/5">The change in indexation is forward looking, so future increases in the value of deferred pensions, or pensions in payment will be based on the CPI. For this reason the Government believe that this is not a reduction of accrued rights-public service pensions will continue to be index linked and continue to protect individual pensions against increases in the cost of living.</p>

	<p pid="d.592W.2/1">The Department for Education has been exploring the practicality of a new national signposting service in detail, together with relevant partners. I have recently written to Professor Eileen Munro, to ask her to consider this issue as part of her wider review into child protection, and she has agreed to take this on as part of her remit. I have placed a copy of the letter, which details some of the progress to date, and lays out the scope for Professor Munro to consider this issue, in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/2">Professor Munro and I are agreed on the importance of avoiding the creation of any unnecessary demands on social workers and others at the front line. Any solution must be firmly focused on helping front-line professionals to spend as much time as possible helping vulnerable children and families.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/3">Professor Munro's interim report is due at the end of January and she will submit her final report to Ministers by the end of April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/4" class="italic"> Letter from Tim Loughton, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-08">8 November 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/5" class="indent">I am writing further to the meeting with key partners on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-19">19 October</phrase> to confirm next steps in relation to a possible national signposting service and the implications for your further work on your review of child protection.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/6" class="indent">We share the starting position set out in my Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-22">22 July</phrase>. Frontline practitioners need to be able to provide support for the most vulnerable children when they move across local authority boundaries or access services in more than one area. Experience and research have shown the potential value of a quick and reliable means of discovering whether a child or young person has been or is the subject of a child protection plan and/or whether they are or have been a looked after child or young person. Following the roundtable discussion, we agreed that it is worth considering a national approach to these issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/7" class="indent">We agree that any national approach must be fit for purpose, proportionate and relate to a clear need. It must also be cost effective and have benefits for the front line of child protection. This was not the case with ContactPoint. However, while recognising that ICT can never be the whole answer to improving frontline practice, it is worth considering whether ICT might play a useful role in supporting aspects of social work and the protection of children and young people-as indeed you have pointed out in your first review report. Our next steps on a possible national signposting service must therefore be taken forward in that context.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/8" class="indent">At the end of the <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-19">19 October</phrase> meeting, I drew out some clear propositions which had emerged from the discussion as a starting point for further work. If a new ICT system is the solution, or part of the solution, the children in scope should be limited to: those who are looked after; those with child protection plans; and, subject to further consideration of legal issues particularly relating to consent, those who have been the subject of section 47 investigations, it is important that any database only contains details of children known to be at risk, otherwise it could fall into disrepute. Clear criteria would also need to be in place for the removal of a child's details from the database.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/9" class="indent">As you know, the Department has already explored the feasibility of a 'national signposting system'. This work has concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/10" class="indent">such a signposting service is technically feasible</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/11" class="indent">among practitioners and their representatives there is no consensus over scope and purpose, but a presumption that if it goes ahead, its coverage should be tightly defined. As I have indicated, this is the presumption that I shall make</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/12" class="indent">similarly there is a range of views on the practitioners who may need access, whether direct or mediated, to a signposting system</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/13" class="indent">there may be scope for improvement of existing protocols and local practice, rather than, or in addition to, a new tool</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/14" class="indent">uncertainty over costs makes it problematic to commit to an ICT-based project, and to judge the value as against other possible uses of the likely resource</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/15" class="indent">the relationship between use of any new ICT system and professional practice is key, with a need to align with your review's recommendations on frontline practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/16" class="indent">Given the discussions thus far on a national signposting service, and the stage you have reached on your review, you and I have agreed an appropriate way forward. You will consider the key underlying issues, notably:</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/17" class="indent">What do practitioners need to help them to quickly identify children who are the subject of protection plans or who are looked after and who come to the notice of professionals working with them or who are presented for help by parents/carers in local services outside their home areas?</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/18" class="indent">Should any other categories of children be regarded as so vulnerable that practitioners need to identify them quickly, such as those who have been looked after or the subject of child protection plans in the past, or those who have been the subject of section 47 investigations?</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/19" class="indent">How effective are existing measures for supporting mobile vulnerable children, and how might they be improved, including the measures, in place across police and health services?</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/20" class="indent">What new or changed processes or tools, which may include ICT solutions, would help frontline practitioners?</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/21" class="indent">The interactions of 'signposting' with your review, including any possible effects of a new IT system on social work practice</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/22" class="indent">and in the light of that, and of the cost-effectiveness of any ICT solution, what priority should be given to development of the kind of signposting service that has been discussed?</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/23" class="indent">The Department will support your consideration by gathering evidence by a variety of means, including in-depth studies in frontline settings and other forms of stakeholder engagement, and undertaking analysis. There will be no fixed assumption that ContactPoint assets should be re-used. Issues to be considered in this work will include:</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/24" class="indent">a. The use of small-scale pilots with LAs and/or busy A&amp;Es, as well as other ways of gathering information, to clarify the scale and nature of the 'problem', model current and desirable practice and potential aids and solutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/25" class="indent">b. Use made currently of the current Missing Children Notifications system, and how the system could be improved. To include</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/26" class="indent">(i) establishing the purpose of the system, investigating current use, its strengths, and known issues</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/27" class="indent">(ii) collecting feedback from local practitioners and understanding what works/potential barriers</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/28" class="indent">(iii) analysing evidence</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/29" class="indent">(iv) drawing conclusions on how the system could be improved</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/30" class="indent">c. Use made currently of police databases; potential for further use of these systems and the new Police National Database.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/31" class="indent">d. And specifically in case an IT solution looks desirable</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/32" class="indent">(i) The nature of any such solution that would offer best value for money</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/33" class="indent">(ii) which professionals should have access, directly or indirectly, and how likely are they to use it and find it useful</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/34" class="indent">(iii) what data should be included, including possible inclusion of school and GP registration data as an aid to signposting</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/35" class="indent">(iv) archiving and exit criteria for data in any IT system</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/36" class="indent">(v) the cost profile and affordability, embodying realistic assumptions about development and operational costs and the implementation date.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/37" class="indent">I should be grateful if you would participate at the appropriate level in the governance arrangements for this work, together with Sue White and officials who support your review. The Department will not start to develop any detailed documentation required for any ICT project until after a decision is taken to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/38" class="indent">I look forward to seeing an update on progress in your January report and a final recommendation in your April report.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/39" class="italic"> Letter from Professor Eileen Munro:</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/40" class="indent">Thank you for your letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-08">8 November</phrase> confirming the next steps we agreed in consideration of a national signposting service for children known to be at risk. I am happy to incorporate this issue and its implications into my review of child protection in England and welcome your offer of support in gathering evidence to inform my recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/41" class="indent">I concur with your view that a national approach to signposting, including any potential case for an ICT-based service, should be shaped by what practitioners need to help them carry out their work to protect children. As you have highlighted, it will be important to give very careful consideration to the criteria for including children on the system and for removing their names. As you have suggested, I will work with Professor Sue White, other members of my reference group and officials working on the review, to consider what practice tools or systems are already in place which could be built upon to meet practitioners' identified needs rather than creating an unnecessary additional system. It goes without saying that the cost-effectiveness of any recommendations will be central to my thinking, particularly with regard to the wider issue my review is addressing of unnecessary bureaucratic demands on social work time.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/42" class="indent">I would ask in addition that you consider preserving some funding for the national signposting work, in order that any recommendations I am minded to make are, if necessary, supported by available resource.</p>
	<p pid="d.592W.2/43" class="indent">As you request, I will update you on my progress in January and seek to provide you with a final recommendation in my April report.</p>

In his statement on the outcome of the spending review on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October 2010</phrase>, the Chancellor announced that all three and four-year-olds would continue to receive 15 hours per week of free early education, and that, through an additional investment of &#163;300 million, this would be extended to all disadvantaged two-year-olds by the end of the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="d.598W.2/2">We are reforming the way in which funding for nursery education is distributed, helping to make the market fairer and more equitable by introducing a locally agreed early years single funding formula (EYSFF), from April 2011, to be applied transparently across schools and the wider early years sector. We will be consulting on the future of school funding, including whether to introduce a national funding formula, in spring 2011. As part of that consultation, we will also seek views on funding early years provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.598W.2/3">Further announcements will be made about funding for other aspects of government support to nurseries shortly as part of wider announcements on local authority funding. This includes the support local authorities provide to providers to drive improvements in quality and secure sufficient child care provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.598W.2/4">The Government also provide support to parents who need to purchase additional child care to enable them to work through subsidies to parents through child tax credit, tax relief on employer supported child care vouchers.</p>

	<p pid="d.598W.5/2">Over time, the National Citizen Service will give all 16-year-olds the opportunity to take part in a structured programme and develop the skills needed to be active and responsible citizens, mix with people from different backgrounds, get involved and do something positive in their communities. This will include a week long residential experience where young people will participate in a series of outdoor challenges.

	<p pid="d.601W.3/3" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/5" class="indent">During the 2008/09 and 2009/10 academic years, maintained school inspections have been carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Ofsted records all judgements made by inspectors in section 5 inspections, including the judgement for overall effectiveness of the school.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/6" class="indent">In 2008/09 and 2009/10 maintained schools inspected under the section 5 framework include nursery, primary, secondary (including academies and city technology colleges), special schools and pupil referral units.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/7" class="indent">In Cumbria there were 96 maintained school inspections in 2008/09, of which 7 schools inspected were judged outstanding for their overall effectiveness.

Table A below shows this information by parliamentary constituency.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/8" class="indent">In the North West government office region there were 1,003 maintained school inspections in 2008/09, of which 216 schools inspected were judged outstanding for their overall effectiveness. In 2009/10 there were 898 maintained school inspections, of which 116 schools inspected were judged outstanding for their overall effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/9" class="indent">In 2008/09 there were 7,065 maintained school inspections in England, of which 1,327 schools inspected were judged outstanding for their overall effectiveness. In 2009/10 there were 6,171 maintained schools inspections, of which 782 schools inspected were judged outstanding for their overall effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.3/10" class="indent">Ofsted releases the outcomes of maintained school inspections as official statistics three times a year on the website.

The census will collect annual information on the qualifications of all teachers in maintained secondary schools in England, the subjects that they are teaching and an indicator, which will enable us to determine whether they are a newly qualified teacher. The first full collection of the census is currently under way and the findings are due to be published in April 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.617W.3/1">As part of the transformational ICT pilot programme, BIS has been testing a number of business support options in different regions to identify and address issues that deter SMEs from adopting digital technology and hence fail to benefit from the productivity and competitiveness benefits it offers.</p>
	<p pid="d.617W.3/2">As a result, we have identified a need to provide tools to up-skill SMEs and enable them to be &quot;intelligent customers&quot;. We are now looking into the scope for developing a number of tools, such as a business IT guide, training modules and a diagnostic tool to be delivered nationally online to encourage SMEs to integrate the web and associated internet e-commerce activities across all parts of their business.</p>
	<p pid="d.617W.3/3">There are also a number of private initiatives to help SMEs, including Google's 'Getting British Business Online'. This collaboration between Google, Enterprise UK, BT, and e-skills UK, with the support of this Department, aims to help small businesses create their first website and understand the opportunities offered by the internet. Over 100,000 UK organisations have already been helped to set up their first website easily and for free. The initiative includes help for businesses on how to market on the web and use search engine optimisation to increase the number of customer visits to their website.</p>
	<p pid="d.617W.3/4">More generally, we are focusing our resources on improving small business performance and growth by investing in a universal service for all businesses, including those operating online. The new service will be delivered via the web and a contact centre, and changes include modernising the provision of online information so web-connected businesses can access what they need, when they need it.</p>

	<p pid="d.620W.3/1">Government considered the proposal to introduce a training wage for interns mirroring the minimum wage rate for apprentices, but decided not to implement it.</p>
	<p pid="d.620W.3/2">We recognise the importance of ensuring that those interns who are eligible to be paid receive at least the appropriate NMW rate. We are working to update our guidance on the payment of work experience and interns to ensure that individuals and employers are clear about their rights and responsibilities, as well as ensuring that enforcement continues to be effective.</p>
	<p pid="d.620W.3/3">Internships have no legal definition and rarely result in a qualification. In this they differ from apprenticeships which are formal programmes of learning that result in recognised qualifications. It is much more difficult to work out who is genuinely an intern in different organisations and to make the case that interns are significantly different from other workers. The proposal for an interns' training wage does not fully acknowledge that some interns are already entitled to a minimum wage.</p>

	<p pid="d.631W.0/1">The Post Office is already a trusted partner to the public sector, delivering a wide range of services for both central and local government. But the wide distribution and unparalleled national coverage of the Post Office network makes it ideally suited to go further and act as a front office for Government. This would see the Post Office as the natural place to complete face-to-face transactions, including those that support the delivery of online services, such as identity verification, as well as having a role in supporting people to use online services.

In coming to our conclusion we reviewed relevant publicly available documents, studied international comparisons and engaged with stakeholders, including supporters of a state-backed Post Bank.</p>

And as is currently the case, any such requests would also be subject to consultation. Any universal service products must be provided at a uniform rate across the UK.</p>

It will also look to build on the relationship already established with organisations at a sub-national level and develop relationships with those local enterprise partnerships that can demonstrably help it extend its reach and engage with innovative businesses.</p>

	<p pid="d.641W.5/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) is a non-departmental public body able to determine which accreditations it considers are suitable. As such, we have not required the LSC to maintain any quality standards. As best practice, the LSC does maintain or has maintained in the past a number of externally recognised quality standards, which are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/2" class="indentitalic"> ISO 9002: quality standard from 2001 to 2007</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/3" class="indentitalic"> Charter Mark: from 2007 to 2010 (the Charter Mark was abolished by the Government in 2010).</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/4">The LSC was assessed on a rolling three-year programme by external assessors for both standards. The LSC passed all assessments and reassessments, and worked with the assessing bodies on various improvements over the years.</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/5" class="italic"> Investors in People accreditation: from March 2009 to present</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/6">The organisation-wide accreditation is in place for three years. If the LSC decides to apply for reaccreditation in March 2012, it will begin self- assessment from 2011. There are no audit requirements throughout the three-year period until March 2012 when the LSC would be reassessed against the standard by an external assessor through a process of interviews with a sample of staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/7" class="italic"> ISO 14001:2004: environmental management standard from March 2009 to August 2010</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/8">The ISO 14001 standard defines a set of environmental management requirements for environmental management systems. To ensure compliance the LSC was required to provide continual staff training and monitoring of key performance indicators. Compliance was externally assessed every six months. In August 2010 the LSC withdrew from ISO 14001 accreditation.</p>
	<p pid="d.641W.5/9">The LSC has no central record of the amount spent on compliance with quality standards and such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.649W.6/1">The diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems suffered by sentenced prisoners is for medical professionals under the NHS prison mental health in-reach programme. Figures are not centrally available for prisoners who have been so diagnosed and who are receiving treatment in prison. However, in the most recent survey of prisoner backgrounds, 17% reported having been treated or counselled for a mental health or emotional problem in the year before custody. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-10">10 January 2011</phrase>, 824 sentenced prisoners in England and Wales were receiving treatment in psychiatric hospitals, after being transferred for treatment by the Secretary of State under the Mental Health Act 1983.</p>

	<p pid="d.650W.2/1">Data are not held centrally on the numbers of serving prisoners with a diagnosed personality disorder. However, it is estimated that approximately two-thirds of prisoners would meet the criteria for at least one type of personality disorder.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.2/2">The prevalence of personality disorder among the prison population was estimated in a Ministry of Justice report 'The problems and needs of newly sentenced prisoners: results from a national survey', Ministry of Justice Research Series 16/08, October 2008. This indicated that 61% of prisoners in the sample were assessed as having a personality disorder. There was little difference by sentence length, but the rate was higher for men than for women (62% versus 57%), and for adults compared to young offenders (63% versus 53%).</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.2/3">The Ministry of Justice Rehabilitation Green Paper 'Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders' noted that the national health service and National Offender Management Service plan to reconfigure existing services in secure and community settings to manage high risk, sexual or violent offenders whose offending is linked to severe forms of personality disorder. The implementation plan for these changes will be subject to a separate consultation by the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice to be launched shortly.</p>

Gang-related issues have been and continue to be managed within the overall framework to manage prisons and provide a safe and decent environment. Where gang-related issues are pronounced, governors work with local police forces to share information as necessary.</p>

Costs will be kept to a minimum, and for those 11 events already planned it is estimated that they will cost no more than &#163;10,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.658W.2/1">Our review of the law in relation to squatting is not only looking at squatting in residential properties but also squatting in non-residential properties. As part of that package we need to take account of all of the coalition commitments, including those to uphold the right to peaceful protest and to guard against the proliferation of unnecessary criminal offences.</p>
	<p pid="d.658W.2/2">Protestors have in the past occupied residential properties (e.g. to protest on the roofs of the homes of political figures) and non-residential buildings (e.g. to stage a sit-in to protest against the policies of an employer) to generate publicity for their causes. These may not be typical cases of 'squatting', but we need to recognise the various forms trespass can take when exploring the possibilities for strengthening the law in this area.</p>
