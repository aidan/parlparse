The programme formally starts in January 2004 and will focus mainly on providing social and economic reintegration assistance including training and employment opportunities for 138,000 former combatants from UNITA and the government's own forces. My department has actively participated in each of the World Bank missions held over the last 18 months in order to design and set up the ADRP. DFID was also one of two donor countries (together with the Netherlands) to participate in the executive committee of the ADRP Special Project that aimed to provide 50,000 ex-combatants with seeds and tools for the autumn 2003 planting season and training in basic livelihoods skills for another 3,000.</p>

	<p pid=".114W.10/1">DRC is considered as one of 38 countries requiring exceptional external assistance by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, as a result of the effects of civil strife and the presence of large numbers of displaced people and refugees. However not all vulnerable people in DRC require food aid, and the UN's assessed requirement for food aid in DRC is low relative to chronically food insecure countries such as Sudan or Ethiopia. In these circumstances emergency help with health and nutrition can be more effective in reducing mortality than food aid.</p>
	<p pid=".114W.10/2">Between 2000 and 2003 the World Food Programme delivered 259,081 metric tonnes (mt) of food for DRC. WFP began a distribution of 46,000mt of food aid in the east of the country in June this year in response to high levels of malnutrition there. This project is due to finish on <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>. Just under 40per cent. of the requested food aid (17,237mt) has been distributed. DFID has not made a specific contribution to this, although it is supporting food aid distribution in the same area through the International Relief NGO, CESVI.</p>
	<p pid=".114W.10/3">DFID has steadily increased its humanitarian programme in DRC over the past five years.</p>
	<p pid=".114W.10/4">This year we will spend over 10 million on emergency humanitarian relief. Much of this is for emergency medical interventions, rather than food aid. We are also committed to supporting the new transitional national government and the political transitiongenerally in DRC.

	<p pid=".116W.2/1">Approximately 90,000 pastoralists are at risk from the failure of the autumn rains in northern Somalia. The global malnutrition rate for the Sool plateau is just under 14 per cent., which indicates the need for close monitoring rather than immediate intervention.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.2/2">The humanitarian response includes: greater use of targeted family rations by WFP alongside UNICEF's supplementary feeding programme to screened children, monitoring of the health and nutrition situation; cash assistance to allow communities meet their non-food needs especially water, transport for livestock and/or people and to some extent pay up for accumulated credit; emergency water provision; emergency health services provision and veterinary services.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.2/3">A United Nations assessment found a difficult situation although not yet a humanitarian crisis. We are envisaging a contribution to a UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs emergency response fund that is likely to appear as an amendment to the 2004 Consolidated Appeal for Somalia. The UN's Children Fund received &pound;1 million from DFID for its health and nutrition work in Somalia in March 2003. We will be making some further contributions to meet humanitarian needs in Somalia very soon.</p>

British investment is now minimal; a number of British tour operators have links with Burmese travel companies and Sea Containers/Orient Express operate cruises in Burma. I have however written to ABTA to suggest that travel operators promoting Burma, should think twice before proceeding.</p>

The procedures are designed to bring performance (or attendance) up to the required standard, and comply with employment legislation and the ACAS Code of Practice on Discipline and Grievance (2000). The inefficiency procedure was revised earlier this year. Both sets of procedures will be reviewed again next year to ensure compliance with the Employment Act 2002 (Dispute Resolution) Regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.5/1">The cost of managing Britain's civil public sector nuclear waste is included within the estimated total of nuclear liabilities which currently stand at around &pound;48 billion. Reliable estimates of annual costs are hard to identify as there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding both the total of the liabilities, and the ongoing operational imperatives and constraints at individual nuclear sites. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which is intended to be operational from April 2005, will need to establish more certainty on the overall liabilities and annual costs. To this end the government has already started preparation of lifecycle baselines for NDA sites that will provide the basis for estimating the costs of clean up going forward. The NDA will be operating within the overall framework of Government policy on decommissioning and waste management and will need to manage the clean up programme accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.3/1">The DTI itself has not commissioned any research on the potential impact of wind farms on common scoter specifically. A DTI report published in 2001 assessed the effects of offshore wind farms on birds. The report reviewed all contemporary published data from both UK and overseas studies and looked at the effects, if any, that wind farms have on birds including common scoter.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/2">More recently, a Strategic Environmental Assessment has been completed in advance of the second round of offshore wind farm development. The Environmental Report resulting from the Assessment considers the full range of impacts that might arise from wind farm activity including those affecting birds. The Report also identifies additional studies that need to be carried out. These include further work on the distribution and main flight paths of seabirds including migratory, feeding and roosting patterns and their behavioural response to wind farms.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/3">The University of Wales at Bangor is close to completing a project on the potential displacement of birds (especially common scoter) from benthic feeding areas because of the impact of wind turbines. The Bangor study is being carried out on behalf of COWRIE (Collaborative Offshore Wind Farm Research in the Environment), a body which includes members drawn from the Crown Estate, Government, offshore wind farm developers and environmental groups.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/4">Before any offshore wind farm can be developed, a number of statutory consents are required&mdash;especially under either the Electricity Act, the Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) and the Coast Protection Act or under the Transport and Works Act and FEPA. As part of the application process for Electricity Act and Transport and Works Act consents, the applicant has to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment, the product of which is an Environmental Statement. This document addresses the potential environmental impacts (including those affecting bird populations) of the projects under application. In determining the application, the Secretary of State will consider any likely impacts on the environment including on any European sites in line with the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives. Any decisions about granting consents for offshore wind farms will consider advice provided by the statutory nature conservation bodies and other interested parties about their impact on the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.3/5">Any consent granted in response to an application may include conditions that will minimise and monitor impacts. Since the Food and Environment Protection Act specifically addresses the protection of the marine environment, it is likely that conditions relating to seabirds would be incorporated into any licence issued under this Act.</p>

These figures include hours flown by exchange pilots from foreign air forces serving with RAF Squadrons based at the Station, as these are not recorded separately. On average there are two such pilots at the Station, and they would normally fly at the same rate as RAF pilots. The figures include hours flown by Marham-based pilots deployed on Operation TELIC, hence the increase in March and April 2003.</p>

The study is due to report next year and it is anticipated that it will produce detailed results demonstrating the benefit.

	<p pid=".138W.11/1">Estimates of the cost in the first three years were published in Budget 2003 and will be updated in the pre-Budget report. The bulk of the cost to the Exchequer consists of the Annually Managed Expenditure for the initial Government endowments, which varies with birth cohort size and is therefore expected to be relatively stable after 2005&ndash;06. Costs to the Exchequer due to the tax loss from the small proportion of savings that would otherwise have been in taxable savings vehicles are negligible in the initial years and may then rise slowly, until the first accounts mature in 18 years. After this the cost of the tax loss is expected to remain stable. Tax loss will be small or negligible compared to the costs of the endowments. Estimates are not available for the cost of any further Government contributions at age 7 as the value of these has yet to be decided.</p>

	<p pid=".140W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on economic growth in the St Helens area for each year since 1992. (141305)</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/4" class="indent">The nearest geography for that area for which a measure of economic activity (that is gross value added (GVA)) is East Merseyside; this includes St Helens and Knowsley.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/5" class="indent">The estimates in tables A and B are based on the regional GVA estimates published in August and October 2003 for regional (North West) and sub-regional (Merseyside) data and April 2001 for the local area (East Merseyside) data. These are available on the National Statistics website at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vink=7359">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vink=7359</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/6" class="indent">Growth rates are normally calculated on the basis of data at constant prices. However, regional Gross Value Added (GVA) data are only available on a current price basis, in the absence of regional deflators or volume measures. The growth rates shown in the table below will therefore include the effects of inflation.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/7" class="indent">Estimates for East Merseyside consistent with the sub-regional data up to 2001 will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>.</p>

Data are now being collected on foraging areas and migration routes using satellite tracking and &quot;at sea&quot; observations, which will help target the conservation effort&mdash;British scientists are involved in this.

The Welsh Assembly does not provide funding for flood defence work in England. However the responsibility for deciding on which projects to promote and their timing rests with local operating authorities, such as the Environment Agency. I understand that the Agency's Wye Local Flood Defence Committee gave priority to constructing defences for Hampton Bishop rather than Hereford, but have engaged consultants to determine the viability of flood defence measures for Hereford. I understand that the consultants are due to complete a project appraisal report by June 2004 and the Agency plans to start work on a scheme at Hereford in 2005, if it qualifies for funding.</p>

The defence is then to be served with a copy of the judgment in the Sally Clark case and its attention is drawn to sections of the judgment touching on his evidence. Further and fuller guidance will be provided to prosecutors as soon as possible. This will apply to both present and future cases.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.6/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>, the Inter-Departmental Group held its first meeting. Progress was made in two areas. How previous cases in which Doctor Alan Williams conducted a post mortem were to be identified and what factors would be used to select the cases on which the group should concentrate.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.6/5">Following that meeting, work commenced immediately on the identification of cases. Several agencies assisted in respect of this process, with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service taking the lead. The Group set a deadline of mid-September for the conclusion of that process. By that date, approximately 50 previous cases had been identified, which dated back between 5&ndash;7 years. These cases all involved charges of murder, manslaughter or infanticide where Doctor Williams had been instructed by the police to conduct the post mortem and which had resulted in a conviction.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.6/6">The cases themselves are now being reviewed. An experienced member each of the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service are conducting the review. This work is continuing. It is anticipated that the results of the initial review will be considered early next year.</p>

BBC Nottingham also broadcast a television item on the magistracy. During next year's recruitment round we will be adding to those initiatives with a local bus advertising campaign backed up by supporting material in local media sources.</p>

	<p pid=".152W.2/1">In recent years The National Archives (TNA) has made considerable progress in improving online and onsite access for amateur historians. The online catalogue (PROCAT), with references to over nine million records, is available over the internet. Users can identify the original documents relevant to their research and place an order for them in advance of a visit to TNA at Kew. In addition, digital images of the entire series of wills from 1384 to 1858, which are of considerable interest to family historians, can be downloaded from the TNA website. TNA also provides digital copies of other records on demand over the internet. Many of TNA's online services are free of charge, including the award winning Learning Curve gallery, which provides online content for school teachers and pupils working on Key Stages 2 to 4 of the History National Curriculum, and the Pathways to the Past section of the website, which includes a wide variety of online material aimed at lifelong learners. The Moving Here project, led by TNA, comprises online exhibitions focusing on the historical experience of immigration to the UK in the last 150 years, and has opened archives up to entirely new audiences.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.2/2">Since 1997, the public reading rooms have been open six days a week, with late opening until 7pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. New users are given an induction tour on their first visit to Kew and can ask trained staff on duty in the reading rooms for further expert advice. All users are encouraged to make suggestions for further service improvements. The Public Record Office (PRO) first gained the Charter Mark Award in 1998 and achieved re-accreditation in 2001. Surveys of users onsite regularly achieve satisfaction levels of 90 per cent. and above.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.2/3">The completion of the merger between the PRO and the Historical Manuscripts Commission in December 2003, resulting in a shared physical location and website, will provide increased access to records, benefiting historians still further.</p>

The number of detectives for any given Basic Command Unit or specialist unit is ultimately a matter for chief officers of police and will depend on factors such as local crime patterns and the strategy to address them.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.3/2">My officials have consulted Treasury colleagues on the possible use of tax incentives to encourage the installation of physical security measures by businesses. However, we are not convinced that a tax incentive scheme is the best way to help small retailers facing crime problems. In particular, it could be perceived as unfair in that it would offer no assistance to businesses (arguably those in most need of help) that do not make enough profit to pay corporation tax. We also understand that the administration and compliance costs of such a system (to both businesses and the Government) would be high.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.3/3">However, the Home Office has received &pound;15 million funding from the Treasury's Capital Modernisation Fund for the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas initiative. By the end of this year, this scheme will have provided security measures and environmental improvements to over 12,500 small retailers and businesses in some of our most deprived areas. Part of the evaluation of this scheme will assess the effect this funding will have had in promoting the benefits of crime reduction and encouraging the recipients and others to take forward further crime reduction activity.</p>

	<p pid=".157W.3/1">On entering a local authority owned car park or a private car park a user is effectively agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions of its use, which should be displayed clearly. Paragraphs 14&ndash;16 of Local Authority Circular 1/90 dated <phrase class="date" code="1990-05-14">14 May 1990</phrase> covered information at car parks and drew attention to the need for local authorities to provide adequate information to users of their car parks, particularly about such matters as charges.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.3/2">Section 32 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 empowers local authorities to provide off street car parks and section 35 enables them to impose conditions on their use, including charges. Failure to comply with such conditions is an offence under section 35 A of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.3/3">A local authority may pursue non-payment of any charges incurred in connection with use of one of their car parks through a magistrates court. Alternatively, if they have obtained decriminalised parking enforcement powers, a penalty charge for non-compliance with the conditions of use may be issued by the authority under section 76 of the Road Traffic Act 1991. Under Schedule 6 to that Act an authority may take steps to enforce payment of a penalty charge through the Traffic Enforcement Centre at Northampton County Court.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.3/4">Privately owned car parks are private property and charges and conditions for their use are a contractual matter between the owner and users. This is not a matter that is the subject of public legislation and it would be for the owner to pursue any unpaid charges as a civil rather than criminal matter.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.0/1">Local roads are a matter for the relevant local authority. As far as the strategic road network in England is concerned low noise surfaces will generally be used as a matter of course when maintenance is due. And the Secretary of State announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> that we expect quieter surfacing to have been installed on over 60 per cent. of the trunk road network, including all concrete stretches, within the period of the 10 year plan. Following consultation, we announced that four criteria would be used to prioritise the resurfacing of concrete roads. They are:</p>
	<p pid=".161W.0/2" class="indent">Wherever possible, the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs;</p>
	<p pid=".161W.0/3" class="indent">Priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people;</p>
	<p pid=".161W.0/4" class="indent">The works will be carried out in such a way as to minimise disruption to the general public and other users of the network; and</p>
	<p pid=".161W.0/5" class="indent">Priority will be given to roads opened since June 1988 where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of the public inquiry.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.6/1">Extensive research was undertaken during the 1980s, which contributed to the decision to introduce central reserve barrier onto the trunk road network in 1986. The majority of product placed on the network at that time was tensioned steel barrier. More recently, different types of barrier have been placed on the network, including wire-rope and concrete barrier. Data obtained from the in-service performance of these products over time is now being used to support research into the cost and safety-effectiveness of different types of central reserve barrier.</p>
	<p pid=".161W.6/2">The research is considering the performance characteristics of different barrier types, as well as the whole life construction, maintenance, repair and replacement costs, including traffic delay costs and safety risks to operatives carrying out the work. This research is expected to be completed in early 2004 and will help in the understanding of how to prevent cross-over accidents.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.2/2">Following the events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> all transport security programmes were reviewed and enhanced and they are kept under continuous review in light of the prevailing threat. While we can never be complacent, we believe that the core policies, baseline measures and the current levels of security required are appropriate to the current situation. For obvious reasons, it is not our practice to detail the required security measures.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/3">The national regime will be augmented next year with the implementation of the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global maritime security regime. The security assessments and security plans that are required by the IMO's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) are designed to identify and address existing vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.2/4">The UK's existing maritime security regime, the ISPS Code requirements and a forthcoming EU Regulation are being drawn together to form the basis of a new National Maritime Security Programme. This programme will include both mandatory security measures and industry best practice guidelines and will provide a consistent, holistic approach to further enhance the security of the maritime sector.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.9/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone who can currently receive analogue television signals will be able to receive them digitally after switchover. A Digital Television Action plan has been produced jointly with broadcasters and other stakeholders. This sets out a series of specific actions for Government and the stakeholders collectively to work towards to achieve the switchover criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".164W.9/2">According to the Independent Television Commission (ITC), around 73.1 per cent. of households are currently able to receive all of the free-to-view channels available on the Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) network. Broadcasters are committed to increasing DTT coverage, but cannot do so until digital switchover.</p>

This spending is not centrally recorded on a consistent basis, but &quot;Game Plan&quot; suggested that in 1999&ndash;2000 &pound;1,015 million was spent on sport and physical activity by local government as part of their block grant.</p>

The Department has had no discussions with the Department for Education and Skills on the possible transfer of responsibilities and funding from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). It is not the Government's intention to transfer responsibilities and funding from one body to another, as the approach set out in the Government's Skills Strategy published in July this year makes clear. Instead we have made it clear that we expect RDAs and local LSCs to work together.</p>

We will be working with the ECA to address the specific problems they identified. But it is important to note that revenue, commitments, administrative expenditure and pre-accession aid did receive a positive Statement of Assurance. In addition, it noted improvements in the management of the agriculture budget, especially in the area of payments and in the Integrated Administration and Control System. The Government believes that the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> will produce further improvements in financial management and accountability. The ECA also commented favourably on the progress made to reform financial management in the Commission&mdash;and noted the ambitious timetable for this. We expect the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee to debate the report in the usual way in February 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".172W.8/2">Information on electricity supplies in Iraq is not collected on the basis of religious or ethnic groupings. The power system in southern and central Iraq particularly has suffered from a lack of maintenance over many years and since the conflict has suffered looting and sabotage. Nevertheless, good progress has been made with the restoration of power supplies so far. Power capacity in Iraq peaked in early October 2003 at 4,518MW, surpassing the pre-war level of 4,400MW. This peak level has been temporarily reduced to allow necessary long-term repairs and planned maintenance to take place.</p>
	<p pid=".172W.8/3">The majority of the Shi'a population are located in the South of the country and supply levels in Basrah are now generally equalling or exceeding the pre-conflict supply levels of approximately 20 hours per day. DFID is currently supporting an Emergency Infrastructure Project in the South, which is further strengthening the power supplies to key installations. This $30 million project forms part of a wider Essential Infrastructure Programme (totalling $127 million), which is being managed by the Coalition Provisional Authority.</p>

	<p pid=".175W.6/1">No assessment is routinely made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the workload of community pharmacists when the legal status of a product is changed from a prescription only medicine to a pharmacy only medicine, nor when a product changes from a pharmacy only medicine to general sale list availability.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.6/2">The consultation document (ARM 18) on a proposal to allow simvastatin 10mg to be available over the counter through pharmacies rather than on a prescription has been distributed widely, including to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) and the National Pharmaceutical Association (NPA). All pharmacists have been made aware of the consultation exercise via the Pharmaceutical Journal, which directed pharmacists to the consultation document displayed on the MHRA's website. At the end of the consultation period, the responses received will be considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) which will advise Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.6/3">The applicant company for the proposal to supply simvastatin 10mg over the counter is proposing to conduct a pre-launch pilot study in a number of pharmacies to test the feasibility of the pharmacy protocol. This will provide valuable information about the supply of the product, will highlight areas for improvement and will test the overall feasibility of pharmacy availability. The proposed protocol, including a questionnaire, will be introduced for first time purchasers of simvastatin 10mg to be completed at the start of the supply process. It is proposed that the questionnaire focuses initially on age and then where appropriate, other risk factors for Coronary heart Disease (CHD) i.e. age (if below 55), family history, smoking, ethnicity, obesity. Based on the responses to the questionnaire, the pharmacist will be able to identify individuals for whom simvastatin 10mg would be suitable. An education and training package is being developed to support the pharmacist in the sale and supply of simvastatin lOmg. Pharmacy bodies including the RPSGB, the NPA and the Centre for Postgraduate Pharmacy Education (CPPE) are being consulted on this material.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.6/4">The RPSGB's code of ethics and standards sets out the professional standards all pharmacists are expected to follow when dispensing medicines against a prescription or when selling pharmacy medicines. The code is published as part of the Society's Medicines, Ethics and Practice, A Guide for Pharmacists which is available on its website at <a href="http://www.rpsgb.org.uk">www.rpsgb.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.6/5">Pharmacists will be able to offer cholesterol testing to people who choose to take up this option. The CSM has advised that it is beneficial to reduce cholesterol levels regardless of the starting level of cholesterol. The safety profile of statins at a low dose is such that CSM advised that there is no need for routine liver function tests once treatment has started.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.6/6">The number of lives likely to be saved each year through over-the-counter availability of statins will depend on the level of take up of the product that would not otherwise be available on prescription. Individual risk reduction could be by as much as a third after three years of treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.2/1">Resources will be made available both centrally and through the National Institute for Mental Health in England's eight development centres for specific pieces of work to help implementation of the national suicide prevention strategy. No voluntary sector organisations have yet been granted funding through these resources.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/2">A number of voluntary sector organisations apply for grants under the Section 64 General Scheme. Some of these organisations have a remit that explicitly includes attention to the needs of vulnerable groups who may be at risk of suicide.

	<p pid=".185W.8/1">Flat rate fees force all students to pay the same fee, regardless of the quality of their course, the demand for it, and the return they get from it. Fixed fees mean that there would be no Office for Fair Access, no progress on widening access and no bursaries for poorer students; and they continue to subsidise rich students at the expense of poorer ones. Flat fees would also require universities to charge the required amount even where they wished to offer a course at a lower charge. Variable fees suffer none of these drawbacks: they are fairer than flat rate fees.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.0/2">The Department has signed a contract for the supply of Teachers' TV with Education Digital, a consortium of Carlton Communications, Brook Lapping Productions Ltd. and the Institute of Education of the University of London. The contract is to provide</p>

	<p pid=".192W.0/5">The costs to the Department of piloting the channel are currently estimated to be &pound;1.5 million. This figure comprises the costs of independent research into the effectiveness of the channel proposition as well as content production and distribution costs.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.0/6">The full channel, if launched, will need to demonstrate value for money compared to other expenditure to reach the same objectives.

	<p pid=".192W.0/7">The Department is currently proposing to underwrite the full costs of the channel through savings in other central expenditure. However, we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these through sponsorship, commercial airtime and programme sales. We have investigated the commercial value of Teachers' TV airtime, but concluded that, initially, the potential revenue would be unlikely to exceed the cost of sales. We will continue to investigate potential revenue streams that may result from a successful channel and that could be used to off-set total channel running costs.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.3/2">We have put in place a comprehensive measurement system to ensure the effectiveness of Teachers' TV. A balanced scorecard of measures will be used to measure performance in four areas:</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/3" class="italic">(a) Audience</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/4">Targets for channel reach and loyalty among the target audience will be set following the pilot (so the pilot can be used to establish realistic but stretching targets). Further key performance indicators have been set to measure relevance, applicability in the classroom and ease of use.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/5" class="italic">(b) Content</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/6">Educational outcomes for the channel have been set to ensure programming as a whole is in line with the Department's strategy (e.g. supports raising literacy and numeracy standards). An independent Teachers' TV board will ensure, among other things, programme quality standards are maintained.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/7" class="italic">(c) Financial</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/8">Open book accounting will be used to ensure financial transparency. Cost overruns will be borne entirely by the supplier by the Department. Under-spends on content will be entirely retained by the Department, while any economies which the channel supplier can realise in non-content areas will be shared between Department and supplier.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/9" class="italic">(d) Functional-technical</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/10">Industry best practice is being adopted in requiring the supplier to meet the same obligations placed on public service broadcasters by the Broadcasting Act 1990, such as independent and regional production quotas. This category also covers maintenance of technical standards such as channel downtime.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.3/11">The supplier will be paid on a cost-plus basis. In addition to costs, the supplier will be rewarded for performance against these key performance indicators. Of the maximum 12.5 per cent. channel management fee, 10 per cent. is performance-related, designed to reward excellence by the channel supplier in meeting channel objectives. An independent governance authority, drawing on the work of an independent research agency where appropriate, will evaluate supplier performance.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.0/1">The Education (Special Educational Needs) (England) (Consolidation) Regulations 2001 set out the actions that an authority must take to comply with a Tribunal order. If the authority does not comply within the appropriate period, the parent may complain to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. It will then be open to him to issue a direction under sections 496 or 497 of the Education Act 1996. Section 496 applies if the local education authority has acted unreasonably with respect to the exercise of any power or duty. Section 497 applies if the authority has failed to discharge a duty imposed on them.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.3/1">Departmental expenditure on attendance-specific measures includes around &pound;700,000 on publicity materials aimed at parents, practitioner conferences and research into truancy, &pound;11.25 million for electronic registration systems in secondary schools and around &pound;500,000 for intensive expert support for education welfare services in 60 local education authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.3/2">This is in addition to funding for a wide range of measures to improve behaviour and attendance provided by the School Inclusion: Pupil Support Grant between 1999 and 2003, through the Behaviour Improvement Programme since 2002 and through the behaviour and attendance strands of the Key Stage 3 Strategy and the Primary Strategy from 2003. Because many of these measures relate to both behaviour and attendance, expenditure on reducing truancy in secondary schools cannot be disaggregated.</p>
