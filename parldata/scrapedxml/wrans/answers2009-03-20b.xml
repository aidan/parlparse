	<p pid="b.1335W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice collects statistics on the number of finds under the Treasure Act 1996 reported to coroners in England and Wales during each calendar year, the number of treasure inquests concluded during the year and, of these, the number of verdicts of treasure returned. Information is not collected on the time taken to conduct treasure inquests.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335W.3/2">Informal figures are collated by the British Museum, which record the time between the inquest being requested by the British Museum and a verdict being returned. However, these figures only relate to treasure inquests which have been requested since 2006. The figures do not include inquests which were requested in earlier years, and so they do not reveal the longest time taken for treasure inquests which were concluded in each of the last three years. The British Museum figures show that the current longest-running ongoing treasure inquest was requested by them in March 2007.</p>

Members are entitled to regular health screening on request and can also self-refer for a consultation with the occupational health adviser or physician, if they believe that their work is having a detrimental effect on their health. There is also an emergency GP service available locally to Members. Given that the House is not the employer of Members' staff, it does not routinely provide occupational health services to them. The Parliamentary Welfare Service is aimed at staff of both Houses and does not formally provide welfare services for Members or their staff; but Members and their staff can ask for informal advice and guidance on the best way to deal with issues of concern. There is no provision for occupational health and welfare services for any civil servants who work on the Parliamentary Estate, as they have adequate access via their own employer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1347W.5/2">I met with a number of stakeholders at the largest consultation event, which was held in London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-11">11 December</phrase>. I provided an introduction to the event and answered questions from the floor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.5/3">My officials held four consultation events, three in London and one in Edinburgh. The London events were held on 4, 11 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December</phrase>; the Edinburgh event was held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-09">9 December</phrase>. Stakeholders were invited to attend and the consultation events were also publicised through the Office for Disability Issues website, the Office for Disability Issues newsletter (which reaches approximately 2,000 people), and via charities who raised the profile of the consultation through their own emails and websites. Following is a list which gives a selection of organisations which attendees came from. Notes were taken at each event and a summary will be included in the Government's response to the consultation, which is currently being prepared. A copy of the response will be placed in the Library on publication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.5/4">Informal meetings between officials and stakeholder groups have also taken place. Those stakeholder organisations with which informal discussions were held included the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Disabilities Charity Consortium (DCC). The DCC is an informal coalition of charities made up of Leonard Cheshire Disability, Mencap, Mind, RNIB, RNID, RADAR, Scope, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and Sense. Minutes of these meetings were not taken due to their informal nature.</p>

	<p pid="b.1350W.2/1">Get Safe Online is a joint public and private sector initiative to raise awareness of internet safety. Its work includes not only a website but community events, educational publicity campaigns, roundtable discussions and conferences as well as general PR and marketing activity to reach a broad audience and help inform general internet users of how to go online safely and with confidence. Research carried out in November 2008 showed that 22 per cent. of people were spontaneously aware of Get Safe Online. <a href="http://www.getsafeonline.org">www.getsafeonline.org</a> currently has over 291,000 links on the Internet compared to its US counterpart <a href="http://www.staysafeonline.info">www.staysafeonline.info</a> which has 11,000 links. The research also highlights an improvement in steps people are taking to prevent themselves falling victim to online crime such as a decrease in the number of people opening e-mail attachments from unknown sources and an increase in those updating their software, although it is difficult to directly attribute this to the campaign activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.2/2">The Cabinet Office has sponsored Get Safe Online for the past four financial years. Budgets for 2009-10 are yet to be determined in relation to my Department's sponsorship of Get Safe Online.

	<p pid="b.1350W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions asking:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/4" class="indent">1) How many death certificates included <i> (a)</i> smoking, <i> (b)</i> knife, <i> (c)</i> overweight, <i> (d)</i> anorexia, <i> (e)</i> bulimia and <i> (f)</i> influenza in the cause of death section in each of the last five years. (264116)</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/5" class="indent">2) How many death certificates included <i> (a)</i> Legionnaires' disease, <i> (b)</i> self-harm, <i> (c)</i><i> </i>cataract, <i> (d)</i> tuberculosis, <i> (e)</i> measles, <i> (f)</i> mumps and <i> (g)</i> rubella in the cause of death section m each of the last five years. (264117)</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/6" class="indent">The accurate reporting of deaths by specific causes depends on the complete recording of all relevant causes of death by medical practitioners and coroners. Medical practitioners are required to complete the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) to the best of their knowledge and belief. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to death to be recorded, and medical practitioners and coroners are not supposed to record all of the diseases or conditions present at or before death. Whether a condition contributed is a matter for their clinical judgment. The MCCD is not designed to collect information on risk factors or exposures related to the development of disease, such as smoking behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/7" class="indent">The tables attached provide the number of deaths where:</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/8" class="indent">1) <i> (a)</i> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of tobacco (b) contact with sharp object, <i> (c)</i> obesity, <i> (d)</i> anorexia nervosa, <i> (e)</i> bulimia nervosa, <i> (f)</i> influenza, or</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/9" class="indent">2) <i> (a)</i> Legionnaires' disease, <i> (b)</i> intentional self-harm, <i> (c)</i> cataract, <i> (d)</i> tuberculosis, <i> (e)</i><i> </i>measles, <i> (f)</i> mumps and <i> (g)</i> rubella were mentioned on the death certificate, in England and Wales, for 2003 to 2007 (the latest year available).</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/10" class="indent">The number of deaths due to (1) (a) mental and behavioural disorders due to use of tobacco is not the same as the number of deaths attributable to smoking. The cause of death recorded in the great majority of cases where smoking was a causal factor would be the specific disease, such as lung cancer or ischaemic heart disease, which led to death.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/11" class="indent">Although there are codes for contact, assault and intentional self-harm by sharp object, there are no specific codes for 'knife1, so these figures are likely to exceed the actual number of deaths involving (1) (b) knives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1350W.5/12" class="indent">Figures for (2) (b) self-harm are likely to be an underestimate, as they exclude any deaths where intent could not be ascertained. These figures do not correspond directly to the statistics published by ONS on suicides.</p>

The Children's Continuing Care Framework, which we hope to launch at the end of May, will provide local partners with the tools to provide tailor made packages of care, involving health, social care and education components. We are taking forward a discrete project looking at the benefits and opportunities arising from investment in community children's nursing services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.2/1">The General Dental Council (GDC) has introduced a requirement for dentists and dental care professionals to undertake regular continuing professional development (CPD) to maintain their registration. We have not commissioned research in respect of CPD, but we expect the GDC's requirement to develop into a revalidation scheme where by health professionals would be required to keep up to date with advances in medical and dental science. The White Paper Trust Assurance and Safety&mdash;The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;In the traditional system for regulating health professionals, once people had qualified and demonstrated that they were fit to practise with patients, their names were placed on the relevant professional register and remained there unless a definite reason came to light for their removal. Public and professional opinion has moved on in the course of this debate, from a position where trust alone was sufficient guarantee of fitness to practise, to one where that trust needs to be underpinned by objective assurance. Public opinion surveys suggest that people expect health professionals to participate in the revalidation of their registration and that many believe this takes place every year.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1363W.5/1">Primary care trusts' (PCTs) target revenue allocations are made on the basis of a fair funding formula, recommended by the independent Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, that directs funding towards areas of greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/2">We are committed to moving all PCTs towards their target allocations as quickly as possible, but this must be balanced with the need to ensure that all PCTs are appropriately supported with stable funding that both supports existing commitments and allows long-term planning, as well as recognising the unavoidable cost pressures that all PCTs face.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/3">The allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11 achieve this by ensuring that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/4" class="indent">average PCT growth is 5.5 per cent. each year;</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/5" class="indent">minimum growth is 5.2 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5.1 per cent. in 2010-11;</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/6" class="indent">no PCT will be more than 6.2 per cent. under target by the end of 2010-11; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/7" class="indent">no PCT will move further under target as a result of above average population growth in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/8">Further, we have ensured that the most under-target PCTs will benefit from the highest increases in funding. At the start of 2009-10, the most under-target PCT will be 10.6 per cent. below its target allocation. Over the next two years, that PCTs' allocation will grow by more than 17 per cent. and it will end 2010-11 only 6.2 per cent. below target. This is a significant achievement by historic standards: in 2003-04, the most under-target PCT was 22 per cent. below target.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/9">The rate at which PCTs will move towards their target allocation in future years will need to be considered in light of a number of factors including population changes, cost pressures and the resources available to the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363W.5/10">Compensation for PCTs that have received under-target allocations in the past would be difficult to determine as targets vary over time. It would effectively mean re-opening those allocation rounds, which would undermine stability of NHS funding and so long-term planning. Further, it could be funded only by reducing resources for other PCTs, which may result in painful cuts to services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1366W.8/2">The Government's 2012 legacy action plan, published in June 2008, sets a cross-Government target to get two million more adults active through sport and physical activity by 2012. The Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) and Sport England lead on getting one million people doing more sport. A range of Government Departments will deliver programmes that will increase wider physical activity. These programmes are outlined in the Department of Health's new Physical Activity Plan &quot;Be Active, Be Healthy&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-11">11 February 2009</phrase>. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.8/3">Sport England's Active People survey will be the measure for the two million target. The baseline for the target will be established using the 2007-08 Active People survey, the results of which were published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-11">11 December 2008</phrase>. The target is based on those adults aged 16 and over achieving three sessions of at least 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity activity per week. The target will also be informed by additional data collected on dance, active conservation and gardening from January 2009. A newly established Physical Activity Programme Board, chaired jointly by the Department and DCMS, will oversee the delivery of programmes against the Legacy Action Plan (LAP) target.</p>
	<p pid="b.1366W.8/4">The LAP target applies to all adults aged over 16 and &quot;Be Active, Be Healthy&quot; recognises that people with disabilities, ranging from physical and neurological to sensory impairments and learning disabilities are at particular risk from inactivity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1367W.2/2">The Government have made clear, both privately and publicly through the media, their support for the recommendations made by the independent Commission of Inquiry into Post-Election Violence. The creation of a Special Tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the violence will be an important step in efforts to end impunity and foster healing and reconciliation in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.2/3">Our support for a local independent tribunal is in line with the views of Kofi Annan, the Inquiry's recommendations and the Kenyan government's adoption of the recommendations. Such a tribunal, with an international prosecutor and judges and strong witness protection systems, could help rebuild confidence in Kenya's judiciary and would be a good route to justice for the victims of that violence, and to stopping it from re-occurring. The International Criminal Court in The Hague is another route for seeking justice and would be an alternative option if the creation of a local tribunal failed. But a local solution would be of greater benefit to Kenya in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.2/4">Our high commissioner to Kenya has discussed this subject with Kenyan ministers, including the President and Prime Minister, and with MPs and civil society groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1369W.6/1">The planned expenditure on the Integrated Children's System (ICS) for 2009-10 is &pound;8.7 million. This consists of &pound;5 million for capital grants to local authorities and &pound;3.7 million to cover project costs. ICS investment beyond 2009-10 will be subject to the outcomes of the 2009 Spending Review. Our plans will be informed by the conclusions of the feasibility study of ICS recommended by Lord Laming in his report earlier this month on progress on the protection of children in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.1372W.2/1">It is for schools and local authorities to support children with medical conditions at schools. The Department has issued guidance to schools to help them support their pupils. Our guidance to schools, &quot;Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings&quot;, issued jointly with the Department of Health in 2005, specifically addresses what schools can do to support pupils with medical needs such as diabetes. It encourages schools and local authorities to develop policies on the management of pupil's medicines and on supporting pupils with medical needs, taking account of local resources and their various responsibilities. We produced sister guidance in the same year, entitled &quot;Including me: managing complex health needs in schools and early years settings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372W.2/2">We are taking a number of steps to ensure that pupils with long term medical conditions have access to the help they need to enable them to attend school and participate in school activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372W.2/3">In April 2007, the Department of Health published a report entitled &quot;Making Every Young Person with Diabetes Matter&quot;, and has convened a group to support the implementation of best practice as set out in the report. The Department for Children, Schools and Families is represented on that group, and also on the sub-group set up to look specifically at support in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372W.2/4">Since September 2007 schools have a duty to promote the well-being of all pupils, including those with long term medical conditions. This duty defines well-being as the five outcomes of Every Child Matters, including being healthy and staying safe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372W.2/5">Most recently, the &quot;Child Health Strategy, Better Health: Brighter Futures&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-12">12 February</phrase> this year, announced that we will be revising the guidance to schools on managing medicines which will include clear statements of expectations of those involved in supporting pupils with medical conditions, such as schools and PCTs. Our intention is that this work will be done in consultation with expert organisations, such as Diabetes UK, and will be supported with an awareness raising campaign.</p>

	<p pid="b.1374W.2/2">The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains in the grip of a severe and prolonged humanitarian crisis, with 1.2 million people displaced by conflict in the east of the country, millions remaining food insecure and vulnerable to disease and natural disasters. However, the overall security situation in eastern DRC has improved over recent months. The end of hostilities and the integration into the national army of the CNDP militia (predominantly Rwandan militia group) since January has reduced barriers to humanitarian access in large areas of North Kivu, in turn allowing aid to reach those most in need. The longer-term humanitarian impact of joint DRC and Rwandan army operations against another militia group, the FDLR (former Rwandan Hutu forces) remains uncertain and the humanitarian community remains prepared to deal with any consequences that arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1374W.2/3">In the north of DRC, in Province Orientale, an ongoing joint DRC/Ugandan military operation which started in December against the Ugandan Lords Resistance Army (LRA) rebels has provoked widespread reprisals against the population by the LRA. This has generated humanitarian and protection needs for the population. MONUC have increased their military presence in the area in order to mitigate the humanitarian impact.</p>

These include the Benazir Income Support Programme, which is now one of the cornerstones of the government's efforts to protect poor people, especially in the current period of economic instability.</p>

Negotiations are in progress and have resulted in agreement over the apportionment of costs between Northern Ireland and the Republic in accordance with the Evidence Review undertaken last year. Maintaining an integrated aids to navigation service around the whole of our coasts benefits both our countries. The two governments are reviewing the benefits enjoyed by each country from this integrated approach, which will inform our continuing work to ensure that a more sustainable funding solution for Irish Lights is put in place.</p>

We estimate that at current exchange rates the net cost to the fund of providing aids to navigation in the Republic of Ireland for the year will be up to &pound;13 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1395W.0/1">In line with a commitment in the Energy White Paper 2007 DECC and Ofgem have agreed a set of proposals to allow larger DE schemes to become licensed suppliers operating on the public network, in a way that is proportionate to their size and impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.0/2">The proposals are set out in a decision letter published by Ofgem on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-06">6 February 2009</phrase>. The letter includes a statutory consultation notice to implement a new standard licence condition that will mean that DE schemes do not have to be a direct party to costly and complex industry codes where they have alternative arrangements in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.0/3">The letter also sets out guidance for the development and provision of supplier services agreements that will enable DE schemes and small suppliers to operate on the public electricity distribution network, with support from larger suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.0/4">The 'Distributed Energy Working Group' was set up to advise on development of these proposals. Full details of the Group and its activity are on the Ofgem website:</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.0/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk">www.ofgem.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.0/6">There are no plans to continue to meet with the Distributed Energy Working Group as currently constituted. Members of the group continue to be involved in the development of wider Distributed Energy and Heat policy in other fora.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.0/7">Distributed Energy Consultations published by Government and Ofgem have highlighted concerns that the current charging regime for using the distribution network does not properly reflect the benefits that DE can bring. These findings have been fed into a separate and ongoing project on the structure of use of system charges. This work is led by Ofgem working with distribution network operators.</p>

	<p pid="b.1409W.2/1">Home improvement agencies (HIAs) are not funded directly by Communities and Local Government. However, there are a number of funding streams which are paid to local authorities which can be used to fund and deliver HIA services. CLG announced a three year allocation for Supporting People in December 2007 of &pound;4.9 billion over period 2008-09 to 2010-11. This provides stability for service planning and delivery over this period. New handypersons funding of &pound;33 million is available over 2009-10 to 2010-11 to build capacity in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.2/2">The Disabled Facilities Grant provides a source of fee income for HIAs. The budget is &pound;468 million over the three years 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.2/3">In addition CLG sponsors the national body for HIAs (Foundations) to support the work of the agencies and service commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1409W.2/4">In autumn 2007 CLG commissioned Foundations to carry out research and produce a report on the options for the future delivery of HIA services. A summary report was published in September 2008.</p>

Meanwhile, the Saving Gateway will be introduced nationally in 2010 to promote saving among working age people on lower incomes. The Government have also legislated for reforms to the private pensions system that will encourage and enable more people to save for their retirement. The reforms include a duty on employers to automatically enrol all eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension and, for the first time, employers will also be required to contribute to workers pensions. In addition, personal accounts will be introduced to give those currently without access to a good quality workplace pension scheme&mdash;in particular, low to moderate earners&mdash;the opportunity to save.</p>

	<p pid="b.1414W.6/1">The UK's zero VAT rate for young children's clothing, including school uniforms is based on Article 110 of Directive 2006/112/EC. There is currently no scope within Annex III of Directive 2006/112/EC for a reduced VAT rate for school uniforms or children's clothing. Any change to European VAT agreements to allow the introduction of a new reduced rate of VAT to the current list, would require the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states.</p>
