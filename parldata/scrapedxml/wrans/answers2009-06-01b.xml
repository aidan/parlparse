	<p pid="b.1W.3/1">British farmers work extremely hard in challenging circumstances and the competitiveness of the industry is a key concern of the Government. Between 1973 and 2008, the productivity (measured as total factor productivity<sup>(1)</sup>) of UK agriculture grew by 55 per cent.<sup>(2)</sup> In addition to productivity, the international competitiveness of UK farming also depends, at least partially, on the strength of sterling against the currencies of our major competitors. The recent weakening of the &pound; against the euro since mid-2008 has meant that British agricultural exports are priced more competitively against our European competitors thereby strengthening our position on the EU export markets. However, in order to maintain competitiveness in the longer term, the industry must improve its productivity performance relative to the farming industries in our main competitor countries, and the Government are committed to helping them do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.3/2" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Total factor productivity is a physical measure of productivity and encompasses all businesses engaged in farming activities, including specialist contractors. Total factor productivity excludes subsidies.</p>

	<p pid="b.7W.2/1">While the dairy sector is responsible for determining milk production, DEFRA helps the supply chain address issues through the Dairy Supply Chain Forum.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/2">I am aware of the current prices and declining milk production, and their effect on the dairy sector at present. This is not specific to the UK, as other EU member states are also experiencing similar drops in milk deliveries. It is normal to see a fall in prices at this time of year due to seasonal production increases. This has been exacerbated somewhat by the high returns experienced in 2007-08 which resulted in an increase in supply, and the fall in global demand seen recently due to the current economic situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.7W.8/1">DEFRA no longer funds the Rural Housing Enablers (RHEs). From April 2005 to March 2008, DEFRA had part-funded this scheme to allow a smooth transition to local authorities and other funding sources after the Countryside Agency withdrew from this area of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.8/2">The vision for the long-term funding of RHEs was that they should be supported at a local level by the same local authorities and housing associations whose rural delivery they exist to support. This reflects the Government's desire to enable decisions about priorities to be taken at the local level in response to local needs. Hence, local authorities, housing associations and registered social landowners now fund the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.24W.2/1">Medical policy for the Defence Medical Services (DMS) is overseen by the Surgeon General's Department (SGD). However, the organisational structure of the DMS means that comprehensive primary care and individual operational costs cannot be provided without disproportionate cost as they are disaggregated and embedded in the budgets of individual military units and overall operational budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.2/2">In Afghanistan, members of the DMS are deployed to provide the necessary in-theatre care and treatment for all our personnel. Funding for these personnel, and all associated treatment costs, are provided from overall operational budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.2/3">In the UK, the majority of secondary health care is provided in NHS hospitals by both DMS and civilian medical staff. The single service medical services are responsible for delivering primary health care to their respective service commanders-in-chief. This includes local medical centres, including GPs, Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs), and Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs). It is not possible to separate out costs from overall unit medical budgets without disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.24W.2/4">The DCMHs provide out-patient mental health treatment for those requiring it, and, as noted above, funding for these falls to the single service commands. In the relatively few cases where in-patient care is required, this has since 2004 been provided under contract with external providers. The costs for in-patient care of UK service personnel in each year to date are provided in the following table:</p>

The Army is unable to provide this information as it is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Navy figures are for administrative and disciplinary discharge only as all other information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. During this period, the RAF was engaged in a significant redundancy programme to meet manning targets and this is reflected in the table.

An exact record of the number of staff who contributed work is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.2/2">The first stage of the review was conducted jointly by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in consultation with the Cabinet Office. The Treasury were informed at all stages. The Department of Trade and Industry were involved in all work with industrial ramifications. The views of all Departments on the options arising from the review work were gauged within a Cabinet Office inter-departmental committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.2/3">Our NATO allies and other partners were kept fully informed of the process during the period of the review. The NATO and WEU Secretary Generals, Defence Ministers of NATO allies and Five Power Defence Arrangements and Gulf Co-operations Councils were kept informed in letters and at a broad range of NATO and bilateral meetings.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.2/4">The review was announced on <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-28">28 May 1997</phrase> and published on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-08">8 July 1998</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.42W.2/5">The exact cost of the review is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, we assess the cost to be in the region of &pound;2.3 million. This does not include normal staff costs, as all MOD staff involved in the work completed it as part of their day to day activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.43W.8/1">In February 2006, The Future Role of Crombie Study made recommendations as to the future role and manpower requirements at DSDA Crombie. These recommendations were approved by the then Minister of State for Armed Forces. At the time it was determined that 26 posts would enable the safe and effective running of DSDA Crombie, as the site was to reduce to that of a jetty/waterfront support operation upon the intended drawdown of explosive storage and processing activity by <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>. Prior to the full implementation of the recommendations, additional work was transferred to Crombie from other DSDA sites, which brought with it an increase in manpower of 14 posts, although future manpower requirements at the site are still being considered. I will write when this work is finalised.</p>

	<p pid="b.45W.5/1">The decision to close most of our military hospitals was taken over a decade ago, after it had become clear that they did not have a sufficient patient volume or range of military cases to develop and maintain the skills of our medical personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.5/2">On a typical day we have barely enough military inpatients, in all NHS hospitals across the UK, to fill two wards. This would be insufficient to sustain even a single, low-level civilian hospital and would require all patients to be brought together in one location, which in many cases would involve a major disruption for families and friends as well as for the patient. Meeting the health needs of veterans is the responsibility of the NHS and in the main their needs will reflect the health needs of the wider population. The same argument of not sending patients to a single dedicated hospital to keep it viable would apply equally to the national veteran patient population.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.5/3">The House of Commons Defence Select Committee agreed with the policy finding that:</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;the arguments in favour of the closure of the stand-alone Service hospitals irresistible. We accept that the reduction in numbers of personnel which took place in the Armed Forces after the end of the Cold War meant that there was insufficient patient volume to make the military hospitals viable in the long term.&quot;</p>

It maintains a network of military joint regional liaison officers who advise on Defence assistance through the Government offices for the regions and contribute to local and regional resilience forums and crisis management groups.

These changes are now in place but will be formally published in the revised Central Government Concept of Operations which is expected this summer.

	<p pid="b.53W.5/3">The estimated cost of the stamp duty holiday of &pound;280 million was based on the most recent SDLT receipt data and accounting for expected changes in house prices, transactions and behavioural effects available at the time of the pre-Budget report. The Treasury does not publish forecasts of house prices or transaction volumes.</p>

Our latest estimate puts the cost of the original holiday at &pound;250 million, with an additional cost of &pound;90 million for the extension to December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.53W.5/5">Around 90,000 transactions (in addition to those falling below the original &pound;125,000 threshold) have already been exempted from stamp duty by the holiday.

Nor is there any accepted definition of the term &quot;punitive&quot; in the context of tariffs. However, the World Trade Organisation publishes statistics on the number of Trade Defence measures (anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard measures) imposed by its members. Measures against the EU as a whole or some of its member states over 1997 to 2008 were as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.63W.8/2">Ofcom have recently moved to Stage Two of a comparative selection process for the first three harmonised, pan-European 116 numbers for services of social value. At this stage&mdash;in a detailed assessment of applicants&mdash;Ofcom will be looking at how the bidding organisations address equality and diversity issues in their own workplaces, and how they will address equality and diversity in both relationships with callers and in promoting the services they offer. Bidding service provider (SP)/communications provider (CP) partnerships will also be required at this stage of the scrutiny to present on how they will handle calls from non-English speakers and citizens who cannot communicate effectively through the spoken word. The selection advisory committee can also stipulate and monitor conditions attached to the allocation and use of the number that will ensure ease of accessibility for all potential users of the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.8/3">Ofcom published a response to the public consultation on allocation and charging for 116 numbers in the UK&mdash;which included representations from the deaf, hard of hearing and sign language user communities. This response, including an Impact and Equality assessment, is available on their website. Separately, Ofcom has recently launched a consultation &quot;Access and Inclusion&quot; which commits &quot;to ensuring that disabled people can access communications services on an equivalent basis to others and propose to work to tackle the most critical issues that they face. This will include assessing the policy case for improving the existing text relay service&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.66W.9/1">The Government carried out an extensive study into personal carbon trading last year. This was one of a number of potential long term options being explored for making individuals better informed about, and involved in, tackling climate change. The aim was to try and understand the issues surrounding personal carbon trading better.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.9/2">The study concluded that personal carbon trading has potential to engage individuals in taking action to combat climate change, but is essentially ahead of its time and expected costs for implementation are high. The findings are available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

There is a range of house types including detached bungalows, mid terraces and large detached houses. Six of the houses were built before 1900 and so have solid walls, although most of these also had extensions built more recently.</p>

This has now been revised to a central case (i.e. a mid-range estimate of what suppliers might achieve) of 2.5 million. This is an illustration of what is achievable under CERT, to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness, and is not a plan of measures to be installed, nor an expectation of what suppliers will do. It is based on a variety of factors including our understanding of the energy supply chain. It is at energy suppliers' discretion which of the eligible measures they promote, with levels of consumer demand a key factor in determining the number of measures installed.</p>

However, research shows developing country governments and citizens face challenges in finding out how much aid their country receives. The Department for International Development (DFID) leads the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) which was launched in September 2008. It brings together donors, developing country governments and Non-Governmental Organisations to agree common information standards so they can share more and better information about aid. Agreement on essential elements of the standards is expected by the end of 2009. Further information on IATI is available on the DFID website:</p>

	<p pid="b.73W.5/1">Access to the Swat Valley is severely constrained for relief agencies; however, information from partners, including the United Nations, suggests that the humanitarian situation in the Swat Valley is very poor. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) states that the region's principal hospital in Mingora has been cut off from water and electricity supply systems. Across the Swat Valley, frequent curfews make it difficult for people to reach basic services.</p>

	<p pid="b.76W.2/4">Canterbury Crown court have introduced a number of initiatives to reduce the length of time a case can take to come to trial but there are other factors which influence the speed at which cases commence such as preparedness of the prosecuting agency or defence, and the availability of witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.76W.2/5">Last year, HMCS timeliness improved significantly from 77.6 per cent. of cases dealt with within target in 2007-08 to 79.7 per cent. of cases dealt with within target in 2008-09. Nationally HMCS are committed to further improving Crown court timeliness and are working closely with the senior judiciary to improve case management, improve timeliness and reduce the number of hearings. There have already been local and national improvements. Additionally more sitting days have been allocated for 2009-10 than in previous years.</p>

	<p pid="b.80W.0/1">A study of criminal histories and reoffending rates of PND recipients is under way and we aim to publish the findings in late 2009. Provisional, unpublished results from this study show that of a sample of 13,800 juvenile and adult offenders given a penalty notice for disorder (PND) for theft during 2005, 33 per cent. reoffended within 12 months of receiving the PND. This study used data recorded on the police national computer and counted as a &quot;reoffence&quot; any offence committed during the 12-month period that resulted in a conviction or caution.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.0/2">This estimate cannot be directly compared to the published reoffending rates for three reasons:</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.0/3" class="indent">it includes offences leading to a caution as well as a conviction whilst the published National Statistics on adult reoffending counts only convictions;</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.0/4" class="indent">it covers offenders who in general have very different offending backgrounds to those in the published cohorts; which cover offenders discharged from prison and offenders commencing a court order under probation supervision;</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.0/5" class="indent">it covers both juvenile and adult offenders together, whereas reoffending data is published separately for adults and juveniles.</p>
	<p pid="b.80W.0/6">We are currently reviewing the use of PNDs for retail theft and will inform the House of our conclusions shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.83W.0/2">The site at Scarisbrick was one of a number of sites brought to the attention of the National Offender Management Service as part of the site search exercise for &quot;Titan&quot; prisons to hold 2,500 prisoners. It was assessed, but not considered suitable for development as a Titan. There are, therefore, no plans for a prison at Scarisbrick.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.0/3">For any new prison, before the submission of planning application for the site of a new prison, officials hold a public exhibition setting out the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.83W.3/1">The following tables show a breakdown of <i> (a)</i> suspected and <i> (b)</i> viable explosive devices or components found in each prison in England and Wales in each of the last 12 years up to the end of March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.3/2">Of these incidents 76 per cent. were suspected devices. This category covers false alarms including such incidents as unattended bags or suspicious packages sent via the postal system, or bomb hoax calls.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.3/3">Viable explosive devices mainly relate to prisoners making small incendiary devices by packing readily available flammable material such as match heads into an improvised container (17 per cent. of incidents in table); 6 per cent. of incidents relate to unexploded wartime ordnance discovered during excavation work; and, 1 per cent. relates to fireworks being found in the grounds of establishments.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.3/4">There were no serious injuries as a result of any of these incidents and minor injuries were recorded in just three cases. Apart from unexploded wartime ordnance finds, none of the viable devices discovered were likely to have had the capability to cause life threatening injuries and none involved the use of sophisticated improvised explosives or commercial or military explosives.</p>

	<p pid="b.90W.6/1">Data held by the Ministry of Justice shows that there were 62,565 defendants found guilty at all courts for 'stealing from shops and stalls' (shoplifting) under the Theft Act 1968 sec. 1, in England and Wales 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.90W.6/2">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figure given on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="b.91W.0/1">Non-payment of a penalty notice for disorder (PND) does not of itself result in prosecution for failing to pay. Recipients of PNDs may either pay the penalty or opt for a court hearing, when they may be prosecuted for the original offence. If they do neither, a fine of one and a half times the amount of the penalty is registered against them, this is enforceable in the normal way for fines. Of the 45,146 penalty notices for disorder issued for shop theft in 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, 172 chose to have their case heard by a court and 24,344 fines were registered. Currently it is not possible to provide separate enforcement rates for fines arising from unpaid PNDs.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.6/1">Nationally, employment and support allowance claimants will continue to have access to back to work support through the successful Pathways to Work Programme, including a series of six mandatory work focused interviews with a personal adviser in the first eight months of the claim. From late 2010 we will extend to two years the period during which new claimants are required to engage with us through work focused interviews. This will provide a more comprehensive framework of engagement in which to address the claimant's barriers to work. Claimants in the support group will not be required to attend any work focused interviews, but will be able to volunteer for Pathways support.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.6/2">Additionally, we anticipate that approximately 6 per cent. of new employment and support allowance claimants will be included in the personalised employment programme pilots which will test a single, integrated, flexible employment programme for jobseeker's allowance claimants, new employment and support allowance claimants and parents with younger children.

	<p pid="b.96W.2/1">Employment and support allowance was introduced for new claims in October 2008. It is estimated that by paying employment and support allowance rates to new claimants rather than the relevant incapacity benefit rates, the Department saves &pound;2 million in 2008-09 and spends an extra &pound;33 million in 2009-10. These figures reflect only the changes in rates of benefit and do not take into account the effect of different eligibility criteria in the benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.99W.9/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what the average processing time for Jobseeker's Allowance claims received from Bristol was in the last period for which figures are available; how many claims for Jobseeker's Allowance received from persons resident in Bristol West constituency are yet to be processed; what steps the Department is taking to improve processing times for claims received for Jobseeker's Allowance in Bristol. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.9/4" class="indent">In Jobcentre Plus we aim to process Jobseeker's Allowance claims within an average of 11.5 working days. Jobseeker's Allowance claims for customers in Bristol are processed at our Bristol Benefit Delivery Centre. The latest figures available for Jobseeker's Allowance claims are for the month of March 2009. These figures show that during March 2009 the Bristol Benefit Delivery Centre processed Jobseeker's Allowance claims on average within 8.9 working days of the claim being made.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April 2009</phrase> there were 1,387 new claims to Jobseeker's Allowance to be processed at Bristol Benefit Delivery Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.9/6" class="indent">During the operational year 2008/09 we processed all Jobseeker's Allowance claims in Bristol within 10.1 days. This is significant as during the twelve month period from April 2008 to March 2009 our Bristol Benefit Delivery Centre saw the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance rise by 133.5 per cent from 8,550 to 19,960. Despite this increase in our workload we have continued to perform well in processing new claims.</p>
	<p pid="b.99W.9/7" class="indent">We anticipate that additional resources are required to deal with the increasing number of new claims to Jobseeker's Allowance arising during the economic downturn. We have recently recruited 130 new staff in the West of England district across a range of Jobcentre Plus offices and duties. These people are currently at various stages of the recruitment process; some have been recruited and trained, whilst others are awaiting screening clearance. Another 105 new staff have been recruited on a fixed term basis and are currently awaiting allocation to posts and training.</p>

	<p pid="b.100W.2/1">Evidence from the Labour Force Survey 2006-08 shows that there are around 40,000 people who have two jobs each paying below the lower earnings limit but when aggregated their earnings are at least equal to the lower earnings limit. Around half of these people are estimated to already be accruing entitlement to contributory benefits through other interactions with the system and represent less than 0.1 per cent. of all people accruing entitlement to state pension in those years.</p>
	<p pid="b.100W.2/2">These are point-in-time data and people are unlikely to remain in this position for lengthy periods and may well have other opportunities to build up qualifying years during their working lives. Reforms in the Pensions Act 2007, including the reduction in the number of qualifying years to 30 for a basic state pension, mean that from 2010 people reaching state pension age will have far greater opportunity to build up a full basic state pension entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.101W.2/2">The information is not collected centrally and therefore the numbers requested are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/3">Government have introduced a number of changes to trivial commutation rules in recent years to help people avoid the problem of stranded pension pots. The 2004 Finance Act increased considerably the amount that could be trivially commuted from &pound;2,500 in 2005-06 to &pound;15,000 in 2006-07. This change benefits those with individual funds above the old limit. However, the limit applies to the aggregate value of all funds held by an individual (to ensure trivial commutation is not exploited for tax reasons) and so can still result in an individual with several pension funds facing one or more stranded pots.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/4">Easements to the trivial commutation rules for occupational pensions come into force <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase>. These amend rules so that small occupational pension pots of less than &pound;2,000 can be commuted as a trivial lump sum irrespective of the total value of funds held by the individual. This will help to ease the problem of stranded pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/5">The problem of stranded pensions must be weighed against the need to make sure that pension savings, which attract favourable tax treatment, are ring-fenced to generate income in retirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.104W.11/1">Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such, there are many possible measures of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/2">It is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Any current projection of the number of pensioners in low income would be subject to uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/3">While the Department does not publish projections on pensioner poverty, use of the static benefit model provides a broad indication of potential change going forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/4">Analysis shows no discernible change to the number of pensioners below 60 per cent. of median household income and also no discernible change to those eligible for pension credit if the basic state pension were increased in line with earnings in each of the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/5">We have committed to restoring the link with earnings in 2012 or by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. Earnings uprating is part of a coherent and affordable set of reforms which are intended to work in the long run as a complementary package which together mean that only around 40 per cent. of pensioner households will be entitled to one or more income related benefits by 2050 compared to around 75 per cent. in 2050 without reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/6" class="indentitalic"> Notes</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/7" class="indent">1. Analysis has been conducted using the Department's Policy Simulation Model.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/8" class="indent">2. In the financial years up to and including 2014-15 Treasury Economic assumptions consistent with Budget 2009 have been used to model prices and earnings uprating.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.11/9" class="indent">3. The model used is a static model. Estimates are therefore not a forecast of expected poverty, but a broad indication of the likely impact on poverty and pension credit caseload brought on purely from changing from price to earnings uprating, all else remaining constant.</p>

	<p pid="b.110W.10/1">To date, delivery of construction materials to the Olympic Park site by water has been in the form of pilot operations to determine wharf locations and areas that require dredging. Regular use of the waterways will commence this summer following the opening of Prescott Lock in June which will enable 350-tonne barge access into the site.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.10/2">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is firmly committed to sustainability and actively encourages all contractors to use sustainable transportation methods. The ODA Sustainability Development Strategy (2007) states that 50 per cent. of construction materials (by weight) will be transported by sustainable means. There are no specific targets in relation to water or rail transportation.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.10/3">In May 2008, Aggregate Industries was appointed sole provider of all aggregate materials needed for the construction of the venues and infrastructure to the Olympic Park including sand, gravel, crushed stone and recycled concrete. Aggregate Industries aims to transport 99 per cent. of aggregate materials via sustainable transport methods, surpassing the ODA's target of 50 per cent. The aim is that approximately 74 per cent. of the aggregate materials will be transported by rail and 25 per cent. by water, with only 1 per cent. transported by road for specialist materials which do not have established rail and water links.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.2/2">The opening of navigable waterways will enable freight barges to carry construction materials in, and waste out, of the park during the construction phase and the Olympic Delivery Authority actively encourages contractors to employ sustainable transport methods at every opportunity.

To date no applications have been refused.</p>
	<p pid="b.117W.5/2">A wide range of European guidelines is available for industry, for example on meeting the relevant quality and manufacturing standards. We recognise that moving from a largely unregulated environment into systematic medicines regulation represents a significant challenge for parts of the over-the-counter herbal medicines sector. Accordingly, the MHRA has been running a programme to manage the regulatory impact of the directive. This includes the opportunity for individual companies seeking to progress applications to register products under the scheme to be given regulatory and scientific advice. Our expectation is that, as with any such new scheme, with growing experience an increasing range of companies will become confident in operating under these regulatory arrangements.</p>

The package involves accelerating the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme and ensuring that all the programme's services recruit employment support co-ordinators to join up health and job centre services in ways that are tailor-made for individuals' different situations.

	<p pid="b.118W.9/2">The Government recognise that there is a need to improve the timeliness of access to secure mental health care by prisoners with acute, severe mental illness. In his report on people with mental health problems or learning disabilities in the criminal justice system (published <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April 2009</phrase>), Lord Bradley has recommended that a target of 14 days should be set. The Government's Health and Criminal Justice Board, which is just being established, will consider the feasibility of such a target. It will also ensure that where further guidance to the NHS and criminal justice agencies is necessary, this is issued by 2010, so that along with improved commissioning of services and availability of secure health services, the goals of improved security and timely access to secure health services by prisoners can be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="b.123W.3/1">The Department commissions and reviews numerous papers on choice. The following answer shows the details of many of the papers, research and surveys on patient choice that the Department has commissioned and reviewed in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.3/2">As part of its ongoing patient choice programme the Department commissions research on various aspects of choice policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.3/3">The Department commissioned a series of national patient choice surveys to assess the implementation of choice at primary care trust (PCT) level. The National Patient Choice Survey is a series of surveys, conducted by Ipsos MORI on behalf of the Department. They monitor patient awareness of choice and recall of having been offered a choice of hospital for their first outpatient appointment. They were designed to provide a national overview of choice with summary results at PCT level (initially bi-monthly and now quarterly) and generally have an effective response rate around 30 per cent. Surveys also contain information on respondents' age, sex and ethnicity. The report of the December 2008 survey was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.3/4">The Health Reform Evaluation Programme (HREP) is a programme of research being coordinated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to evaluate the reforms set out in the Department's publication &quot;Health Reform in England: update and next steps&quot;. This includes research on a range of issues including patient choice. Final reporting will begin in 2010. As part of the HREP, LSHTM have also conducted a &quot;systematic review of the impact of patient choice of provider in the English NHS<sup>(1)</sup>&quot; (2009). An ongoing study under this programme which is yet to report is entitled &quot;Effects of choice and market reform on inequalities of access to health care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.3/5">The Department commissions a module on attitudes to health issues in the British Social Attitudes annual survey conducted by Natcen. This involves a series of questions about social attitudes towards health and health services. Some of these questions are about attitudes towards patient choice. The results of the survey are published in a report on an annual basis<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.123W.3/6">The Department is conducting regional awareness campaigns on patient choice and has commissioned an evaluation of these campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.0/1">The Department has already provided a great deal of support to hospitals in the form of guidance and on-going workshops to ensure that contingency and business continuity issues have been thought through in advance of a pandemic and addressed. Model exercises have been provided to support the national health service in raising awareness and testing the robustness of these plans. Each primary care trust also has a designated flu lead to assist organisations with planning across their geographic area.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/2">We have published guidance on infection control in hospitals and surgeries, and advice to staff treating or caring for patients with flu symptoms. A copy has been placed in the Library. We have also issued guidance to ambulance trusts. A copy of this guidance has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State stated on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-14">14 May 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-14.1059"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 1059-1095</phrase>, that the likelihood of the current outbreak developing into a full blown pandemic remains high, but there are still many uncertainties about the virus. That is still the case. Scientists are learning more every day and we are continuing to monitor the situation so that if the virulence or severity of the virus worsens we can react quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/4">The Department has been planning for a possible influenza pandemic for some time and has robust plans in place. We have enough antiviral stocks to cover 50 per cent. of the population (some 33.5 million courses); we are further increasing the stockpile so that it is enough to cover 80 per cent. of the population (some 50 million courses).</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/5">We also expect flu line, which will be used to assess symptoms and authorise anti-virals for individuals, to be operational by the autumn, thus ensuring we have additional capability to respond to a re-emergence of the virus.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-15">15 May</phrase>, the Government also announced the signing of agreements with vaccine manufacturers for up to 90 million doses of a pre-pandemic vaccine based on the current H1N1 strain. The agreements could provide enough vaccine to protect the most vulnerable groups in our population before a pandemic is likely to arrive. In the event of a pandemic, the advanced purchase agreements previously signed with Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline will be activated; these will enable the United Kingdom to purchase enough vaccine to cover 100 per cent. of the UK population.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/7">In addition, we are increasing our stocks of facemasks, respirators and antibiotics to ensure we have sufficient stocks of countermeasures to tackle a re-emergence of swine influenza later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.141W.2/1">Under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, control of fluid intake is used to motivate monkeys so that they will perform extended sequences of behaviour in behavioural neuroscience experiments. The monkeys are trained to perform simple or complex tasks for which small amounts of a fluid, referred to as rewards or reinforcers, are used to motivate the animals and maintain behavioural or cognitive performance. The fluid control may involve limiting the time fluid is available, or may involve reducing the total amount fluid provided per day.

	<p pid="b.141W.5/2"><i> </i>There is no authoritative definition of the term 'household products' and it is not defined in any national or international legislation. However, in the context of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, regard is paid to the definition of finished household products as set out in the 2002 publication on &quot;The Use of Animals in Testing Household Products&quot; produced by the Boyd Group, a forum encompassing a wide rage of expertise and perspectives concerned with the use of animals in scientific procedures. All products that are primarily intended for use in the home fall within the sub-category of 'Substances used in the household' and would include such products as detergents and other laundry products, household cleaners, air-fresheners, toilet blocks, polishes, paper products such as infant nappies, paints, glues (and removers), other furnishing and DIY products and household pesticides. The sub-category applies to both finished household products and their ingredients, although in practice mainly the latter are tested.</p>

	<p pid="b.158W.11/1">The illegal supply of Class B drugs is a serious matter. Trafficking in controlled drugs of all classes needs to be tackled robustly in order to reduce the harm drugs cause to communities and the organised criminality associated with their supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.11/2">The Government's strategy is to bear down on all points in the drugs supply chain in order to disrupt criminal gangs, stifle drug supply and reduce the harm caused to communities in the UK. Increasing quantities of drugs are being seized and organised crime groups and dealers disrupted.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.11/3">The latest figures published show that in 2007-08, there were 8,671 seizures of Class B drugs by the police and HMRC in England and Wales, up 4 per cent. from the 8,304 seizures the previous year. The majority of the Class B seizures in 2007-08 were amphetamines, with 8,412 in 2007-08, an increase of 5 per cent. from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.11/4">It is right that the police should prioritise action to tackle the offences which cause the most harm. For this reason, operational activity tends to focus on Class A drugs, particularly the supply of heroin and cocaine. Where Class B drugs pose a threat within a community, these will become a focus of police activity.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-05">5 May 2009</phrase>, the UK Border Agency published a list of 16 individuals who have been excluded since last October 2008.

	<p pid="b.162W.3/1">The Government take all fraud seriously wherever it is perpetrated, which is why we have allocated &pound;29 million in new funding over three years to implement the National Fraud Programme which includes establishing a National Fraud Authority; a National Fraud Reporting Centre and a National Lead Force for investigating serious and complex fraud. The National Fraud Authority which brings together Government, law enforcement and industry representatives, became operational in October last year and on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-19">19 March</phrase> published the first National Fraud Strategy which will benefit all areas of the country. The National Fraud Reporting Centre will equip law enforcement agencies with a powerful intelligence tool, enabling the police to collate information from fraud cases across the country, leading to better intelligence and hence better targeted operations, as well as better prevention advice for businesses and the public. In its rote as national lead force, City of London Police will tackle serious and complex fraud wherever it occurs and assist other police forces by offering training and best practice advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/2" class="italic"> (i) Police National Computer (PNC)</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/3">The Police National Computer (PNC) is a critical national service which the Police Service and many others in the Criminal Justice System rely on in order to perform their jobs effectively and safely.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/4">The PNC contains records from a number of separate information databases. The information records stored on the PNC are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/5" class="indent">Vehicles&mdash;these records are made up of the key data items held by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) that describe the vehicle and its registered keeper. This information, supplemented by any police reports relating to vehicles of interest to the police, is primarily used for roads policing purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/6" class="indent">Drivers Licences&mdash;these records are made up of the key data items from DVLA and record driver entitlement. Their use is confined to roads policing. The system was constructed to enable enquiries to be carried out efficiently and save members of the public from having to present their documents at police stations, reducing inconvenience and saving police time.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/7" class="indent">Property&mdash;these records are constructed by the police and describe stolen, lost and found items of property that are uniquely identifiable by a (serial) number.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/8" class="indent">Crimelink&mdash;these records are constructed by the police and relate to serious unsolved crimes, where the perpetrator has yet to be identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/9" class="indent">National Firearms Certificate Holders&mdash;these are records pertaining to the management of firearm licences. They hold details of members of the public who legally own firearms, renew firearms licences, have been refused a licence or had one revoked. The Dunblane tragedy was a key driver for developing the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/10" class="indent">Names&mdash;these records are created when individuals are arrested. They record any charges and the subsequent disposal. All recordable convictions are held on the PNC. In England and Wales, records are retained in accordance with ACPO's Criminal Records Office PNC Data Retention Guidelines (publicly available via the ACRO website). In essence all records are retained until the individual is 100 years of age. Records from Scotland are retained in accordance with their legislation and records on the PNC are deleted in the same timeframe as that of Scotland's Criminal History System (CHS).</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/11">The table shows the number of records held on the PNC, broken down by the various information databases, as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-13">13 November 2008</phrase>. These figures are not mutually exclusive; for example, the same record may be included in more than one database.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.8/35">While this illustrates the data fields available they will not all be completed for every record.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/36">Where fields are sub-divided, for example a post code may be entered in two parts, or where multiple entries can occur, for example up to 999 addresses may be entered on a person's record, this has been counted as one data field.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/37" class="italic"> (ii) Impact Nominal Index (INI)</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/38">The INI is a system used by all police forces in the United Kingdom and other joint operating authorities such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre. It provides summary level information of people who have passed through one of six business areas of the police forces. These business areas are: crime, custody, child protection, domestic violence, firearms licensing (revoked and refused) and intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/39">The system is part of the response to Sir Michael Bichard's inquiry into the Soham murders, seeking to provide a national information sharing capability to prevent criminals escaping detection simply by crossing force boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/40">As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-19">19 March 2009</phrase> there were 69,246,299 records on the INI.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/41">Each INI record contains 15 data fields, which include eight fields for the basic nominal data such as surname, forenames, PNC ID, date of birth, age and gender.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/42">The remaining fields contain reference information pertaining to the origin of the data such as the details of the police force/organisation, reference ID, business area and number of records held.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/43" class="italic"> (iii) Police National Database (PND)</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/44">The PND has not yet been built and therefore does not contain any records or data fields.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/45" class="italic"> (iv) National DNA Database</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/46">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) plays a key role in catching criminals, eliminating the innocent from investigations and focusing the direction of inquiries. It is also one of the few long-term investigation tools, sometimes identifying criminals many years after they believe they have escaped detection. The purpose of the NDNAD is to match DNA profiles left at crime scenes with DNA profiles from known subjects and thereby provide the police with a lead for further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/47">As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> there were 5,614,411 subject profile records retained on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) from all police forces, relating to approximately 4,856,466 individuals. Of these, 5,258,779 were from English and Welsh police forces, relating to approximately 4,548,844 individuals. In addition, as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase> there were 343,657 crime scene profiles retained on the NDNAD, of which 329,482 were from English and Welsh police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/48">The reason why the number of subject profile records is not the same as the number of individuals is that it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion; that is, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names or different versions of their name on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/49">All NDNAD records have the same structure consisting of 36 data fields. However, some of these fields are only relevant to subject profiles, and some are only relevant to crime scene profiles. Therefore, no record will have all data fields completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/50" class="italic"> (v) National Fingerprint Database (IDENT.1)</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/51">IDENT1, the national fingerprint database, is central to police investigation, crime detection and public safety. It gives the ability to establish the identity of arrestees and link a presence at a crime scene with a verified identity quickly and, where necessary, to a forensic standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/52">As at the end of February 2009, the IDENT1 (National Fingerprint Database) Unified Collection of Print Sets contained the verified identities of 7.8 million individuals, with which were associated 16.9 million sets of ten-prints and 6.7 million palm prints. The Unified Collection of Unresolved Crime Scene Marks contained 1.78 million finger marks and 115,000 palm marks. There were also 4,600 marks in the Serious Crime Collection.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/53">In addition to the fields representing the biometric data above, there are five fields relating to the biographic data associated with each person: first name, surname, date of birth, gender and appearance.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/54" class="italic"> (vi) National ANPR Data Centre (NADC)</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/55">Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology allows vehicle registration marks to be &quot;read&quot; by cameras and for the details to be compared against identified database records.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/56">ANPR data itself involves a number of different components. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/57" class="indent">The overview image, which shows a picture of those parts of vehicle captured by camera while photographing the number plate.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/58" class="indent">The plate patch, which extracts and isolates the picture of the number plate from the overview image.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/59" class="indent">The ANPR interpretation (Read) which shows how the ANPR programme has read the number plate.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/60" class="indent">Hotlists, which are lists of vehicles of interest to the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/61" class="indent">ANPR matches (hits) which show when an ANPR read has matched something on a hotlist.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/62" class="indent">Time, date and location stamp, which show when and where the data was obtained (the entire national system is time/date synchronised).</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/63">The NADC provides a national store for the ANPR data captured by police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/64">The NADC does not itself contain personal data. However, it does contain data which, when combined with other data sources (e.g. vehicle keeper records), could identify an individual. Access to the NADC is only permitted for major and serious investigations and requires authorisation in each case by a senior officer. The level of authority required to access ANPR data increases over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/65">It is estimated that there are currently 1.3 billion records held on the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/66">For each number plate read recorded, nine fields are populated. For each number plate read that matches a &quot;hotlist&quot; (for example a list of uninsured vehicles), 11 fields are populated, six fields are used to record details of cameras, four fields are used to record audit information.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/67" class="italic"> (vii) UK Border Agency's e-borders programme</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/68">The Semaphore Legacy system of e-Borders currently contains over 82 million records.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.8/69">The e-Borders system will capture data on passengers and crew arriving in and departing from the UK. This data is API (Advance Passenger Information) and OPI (Other Passenger Information). API will be captured on all those travelling to and from the UK and will comprise up to eight data fields. OPI will be provided by carriers on selected routes only. This will be a data record corresponding to their passenger reservation information. Carriers will only be required to provide this to the extent that it is known, the number of data fields in these records will therefore vary and none are mandatory.</p>

	<p pid="b.178W.8/1">Much of the Home Office's work to tackle racially-aggravated and other hate crimes is at national level as the first step.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.8/2">For instance, the Home Office is currently developing a Cross-Government Action Plan on Hate Crime in conjunction with other Departments and criminal justice agencies. This aims to support Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs), such as Coventry's Community Safety Partnership, to tackle racially-aggravated crime and learn from good practice in other localities. Local areas need to be able to tailor their response to their particular situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.8/3">Coventry's Community Safety Partnership continues to prioritise the importance of anti-racist training which has been delivered not only to staff working in the community but also to police officers, neighbourhood wardens, social landlords and community activists. Hate crime in Coventry has been reduced by 9.1 per cent. in the 12 months of 2008-09 against the previous 12 months of 2007-08.</p>

Sources of funding for SARCs include police forces and primary care trusts, police authorities, hospitals, local authorities, local crime and disorder reduction partnerships and community safety partnerships, local criminal justice boards and donations from businesses and private benefactors. National service guidelines on developing SARCs have been produced jointly by the Home Office and Department of Health which strongly encourage those who commission health and police services to invest in SARCs in line with local assessments of need.</p>

	<p pid="b.182W.5/1">The Home Office provides core funding of &pound;75,000 each to the two umbrella organisations representing victims of sexual violence: (i) Rape Crisis England and Wales; and (ii) The Survivors Trust. That funding has continued in 2009-10. In addition, the Home Office has contributed to the cross-Government Special Fund of &pound;1.6 million for specialist sexual violence voluntary sector organisations which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-19">19 March</phrase> by the Minister for Women and Equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/2">The Special Fund and other central Government funds are provided in addition to local funding which may be provided, for example, from local authorities, health bodies and charitable trusts. Local decision makers are best placed to assess local needs, and Government expect the majority of funding to the sexual violence voluntary sector to come from local sources. The Government recognise the ongoing funding problems experienced by the sexual violence voluntary sector, particularly in respect of accessing local funding. We are working with our delivery partners to consider what more can be done to assist organisations to access local funding. This follows on from the recommendations made by the Home Office's Stakeholder Advisory Group on Sexual Violence and Abuse Funding Sub-group.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/3">In addition the Government Equalities Office has commissioned a research project to help improve our understanding of the stability and sustainability of the violence against women voluntary sector, including sexual violence services. We aim to develop a long-term funding strategy for the sector later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.183W.2/1">The criteria which apply to a decision to deport in these circumstances are first, that the person's deportation from the United Kingdom would be conducive to the public good, and second, that the person's removal to the intended destination would be consistent with the United Kingdom's international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.2/2">The policy for charging terrorist suspects from overseas is the same as for all suspects and is set out in the Crown Prosecution Service's Code for Crown prosecutors. In all cases, there are two tests: whether there is sufficient evidence; and whether a prosecution is in the public interest. Whether it would be in the public interest to prosecute such cases will depend on the particular facts of each case.</p>

	<p pid="b.185W.8/3">For example, the Home Office has funded 28 Sexual Assault Referral Centres to provide support to victims of sexual violence and are supporting the national rollout of independent domestic violence advisers, and independent sexual violence advisers, ensuring that this support is available to all victims of these crimes.</p>

However, the Government recognise the ongoing problems experienced by the sexual violence sector in respect of accessing local funding.

This broad definition is in line with that in article 9 of the European convention on human rights, which also stipulates that a religion must have a clear structure and belief system.

For those where legislation is required, the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, which is currently before Parliament, contains the major provisions, including a number added since introduction.

	<p pid="b.192W.3/1">The framework document for the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) provides that for project-based programmes, prior Community and Local Government (CLG) approval is required for any projects which involve proposed public expenditure of &pound;10 million or over, expenditure that is potentially novel, contentious or repercussive, or an endowment (to support the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of amenity lands). It also provides for CLG approval for any project under the Community Infrastructure Fund, for all PFI projects, and for all novel or major joint venture projects. My Department has given no approvals to the HCA since its inception on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase> under the above categories that involved expenditure in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/2">The predecessor bodies for the Homes and Communities Agency were English Partnerships, the investment arm of the Housing Corporation, and the Academy for Sustainable Communities. A range of departmental programmes also transferred to the Agency from Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/3">Prior to the inception of the HCA, the investment arm of the Housing Corporation was required to seek departmental approval on an annual basis on the investment appraisal criteria to be used for assessing bids on its national affordable housing programme and related sub-programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/4">The financial memorandum for English Partnerships (EP) required that CLG approval was given for spending in excess of &pound;10 million, all endowments, and spending which involved the acquisition of a greenfield site. The following table shows the number of approvals made in each of these categories in each year over the last five years. In addition EP sought CLG approval to enter into an interest in a number of bodies in recent years, many of which would have led to expenditure for revenue support of the body; all such subsidiary undertakings are listed in EP's annual report and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.3/5">Finally, the Department has not approved any formal requests on the basis that the proposals were novel, contentious or repercussive in the last five years for programmes and projects relating to English Partnerships, the Housing Corporation or the Academy for Sustainable Communities. In practice, these bodies would normally discuss any potentially novel, contentious or repercussive expenditure with the Department before submitting a formal request.</p>

FE colleges and providers are independent institutions and are responsible for determining their own curriculum offer in order to respond to the demand locally from learners and employers. The curriculum offered by colleges will therefore change to respond to this demand rather than being a set offer that learners and employers apply for. Funding for these courses will also reflect demand and reward those colleges and providers that are most effective at meeting local demand. This will include moving funding from under performing colleges and providers in order to support those over performing.</p>

	<p pid="b.213W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/2">Independent specialist providers of post-16 education and training play an important role in providing education for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities, often with very specific needs and requirements. We recognise the value of having a diverse mix of high quality providers that ensures that our young people are able to access the right course or provision to help them realise their goals and ambitions. We do not feel it is appropriate to centrally guarantee funding streams for particular institutions. Local authorities will need to work in partnership with each other, providers and young people and their families to assess the level of demand in their area and to commission suitable provision that meets young people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/3">Provision has been made in clause 40 of the ASCL Bill to require local authorities, when commissioning provision, to take account of the quality of provision being secured and encourage diversity in the range of education and training on offer to support learner choice. In addition, in deciding whether education and training is suitable to meet young people's reasonable needs, local authorities will be required to have regard to any learning difficulties the persons may have.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/4">We believe that the transfer to local authorities will have significant benefits in terms of a more informed and integrated commissioning of their services leading to better outcomes for learners. Arrangements are being developed, in consultation with stakeholders, that recognise that independent specialist colleges will often work across local authority boundaries and nationally, and consideration is being given to the need to minimise bureaucracy for these and other learning providers. These arrangements will feed into the statutory guidance being developed for local authorities in respect of their commissioning responsibilities which the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) will publish when it comes into being in April 2010, subject to the passage of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning (ASCL) Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/5">We do not expect the YPLA to be involved in the commissioning of learning provision in the vast majority of cases, although there may be some circumstances where it may need to commission provision directly, for instance:</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/6" class="indent">where a local authority is failing or looks likely to fail in fulfilling its duties under clauses 40 and 47 of the Bill to commission suitable education or training;</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/7" class="indent">with a small number of national providers for whom it may be appropriate to commission at a national rather than local level; and</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/8" class="indent">where the sub regional group (SRG) identifies that they are not yet ready to take on the role.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.9/9">In those cases, the YPLA will need to engage those providers, including specialist colleges, to ensure that they are commissioned effectively in response to the needs of young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.215W.0/1">DIUS recently commissioned research as part of the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (Next Steps) and the Youth Cohort Study. This covers over 11,000 16 and 17-year-olds, many of whom are at school and college, and includes questions about their attitudes towards higher education including views of its costs and benefits, intentions regarding applying for places, and awareness of financial aspects, subject preferences and other aspects of higher education. We expect that the report will be published in late June 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.215W.0/2">Information held on higher education students shows whether they are from socio- economic classes 1-7.</p>
	<p pid="b.215W.0/3">In 2006/07, the proportion of 18 to 20-year-olds from the top three socio-economic classes who participated for the first time in full-time higher education was provisionally 39.5 per cent. The proportion from the bottom four socio-economic classes was provisionally 19.0 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.215W.0/4">These figures cover English-domiciled 18 to 20-year-olds who are studying for the first time at higher education level at UK higher education institutions or English further education colleges, who remain on their courses for at least six months. Further information is available on the DIUS website:</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.3/1">We understand from the Government of Bermuda that trials of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to provide power for homes have produced favourable results. Trials have not begun for commercial buildings; although suitable government buildings have been identified for them. Discussions are under way to allocate land for a small solar PV power station, which will be preceded by a commercial trial.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.3/2">In order to encourage solar power adoption, customs duty has been waived on solar PV systems and the Bermuda government is introducing a rebate programme with a &quot;cash back&quot; scheme for customers who install and operate them, and making the approval process easier and faster.</p>

	<p pid="b.221W.9/3">We are pleased that the two leaders have since intensified their efforts, agreeing to meet more frequently. We welcome the progress already made both in the talks and in confidence building measures. We applaud the recent launch of the bicommunal sub-committee on crime and criminal matters, which will help the fight against organised crime by sharing information. We look forward to early progress on all other confidence building measures agreed between the leaders. The leaders face many challenges but we are confident that, with flexibility and compromise on both sides, they will be able to resolve this long-standing issue, setting an example to the world and reaping the many economic, social and political benefits that a settlement will bring to all Cypriots. It is important that all Cypriots, not just politicians, come together to help create the right environment for a solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.222W.5/1">Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) natural resources have the potential to bring prosperity to the country and help improve the quality of life for people living there through better revenue collection and the creation of wealth and jobs. However, a proportion of those resources are controlled by militias and ill-disciplined members of the DRC armed forces who commit many of the abuses suffered by civilians and who fund themselves, in part, by trading minerals. This is one of a range of factors contributing to the poor standard of human rights in DRC. Better regulatory control over the trade in minerals from DRC and effective measures to discourage transactions which benefit militia groups there, will help improve the human rights situation. We are already working with our partners across Whitehall and internationally to identify ways of achieving this.</p>

The arms embargo and sanctions regime in place in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are a necessary part of the effort to isolate illegal armed groups, limit the support they receive and reduce the threat they pose to civilians in DRC. The work of the Group of Experts is essential to monitor compliance with the terms of the embargo. Individuals and entities who support illegal militias in eastern DRC through illicit trade in natural resources may now be made subject to sanctions. It is appropriate that the UN Group of Experts should devote some of their effort to investigating such cases.</p>

All users are required to sign a statement of responsibility, accepting financial liability for losses incurred through negligence. Losses are reported, recorded and managed locally. The information is not held centrally and to provide it would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

One set of documents was lost in December 2007, within one of Ofsted's regional offices, and has not been found. I very much regret this. Due to the highly sensitive content of serious case reviews, the matter was thoroughly investigated and a more secure document handling process was implemented across the whole of Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="b.236W.3/6" class="indent">There has been no recurrence. However, there have been four incidents when local safeguarding boards have claimed to have sent documents to Ofsted that were not received. Ofsted has a process for recording receipt of post, which is why we know the Derbyshire documents were received in our Midlands regional office and then lost by us. We have no record of documents from these four incidents reaching any of our four offices and in none of these cases could proof of postage be provided. In each case, documents were subsequently provided to Ofsted and evaluated.</p>

	<p pid="b.244W.6/1">By the end of this school year, just over 8,000 children will have received one-to-one tuition in reading through the Every Child a Reader programme since its national implementation in September 2008. This is at a cost to Government of approximately &pound;17 million over the academic year 2008/09. The implementation of the Every Child a Reader programme is proving to be very successful, with children who access the intensive elements of these programmes making four to five times the normal rate of progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.6/2">A report by KPMG's Every Child a Chance Trust, published in January 2009, estimates the cost per child to be &pound;2,609. This figure includes the costs incurred by local authorities as well as the national training and infrastructure co-ordinated through the University of London's Institute of Education.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.6/3">This Government are committed to ensuring every child learns to read. For most, this will mean good systematic phonics through the early years and beginning of primary school. For others, extra provision will be necessary&mdash;primarily through school-based interventions and our Every Child a Reader programme. We continue to fund local authorities and schools to strike the appropriate balance between whole class teaching and catch-up interventions for those children that need it. We remain committed to rolling out this highly effective programme to reach 30,000 children a year by 2010/11.</p>

	<p pid="b.245W.8/1">Over the last 10 years, National Curriculum testing and assessment has played a vital role in ensuring that more than 100,000 more pupils leave primary school secure in English and maths. The Key Stage 2 tests provide a robust and objective measure of pupils' performance, and a recent survey confirmed that they are greatly valued by parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.245W.8/2">We announced last year that 14-year-olds would no longer be required to sit national Key Stage 3 tests, but would be assessed by ongoing teacher assessment throughout the key stage.

The group published its report on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May 2009</phrase>. The group reported that the Key Stage 2 tests are valuable, vital for public accountability and a key part of giving parents objective information on their children's levels of attainment and progress.

A small proportion of pupils have more than one enrolment i.e. if they move school during the year or are registered at more than one school. The analysis is based on the duration of exclusions per enrolment.</p>

The Department is concerned that a small number of schools have not met their legal duties in this regard, and has written to relevant local authorities to remind them of the need to monitor and challenge schools who have acted unlawfully in this respect.</p>

	<p pid="b.250W.3/1">There are two different sets of guidance on the provision and support to children diagnosed with epilepsy available to schools. &quot;Managing Medicines in schools and early years settings&quot; was produced in 2005 by the then Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and Department of Health. This guidance explains what epilepsy is and provides schools with medical support and advice on what to do should a child experience a seizure.</p>
	<p pid="b.250W.3/2">&quot;Including Me&quot; was produced in the same year in conjunction with key stakeholders to accompany &quot;Managing Medicines&quot;. This was published to help schools, early years settings and health providers to develop policies and procedures to ensure that children with complex health needs can access education and childcare. This includes an example of a child experiencing severe episodes of epilepsy having a need identified for a trained learning support assistant at school.</p>
	<p pid="b.250W.3/3">We do not collect data centrally on how many schools actively use both sets of guidance.</p>

This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br/> 2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DCSF (formerly DFES). 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables.<br/> 3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &pound;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &pound;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br/> 4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DCSF School Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br/> 5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place during the mid to late 1990's and those LAs that did not exist either pre or post LGR are shaded out for those years.<br/> 6. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br/> 7. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br/> 8. School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br/> 9. Figures are as reported by local authorities as at 12 May 2009 and are rounded to the nearest &pound;10. 2007-08 data are subject to change by the local authority.<br/> 10.

	<p pid="b.259W.2/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has begun a transformation programme, with the creation within its existing powers of interim Ofqual in April 2008; the restructuring of the rest of the QCA as it evolves into the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA); and relocation of QCA to Coventry by early 2010 in line with commitments following Sir Michael Lyons' Independent Review of Public Sector Relocation. Approximately &pound;3 million was spent in 2008-09 on establishing interim Ofqual and relocating it to Coventry by June 2009. These costs include the costs of recruitment, relocation, restructuring, additional staff reflecting the new approach to regulation, and communications. Over the same period, QCA spent &pound;150,000 on restructuring and communications as it evolves into the QCDA.</p>

Where any authorised community users would be displaced if the application were to be approved, we expect the application to include a full account of the effect on those users, particularly whether their activities can realistically be moved to an alternative site on terms which do not adversely affect the users. They must also be fully consulted about any proposal to dispose of the school playing fields.</p>

	<p pid="b.288W.5/1">Independent Specialist providers of post-16 education and training play an important role in providing education for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities, often with very specific needs and requirements. We recognise the value of having a diverse mix of high quality providers that ensures that our young people are able to access the right course or provision to help them realise their goals and ambitions. We do not feel it is appropriate to centrally guarantee funding streams for particular institutions. Local authorities will need to work in partnership with each other, providers and young people and their families to assess the level of demand in their area and to commission suitable provision that meets young people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/2">Provision has been made in clause 40 of the ASCL Bill to require local authorities, when commissioning provision, to take account of the quality of provision being secured and encourage diversity in the range of education and training on offer to support learner choice. In addition, in deciding whether education and training is suitable to meet young people's reasonable needs, local authorities will be required to have regard to any learning difficulties the persons may have.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/3">We believe that the transfer to local authorities will have significant benefits in terms of a more informed and integrated commissioning of their services leading to better outcomes for learners. Arrangements are being developed, in consultation with stakeholders, that recognise that independent specialist colleges will often work across local authority boundaries and nationally, and consideration is being given to the need to minimise bureaucracy for these and other learning providers. These arrangements will feed into the statutory guidance being developed for local authorities in respect of their commissioning responsibilities which the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) will publish when it comes into being in April 2010, subject to the passage of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning (ASCL) Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/4">We do not expect the YPLA to be involved in the commissioning of learning provision in the vast majority of cases, although there may be some circumstances where it may need to commission provision directly, for instance:</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/5" class="indent">where a local authority is failing or looks likely to fail in fulfilling its duties under clauses 40 and 47 of the Bill to commission suitable education or training;</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/6" class="indent">with a small number of national providers for whom it may be appropriate to commission at a national rather than local level; and</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/7" class="indent">where the sub regional group (SRG) identifies that they are not yet ready to take on the role.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/8">In those cases, the YPLA will need to engage those providers, including specialist colleges, to ensure that they are commissioned effectively in response to the needs of young people.</p>
