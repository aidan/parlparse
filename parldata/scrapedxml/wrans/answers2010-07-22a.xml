	<p pid="a.468W.8/1">HMCS systems do not currently identify how many fines imposed within a year are paid within the same period, this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost as it would require a manual search of all fine accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.8/2">However HMCS's systems can identify the amounts imposed within the last three years for all HMCS regions and Local Criminal Justice Board areas. These data together with the total amount outstanding at the end of each year are set out in the following table. The outstanding balance has risen through the application of a strict policy that only allows fines to be written off in certain circumstances. The outstanding balance includes fines imposed a number of years ago during the period when fines could not be cancelled (2004-06) and fines which are being paid by instalments.</p>

	<p pid="a.473W.2/1">Around a quarter of all radio listening is now to digital, so a future transition to digital radio continues to gain impetus. However, we believe that FM analogue broadcasting will continue for the foreseeable future and for at least as long as it is needed as a platform for local radio.</p>
	<p pid="a.473W.2/2">It would not be in anyone's interest to force stations on to DAB or to 'switch off' FM at a time when it would leave local and community stations without an appropriate broadcast platform. Radio broadcasting on FM will therefore continue for as long as it is needed and viable.</p>

	<p pid="a.480W.5/1">The Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) provides the legal framework within which the reserves are formed and called out. It also provides a number of safeguards for the reservist and his/her employer. Under RFA 96, employers, no matter what size the business is, may claim financial assistance in accordance with SI 859 because a member of their staff has been mobilised. Examples of assistance might be agency and advertising costs, and/or the costs of re-training the reservist on his/her return to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.480W.5/2">When a reservist undertakes training, businesses do not receive financial support. Any leave required by a reservist to attend training should be an agreement made between the employee and their employers. Employers are not obligated to give a reservist additional leave for training, either paid or unpaid. However, many employers choose to do so, because they realise that such training gives them valuable skills that can be transferred directly to the work place. Recent research for the Ministry of Defence and endorsed by the Chartered Management Institute, has calculated that the work experience value to employers gained by reservists deployed on operations is &#163;18,432.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has previously published information about the extremely limited use of depleted uranium (DU) munitions by UK forces during the 1991 Gulf War: less than one metric tonne of DU was expended in these munitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.0/2">Approximately 1.9 metric tonnes of DU ammunition was expended in the 2003 Iraq War by UK forces. The MOD provided the coordinates of targets attacked using DU ammunition in 2003 to the United Nations (UN) Environmental Programme. The MOD also shared with the UN and the Government of Iraq the results of a scientific assessment carried out in June 2003 that indicated very low levels of DU even in the vicinity of vehicles struck by DU munitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.0/3">Responsibility for clean-up after an armed conflict falls to the country's civilian administration with assistance from the international community. The World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency state that the risks of DU can be controlled with simple countermeasures conducted by national authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.0/4">In Iraq, UK forces carried out ordnance disposal activities and removed surface-lying DU fragments as they were discovered. They also exchanged information with humanitarian and other organizations, and warned Iraqis through signs and leaflets that they should not go near or touch any debris they find on the former battlefield. The UK has also provided UN and Iraqi scientists with the results of our DU contamination monitoring in Iraq and offered to provide advice on carrying out risk assessments and on long-term monitoring of DU in the environment, including water.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.0/5">The MOD has made it clear that we take seriously concerns about the effects of the use of DU munitions. However, the scientific literature and UN report of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-24">24 July 2008</phrase> indicate that DU has not been shown to have, and indeed is very unlikely to have, any significant impact on the local population or on veterans.</p>
	<p pid="a.483W.0/6">Other nations' choices to share or not to share information are a matter for them alone.</p>

In subjecting cyber security to the review process the full range of cyber capabilities have been considered, including (but not limited to) defensive and offensive capability.

	<p pid="a.484W.5/2">Both the value for money review of the Trident programme and the re-examination of the UK's declaratory nuclear policy will be conducted within the framework of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). The current policy of maintaining the UK's essential minimum deterrent remains unchanged. The Trident Value For Money Review is looking at whether this policy can be met while reducing the cost of the successor submarine and ballistic missile systems, including by shifting the balance between financial savings and operational risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/3">The value for money review work will cover: the programme timetable; submarine numbers; numbers of missiles, missile tubes and warheads; infrastructure and other support costs; and the industrial supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/4">The Ministry of Defence's work on the value for money review should be completed at the end of this month. The findings will go to the Cabinet Office, and will then be considered by the National Security Council. The Council's conclusions will inform the SDSR and the comprehensive spending review, which will be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.5/5">There are no plans for independent organisations to be consulted.</p>

	<p pid="a.495W.6/1">Peat soils provide a wide range of 'ecosystem services' or functions for society, including carbon storage. UK peat soils are estimated to store around 5.5 billion tonnes of carbon, equivalent to 31 times the UK's total annual greenhouse gas emissions if it were all lost to the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.6/2">Peat soils also support valuable wildlife and biodiversity and a range of peatland habitats in both upland areas (for example, blanket bogs and moorland) and lowlands (for example, raised bogs and fens). The importance of peatland habitats is recognised by the designation of 68% of English upland blanket bogs as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), and 85% of lowland raised bogs.</p>
	<p pid="a.495W.6/3">Formed over hundreds and thousands of years in cold and wet conditions, peat soils are of special interest for archaeology. The preservation of organic materials (e.g. wood, skin, leather, hair, textiles and plant remains) in peat has led to a better and more detailed understanding of the past, including valuable information about past environmental and climatic change. English Heritage surveys of the main wetlands in England show that there are 4,200 archaeological sites in lowland peatlands alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.496W.2/1">Degraded peatlands emit carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere as their store of carbon is oxidised. The primary objective of most restoration activities is to protect the underlying peat (for example, by re-wetting or re-vegetating) and to halt the emissions associated with degradation.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/2">Restoration to an active peat-forming bog is more challenging and can take many decades, if not centuries. As such, accumulation of new carbon in restored and active peat bogs (in other words, the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) is a slow process, and peat is, therefore, viewed as an essentially non-renewable resource. However, active bogs do accumulate carbon (by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) at a rate of 0.2 to 0.7 tonnes per hectare per year, under UK conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/3">A DEFRA study in 2009 concluded that the restoration of degraded peatlands is generally beneficial from an overall global warming point of view as it protects the carbon store from further degradation. However, it is recognised that active peat bogs are also, naturally, a source of methane emissions, and any post-restoration savings in emissions of carbon dioxide need to be carefully balanced against the potential for increased emissions of methane. DEFRA has recently commissioned further research to develop best practices for restoration, focusing on techniques to minimise methane emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/4">The domestic extraction of peat for horticultural use in the UK, predominantly from lowland raised bogs, is estimated to result in emissions of at least 400,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year (not including the emissions associated with peat imports). If extraction from these sites halted and they were restored to sphagnum-forming bogs, these emissions would be halted-although, as above, restoration to an active bog can take many decades, or even centuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/5">Lowland raised bogs are an important store of carbon, with underlying deposits of up to 10 metres deep, and raised bogs in England alone are estimated to store over 57 million tonnes of carbon. This is equivalent to a third of the UK's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, if it were all lost to the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.496W.2/6">The Biodiversity Action Plan contained four specific targets for lowland raised bogs. Progress against each was assessed in 2008 by the UK Biodiversity Partnership and this assessment can be found on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.503W.3/1">In general terms, local authorities can recover input value added tax, so their costs will not rise when the VAT rate rises. Since maintained schools count as part of the local authority when spending local authority funds (section 49(5) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998), they can recover VAT through their maintaining authority. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but we estimate that the increase in the rate of VAT will not cause any significant pressure on schools' budgets.</p>

A further 69 children's services have expressed an interest in doing so later this year. The Department of Health is taking a similar approach in adult services and we will build on this work to develop a consistent offer for the whole profession from 2011.</p>

Schools with little or no gender gap tend to have a positive learning ethos, high expectations of all pupils, high quality teaching and classroom management and close tracking of individual pupils' achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.505W.6/3">We also know that more women are now completing further education than men. In 2008-09 57% of first degree graduates from courses at UK higher education institutions were female.</p>

	<p pid="a.505W.6/5">We have pledged to tackle this by promoting equal pay and we will take a range of measures to end discrimination and disadvantage in the work place. The role of women as primary carers in many families contributes to the pay gap so we will be introducing measures to help people balance their work and home responsibilities. These include extending the right to request flexible working for all and promoting a system of flexible parental leave. We are also looking at how to promote gender equality on the boards of listed companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.506W.8/1">Sir Roy McNulty's review of value for money on the railway has produced a scoping study, which identifies that the UK's railway is prima facie up to 40% more expensive than elsewhere in Europe. We must adjust to a world in which our aspirations for a successful railway have to be met from within a much tighter public spending envelope. Therefore, I have asked Sir Roy to accelerate his work, looking at the drivers of cost across the industry and to produce recommendations to create a sustainable railway with growing passenger usage and declining subsidy.</p>

	<p pid="a.512W.5/2">The Department for Transport has carried out a high-level analysis of the costs of further electrification in Wales, based on the length of the tracks and typical costs per mile of other recent electrification work. But a detailed estimate of cost based on the features specific to these routes, such as the number of structures needing modification and power supply requirements has not been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.5/3">The Government support rail electrification as it helps to reduce carbon emissions and cut running costs. However, we are in the early stages of the new Government and Ministers are considering the full range of transport policy to ascertain what is affordable.</p>

	<p pid="a.517W.6/1">The movement of beer in duty suspension between EU member states is governed by EU Council Directive 2008/118/EC. This states that movements within the UK and EU must take place between approved businesses and must be accompanied by an administrative accompanying document or commercial equivalent document at all times. Once the goods have been received at their destination, the consignee must discharge the movement by returning a report of receipt to the consignor.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.6/2">This system is in place to monitor and maintain the integrity of the duty suspension system. The UK applies various techniques to ensure that those approved to deal in duty-suspended excise goods comply with their legal obligations. For example, officers of HMRC will select specific consignments for verification and test with officials in the member state of destination whether or not those goods actually arrived in that member state.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.6/3">Over the past eight years the UK has worked with counterpart revenue authorities on the development of the EU-wide Excise Movement and Control System. This provides an electronic system to replace the existing paper-based system and allows for monitoring the movement of excise goods in duty suspension within the EU. The system will be implemented in the UK and all member states by <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.520W.6/1">Departments are legally obliged in carrying out their functions to have regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination and promote equality of opportunity. This is currently required in relation to gender, race and disability by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The duty will extend to all forms of prohibited discriminatory conduct when the Equality Act 2010 comes into force. Departments must in their published equality schemes state how they intend to fulfil their duties and how they propose to assess the impact of policies on equality in the relevant areas. Whether or not a full equality impact assessment will be carried out in any case depends on the likely impact of a proposed policy on members of the relevant groups of people and whether it would be proportionate to do so. Such equality impact assessments as are considered to be appropriate and proportionate will be conducted for prospective areas for savings in the Department's budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.6/2">Analysis of the overall Budget impact is undertaken at a household level, as benefits and tax credits are awarded based on family income. How households allocate their resources varies significantly and interactions between the tax and benefit system are complex. For this reason any gender analysis on a single set of assumptions will not be robust.</p>

	<p pid="a.525W.4/3">ASBOs can be of a fixed duration (for a minimum of two years) or made until further order. It is therefore not possible to determine from centrally collected data how many ASBOs are in force at a particular point in time except by reference to individual court files which could be achieved only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The recent commemorations of the fifteenth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre passed off without serious incident. However in an incident on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-27">27 June 2010</phrase>, a police officer was killed and another injured in a bomb attack on a police station in Bugojno (central BiH). The BiH Government-along with the Peace Implementation Council and the EU-publicly condemned the attack in the strongest terms and urged the relevant authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice. More broadly the Government have serious concerns about the political dynamics and continued nationalist tensions in BiH. In this context the presence of the EU military mission continues to play a crucial role underpinning stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.0/1">Digital social media channels, such as Flickr, Twitter and Youtube, are run by the proprietors of those websites. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is not charged for the use of these sites which results in a cost-saving to the department as we are able to utilise their free hosting services for otherwise expensive media storage.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.0/2">The FCO expects staff in all functions and grades to use a range of digital media-including the social web-to publish, carry out research and engage with peers, partners and the public. Our centralised digital team can advise staff on use of the social web but no one member of staff is allocated to manage Flickr, Twitter or Youtube and responsibility for social media channel management is devolved across the FCO. As a result, information on the specific numbers of staff and their costs could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.9/1">We do not have plans to undertake research into replacing benefits with exchangeable vouchers for DWP customer groups. However, the Government are determined to reform the welfare system to support employment and earnings and to tackle welfare dependency. A reformed system will make it easier to ensure that drug and alcohol users receive the help and support they need to overcome their dependency and get back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.9/2">Drug and alcohol addiction is one of the most damaging root causes of poverty, and helping people who are trapped on benefits through drug and alcohol addiction so that they can recover and find employment is a top priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.9/3">DWP has recently published research examining the issues surrounding benefit uptake in England by individuals who use illicit drugs, in particular heroin and crack cocaine, 'Problem Drug Users Experiences of Employment and the Benefit System' Department for Work and Pensions, Research Report No. 640, June 2010:</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.9/4" class="indent"><a href="http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/report_abstracts/rr_abstracts/rra_640.asp">http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/report_abstracts/rr_abstracts/rra_640.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.559W.9/5">The study explores the wider context of education, training and employment for drug users as well as the role of treatment. The report found that drug users face a number of barriers to employment which can include a lack of self-confidence, mental and physical health problems, a criminal record, lack of skills and qualifications and employer discrimination. In addition, financial problems can lead to homelessness and an increase in levels of crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.560W.2/1">Winter fuel payments are targeted at older people because they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather. They provide assurance to older people that they can keep warm during the colder winter months because they know they will receive significant help with their bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.2/2">The structure of the scheme, which provides for an annual lump sum payment, is not necessarily appropriate for the needs of people with cancer, whose extra heating needs can arise at any time of year, not just in the winter months.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.2/3">The Government do appreciate that some people with cancer can face extra costs as a result of their condition and treatment, including heating costs, and believe that disability benefits and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits are the most appropriate way of providing this extra help.</p>
	<p pid="a.560W.2/4">With regard to carers, older carers can qualify for winter fuel payments in the same way as any other older person who has reached women's state pension age. Where carers who have not yet reached this age look after a disabled person, any extra costs of impairment for the disabled person, including higher heating costs, are also provided for through disability benefits and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits. Of course, if the disabled person is above women's state pension age, provision is provided through winter fuel payments as well.</p>

However, there may be a range of adjustments that an employer could put in place to avoid a hearing-impaired employee or job applicant being placed at a substantial disadvantage in the workplace. Whether or not the use of a loop system is appropriate or reasonable will depend upon the circumstances of the individual case. Consequently, we do not consider it appropriate to be prescriptive about the use of loop systems.</p>

Experimental statistics-which are in a testing or consultation phase and are not fully developed-should be treated with caution. Life expectancies for wards can be based on very small numbers of deaths and small populations. They may therefore be subject to large variations even when aggregated over five years, as shown by the width of the '95% confidence interval' in the tables.

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.  <sup>(2)</sup> Five year averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and experimental ward population estimates based on the 2001 Census. The ward names and boundaries used are 2001 Census Standard Table wards.  <sup>(3 )</sup>Confidence intervals (CIs) are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.  <sup>(4 )</sup>The presence of medical and care communal establishments, such as nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to 5: '0' means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments; '1' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards . '5' means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the highest fifth of all wards.</td> </tr>

This applies to food produced in other member states, which once placed on the market, is in &quot;free circulation&quot; or, food that is directly imported into the United Kingdom from Third countries, ie countries outside the European Union. Official controls are in place to monitor food that is imported from third countries to ensure it meets EU requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.574W.12/2">Products of animal origin, such as meat, must come from approved establishments, in approved third countries and enter the UK through designated border inspection posts, under the control of veterinary inspectors. Such food will then undergo documentary checks, identity checks and a prescribed proportion will be subject to physical checks, which could include testing for contaminants. Food not of animal origin is also subject to checks by authorised officers and, depending on its source and whether it is regarded as high risk, may undergo stringent checks to ensure it is safe for human consumption.</p>

Specific procurement programmes deliver framework agreements for the NHS to call off requirements targeted at generic, branded and specialised medicines.

The vast majority of FBOs paid throughput charges. Those FBOs that paid time charges were not paying for the full cost of the service provided. This was approximately 30% below full cost due to Ministers freezing charge rates in 1999 and capping rates in 2000.</p>

The discount has been calculated such that the 2009-10 charge for an FBO would be the same should their throughput and operating hours remain the same, subject to compliance with the European Union minima requirement. After recalculating the EU minima requirement using the average sterling/euro exchange rate for 2009, the range of discounts received by FBOs is currently 0-100%.</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.6/1">Civil Service Live events are owned and managed by the private company Dods, the publishers of Civil Service World, who bear the financial risks. The overall delegate numbers for Civil Service Live in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were approximately 6,000, 8,000 and 7,700 respectively. Delegate registration is managed centrally by Dods. Departments do not keep a detailed record of every member of staff that attends.</p>
	<p pid="a.586W.6/2">Civil servants do not pay to attend Civil Service Live events. There will have been some travel and subsistence costs for delegates, which are paid for by individual Departments. Civil servants attending the event will have followed the travel and subsistence guidelines set by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.591W.2/3">UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) is the Government Department with responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment into the UK. It is the joint responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. UKTI provides bespoke information and location advice to potential and existing foreign direct investors. This work is delivered through UKTI's global network, in partnership with a range of organisations, including English regional development agencies and devolved administration economic development agencies. Overseas, the UKTI network is based in British embassies, high commissions and Consulates-General, including a UKTI inward investment team at the British embassy in Tel Aviv.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/4">In the financial year 2009-10 UK Trade and Investment provided approximately &#163;16 million, via BIS, specifically for foreign direct investment work by the English regional development agencies. Devolved administrations have separate funding arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/5">This was part of a total of approximately &#163;80 million spent globally by UKTI in the same period on foreign direct investment work.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/6">UKTI assisted a total of 57 foreign direct investment projects from Israel which located or expanded in the UK in the financial years 1997-98 to 2009-10 inclusive (see Table A). Of these, 15 were assisted in collaboration with one or more RDAs or devolved administration economic development agencies.

The Middlesbrough South and Cleveland constituency is covered by the inward investment team at ONE North East.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/9">UKTI assisted a total of three foreign direct investment projects from Israel which located or expanded in the North East of England in the financial years 1997-98 to 2009-10 inclusive (see Table B). All of these were assisted in collaboration with ONE North East. Additionally, ONE North East assisted a further two such projects in which UKTI was not directly involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.2/10">Of this total of five projects, three located or expanded in the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency. All three were assisted by UKTI in collaboration with ONE North East.</p>

	<p pid="a.591W.2/12">UK Trade and Investment does not provide financial assistance to inward investors. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and RDAs do, according to their respective roles and competences. In the period from financial year 2002-03 to 2009-10 inclusive, One North East provided a total of &#163;1,362,600 to such projects in the North East of England, of which &#163;870,000 went to such projects in the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency. In 1998-99 a Regional Selective Assistance payment of &#163;50,000 was made via Government Office in connection with a project in the North East region.

	<p pid="a.598W.6/1">Regional development agencies own a range of assets which were acquired for regeneration purposes. Some of these assets may be sold by agencies as part of their normal programme of disposal over the next year. We will be discussing with RDAs, their partners and other Departments the future ownership of other assets. No final decisions have been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.598W.9/1">Our proposals are for restructuring the delivery landscape for economic development. Replacing the regional development agencies (RDAs) with local enterprise partnerships will ensure that these partnerships better reflect the natural economic geography of the areas that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.598W.9/2">Reorganising the delivery of economic development will ensure a focused targeted delivery of policy/services in areas where it can have the most benefit, and we would not expect that that this transition will have a negative impact on science and innovation or industry in the English regions.</p>
