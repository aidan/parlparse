	<p pid="a.1150W.6/3">2010&#8212;24,213.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150W.6/4">All TB reactors are regarded as infected and European and national legislation require all such animals to be slaughtered. Those cattle are then subject to post mortem examination and a proportion of them will also be sampled for laboratory culture, but this is not to prove or disprove the disease status of the animal. The primary purpose of post mortem and bacteriological culture of TB test reactors is to assess the severity of infection and identify the strain of the causative bacterium&#8212;this is useful for epidemiological investigations and helps to support subsequent outbreak control efforts. TB is a chronic and insidious infectious disease with potentially long incubation periods. In the early stages of this disease it is often not possible to see lesions with the naked eye, and due to the fastidious nature of the TB bacterium (which may be present in low numbers in the affected organs) it is not always possible to culture it from tissue samples. It is therefore wrong to consider all TB reactors that fail to disclose evidence of infection in the slaughterhouse or in the laboratory as being &#8220;false positives&#8221; or &#8220;negative for the disease&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1152W.2/1">Under European legislation, pesticide active substances are first evaluated at Community level. A key part of the process is an assessment of risks to wildlife, including pollinators. If an active substance meets the EU safety requirements, then products authorising that active substance can be authorised at member state level, taking into account that country&#8217;s individual agronomic, climatic and dietary requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/2">In the UK, pesticides can only be sold or used after they have been authorised. As part of this process, the chemicals regulation directorate of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) undertakes an assessment of the toxicity of each product and ways in which spray operators, the public or environment (including pollinators) may be exposed. The purpose being to ensure that the use of the product poses no unacceptable risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.2/3">The assessment for neonicotinoid pesticides has concluded that provided they are used in accordance with their approved conditions of use, there is no unacceptable risk to pollinators, including butterfly and other non-target arthropod populations.</p>

We continue to monitor research and developments in other EU member states and elsewhere to see if they are relevant to the UK and participate in initiatives such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working group on pesticides-supported project on the pesticide effects on insect pollinators.</p>

	<p pid="a.1152W.5/1">It is difficult to differentiate between butterfly conservation in urban and rural areas as there is significant overlap and inter-play between them. However, in general, rural areas contain a greater number of specialist species and urban areas more generalist species.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.5/2">Specialist species tend to be highly reliant on protection through existing designated sites. Natural England is currently reviewing all sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) to ensure that the specific management requirements of specialist butterflies (and other species) are included in the conservation objectives of these sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.5/3">Natural England's recent research (&#8220;Managing for species: Integrating the needs of England's priority species into habitat management&#8221;) identified that many species of butterfly can have their conservation needs met by ensuring their requirements are integrated within urban and rural habitat management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.5/4">For butterflies on farmland, the Government are developing tools and protocols to ensure that land that is managed under the Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) agri-environment scheme has the appropriate management options in place to provide the correct habitat niches for butterflies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.5/5">In urban areas, the Government are developing tools for developers and planners to encourage the adoption of management of habitat niches for butterflies and other species in the planning of urban green infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1153W.2/1">The collection and analysis of butterfly data through the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme is a partnership project involving the Natural Environment Research Council's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Butterfly Conservation, DEFRA and the conservation agencies across the UK. DEFRA recently published the final report from the latest phase of funding. The report concludes that while the numbers of most widespread butterfly species are comparatively stable, almost half of the more specialised butterflies (those species associated with more natural habitats) are declining. Despite this, agri-environment schemes are having a positive effect and there are some notable signs of recovery for some of these more specialist species, such as the Marsh Fritillary and the reintroduced Large Blue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153W.2/2">We will continue to build on these successful cases, drawing on their example of successful partnership working with Butterfly Conservation and others in the voluntary sector, to design or deliver targeted conservation action.</p>

	<p pid="a.1153W.5/1">The monitoring of butterfly populations remains an important part of Natural England's work, with its partners, to develop a more integrated monitoring programme across a range of species. Natural England is contributing &#163;15,000 this financial year towards a UK integrated monitoring project for butterflies and a further &#163;40,000 to Butterfly Conservation for data management to support UK biodiversity commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153W.5/2">Natural England will continue to deliver and support butterfly conservation work as it has done in the past, but the emphasis will shift to habitat management as opposed to projects aimed at single species. This approach is supported by Natural England research (Managing for species: Integrating the needs of England's priority species into habitat management), which found that the most efficient and effective way to deliver butterfly conservation was usually by appropriate incorporation into habitat-based work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153W.5/3">Natural England will place increased emphasis on ensuring that Higher Level Stewardship agri-environment agreements with landowners and farmers contain the appropriate management options for butterflies. Natural England will also be working closely with the owners and occupiers of sites of special scientific interest, National Nature Reserves and with existing and new landscape-scale partnerships, to ensure that the conservation needs of species are incorporated into the conservation objectives and habitat management for these areas.</p>

This can be done by preventing the waste arising in the first place, or diverting waste away from landfill into recycling or recovery operations.

The Government's role is not to make the decisions about what are the best waste management options in particular circumstances: that is for local communities, but we provide a range of support to help inform those decisions. To that end, we support WRAP's work in developing markets for compost and recognise the role of the British Standard BSI PAS 100 in giving confidence that the compost produced is safe, reliable and high quality.</p>

This will help reduce uncertainties about the level of risk posed by bio-aerosols and odours at composting sites and ensure regulatory controls are applied proportionately.

	<p pid="a.1169W.2/1">Overfishing is the most widespread and significant human pressure on marine wildlife and habitats. Many fish stocks are overexploited globally, with the FAO reporting in 2010 that 32% of stocks are overexploited, depleted or recovering. A further 53% of stocks are fully exploited, with the rest under or moderately exploited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/2">Within the North East Atlantic (in 2011), 63% of stocks are overexploited, and 37% are at or below their maximum sustainable yield.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/3">It is therefore very important that we lead by example in procuring sustainable fish and I believe that a 100% target is fully achievable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/4">We have estimated that around 60% of fish procured by central Government is demonstrably sustainable. To increase this to 100%, based upon an assumed 5% price premium for sustainably-sourced fish, the cost of implementing and maintaining this criteria is estimated to be:</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/5">Approximately &#163;227,000 per annum where the food procured is taxpayer-funded (prisons, MOD operational and so on);</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/6">Approximately &#163;95,000 per annum where the food procured is customer-funded (central Government Department staff restaurants).</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/7">Two caveats apply here:</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/8">These are undiscounted costs. A discount rate of 3.5% per annum is usually used in the appraisal of Government policy, so as to allow an accurate comparison of costs and benefits which occur in different years;</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/9">The latter figures do not take into account a possible demand response, though this is likely to be relatively small.</p>

The purpose of that amendment was not to seek the enhancement of any of the British Waterways Board's existing powers but to enable the proposed New Waterways Charity to receive the British Waterways Board's existing important statutory and regulatory functions.

Wherever a vessel is identified as being someone's home, British Waterways does not exercise its powers under section 8 without having taken the matter to the County Court and obtained a declaration from the Court that the removal is lawful. These long-held powers operate in the interests of the waterways and their users.

	<p pid="a.1171W.6/1">DEFRA supports elephant protection by funding conservation projects in Africa and Asia directly, via the Darwin Initiative, and through trade controls applied under the Convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES).</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.6/2">The Government have made tackling illegal trafficking in wildlife a priority and this year we are providing &#163;30,000 towards a CITES programme which monitors the illegal killing of elephants (MIKE). We are also providing &#163;35,000 towards the running of the international Union for Conservation of Nature's African Elephant Specialist Group which works closely with African states to protect elephant populations. We will also provide &#163;90,000 to an Interpol project to help African states improve their enforcement capacity and elephant (and rhino) protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.6/3">We are currently funding three Darwin Initiative projects contributing to elephant conservation totalling approximately &#163;495,000 over three years, and another project worth &#163;240,000, that will fund improvements to the ETIS database which monitors all illegal seizures of ivory around the world. In addition, the UK has funded wider international projects that will protect the habitats of forest-dwelling elephants by combating deforestation and illegal logging (for example, in the Congo Basin and South East Asia).</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.6/4">The UK also contributes to the EU budget which in turn provides significant funding to CITES activities on elephant issues. This work includes a meeting in November 2010 that brought together African countries to discuss elephant conservation, and the MIKE programme in Africa (&#8364;10 million over the last five years), as well as several wider projects on forest conservation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1173W.8/1">Estimates of the numbers of primates kept by private ownership in England vary considerably. The working group that drafted the Code of Practice on the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-Human Primates estimated the number to be between 900 and 1,600, and used the mid-range figure of 1,200 in calculations (held by an estimated 300 private owners, i.e. not zoos or rescue centres).</p>
	<p pid="a.1173W.8/2">During consultation on the code, several respondents provided alternative higher estimates based on some Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 licences issued and sales figures of primates. From the consultation's summary, most respondents estimated that there were between 1,500 and 7,500. We acknowledge that numbers of primates in private hands is difficult to estimate, but we have used the figure of 1,200 to 5,000 to demonstrate the sort of costs owners might be expected to meet, as a result of the code.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175W.5/1">As announced in the Natural Environment White Paper the Government intends to take steps to tackle the legacy of unsustainable abstraction more efficiently. Further details will be included in the Water White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/2">The chalk streams in Hertfordshire suffer from low flows as a result of over abstraction. These are located on the Rivers Stort, Ash, Rib, Beane and Mimram. Through the Environment Agency's (EA) Restoring Sustainable Abstraction programme it is seeking to improve flows in these rivers and working with Veolia Water Central and a number of experts to establish how much water we need in these rivers to support good ecological status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/3">The EA is also undertaking habitat restoration where it has identified opportunities for improvement. For example, the removal of barriers to fish migration is a key element of delivering the Water Framework Directive and the EA has identified a programme of improvements over the next three years on the Rivers Beane and Rib.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/4">To help protect and improve chalk stream habitats the EA works closely with other organisations, including the Hertfordshire and Middlesex Wildlife Trust, which has a chalk stream project officer in place to deliver improvements within the catchments.</p>

The Department places a strong emphasis on meeting user needs within GMES and runs a number of &#8216;Network Groups&#8217; to support the programme within the domains of Land, Marine, Atmosphere, Climate Change and Emergency' Response. These cross-community groups provide the Department with a platform for active consideration of the effectiveness and the potential of earth observation satellite technology in each associated policy area, both in the context of GMES and earth observation more widely. This is supplemented by a specialist forum which is co-chaired by JNCC and DEFRA.</p>

The Department for Education's Green Paper &quot;Support and aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March</phrase>, sets out the Government's aspiration to move towards a single assessment process for a child's social care, health and special educational needs. The Department for Education plan to test the approach starting this year and we will look at the findings of the pathfinders to explore whether the single assessment process might also be used to support claims for disability living allowance and personal independence payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1187W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) spent some &#163;190 million on travel and subsistence between May 2010 and May 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1187W.8/2">This figure includes, for both service and civilian staff, the cost of travel and accommodation booked centrally, the reimbursement of expenses incurred when using their own vehicle for duty journeys, most rail fares not booked centrally and some car hire costs. The figures also include expenses reimbursed to civilian staff for overnight accommodation, subsistence, taxi, bus and underground fares, parking charges and road tolls, and most of their air fares not booked centrally. Costs of the MOD&#8217;s White Fleet are not included as they are not recorded on a monthly basis; however, we estimate that White Fleet contract and fuel costs averaged around &#163;4.5 million a month. The figures also do not include all travel and subsistence costs reimbursed to service personnel, but we are currently improving the accessibility of these in the interests of transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1187W.8/3">By whatever means staff travel, they must do so in a way that is the most economical in both money and official time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1187W.8/4">I apologise for the delay in providing this information.</p>

	<p pid="a.1188W.3/2">UOR equipment is routinely reviewed after 12 months of initial deployment or at the end of the operation for which it was procured, whichever is sooner. If it is judged to have future utility to Defence, it may be taken into the core programme. Where a capability is judged to be effective for the operation but has no future utility to Defence, it is supported for the length of the operation. If a capability is no longer required it is either run into obsolescence while it retains limited utility, or is disposed of. We are currently assessing which UOR equipment capabilities have enduring utility.</p>

	<p pid="a.1195W.0/1">We have proposed that future oversight of prices within the national health service would be undertaken by Monitor and the NHS Commissioning Board, as set out in the Health and Social Care Bill (Part 3, Chapter 5). Under the proposed legislation, it would be for the NHS Commissioning Board to agree with Monitor whether and to what extent prices for physiotherapy services were to be determined by the national tariff, or set locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.0/2">Monitor would lead on developing the methodology for determining prices under the national tariff and agree this with the NHS Commissioning Board. We would expect Monitor to ensure consistency in the methodology for determining prices across different geographical areas, having regard to any unavoidable differences in the cost of providing services in different geographical areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.0/3">In carrying out its functions, Monitor would have to have regard to the need for commissioners to secure access to health care services, to meet the needs of their populations, and to make best use of NHS resources in doing so. In this way, commissioners will remain responsible for securing services and making best use of NHS resources to meet the health care needs of their populations, including in securing access to physiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195W.0/4">We tabled amendments during Public Bill Committee to make clear that the national tariff would be a fixed price, rather than a maximum price, so as to enable competition on quality, not on price, driven by patients' choices. For services outside the scope of the national tariff, we would expect commissioners to set prices on value for money criteria, as per guidance set out in the &#8216;Procurement guide for commissioners of NHS-funded services&#8217;, published in July 2010:</p>

The Department is supportive of the principles of The Prostate Cancer Charity's &#8220;Testing Choices&#8221; campaign, and continues to work with the charity through PCAG, of which Owen Sharp, the chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity, is a member.</p>

NCAT has now commenced a targeted awareness campaign, with 10,000 copies of the supplement being distributed across London, the West Midlands, the East Midlands, Bradford and Manchester.

The pilot, which also aims to increase awareness of prostate cancer among the local population, is being evaluated to find out whether providing such a service in a community setting can make a difference to the numbers of men accessing this type of service rather than more traditional services. The clinic also offers men a series of prostate related tests, if required, with most test results provided immediately.</p>

	<p pid="a.1203W.3/1">Lord Marland met a variety of British businesses during a dinner on his arrival on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-29">29 May 2011</phrase>. The next day he attended the International Energy Forum where he met Noe Van Hulst, Secretary General. Later he met Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, Governor of Riyadh, Dr Waleed Abulfaraj, VP, King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE) and Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Assistant Minister for Petroleum Affairs. Finally, he visited King Saud University and met the President, Dr Abdullah al Othman.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.3/2">The purpose of the meetings was to strengthen the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia on energy, commercial and other bilateral issues. This included reinforcing the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Gulf Initiative, discussing oil and gas issues and exploring opportunities for the British and Saudi governments to support the private sector in driving sustainable and mutually beneficial growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1203W.3/3">The outcome of the meetings was a strengthened producer-consumer dialogue on wide range of energy issues, including oil and gas market evolution and nuclear projects. He opened talks on potential major commercial deals, and reported back to Government on new commercial opportunities. He was also able to inform major Gulf investors about key UK inward investment opportunities which have laid essential groundwork for his future follow-up visit with a trade and investment delegation in his capacity as chairman of the ambassadors' network.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/2">The 2010-11 health care budget at Her Majesty&#8217;s Prison Young Offenders Institute Lancaster Farms (HMP YOI Lancaster Farms) was reduced by &#163;562,000. This represents a 29% reduction in the health care budget issued to HMP YOI Lancaster Farms and directly correlates to the removal of 130 places for people under the age of 18 by the Youth Justice Board (YJB).</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/3">The YJB&#8217;s decision to remove 130 places, and the funding adjustment itself, reflect the current absence of young people under 18 being held at HMP YOI Lancaster Farms. The Department and NHS North Lancashire are confident that appropriate services are deliverable within the confines of revised funding.</p>
