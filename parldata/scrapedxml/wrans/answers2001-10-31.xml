	<p pid=".664W.0/1">During the year 2000, no disciplinary action was taken against personnel from any of the three services for testing positive at a Compulsory Drugs Test (CDT). Failure of a CDT will normally lead to the Administrative Discharge of an individual on the basis that drugs are incompatible with service in the armed forces. A positive test by itself is not a criminal or disciplinary offence. Disciplinary action will only be invoked, in relation to CDT, if an individual commits the offence of failing to provide a urine sample for the purpose of testing.</p>

	<p pid=".664W.12/1">The Regular Commission Board (RCB), which is currently based at Westbury in Wiltshire, is part of the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA). Its role is to select potential officers for entry to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS), also part of ATRA.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.12/2">Historically, the RCB was part of the Directorate of Army Recruiting but in 1998 it was placed under the control of RMAS, as there is clearly a synergy between the selection and training of potential officers.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.12/3">We have now decided that RCB should be collocated with RMAS as from February 2003. Collocation of the two parts of what is essentially a single operation will further enhance coherence, achieve economies of scale and could enable ATRA to achieve a degree of estate rationalisation. The role and ethos of RCB will not change.</p>

	<p pid=".671W.17/1">Schedule 7 to the Railways Act 1993 makes provision for a transfer scheme mechanism to be used for the transfer of the undertaking of a protected railway company which is the subject of a railway administration order.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/2">Paragraph 2(2) of schedule 7 provides that a scheme made under that schedule shall not take effect unless (in the case of the undertaking of Railtrack plc) it is approved by the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/3">I will consider carefully all of the terms of any proposed scheme submitted to me by Railtrack plc (acting by its administrators). However, in order to assist potential bidders for the undertaking of Railtrack plc this answer sets out, by way of guidelines, the principal issues upon which I will need to be satisfied before approving a proposed scheme. These guidelines may change from time to time (in which case I will publish the revised guidelines) and they are not intended to be exhaustive and are issued as guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/4" class="italic">Guidelines</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/5">My principal objective, in determining whether or not to approve a proposed transfer scheme, is to ensure that the operation of the network will, after the proposed transfer, be undertaken efficiently, safely and economically.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/6">I also intend to ensure that I am satisfied on the following issues:</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/7">1. <i>Efficiency and Viability</i></p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/8">The technical expertise of the proposed transferee to operate, maintain, renew and enhance the railway network. This will include:</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/9">presenting proposals for focused and effective management (particularly in relation to contract management and planning, and a willingness to facilitate enhancement by special purpose vehicles or alternative structures for financing enhancements and developments which separate enhancement and development risk from operation, maintenance and renewal), and</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/10">demonstrating that employees with appropriate skills will be retained and, where applicable, recruited;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/11">A proper understanding of the projected liabilities of the transferee and the performance risks it faces;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/12">A proper understanding of Railtrack plc's network operating licence and a demonstrable intention and ability to comply with it;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/13">A proper understanding of the Government's strategic plans for the railway industry and a demonstrable commitment to them (including the 10-Year Plan and the SRA's Strategic Agenda);</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/14">A coherent and cost-effective business plan for:</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/15">ascertaining the condition of the network assets and life cycle cost minimisation;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/16">implementing output based contracts for maintenance and renewal;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/17">facilitating the successful implementation of special purpose vehicles (or equivalent arrangements) delivering large scale enhancements and renewals; and</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/18">the maintenance of an assets register, including a description of process and timetable;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/19">Proposals for ascertaining the cost structure of the network business and the control systems to be implemented at both central and regional levels and how successful reporting mechanics are to be achieved;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/20">A cohesive, achievable and cost-effective strategy for dealing with those renewals and small enhancements that are not to be delivered by special purpose vehicles (or equivalents).</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/21">2. Safety</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/22">An ability to run the network safely, with a clearly defined safety policy;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/23">Evidence that the Heath and Safety Executive has confidence in the proposed transferee and that the relevant Safety Case will be in place immediately following the transfer.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/24">3. Key Relationships</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/25">Proposals for creating, at regional level, relationships with railway passenger and freight service operators and other stakeholders;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/26">Evidence of support from employees and their representatives;</p>

	<p pid=".671W.17/28">4. Financial viability and value for money</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/29">A demonstrated ability to finance the activities of the proposed transferee in a cost-effective manner (including its proposed treatment of existing and future, short and long term finance creditors, and a demonstration that it will have a sufficiently high, investment grade, credit rating to raise the necessary finance for its activities);</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/30">A coherent plan for the treatment of existing trade and other creditors;</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/31">A demonstration that its approach would ensure that effective maintenance and renewal takes place at the lowest practical cost.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/32">Proposals for the transfer of liabilities which relate to the operation, maintenance, renewal and development of the parts of the network that are to be transferred.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.17/33">In addition, and to achieve my overall objective, I will have regard to the extent and nature of Government support that will be required to operate the network after the proposed transfer and the value for money that this would represent for Government. I will expect any proposal for a transfer to address very clearly the basis, extent and nature of support that will be required from the Government.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.2/2">The proposals originated from DG Enterprise, who have been engaged in discussions with the vehicle manufacturers' representatives on this issue over the past year.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/3">The work by TRL assessing the benefits of the first phase of the negotiated agreement relative to the benefits of the full EEVC WG17 proposals (which would be delivered in the second phase) has been within a tight timescale, so any figures provided have been on an informal basis. Figures may evolve or be refined before they can be incorporated into an intermediate or final publishable report.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/4" class="italic">Benefits of the first phase of the negotiated agreement relative to EEVC WG17:</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/5">The initial work focused on a critique of the 80 per cent. relative benefit for killed and seriously injured pedestrians claimed by industry. Using what was believed to be similar assumptions, TRL arrived at relative benefits of 60 per cent. for fatals and 70 per cent. for seriously injured. We said, when we recently consulted on the Commission's proposal, that the benefits were being looked at afresh. This new approach uses databases from Europe, Japan and the USA and test and other data. This suggests that the relative benefit is around 25 per cent. for fatals and 60 per cent. for seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/6" class="italic">Absolute benefits:</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/7">The benefit for the full EEVC proposals changes slightly to 10 per cent. fatals and 20 per cent. seriously injured compared with the values of 8 per cent. and 21 per cent. which we have traditionally used.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.2/8">TRL's work on this will be available in an interim report in early 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".679W.5/2">Abandoned cars are an increasing eyesore on our streets and a real danger to children who are attracted to them as playgrounds. Too often they are also a target for local arsonists and also can be useful to criminals as a pool of cars that cannot be traced back to them. Our proposals published today aim to get abandoned cars off the streets, quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".679W.5/3">The measures will give local councils increased powers to deal with these cars and get rid of the bureaucratic boundaries that make it easier for irresponsible people to abandon cars at will. They will also reduce the demands on the police and fire services who have to deal with the vandalism, arson and other crime resulting from, and facilitated by, abandoned cars.</p>

Its core objectives are to support sustainable economic growth and regeneration and to achieve urban and rural renaissance in the region. Development will be focused on the region's main towns and cities making best use of previously-developed land and helping to reduce the need to travel.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.11/3">The new Yorkshire and Humber Assembly, launched on <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase>, will be at the heart of the implementation of the strategy, working with the region's local authorities, Yorkshire Forward and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.11/4">I am pleased that much of the format and content of RPG12, including the vision, objectives and core strategy, carries forward what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the Regional Assembly. RPG12 reflects very effective working between the Assembly, local authorities and other stakeholders who have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft strategy. It builds on the new inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place. Many of the comments received in response to the consultations carried out earlier this year were constructive suggestions and have been taken on board in finalising the guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.11/5">The Yorkshire and Humber Assembly will now take the strategy forward and work with partners to ensure its effective implementation, monitoring and review.</p>

	<p pid=".681W.2/1">The 2002 editions of the Approved Documents which give guidance on ways of meeting the new requirements of Part L1, Conservation of fuel and power in dwellings, Part L2, Conservation of fuel and power in buildings other than dwellings, Part H, Drainage and waste disposal, and Part J, Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems, as introduced by the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001, SI 2001/3335, were published today by The Stationery Office.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/2">The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001, SI 2001/3335 and the Building (Approved Inspectors etc) (Amendment) Regulations 2001, SI 2001/3336 were laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-11">11 October 2001</phrase>. The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001 made changes to the technical requirements with regard to Part L, Conservation of fuel and power, Part H, Drainage and waste disposal, and Part J, Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems in the Building Regulations 2000, SI 2000/2531. Both sets of Regulations also made some consequential administrative changes to both the Building Regulations 2000, SI 2000/2531 and to the Building (Approved Inspectors etc) Regulations 2000, SI 2000/2532. Both sets of Regulations will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/3">Taken together, these new regulations and their supporting Approved Documents introduce a package of measures that will bring a number of environmental, safety and economic benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/4">The review of Part L has been a noteworthy example of the good relations the Government wish to forge with industry and others with interests in our energy policy and the development of proportionate regulations. The performance standards in the new Approved Documents L1 and L2 are significantly higher than those introduced in 1995 and will set most builders and building services engineers something of a challenge. However the close contact with industry has ensured that the new standards can be achieved by adopting reasonable standards of design and construction practice. They will yield substantial benefits for the occupiers of new dwellings and other buildings through lower heating bills (up to 25 per cent. in the case of dwellings), lower air conditioning bills and/or improved comfort and productivity, and for the nation in the avoidance of carbon emissions. It is estimated that these measures will contribute 1.4 MtC in 2010 of the overall 23 per cent. cut in the UK's greenhouse gas emissions that we set out in our Climate Change Programme published last November, and of course those savings will continue to accumulate thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-05">5 March 2001</phrase> I announced the package of amendments that were to be made to Part L following consultation. As industry requested, the material has been split into two Approved Documents, L1 for dwellings and L2 for other buildings. The guidance in the new Approved Documents raises the performance standards for building insulation, introduces new ones for airtightness and solar shading, widens the standards for heating to include boiler performance, widens the lighting standards to include luminaires and display lights, and introduces new ones for air conditioning systems including their controls. To back these physical measures up there are new requirements for testing and commissioning that will help to make designers' intended performance capabilities a reality, and the provision of users' manuals and log books so that occupiers can obtain all of the potential benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/6">To back up the guidance in these Approved Documents we have also published today &quot;Limiting thermal bridging and air leakage: Robust construction details for dwellings and similar buildings&quot;. This document was prepared in collaboration with industry and provides construction details which are a way of showing compliance with the new standards for thermal insulation and airtightness.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/7">Part L now also addresses summer performance as well as insulation against winter cold and heating and hot water systems. There are new building fabric provisions aimed at limiting solar overheating, and new air conditioning and mechanical ventilation measures aiming to ensure that, when specified, they can perform efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/8">These new provisions are not restricted to new buildings. Around half of the carbon benefits mentioned will come from the application of the new requirements for work in existing buildings. For dwellings, we have introduced provisions that apply whenever new windows and glazed doors, boilers and hot water vessels are to be replaced. For buildings other than dwellings the same provisions apply for windows and all the building systems addressed by Part L, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting, are also included. These provisions are qualified however, in that reasonable provision depends on the circumstances in the particular case. Sympathetic treatment of historic buildings is necessary for instance to enable conservation and restoration and new guidance in both the Approved Documents will help to establish what reasonable provision is in these special cases.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/9">The review of Part J has addressed the increasing risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, the ill-health effects of flue-gas entering living space, and the risks of injuries caused by fires, and also to address for the first time the oil pollution threat from domestic central heating oil storage systems.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/10">The outcome of investigations into possible additional risks posed by lower specification concrete flue liners was announced in November 2000. These investigations found no certain evidence of additional risk but made a series of recommendations. The amendments to Part J and the publication of the 2002 edition of Approved Document J complete our response to these. They incorporate a new requirement (J4) to fix permanent notices indicating hearth, fireplace and chimney performance limits, and the Approved Document gives examples of what are satisfactory provisions using the new European Method for specifying performance of all types of flue liners.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/11">A new requirement J5 makes provisions for reasonable steps to be taken to ensure that when external liquid fuel storage (oil and liquefied petroleum gas) systems are provided they are protected from fire in adjacent buildings or premises.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/12">The new requirement J6 makes provision for oil storage tanks and connecting pipework serving buildings used wholly or mainly as private dwellings to be constructed and protected to reduce the level of risk of oil escaping and causing pollution. This new requirement also makes provisions for notices which give information on how to respond to an oil escape to be fixed in a prominent position.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/13">The publication of a consultation on amendments to Part H of the Building Regulations was announced in July 2000. The outcome of that review is reflected in the amendments to Part H of the Building Regulations and in the 2002 edition of the Approved Document.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/14">The new requirement H4 applies when building work takes place over sewers. This has enabled the repeal of Section 18 (building over sewer etc) of the Building Act 1984. Provision of foul drainage is now required by the Regulations, and this has enabled the repeal of Section 21(1) and (2) of the Act. These changes bring necessary requirements all together into the Regulations, and should simplify matters for practitioners.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/15">The new requirement H2 includes the provision of a durable notice giving information on necessary continuing maintenance for septic tanks, wastewater treatment systems and cesspools. Lack of maintenance is one of the main causes of failure of septic tanks and other non-mains drainage systems, and this new requirement seeks to address this. There is also improved guidance on drainage fields from septic tanks.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/16">Guidance in the Approved Document includes guidance on the use of infiltration drainage systems and a presumption that this method of drainage is the preferred option for rainwater disposal rather than storm sewers. This will ease the load on storm sewers and may reduce the risk of flooding due to run off from new development.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/17">Guidance in the Approved Document recommends that drains serving more than 10 properties should have a minimum diameter of 150 mm. This should help to reduce the incidence of private sewers and drains.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/18">Copies of &quot;Limiting thermal bridging and air leakage: Robust construction details for dwellings and similar buildings&quot; have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".681W.2/19">A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations and it too was published today. It has also been placed on the DTLR website at (<a href="http://www.safety.dtlr.gov.uk/bregs/brpub/02.htm">http://www.safety.dtlr.gov.uk/bregs/brpub/02.htm</a>).</p>

The principles for successful partnership working used in the original development of the Regional Economic Strategies are now reflected in the preparation of RDA Action Plans and the revision of their RESs. Under a new fund worth &pound;15 million over three years, the regional chambers have been awarded a total of &pound;5 million in 2000&ndash;01 to enhance their RDA scrutiny role and thus strengthen regional accountability.

	<p pid=".704W.11/2">In October 1997, the then Minister for Industry, Energy and Science proposed that the electricity pool system be reviewed. In the review and the subsequent development of regulations to implement new electricity trading arrangements (NETA), there were a number of consultations undertaken by my Department and Ofgem. During the development and implementation of NETA, numerous representations were received from a range of organisations, in the form of letters, responses to consultation exercises and in meetings. Since NETA went live in March of this year, the DTI and Ofgem have consulted on further refinements to the trading arrangements in light of experience of the new system. This has prompted further representations from interested parties.</p>

Far from being a relaxation of criteria, the guidance makes it clear that schools should satisfy themselves that the educational benefits of the commercial activity outweigh the potential disadvantages; that explicit sales messages should be avoided wherever possible; and that the level of any branding should be appropriate to the activity.

We are aware that boys' performance in the main A-level subjects has not equalled that of girls in recent years. The foundations for improvement need to be laid at earlier stages of schooling. That is why we have put resources into pre-16 initiatives that enhance boys' performance, such as the literacy strategy. We also have a major research project under way to identify successful strategies for raising boys' achievement that can be disseminated more widely.

	<p pid=".712W.2/2">There is a continuing and vital role for special schools within an inclusive education system. Inclusion is not a drive to close special schools. Rather, the Government want all special schools to be outward-looking centres of excellence working hand in hand with each other and with mainstream schools. Special schools can act as a source of expertise, advice and professional development. When mainstream and special schools work together there are benefits for all.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.5/1">The original target for the pilot phase of the Computers within Reach scheme was to supply up to 35,000 refurbished computers by March 2001 for those on certain benefits who were seeking to gain or retain employment. Due to problems associated with the sourcing of equipment and the logistics of delivery, the scheme was extended to <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October 2001</phrase>. This was to enable all individuals on waiting lists who had paid for a computer to receive one. Until figures from suppliers are collated I cannot give a final number for computers delivered through the scheme. However, it is anticipated that around 24,000 computers will have been delivered by the end of the pilot phase.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/2">There is an on-going evaluation of the scheme and the initial findings show it has been successful in targeting the priority groups of those in receipt of:</p>

	<p pid=".717W.0/2">We are determined that people who have offended in the past should not be unfairly discriminated against. The Code of Practice issued under the Police Act 1997, following extensive consultation, emphasises the need for information to be used fairly, and for guidance issued or supported by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) to be observed. The Code also requires employers to have written policies in relation to the recruitment of ex-offenders. The CRB is working closely with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and with Nacro to develop guidance material for organisations that wish to use the CRB's service. Two publications have been issued so far. Both offer practical and policy recommendations on employing people with a criminal record. The Bureau will continue to work with these organisations and others on the creation of guidance materials. A publicity campaign aimed at offenders, ex-offenders, employers, volunteering groups and the public is currently being developed by the CRB, to help inform people about the disclosure service.</p>

	<p pid=".719W.2/1">The Prison Service policy on pricing is that goods and services should be offered at a fair market price, which covers direct manufacturing cost plus a contribution to the recovery of overheads. Prison overheads are higher than outside because of high fixed costs, such as high ratios of costly supervision, a short working week and low productivity rates. Once a prison has recovered all variable costs and a contribution to the direct costs, its rates are in most cases no lower than those of comparable commercial ventures.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.2/2">The Prison Service has dealt with three cases during the last 12 months in which concerns were expressed about under-cutting by prisons. All three cases were fully investigated and it was found in each case that Prison Service policy had been adhered to.</p>

	<p pid=".720W.0/1">A number of professional sports bodies were involved in the discussions of the Football Working Group, which was chaired by former Home Office Minister, Lord Bassam of Brighton and which reported in March 2001. The working group report includes recommendations aimed at encouraging Premiership and Football League clubs to maximise and expand their community investment programmes, notably through developing partnerships with local communities, local authorities and businesses. The report highlights the social and public order benefits of encouraging, facilitating and funding young people to participate in grassroots football and other sports projects.</p>
	<p pid=".720W.0/2">In January 2001 senior Home Office officials met officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Department for Education and Skills (formerly Department for Education and Science) and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (formerly Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions) to discuss the contribution youth sport can make to crime reduction. Officials subsequently attended a seminar organised by the DCMS and featuring an American expert in this field. Further discussions took place in June and officials remain in touch with a view to identifying examples of effective schemes which can be recommended to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".720W.0/3">The Home Office is currently funding a number of schemes which aim to use sport and recreation to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour. There are several small schemes with total funding of &pound;400,000 under the Reducing Burglary Initiative. The principal schemes are those involving the Youth Justice Board&mdash;ie Positive Futures (&pound;6 million over three years to March 2003); Youth Inclusion (&pound;15.6 million over four years to March 2003); and Easter and Summer 'Splash' schemes (&pound;3.6 million over two years to March 2002).</p>

	<p pid=".722W.0/1">My Department receives large amounts of correspondence from hon. Members and members of the public. We aim to send a substantive reply to all letters as soon as possible. I am determined to achieve a high level of performance in dealing quickly with correspondence.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/2">We are working with our information technology partners to develop next summer a customer contact centre which will radically change the way we handle letters, e-mails and telephone inquiries. In the short term we are implementing a number of organisational and process changes to bring about improvements in the quality and timeliness of replies and to prepare for the contact centre.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/3">General information on the volumes of correspondence received across Whitehall and on overall performance is published by the Cabinet Office. Figures for 2000 were published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-06">6 April 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-04-06.324W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 324W</phrase>, and on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-19">19 July 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-07-19.454W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 454W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/4">The Home Office also receives a high number of parliamentary questions each Session and takes its responsibilities for answering them seriously. This is reflected in the performance levels indicated in the tables, which are, in the main, within the recommended response times required by both Houses. The Home Office has, since 2000, had a performance indicator of answering 95 per cent. of parliamentary questions within target. In the most recent financial year for which figures are available&mdash;2000/01&mdash;the figure achieved was 94 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.0/5">The tables show the number of written parliamentary questions answered by the Home Office in the House of Commons and the House of Lords respectively since 1995; the percentage of those questions which took more than a month to provide a substantive answer; the percentage of questions which took more than three months to provide a substantive answer; and the average response time in days from the point at which the question is due for answer (ie the date on which it appears in the order book). The figures for questions in the House of Commons have been broken down in terms of questions which were for ordinary written and named day answer respectively.</p>

The general definition of communications is in Part I, Chapter II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The types of data within that category that will be covered by the code will be agreed in the course of consultation. That way we can be sure that both sides are clear about the types of data which are retained.</p>

Our aim will be to complete the task of converting the Bonn agreement into detailed decisions. We should not underestimate the scale of this task, but I am optimistic agreement should be possible. It is vital that we maintain political momentum and the spirit of co-operation that was evident in Bonn.

	<p pid=".732W.9/1">The UK's climate change programme, published in November 2000, sets out details of the policies and measures that the Government are introducing to meet the UK's target under the Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&ndash;12 and to move towards our domestic goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. We estimate that these policies could reduce emissions by 23 per cent. by 2010. This is substantially beyond our Kyoto target.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.9/2">The Government have been making progress with implementing the policies outlined in the programme. The UK's Third National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase>, provides an update of this progress. Copies of the Communication will be placed in the Library of each House.</p>

	<p pid=".733W.2/1">Major benefits are expected to flow from bringing together responsibilities for farming and food, environment and conservation and the rural affairs portfolio within one Department, although the benefits&mdash;both policy and operational&mdash;will be realised gradually. On foot and mouth disease, there was already close joint working between Departments, via the Cabinet Office co-ordination machinery and via the rural task force, which brought together both Departments involved and external stakeholders. The establishment of DEFRA has offered scope for further integration. Great efforts are being made to establish a new culture within the Department, with clear aims and objectives through a process in which stakeholders and staff at every level have been involved. We are also seeking to develop close partnerships as a way of working within the new Department, across Whitehall and with partners at a regional and local level throughout England as well as on the international stage. The new Department has created a post at Board level to bring together general weight of DEFRA field delivery as a whole.</p>

I am grateful to them for their positive response to the challenges and the high degree of co-operation we have received from them in recent months. As with earlier tranches of money, it will be for the individual regional development agency to decide on the best way to allocate the Business Recovery Fund (BRF) in its region and to set the deadline for applications according to local circumstances. Regional development agencies must ensure that grants are consistent with the European Commission's state aids rules as well as the guidance issued by this Department.

	<p pid=".735W.2/2">DEFRA Head Office gives permission for local Animal Health Offices (AHOs) to start blood testing (serosurveillance) around former infected premises but it is left to the local AHO to decide on its priorities for sampling based on a number of factors. In the case of north Somerset, the AHO is also responsible for Gloucestershire and Wiltshire.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/3">The blood tests are part of the extensive on-going programme of testing sheep flocks inside foot and mouth disease protection and surveillance zones and so far over 1.1 million samples have been taken across the country. The 22 farms in north Somerset fell within a surveillance zone straddling the borders of two testing regions. Those in the Somerset part of the zone were sampled in advance of those in north Somerset.</p>

While Treasury approval is generally required for write-offs, the final decision in individual cases rests with the relevant Secretary of State. The decision to remit lending will of course depend on the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.9/2">Departments are responsible for accounting for all loans, including write-offs. In the case of loans from the National Loans Fund, primary legislation is required before any loan can be written off. In the case of lending financed by Departments, all other write-offs must be recorded in the accounts of the leading department and any remission of voted lending above &pound;20 million is reported to Parliament by way of a Treasury Minute.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.64/2">Inspectors found that despite covering the largest geographical area of any council in the UK, the council was effective at promoting the take-up of benefit and provided access to advice on HB and CTB through a number of local outlets.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.64/3">Although benefit claims were processed on time, inspectors consider the council's claim form was poor and its approach to verification was inconsistent, resulting in serious implications for the security of the benefits gateway. The report notes the council intended to phase in the Verification Framework from April 2001 and also agreed to revise its claim form.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.64/4">Inspectors consider one of the underlying problems was the council's failure to manage benefits, particularly the lack of a senior manager with direct responsibility for HB and CTB. The report notes that addressing this failure is fundamental to facilitating improvements and successfully implementing BFI's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.64/5">Inspectors found limited counter-fraud activity, with no procedures in place with the procurator fiscal to effectively pursue prosecutions nor to offer administrative penalties. Insufficient staff were allocated to the counter-fraud team. Investigation work was in arrears and some investigations had not been fully completed. BFI considers one third of the council's Weekly Benefit Savings claims were incorrect.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.64/6">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter-fraud activities.</p>

The rates will be reduced for non-resident parents on low incomes, for those who share the care of qualifying children and for those with children (including stepchildren) in a second family.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.137/2">The chief inspector's report describes the work of the Inspectorate over the past year and reports some of its principal findings. Magistrates courts committees (MCCs) are seen to have made improvements in many areas. In particular, the co-operation between the courts, police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) at an operational level, has strengthened further. The progress made on the operation of the 'Narey' reforms aimed at reducing delay in the magistrates courts and the Government's pledge to reduce the time taken to deal with persistent young offenders are examples of the benefits of close working.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.137/3">There have been advances made in the collection of performance information, and in the way it is represented to the MCC, but effective analysis of this information remains a weakness for a number of MCCs. This is in spite of the situation being highlighted in last year's report. MCCs are, however, demonstrating a better awareness of the need to provide the strategic direction and of leaving operational matters to their officers.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.148/2">Apart from the Football (Disorder) (Amendment) Bill, which is undergoing parliamentary scrutiny, no relevant legislation is currently proposed. An extensive range of specific legislative measures is in place for tackling violence and disorder at football matches while general public order and other provisions are available for dealing with the much lower levels of disorder experienced at other sporting events. Legislation alone will not eradicate violence and hooliganism.

	<p pid=".742W.166/3">The Government, through UK Sport and Sport England, continue to fund the work of the National Sports Medicine Institute (NSMI). The Institute promotes good medical practice in the treatment of athletes at all levels, including adequate preparation for events and the importance of a sound diet for optimum health and performance.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.166/4">In addition, the UKSI and NSMI work closely with the British Olympic Medical Centre (BOMC), based at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, on co-ordination and delivery of sports medicine and science services for elite athletes in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.166/5">Following a monitoring report on their World Class Performance Plan, published at the start of 2001, and subsequent joint work between UK Athletics and UK Sport, UK Athletics commissioned an independent review of its sports medicine provision. Dr. Ken Fitch, who has undertaken significant reviews across the world, including the Australian Institute of Sport, was responsible for the review. The Minister for Sport recently met with UK Athletics and Dr. Fitch to discuss sports medicine provision for international athletics.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.166/6">UK Athletics have just received Dr. Fitch's report and they will be putting together an action plan for the short, medium and long term to enhance their provision of sports medicine to athletes. The UKSI also contributed to the review and UK Sport will work in partnership with UK Athletics on the implementation of the review's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.175/1">The Commonwealth games are a commercial event, and the organisers have an imperative to sell all the available tickets. However, tickets for the games have been set at a level to ensure that people can afford them. Ticket prices start at &pound;5 and over half of all tickets will be priced at &pound;10 or less. Five events, the marathon, triathlon, walking, and mountain and road cycling will also be free.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.175/2">Local school children will be taking part in the opening and closing ceremonies. Alongside the Commonwealth games the organisers, Manchester 2002 Ltd., are also organising the Sprit of Friendship Festival and Queen's Jubilee Baton Relay. These will offer a range of opportunities for school children to participate in the broader games programme and celebrate the Golden Jubilee.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.199/1">Football is the nation's most popular participation sport by far, and it is a priority for both the Government and Sport England to develop the sport at the grass roots. Sport England's funding for football has been channelled through the Football Foundation since July 2000. The Foundation received Lottery funding totalling &pound;7 million from Sport England in 2000&ndash;01, and the majority of this went to funding the sport at the grass roots level. Children's and recreational football also benefits from substantial Sport England Lottery funding for multi-use capital projects, and the financial benefits to grass roots football cannot be quantified.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.199/2">In addition, exchequer-funded grants from Sport England to the Football Association to fund work on grass roots development totalled &pound;165,000 in 1998&ndash;99 and &pound;144,000 in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.199/3">The primary role of UK Sport is to support elite sportsmen and women by funding the development of training and competition facilities, and the provision of high quality coaching. UK Sport does not fund grass roots development initiatives in any sport.</p>
