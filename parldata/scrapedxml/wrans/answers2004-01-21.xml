	<p pid=".1233W.6/2">The UK signed and ratified the Montreal Protocol in 1987, and has since ratified the four other amendments, London (1990) Copenhagen (1992) Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). The Community has implemented its obligations under the Montreal Protocol through EC Regulation 2037/2000, which is directly applicable in UK law. This Regulation has put in place an accelerated phase-out programme on the supply and use of ozone depleting substances, as EU member states were keen to move faster than the Protocol. A statutory Instrument has been introduced which creates offences and sets penalties for any breaches of the ozone regulation.</p>

	<p pid=".1233W.9/2">In accordance with international practice, the inventory difference that occurs when the result of a physical inventory of nuclear material is compared with the book inventory is referred to as MUF ('material unaccounted for'). The difference may be negative (an apparent loss) or positive (an apparent gain). MUF is a recognised feature of accounting for nuclear material and is caused primarily by the uncertainties inherent in the techniques used to measure nuclear material. MUF figures at UKAEA, BNFL and Urenco sites are published annually by the industry. Copies of the figures published since 1997 have been placed in the Library of the House. There is no evidence to suggest that there have been any real losses or gains of nuclear material.</p>

	<p pid=".1234W.8/1">Every five years the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) advises Government on which animals should be legally protected by listing on Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. JNCC reported to Government with its recommendations in September 2002, which included full protection for this species. The next stage is for Government to conduct a public consultation based on these recommendations, which will occur in spring 2004. Following this consultation, the Secretary of State will decide on the changes to be made to the schedules and these will be implemented by Statutory Instrument.</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/2">For a species to be recommended for scheduling one of the eligibility criteria in each of the Sections A to D below should be met:</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/3" class="indent">A. Generally, only native (including re-established) taxa are to be considered. Taxa introduced or thought to be introduced to Great Britain by man could be considered exceptionally, with the following provisos.</p>

	<p pid=".1234W.8/5" class="indent">(ii) preferably, the natural range reaches the north west coast of Europe (i.e. continental distribution extends to the Atlantic coast of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany or Scandinavia; for marine taxa, the distribution includes the north west Atlantic area), and provided that</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/6" class="indent">(iii) information suggests that the organism is unlikely to have an adverse impact on important native species or ecosystems.</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/7" class="indent">B. The taxon must be either:</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/8" class="indent">(i) established in the wild in Great Britain; or</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/9" class="indent">(ii) occur as a vagrant in Great Britain and require international protection; or</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/10" class="indent">(iii) be believed extinct in Great Britain as a breeding species, but be in the process of re-establishment; or</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/11" class="indent">(iv) be believed extinct in Great Britain, but with the possibility that it could become re-established naturally.</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/12" class="indent">C. The taxonomic status of the organism must be well authenticated. Taxa below the species level could be considered, providing they are:</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/13" class="indent">(i) clearly recognisable (i.e. morphologically distinct), and</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/14" class="indent">(ii) geographically or ecologically distinct.</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/15" class="indent">D. The taxon must be endangered in Great Britain, or likely to become so unless conservation measures are taken, and/or be subject to an international obligation for protection. One or more of the following may indicate that a taxon is or may become endangered:</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/16" class="indent">(i) it is included in a JNCC-approved British Red Data Book as Extinct, Endangered or Vulnerable (or, in Red Lists drawn up using the recently revised IUCN criteria, as Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable)]</p>

	<p pid=".1234W.8/18" class="indent">(iii) it is confined to a particularly threatened habitat. The extent or quality of the habitat is being significantly reduced or is likely to become significantly reduced, thus threatening the survival of the organism;</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/19" class="indent">(iv) it is rapidly declining in population, number of localities occupied or range. Indicative would be at least 50 per cent. decline observed, estimated inferred or suspected in the last 20 years, or a decline of at least 50 per cent. projected, inferred or suspected to be likely in the near future. The decline must transcend normal fluctuations;</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/20" class="indent">(v) it is endangered, or likely to become endangered through being targeted for exploitation or killing for commercial reasons and/or through being particularly attractive to collectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/21" class="indent">International obligations apply to a taxon which is:</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.8/22" class="indent">(vi) naturally resident and listed on Appendices I, II or III of the Bern Convention; Annexes II, IV or V of the EC Habitats and Species Directive; Appendix I of the Bonn Convention (unless derogations are in force); and/or endemic to Great Britain and included in a JNCC-approved British Red List.</p>

	<p pid=".1235W.3/1">The Government considers that strengthened enforcement of existing controls, combined with publicity and education, is the appropriate basis for dealing with drink-drive accidents and casualties. The Government carried out an analysis of the possible savings in road traffic casualties from a reduction in the legal alcohol limit for the purposes of the 1998 consultation document &quot;Combating Drink Driving: Next Steps&quot;, a copy of which is in the House Library. This estimated that a reduction in the limit to 50mg/100ml could save around 50 fatalities per year, but was based on a number of assumptions about accident causation and individual driver compliance. We have also considered more recent published research into the potential impact of lowering the limit, the results of which appear to be inconclusive.</p>

The CAA intends to review with UK industry the impact that EASA will have on the costs of its Safety Regulation Group and the associated charges to UK industry.</p>

	<p pid=".1244W.8/2">Army combat arms training has been taken to encompass individual training for all personnel at Phase 1 (initial) training (which will include individuals who go on to serve in non-combat arms), and individual training at phase 2 (specialist) and phase 3 (career and development) training for personnel serving in the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Artillery, the Infantry, and the School of Army Aviation. LAND Command undertakes collective training for the whole Army but cannot identify specific costs associated with such training for combat arms. The sums shown include an element for HQ Admin costs etc., which cannot easily be separated out, but exclude all salary costs of trainees, which are accounted for separately.

	<p pid=".1256W.4/1">An update on the Government's current assessment of the impact of the aggregates levy was in the pre-Budget report (Cm 6042). Monitoring of the aggregates levy takes the form of a rolling programme of research and analysis of data as it becomes available. It encompasses all regions of the UK and it takes account of data from specific research, such as the Government-commissioned Symonds Report on the levy's impact in Northern Ireland, as well as information from business organisations, individual companies, environment groups and site visits by officials.</p>
	<p pid=".1256W.4/2">Emerging evidence suggests that overall primary aggregates extraction has fallen since the levy's introduction; for example, the total outputs from the Annual Minerals Raised Inquiry for Great Britain for 2002 show a decrease of 5.7 per cent. on the 2001 figures. While there are a number of factors affecting extraction levels, it is clear that the levy has played a significant part in encouraging that reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".1259W.0/1">The Government are committed to improving household energy efficiency, as part of their programme to meet Energy White Paper targets. The Government routinely evaluate the impact of policy initiatives, including environmental tax measures. The Government have a long-standing commitment to pursue EU changes to permit a reduced rate of VAT for the DIY installation of energy saving materials, and have already applied a reduced rate of VAT for the installation of materials in certain other circumstances. The Government consulted on further measures to improve household energy efficiency in 2003, including a tax allowance for private landlords investing in energy efficiency. The Government also invited views on other possible policy initiatives. Responses were published and are being taken into account in further policy development. In the pre-Budget report (Cm 6042) we confirmed that we believe that there is a case for the further use of economic instruments as part of a package of measures to promote energy efficiency. A further announcement will be made around Budget 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1260W.2/1">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) lends to low-income countries through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), a lending instrument offering softer terms than conventional IMF lending. Loans under the PRGF are based on a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which is prepared by the country in co-operation with civil society and other development partners, in particular the World Bank. The UK believes that IMF loan conditions should reflect only what is necessary for the success of a program, to ensure the protection of IMF funds, and to meet the core requirements of the Fund's mandate. Conditions should be appropriate for a particular country. This is upheld in new guidelines on conditionality introduced by the IMF in September 2002 and the UK will work to ensure these guidelines remain appropriate and that they are upheld in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1260W.2/2">The UK continues to be fully committed to the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to ensure that it delivers a robust exit from unsustainable debt for the world's poorest countries. To change the underlying dynamics of those countries in which debt indicators are deteriorating, it is important that&mdash;in addition to receiving debt relief&mdash;countries implement the reforms necessary to allow them to grow faster, to increase poverty reduction expenditure and to enable them to diversify their export bases and better absorb macroeconomic shocks, such as a decline in specific commodity prices. So far 27 countries have started to receive debt relief under the initiative, worth over US $70 billion. To be eligible for the HIPC Initiative, countries must be eligible for highly concessional assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, face an unsustainable debt situation after the full application of traditional debt relief mechanisms (such as application of Naples terms under the Paris Club agreement), and must make a commitment to poverty reduction through the implementation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".1260W.2/3">The HIPC Initiative has an important role to play in maximising the resources available for poverty reduction in developing countries. However, unless there is an increase in the volume of resources available from donors to poor countries, additional debt relief would simply reallocate resources from one form of financing to another, and from non-HIPC poor countries to HIPC countries, without adding to the overall financing available for poverty reduction. Furthermore, all HIPC countries would still need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals even if all of their debt from the World Bank and IMF were cancelled. That is why the UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important. It could provide the much-needed substantial increase in resources which debt relief alone would not achieve and which could be disbursed by way of grants and additional debt relief.</p>

These measures will help clubs raise funds to improve facilities for participating in sport, by reducing the burden placed upon them.</p>

Incidences of human trafficking to the UK remain low, although the vast majority of those entering the UK illegally do so with the assistance of people smugglers (or facilitators). Figures for the prosecutions of facilitators do not differentiate between asylum seekers who enter illegally, and other illegal entrants.

In addition, individuals whose asylum claims appear to be capable of being decided quickly may be detained as part of a fast-track asylum process. The majority of those detained for these reasons are held in Immigration Service removal centres. In a small number of individual cases it is necessary for reasons of security and control to hold detained persons in prison accommodation.

	<p pid=".1271W.2/2">The Home Office recognises that local communities are best placed to define and solve their own problems and that they should be able to work with the relevant authorities and organisations in a flexible way. This approach is termed civil renewal and can be applied across areas such as policing, criminal justice, and the work of drug action teams.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.2/3">In terms of policing and police reform, for example, in the last six months three police authority areas have been identified&mdash;Cheshire, Merseyside and Northumbria&mdash;to test out new ways to engage with communities. The lessons they learn will be fed through to the work of a Practitioner Panel which will identify and share good practice in citizen-focused policy and community engagement.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.2/4">Reform of the criminal justice system will continue to address the challenge of developing more effective community engagement, so that individuals and communities affected by crime can play an active part in solving the crime-related problems in their local areas, and can feel greater confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.2/5">As another example of the civil renewal approach, the Home Office is monitoring what drug action teams across the country do to engage local communities. Progress is good, including a grants scheme for black and minority ethnic community groups to carry out research into the health needs of their communities and generate ideas for service improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".1271W.2/6">The Home Office is currently consulting the community and voluntary sector about practical ways to build capacity in communities in order to achieve civil renewal. It has also recently launched the Active Citizenship Centre, which is the centre for research in best practice and case studies of civil renewal.</p>

	<p pid=".1272W.5/2">The National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) is continually monitoring the threat of electronic attack on the UK's Critical National Infrastructure. NISCC's assessment is that the overall threat from electronic attack is increasing but remains less attractive than a conventional attack. While the threat of the sort of attack that could disable a critical service is considered to remain low, less serious but damaging attacks that might deface a website or deny service from a website are assessed to be more likely.</p>

	<p pid=".1275W.8/1">There is already substantial legislation to protect people who are victimised or discriminated against because of their religion. For example, the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 already contains provisions which make it a criminal offence to incite or arouse fear of racial or religious hatred. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 created new religiously aggravated offences in England and Wales, under which crimes such as assault and criminal damage attract a higher maximum penalty if they are committed because of the victim's religious belief or lack of belief. We would urge any person whose safety or property is threatened because of their religious beliefs or lack of beliefs to report the matter to the police. The Home Office has recently published a response to the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences, in which we have indicated our support in principle for a new offence of incitement to religious hatred in England and Wales.</p>

There are many reasons for this increase. For example, arrangements for plea before venue, as made possible by the Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act 1996 and the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, were implemented on <phrase class="date" code="1997-10-01">1 October 1997</phrase>. Plea before venue led to offenders pleading guilty earlier than previously and hence spending less time untried and spending proportionately more time convicted unsentenced.</p>

A rate ceiling could actually encourage rates to gravitate towards the ceiling, causing detriment to consumers and competition. It might also encourage lenders to make the cost of credit more expensive to consumers in other ways (for example by introducing higher charges), or lead some lenders to exit the market, denying some consumers access to credit.</p>

	<p pid=".1282W.9/1">The department has commissioned a range of research looking at the Working Time Directive in the UK. The evidence suggests that the majority of UK workers are in workplaces complying with the Working Time Regulations. However, there are some areas of concern.</p>
	<p pid=".1282W.9/2">A Survey of Workers' Experiences of the Working Time Regulations commissioned by the department in 2001 shows that just under a quarter of 'long hours' workers who have not signed an opt-out perceived employer pressure to work long hours. A second piece of research published by DTI in 2003, the Business Context to Long Hours Working, suggests that in establishments which had sustained long hours working, around three-quarters had no employees sign the opt-out.</p>
	<p pid=".1282W.9/3">The research commissioned does not specifically look at whether staff have been illegally asked to optout of their rights to rest breaks and night work limits. However, the Survey of Workers' Experiences of the Working Time Regulations found that approximately one in 10 workers 'without full rest breaks' thought they had experienced employer pressure to work without full rest breaks, and a similar proportion of 'night workers' felt pressured to work long hours at night.</p>
	<p pid=".1282W.9/4">Other research published by DTI in 2003 looking at the Implementation of the Working Time Regulations: a follow up study, reported that one case study employer, an engineering company, had made the signing of an opt-out agreement a condition of employment for new starters who worked nights.</p>
	<p pid=".1282W.9/5">I am ready to look at suggestions for improving the operation of working time law, including concerns over misuse of the opt-out to make sure it works properly.

	<p pid=".1283W.2/1">The opt-out from the weekly working time limits is valuable as it provides flexibility for employers and the choice for employees to work longer hours if they want to. Without the opt-out, employers would have to reduce the hours of some of their workers. This could cause problems for both employers and employees. A recent study The Business Context to Long Hours Working published by my department in 2003 shows that employers thought the most common barrier to reducing the hours of staff was the needs of the business and workload (55 per cent. of respondents cited this), second to this was the concern that existing staff may resist the reduction in hours as it could limit their choice to work these hours and a reduction in their overtime pay (22 per cent.).</p>

Four projects that have improved access to potable water, sanitation and environmental health in some of the poorest communities have just been brought to a successful conclusion. We currently fund two projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1295W.8/2">Our support for the Sustainable Management of the West Bank and Gaza Strip Aquifers project will enhance the Palestinian Water Authority's understanding of the western aquifer, which is an essential source of water in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The project includes consideration of the management and allocation of water resources between various uses&mdash;agriculture, industry and domestic&mdash;to allow the implications of alternative policies to be assessed. We also support a Water Access and Storage project to enable villages in the south Hebron district of the West Bank that do not have access to the networked water supply to obtain more secure access to drinking water and sustainable improved sanitation.</p>

	<p pid=".1296W.2/1">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) was founded in January 2002. We recognise that the GFATM is still a young partnership and that it has just started to finance programmes within countries. The impact of GFATM is difficult to measure at this early stage but its 2002&ndash;03 annual report provides very good evidence of progress made to date on each of these diseases. Disbursement is now accelerating we expect to see more evidence of the impact of the Global Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1296W.2/2">DFID has been working closely with the Board on effective ways to measure the GFATM's performance and evaluate its processes. We are working to ensure that the GFATM has a clear poverty focus, sound financial systems in place and alignment of its activities with national programmes and processes.</p>

	<p pid=".1296W.5/1">Of the 16 PSA countries, six have experienced a rise in child mortality between 1990 and 2001. The other ten have made varying degrees of progress but are all generally some way below the level needed to reach the PSA target.</p>
	<p pid=".1296W.5/2">Child mortality has multiple and complex causes. Economic decline and associated malnutrition is likely to have played a major role in constraining improvement in child health. Several African countries have also experienced conflict and civil unrest, which further undermine attempts to reduce child mortality. Other significant reasons for lack of progress include problems within the performance of the health sector itself and HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".1296W.5/3">However, in a number of the PSA countries some encouraging progress has been achieved against intermediate health indicators. For example, in Ghana there has been progress with immunisation rates and deployment of nurses. Tanzania has seen improved immunisation rates, significant Vitamin A and insecticide-treated mosquito net distribution, improved malaria treatment and strengthened health planning and management at district level. In Uganda, use of outpatient services has increased and immunisation rates have risen. All of these improvements have the potential to improve child mortality rates.</p>
	<p pid=".1296W.5/4">The Department for International Development's contribution to these improvements in Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda and other countries has been provided in a number of ways, including through support for the health sector, budget support, and technical assistance. It is also important to recognise that DFID is not working alone, and that changes are due to the combined efforts of the countries concerned and other donors as well as ourselves. We will continue to work with other donors to ensure that affordable and sustainable health outcomes are given due priority and support in national planning and budgeting processes.</p>

The ability accurately to measure localised increases in cancer rates&mdash;especially if there is cancer due to radiation, which can take years to develop&mdash;requires a well-developed national disease surveillance system, which Iraq does not currently have. The World Health Organisation plans to carry out a study to investigate the effects of the use of depleted uranium in ordnance used by military forces, which some individuals have claimed has caused an increase in cancer rates in Iraq, using that country as a key focus. This study will be subject to funding and to an improvement in the security situation.</p>

	<p pid=".1298W.2/1">DFID's approach is to encourage the involvement and employment of Iraqis as much as possible in all the work we fund. For some projects, this has included direct employment of Iraqi staff and sub-contracting of Iraqi firms. By way of example, the vast majority of the construction work DFID has funded in southern Iraq has been sub-contracted to local firms. One of the criteria we have set for our &pound;20 million Essential Infrastructure Programme has been to give priority to projects that create the most employment.

	<p pid=".1299W.2/1">Artemisinin (or Artesunate) is a naturally occurring substance that has been used in China in the treatment of malaria for a long period of time. It can be used by itself, but is more useful when combined with other effective anti-malarials as it enhances their useful life by decreasing the possibility of drug resistance. The World Health Organisation and Roll Back Malaria recommend the use of combined therapies as the first option wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1299W.2/2">The Department for International Development has committed &pound;48 million to Roll Back Malaria (RBM) over a four and a half year period (September 1999&mdash;March 2004). RBM provides coordinated support for sustainable action against malaria. This includes providing technical support to Governments to ensure that their anti-malarial drug policies enable those suffering from malaria to get early treatment and to access affordable and appropriate medicines. Their advice covers the use of artemisinin- based combination therapies. As an active partner of RBM, my Department works to ensure that RBM provides sound evidence based support for the effective use of resources, including those available from the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which we have committed a total of US$280 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1299W.2/3">DFID has also engaged more directly in partnerships with industry to transform research into drugs. We recently worked with GlaxoSmithKline, the WHO programme on Tropical Diseases Research and Liverpool University in the development of a cheap new drug called LAPDAP. In order to make the best use of LAPDAP, further research to combine it with artemisinin is being undertaken, managed under an umbrella organisation called the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), which DFID also supports. MMV has a portfolio of projects, which include the development of a number of artemisinin-based combination therapies using a variety of drugs. DFID is funding MMV with &pound;1 million per year for five years. Since its inception in 1999 MMV has demonstrated significant progress towards reaching its objective of two new drugs in the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1299W.2/4">Artemisinin-based therapies are, like many new treatments, relatively expensive. This highlights the need for the UK Government to work with others to reduce the cost of effective new drugs. The Prime Minister's high-level Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World recommended differential pricing of essential medicines for the developing world. My Department is working with other Government Departments to secure greater international commitment to affordable pricing. The Government worked with G8 colleagues at last year's Evian summit to secure commitment to action on this issue in line with the Working Group's recommendations.</p>

The Education For All Global Monitoring Report identifies 36 countries at serious risk of not achieving the goal, of which 22 are in sub-Saharan Africa. There is increased evidence since the World Education Forum in April 2000, that many countries now have better education sector policies for making progress. Increased international support, including our own commitment of &pound;1 billion over the period 2002&ndash;07, is helping African Governments to improve primary school enrolment.</p>

	<p pid=".1305W.5/1">One of the more positive outcomes of the WTO ministerial in Cancun was the joint announcement by the World Bank and the IMF of a new trade-related initiative. Its overall aim is to assist poor countries with the adjustment costs of transition to trade liberalisation and help them capitalise on the potential benefits. DFID, in collaboration with others, has for some time been actively encouraging the World Bank and IMF to address more systematically the adjustment costs of trade liberalisation and the need for trade-related technical assistance. The collapse of negotiations in Cancun allows more time for the initiative to be developed and to encourage the Bank and Fund to work together more closely in designing mechanisms.</p>

	<p pid=".1306W.5/1">DFID strongly supports the underlying principles of the UN's Year of Microcredit 2005, which seeks to increase international efforts to spread microfinance to more low income clients worldwide. Donors, including DFID, have supported policies and institutions to extend the outreach of sustainable microcredit and other financial services to the poor for many years. DFID has held several discussions with the UN organisers and has been instrumental in linking them with The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), which promotes best practice in the microfinance industry. We intend to support specific events in the UK and will announce these this autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/2" class="italic">Background</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/3" class="italic">UN Year of Microcredit 2005</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/4">The UN General Assembly, through resolution 53/197 in December 1998, proclaimed 2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. Following consultations with Member States in the second half of 2003, a Programme of Action for the Year has been agreed. The UN Capital Development Fund and the UN Secretariat's Department of Economic and Social Affairs will jointly coordinate the preparation activities of the UN system for the Year. The UK and others supported wording in the Programme of Action resolution that emphasised the wider contribution of microfinance, and financial sector development, beyond a concentration on microcredit itself. Hence the Programme of Action often refers to microfinance, in addition to microcredit, and refers to savings, asset creation, and economic security.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/5">The UN Programme proposes that the Year will be launched in November 2004, that Member States will establish National Committees, and that 2004 should be a year of preparation. DFID officials have met initially with UNCDF Secretariat staff, and also with Citigroup, one of the private sector sponsors. UNCDF have noted that donor funding will not be needed at the international level.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/6">The key to the success of the Year will be UN countries adopting the General Assembly Resolution, and signing up to active steps to enable expansion of access to microfinance at local level. Whilst UN &quot;Years&quot; are vulnerable to a charge of more talk and less action, the Year of Microcredit is already attracting attention from private and public sectors including Citigroup, Bank of International Settlements and others.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/7">The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Microfinance is very likely to take an interest in the International Year of Microcredit. The Secretary of State met with them on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-21">21 October</phrase>. DFID officials are also checking whether other Departments will have an interest in the Year (Treasury, DTI). Following further meetings, DFID will recommend a programme of action for the Year to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/8" class="italic">DFID Support to Extend Access to Microfinance</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/9">Current DFID-supported initiatives also include:</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/10">The &pound;18 million Financial Deepening Challenge Fund, using innovative mechanisms to encourage banks and other financial service providers to extend financial services for the poor (<a href="http://www.challengefunds.org">www.challengefunds.org</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/11">AfriCap (<a href="http://www.africapfund.com">www.africapfund.com</a>), specialist equity fund investing in emerging microfinance institutions in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/12">MicroSave-Africa (<a href="http://www.MicroSave-Africa.com">www.MicroSave-Africa.com</a>) a programme that tests new pro-poor savings, insurance, and loan products and promotes market-led microfinance.</p>
	<p pid=".1306W.5/13">In addition, country-led programmes to develop the microfinance industry are under way in Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, India and Bangladesh.</p>

However, it is now clear that this figure is an underestimate and is being revised upwards to 5.1 million people in rural areas. Results of a comprehensive urban vulnerability assessment are yet to be released, but are also expected to show a significant increase in people requiring humanitarian assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".1309W.0/1">In December 2003, the WFP and other agencies distributed general rations to 3.5 million beneficiaries, while many other vulnerable people received food through targeted programmes.

Incidents of political interference remain few and isolated.

	<p pid=".1311W.2/2">&quot;The Skills for Life Survey: A National Needs and Impact Survey of Literacy, Numeracy and ICT skills&quot; (DfES, October 2003) provides an up-to-date assessment of the level of basic skills need against the National Standards for literacy, numeracy and ICT among adults aged 16 to 65 in England. A copy of this survey has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

They provide an invaluable source of information on the people taking part and the direct impact the strategy is having.</p>

	<p pid=".1313W.8/2">Career guidance is a key part of the work of Connexions. All 13&ndash;19 year olds in England have access to support on making learning and career choices from Connexions. The level of support each individual receives is differentiated according to need. Support is provided in a range of ways, including through: one to one and group sessions with a Connexions Personal Adviser; Connexions Direct&mdash;a telephone helpline, e-mail and web-chat facility, open from 8am to 2am, 365 days a year; and the careers information materials available in Connexions Resource centres in schools, colleges and Connexions one-stop shops.</p>

Officials have also regularly met representatives of local government to discuss policy development. Our work has also been informed by the extensive consultation we undertook on &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. All areas of local government were fully represented at the nine regional consultation events and we are pleased to have received a huge response to the written consultation, including many submissions from local government representative groups and local authorities. I have also met individual local authority representatives in a number of meetings and on a range of visits.</p>

Departmental officials only authorise local education authorities to release funding to a school when they are satisfied that its plans comply with stringent conditions set by the project. Local education authorities are then expected to work with schools to ensure the efficiency of systems installed.</p>

	<p pid=".1321W.2/1">The discount levels in the memorandum between Microsoft and the British Educational Communications and Training Agency are based on thresholds derived from the estimated number of licenses purchased annually by schools in England rather than on the total number of licenses held. The discount levels are calculated annually in arrears and therefore the discount levels which apply in Year 1 of the agreement relate to purchases already made, are at the maximum level, and are therefore absolutely guaranteed. The discount applicable in Year 2 will relate to the number of licenses actually purchased in Year 1. The discount in Year 3 relates to the actual purchases in Year 2.</p>
	<p pid=".1321W.2/2">The number of licences across the UK required to qualify for the maximum discount in Year 2 and Year 3 are also based on the same numerical threshold as Year 1. Therefore, no growth in the number of Microsoft licences purchased annually by schools is required to achieve the maximum discount levels.</p>
	<p pid=".1321W.2/3">As Becta has a UK wide remit, it has ensured that licence volumes from the Devolved Administrations, although not taken into account in deriving the threshold, can be taken into account in meeting it, thus providing a cost advantage to schools in the Devolved Administrations, and the increased possibility that schools in England will benefit from the highest discount levels.</p>
	<p pid=".1321W.2/4">In the event that the number of licenses purchased by schools across the UK does not fall below 96 per cent. of the number of licenses purchased by schools in England in the year prior to the introduction of the MOU, the maximum level of discount will continue to apply. If the total number of licences sold to schools in the UK in any year of the agreement (the annual sales) falls below 96 per cent. of the number of licences purchased in the year immediately preceding the agreement by schools in England (the base year), the 20 per cent. minimum discount will be reduced as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1321W.2/5" class="indent">if the annual sales fell to 75 per cent. of the base year sales, the minimum discount of 20 per cent. would be reduced to 75 per cent. of its previous value i.e. it would fall from 20 per cent. to 15 per cent; and</p>
	<p pid=".1321W.2/6" class="indent">if the annual sales fell to 50 per cent. of the base year sales, the minimum discount would be reduced to 50 per cent. of its previous value i.e. it would drop from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1321W.2/7">These two 'pro rata' minimum discount points at 15 per cent. and 10 per cent. were introduced to minimise the impact of any reductions in the purchasing by schools of Microsoft products.</p>

	<p pid=".1322W.6/1">Through aggregating demand for Microsoft Licensing, Becta has been able to identify estimated savings over the next three years of up to &pound;46 million for schools in England. These potential savings apply to all schools in the maintained and independent sectors. Additional savings will accrue to schools in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Compared to April 2003 pricing, the reduction/savings in schools' spending attributable to this deal will be between 20 per cent. and 37 per cent. depending on the actual products purchased.</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.6/2">The estimate of savings for each of the next three years is:</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.6/3" class="indent">Year 1&mdash;&pound;13 million;</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.6/4" class="indent">Year 2&mdash;&pound;15 million; and</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.6/5" class="indent">Year 3&mdash;&pound;18 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.6/6">Taking account of the likely mix of products purchased and the licensing programmes used, the overall percentage reduction in school spend on Microsoft licensing compared with spending levels as at April 2003 is estimated to be between 30 per cent. to 33 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.6/7">The calculation of these savings was made possible as a result of information made available to Becta by Microsoft in respect of Microsoft's most recent financial year and under legally binding non-disclosure arrangements. Procedures to monitor the actual level of savings achieved have been agreed by Becta and Microsoft.</p>

We expect LEAs to pass on funding increases to schools. We will continue to provide some direct grants from the Government to schools, in particular the Standards Fund, and allow schools to spend these funds more flexibly to meet their needs.

All Sure Start programmes are 'community-led' through a partnership (made up of parents, community groups, and local representatives of voluntary and statutory organisations providing services to the families in the area) that designs the programme after consultation with families and workers in the area so that services reflect the needs of the community. These partnerships, in the main, have no legal status and are not incorporated bodies. One of the partner organisations must act as the 'accountable body' and take the legal responsibility for receiving the grant on behalf of the partnership. 86 programmes (16 per cent.) have non-statutory organisations as their accountable body, and of these, 16 (3 per cent.) are community groups or partnerships who have taken legal status for the purpose of running the programme.</p>

	<p pid=".1335W.3/1">Promoting the take-up of council tax benefit is the statutory duty of local authorities. However we are keen to ensure that all pensioners entitled to help with their council tax bills are claiming this. In particular, we want to ensure that the 1.9 million pensioners who gain, or gain more, council tax benefit on the introduction of pension credit get the extra help to which they are entitled.</p>
	<p pid=".1335W.3/2">We are therefore actively pursuing ways of supporting local authorities in their duty to promote awareness of council tax benefit. Many authorities already have well developed take up strategies and we want to support these, and other authorities, to ensure that more pensioners on low income are receiving the help to which they are entitled.</p>
	<p pid=".1335W.3/3">The pension service are inviting claims for council tax benefit when an application for pension credit is made, and we recently introduced a shortened claim form for pensioners applying for the benefit to make their claim easier. Everyone who calls the pension credit application line and wishes to apply for housing/council tax benefit is issued with a form.</p>
	<p pid=".1335W.3/4">The local service is also working with partner organisations, including local authorities, to help reach the most vulnerable pensioners. During visits to pensioners in the local community or their homes advice on entitlement is provided and help offered to complete application forms.</p>

	<p pid=".1336W.5/1">The overall aim of the Department's anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system that is secure from first claim to final payment. The implementation of this strategy means than an anti-fraud focus is integral to the work of all staff in the Department, as is dealing with the wider agenda of error and incorrectness in benefit payments.</p>
	<p pid=".1336W.5/2">The information currently available suggests that around 5,000 staff are employed nationally at any one time by the Department and its agencies in work to investigate suspicions of fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".1338W.3/1">The Disability and Carers Service acknowledges that the claiming process for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) needs to be simplified and has been running a number of initiatives designed to improve the service to customers.</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/2">A shorter DLA postal claim form based around the revised Attendance Allowance (AA) claim form introduced nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-06">6 October 2003</phrase> is being tested. The new DLA postal form has 23 pages and is considerably shorter than the existing claim form. The results from the first three full months of testing are currently being collated and a revised claim form is expected to be produced later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/3">Internet based claim forms for DLA and AA are also under development following the E claim form for Carers Allowance that was launched in December 2003. These should also be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1338W.3/4">Since November 2002, a new interactive claiming process has been trialled in Glasgow Disability Benefits Centre. Customers who request a claim form by telephone are directed to a customer claim advisor who asks some preliminary questions to establish the broad basis of the claim. A tailored claim form is then produced by the computer system that supports the process and forwarded to the customer for completion. The form generated is a maximum of 18 pages, considerably shorter than the existing 47 page form. The results of this trial and the clerical claim form tests will inform the further modernisation of the processing of Disability Benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1342W.2/1">The impact of all Directives relevant to occupational pensions are assessed with regard to the impact on business including any costs they may impose, although additional costs may not directly impact on the funding of a scheme. Such assessments are set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessments that are published with the legislative measures which implement the requirements of these Directives.</p>
	<p pid=".1342W.2/2">The Directive on the Activities and Supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provisions contains Articles which directly relate to funding and we have recently consulted on its implementation in the UK.

	<p pid=".1348W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is in the early stages of developing a Third Age Service which is seen as a network of service providers providing improved access to a range of more integrated services. In this respect, we are working with partners, in particular the Partnerships Against Poverty Group and the Third Age Working Group which DWP chair and which include representatives from Age Concern, Help the Aged, Better Government for Older people and other key stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".1348W.2/2">We have already made progress in developing the main aspects of a third age service e.g. Joint Financial Assessment &amp; Benefit Teams with local authorities. Experience and research evidence indicate that this is the right approach to integrated services. Already, nine joint teams are operational and plans are in place to roll out nationally over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".1348W.2/3">This, together with the work we are doing to enable partner organisations to take benefit claims and verify evidence (on which guidance has been issued), and the work on the Partnership Fund (which will be published in spring this year) shows that we are already delivering on the Government's Manifesto commitment which was 'to build on Care Direct to provide integration of health, housing, benefits and social care for older people'. We await the Lessons Learned report on Care Direct pilots (April 2004) before developing further building blocks.</p>

	<p pid=".1354W.5/1">According to the &quot;National Diet and Nutrition Survey: people aged 65 years and over&quot;, published in 1998, 16 per cent. of men and 15 per cent. of women living in care homes were classified as underweight. The more recent Health Survey for England 2000 gave figures of 8 per cent. for men and 11 per cent. for women. In both cases, underweight was defined as a person with a body mass index of less than 20. We do not have figures estimating people at risk of becoming malnourished.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.5/2">We have no plans to introduce mandatory screening for malnutrition for people in care homes. A number of measures and strategies are in place to manage, monitor and screen people for under nutrition in care homes. Before going into a home every resident should have a detailed needs assessment. This includes nutrition and screening for malnutrition. The assessment should be revised at regular intervals. The home should draw up a care plan for each resident based on his or her needs assessment. The care plan should be reviewed at least once a month to monitor changes in the resident's needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1354W.5/3">The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) regulates care homes in accordance with statutory regulations and national minimum standards to ensure they provide for the needs of their residents. The Care Homes Regulations require homes to provide adequate quantities of suitable, wholesome and nutritious food for service users; and to maintain records of the food provided for service users in sufficient detail to enable inspectors to determine whether the diet is satisfactory, in relation to nutrition and otherwise. Standard 19 of the national standards for care homes for older people sets out what care homes are expected to do to ensure residents are properly fed. This includes giving people assistance with eating where necessary. The NCSC will take swift action where it has concerns about the welfare of residents.</p>

	<p pid=".1361W.5/2">The procurement of independent sector treatment centres (IS-TCs) is designed to contribute to a genuine increase in workforce capacity to treat national health service patients. This is why bidders have been asked to provide as many non-NHS staff as possible: primarily from overseas. In some circumstances, it will be appropriate for NHS staff to work in independent sector treatment centres but this will only be done under a structured arrangement that is agreed between the NHS and the IS-TC provider. The number of professional staff working in these new units and the proportion from overseas will be finalised during the stage of negotiations leading to contract close.</p>

	<p pid=".1364W.2/1">The annual uplift in the unitary fee for Worcestershire Royal Infirmary is specified in the contract.</p>
	<p pid=".1364W.2/2">The unitary fee is uplifted by the General Index of Retail Prices (RPI) each year, unless the Whitley council pay increase for ancillary staff exceeds this level. In this case, the uplift for pay on the soft service element of the contract (eg., catering and domestic services, etc.) is as per the Whitley council agreement and the non staff costs associated with these soft services is uplifted at RPI less 1 per cent.</p>
