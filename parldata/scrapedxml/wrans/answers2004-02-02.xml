	<p pid=".615W.3/1">DFID has developed a comprehensive approach to assessing and managing the fiduciary risks associated with direct budget support, which has been agreed with the UK's National Audit Office.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/2">Firstly, a thorough evaluation of the recipient government's public financial management and accountability procedures, systems, practices and associated risks must be carried out. We have set out eight good practice principles and 15 related benchmarks which provide a framework both to ensure that adequate and sufficient information is obtained and that a broad assessment can be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/3">Secondly, the recipient government must have a credible programme to improve public financial management and if necessary to incorporate temporary safeguards to mitigate identified risks. The decision to provide direct budget support is made where the potential development benefits justify the risk involved. DFID's policy in this area is clearly identified in the published document &quot;Managing Fiduciary Risk When Providing Budget Support&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/4">DFID is working with other development agencies and international financial institutions to harmonise approaches to fiduciary risk management, thereby limiting the burden placed on governments to meet the requirements of different donors and lenders. This includes harmonisation of donor assessment procedures.</p>

In spite of difficulties resulting from the security situation in Iraq, there is no humanitarian crisis in the country. Significant progress has been made since the end of the conflict in restoring essential services, maintaining the Public Distribution System for food rations, reopening hospitals and schools, and beginning the process of longer term reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.0/2">US$33 billion in grants and soft loans was pledged for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid Donors' Conference in October, including over US$18 billion from the USA.

	<p pid=".618W.0/1">Local authorities have a power under s135 of the Transport Act 2000 to require local bus operators to provide through ticketing. The Bus Partnership Forum, which I chair, has produced four templates intended for use as model ticketing schemes, including one that provides an example of a through-ticketing scheme involving different companies. We are placing the templates on the Department for Transport's website (under &quot;Local Transport&quot;), and I encourage all local transport authorities and bus operators to take advantage of these resources.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.0/1">The trawl used for scientific surveys of bottom living fish in the North Sea is the GOV trawl ('Grande Ouverture Verticale'). This general purpose bottom trawl has a high headline of five to six metres, and is used where the target species are a mix of commercial whitefish such as cod, haddock, whiting, pout and saithe. The net also samples shoaling or pelagic species including herring and mackerel. Design, specification and operation of the GOV trawl are all agreed internationally and co-ordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. The standard towing speed is four knots over the sea bed.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.6/1">Yes. Commercial gear is rigged by individual skippers to suit local conditions and to maximise the catch of target species. It is regularly modified to follow the changes in the technical conservation legislation, and is frequently adjusted to improve catchability. Survey gear is chosen to fish both a wide range of species and a wide range of sizes including juvenile fish. It is maintained and operated to an internationally agreed specification without modification over time, so that the results of different national surveys can be combined. True comparisons can thus be made from year to year unaffected by technical changes.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.2/4" class="indent">Since 2002 the Office for National Statistics Micro-data Release Panel has implemented revisions to procedures for releasing all micro-data held by ONS.

	<p pid=".636W.2/5" class="indent">New Earnings Survey (NES) micro-data up to 2003, the latest year for which data are available, have been released to other government departments. NES micro-data are available for statistical research purposes through the ONS &quot;virtual data-lab&quot;, which provides access to micro-datasets on ONS premises under controlled access conditions, in line with the Code of Practice and protocols. A longitudinal NES dataset used by some academic and government researchers was suspended from 2001 when I initiated a review of the access contracts and methods.

Information about this service is available from the UKDA web-site: <a href="http://www.data-archive.ac.uk">www.data-archive.ac.uk</a>. Access requests by government and academic researchers to confidential (non-anonymised) copies of LFS micro-data are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Micro-data Release Panel.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.2/7" class="indent">Any research studies carried out by ONS using regression analysis of either NES or LFS earnings data would usually be published if of significance, and of publishable standard. No specific work on the sensitivity of regression results exists for publication, or has been prepared for other reasons. In general, micro-data access is a well recognised statistical service, and all researchers have access to more statistical records than in most countries in Europe.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.2/1">The proceeds from the sale of part of the United Kingdom's gold holdings between 6 July 1999 and 6 March 2002 totalled approximately $3.5 billion. These proceeds were invested in interest-bearing foreign currency assets in broadly the same proportion as currently held in the net foreign currency reserves (40 per cent. dollars; 40 per cent. euros; 20 per cent. yen). The gold sales reduced risk by around 30 per cent. (as measured by value-at-risk) and are not expected to deliver a loss in return when measured over the medium to long-term, the appropriate time horizon for such a decision.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.2/2">The United Kingdom has been at the forefront internationally in promoting openness and transparency in reserves data. Details, including currency composition, are available from the Bank of England's website: <a href="http://www.bankofenqland.co.uk">www.bankofenqland.co.uk</a>. The investment policy for the reserves is also outlined in the Exchange Equalisation Account Financial Accounts, most recently published on 1 December 2003 for financial year 2002&ndash;03. We do not provide market-sensitive information, however, about individual assets within the reserves portfolio.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.2/1">Officials are in regular discussions with other countries on these matters. Tax stamps have been introduced in 40 different countries for a variety of reasons ranging from quality assurance to tackling fraud. Of eight European Union and accession countries where direct inquiries have been made, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic have no plans to withdraw their schemes. Greece have withdrawn their 'quality' marker stamp and Belgium decided after consideration not to introduce tax stamps. Additionally, we are aware that the USA withdrew their tax stamps in 1985 when the 1954 law governing marks on spirits was repealed. The variety of reasons for introduction and withdrawal of tax stamp schemes highlight that direct comparisons between different countries' excise regimes cannot be easily drawn.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.8/1">The EU Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) should be introduced by July 2009 and should reinforce the Government's strategy to tackle alcohol duty fraud. It will allow member states to monitor, in real time, the despatch and receipt of movements of alcohol, as well as tobacco and certain fuel products, between tax warehouses located in different member states. EMCS will be an improvement on the current paper-based system of Accompanying Administrative Documents. However, tax stamps are still likely to have a useful role to play in the detection of smuggled and diverted products after the full implementation of EMCS.</p>

	<p pid=".643W.0/1">The Department of Trade and Industry and its agencies have reorganised their grading structures since 1997. This makes drawing direct comparison between current grades and those in 1997 very difficult.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.5/1">Since coming to office, the Government have taken a number of steps to improve SMEs' ability to access investment capital. These include the development of Regional Venture Capital Funds, the UK High Technology Fund, Early Growth Funds, The Community Development Venture Fund (known as the Bridges Fund), Community Investment Tax Relief and Investment Readiness demonstration projects. We are currently also developing Enterprise Capital Funds following the 'Bridging the Finance Gap' consultation announced in Budget 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/2">In addition, the changes proposed by the Chancellor in his pre-Budget report to enhance the already effective Venture Capital Trust and Enterprise Investment Scheme tax incentives will further improve the availability of investment capital.</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/3">The Government have provided, and continue to provide, a system for practical help and advice to small businesses via Business Link, providing easy access to objective information and support across a wide range of initiatives and financial packages. Business Link provides help and advice for those wishing to start a small business or who are already in a small business. Full details are available on the website (<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www. businesslink.gov.uk</a>)</p>
	<p pid=".650W.5/4">Recently, the Government have taken action to support small business via a wide range of initiatives, as outlined in &quot;The Government Action Plan for Small Business&quot; published on 8 January 2004 and available on the Small Business Service website (<a href="http://www.sbs.gov.uk">www.sbs.gov.uk</a>). It provides a comprehensive account of the significant Government help being made available to small businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.2/13" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".651W.2/14">1. We have interpreted the question as being about how much the small business service costs to run (&pound;18 million in 2002&ndash;03), rather than the cost of the programmes it delivers (outturn &pound;354 million in 2002&ndash;03).</p>
	<p pid=".651W.2/15">2. The total cost of running the SBS reported in the accounts includes not only the administration budget from DTI (outturn &pound;11.5 million in 2002&ndash;03) which covers staff in London and Sheffield, and Directors for the regions, but also the cost of the regional teams, SBS's share of DTI central services and accommodation costs.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.2/16">3. The leap in administration costs from 2001&ndash;02 (&pound;13 million) to 2002&ndash;03 (&pound;18 million) is due to the transfer of 94 staff (full-time equivalents) from Government Offices to SBS regional teams, and to a rise in accommodation costs.</p>

	<p pid=".653W.3/1">The hon. Lady will be aware that the broader EU VAT review has currently reached an impasse following the rejection by the Council of Ministers of the proposals brought forward by the Commission last summer. The EU Presidency has now changed and the matter has yet to be formally brought forward for further discussion. The impending elections to the EU Parliament and the likely changes resulting from the appointment of the new Commission later this year may further delay resolution or even consideration of the EU VAT review.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.3/2">Meanwhile, the Church VAT Group was delighted that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme has been extended to March 2006. The Group remains in touch with officials at HM Treasury and we know that the Government are committed to achieving the aim of a VAT reduction in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".656W.0/2">The independent evaluation of EMA began in September 1999 and assesses the impact of EMA among EMA-eligible young people in 10 of the first 15 pilot areas compared to 11 control areas. This evaluation estimated the impact nationally will be around 4.1 percentage points among the full cohort of young people.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.0/3">Liverpool LEA began piloting EMA in September 2000 and is not formally part of the statistical evaluation. Therefore we do not have statistically reliable information on the exact impact of EMA in Liverpool. We do, however, collect information to assess participation by 16 and 17 year olds by LEA area. This data, which is available on the DfES website and includes information on the numbers of young people accepted for EMA, is replicated in the following table. Although we cannot say that EMA is the only factor causing the increase in participation, it must be a significant contributor to this effect.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.2/2">Edexcel, who award the BTEC Higher National Diploma, have announced plans to make BTEC Foundation Degrees available. Colleges and universities currently offering HNDs will make decisions about whether they retain their HND provision, develop their own Foundation Degrees, or move to new BTEC Foundation Degrees. In doing so, they will take account of student and employer demand.</p>

	<p pid=".671W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 26 January 2004</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/2">We are committed to raising the skill levels of adults in the workforce, and in particular, supporting adults with no, or low qualifications to gain qualifications that give them the foundation skills for employability.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/3">The Skills Strategy White Paper, &quot;21st Century Skills Realising Our Potential&quot;, published in July last year, set out a number of key measures to address this issue. And we have already put in place support for adults with basic skill needs through our Skills for Life Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/4">The White Paper announced the introduction of a new entitlement to free learning for all those studying for their first full level 2 qualification as foundation for employability. We have begun to pilot the introduction of a new adult learning grant of up to &pound;30 a week for full time learners studying for their first NVQ Level 2 qualification or equivalent.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/5">We have also put in place a strategy to ensure that low-skilled adults receive high quality information, advice and guidance to help them choose the right course for them.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/6">We are running 12 Employer Training Pilots, of which two are in the West Midlands, to encourage employers to invest in skills and qualifications, particularly for low skilled trainees. They are testing out a package of financial support measures to improve access to training and enable employees to develop basic skills and NVQ level 2 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/7">In the West Midlands, six professional development centres have been established as a result of partnerships between the local LSCs and the Universities of Wolverhampton, Warwick, Worcestershire and Staffordshire. These are aimed at providing support and opportunities for all those working across the spectrum of Skills for Life delivery&mdash;teachers, voluntary sector workers and those working in Adult and Community Learning.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/8">We are working nationally to engage employers in activity to address the basic skills needs of their employees. This includes raising demand in the workplace and ensuring that appropriate advice and guidance is available to employers to help them establish the learning programmes they require for their employees. In the West Midlands, we have established a group of employer champions who will push the message that basic skills are important to other employers.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.8/9">Advantage West Midlands has responded to our invitation to RDAs and their regional partners to draw up proposals for Regional Skills Partnerships. The Partnerships aim to ensure that the work of different agencies involved in delivering the aims of the Skills Strategy&mdash;the Learning and Skills Councils, Jobcentre Plus, the Skills for Business network, the Small Business Service and others&mdash;are better co-ordinated and delivered in a way that connects with the needs of employers at individual and regional, local and sectoral levels. We will be talking to Advantage West Midlands about their proposal and their plans to set up the Partnership in the West Midlands in April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.5/1">As a result of agreed pay protection arrangements, none of the national health service staff in the 12 'early implementer' sites will have had a reduction in pay as a result of the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; pay modernisation programme, nor will any other NHS staff receive a reduction in pay after implementation of the proposed new pay system. Where, in a minority of cases, staff need to have their pay protected, there will be a review of their skills, knowledge and role as soon as possible during the period of protection. This will be used to assess whether they can be re-assigned to a more highly weighted job or offered development and training to fit them for a more highly weighted job. This is designed to keep to an absolute minimum the number of staff, if any, who are still covered by the protection arrangements immediately before those expire in April 2011.</p>

NICE is also planning to publish a clinical guideline for the diagnosis, management and treatment in July 2004 which will be available to the NHS to support improvements in services. Additionally, implementation of the clinical quality standards of the new general medical services contract from April 2004 will help improve the management of epilepsy in primary care. We are also developing the national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions which will focus on improving the standard of neurology services across England for conditions such as epilepsy.

	<p pid=".684W.8/1">Under the new general medical services contract, which is to be introduced from April 2004, general practitioners (GPs) will be able to opt-out completely from responsibility for care during the out-of-hours period and it will become a responsibility of the local primary care trust (PCT) who are working with local practices to establish how many intend to exercise this option. We expect that a large majority will exercise this right to opt out of responsibility for arranging out of hours services.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/2">Many GPs will still participate in the delivery of out-of-hours services organised under the auspices of the PCT. Patients will therefore continue to have access to a GP if their condition requires the attention of a doctor.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/3">These changes provide a challenge for PCTs, but they also provide an opportunity for PCTs to review and reconfigure the provision of out-of-hours services across their area and to co-ordinate this with other services including accident and emergency, social care and in-hours services such as national health service walk-in centres.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.5/1">On 21 January 2004, I wrote to all right hon. and hon. Members describing the current position as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/2">Mobile phone technology and health issues have hit the headlines again following the publication of a scientific review by the National Radiological Protection Board's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR). News headlines about such issues tend to raise the levels of people's concern and you may well receive inquiries about mobile phones or mobile phone base stations. I am glad to say that the report confirms the conclusions of the Stewart Report and there is no new evidence suggesting that mobile phone use is likely to cause ill health in the general population. In the words of AGNIR's carefully considered report:</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;The weight of evidence now available does not suggest that there are adverse health effects from exposures to RF fields below guideline levels, but the published research on RF exposures and health has limitations, and mobile phones have only been in widespread use for a relatively short time. The possibility therefore remains open that there could be health effects from exposure to RF fields below guideline levels; hence continued research is needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/4">The rapid expansion of mobile phone telecommunications has brought with it huge benefits to individuals and the business community. Government are however taking seriously the concerns that people have that there might be health effects resulting from exposure to radiofrequency signals from this technology. It is for this reason that the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP) was set up under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/5">Sir William's expert group published its report on Mobile Phones and Health in May 2000 and it can be read in full on the website (<a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk">www.iegmp.org.uk</a>). The overall conclusion was that</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/6" class="indent">&quot;the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures to RF (radiofrequency) radiation below guidelines do not cause health effects to the general population.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/7">They went on to say that the emerging new technology should be accompanied by appropriate research and that a further review of the evidence for potential health effects should be reviewed in three years or earlier if circumstances demand it. These were just two of the 30 or so Stewart recommendations that have subsequently been acted upon by Government Departments or by the appropriate agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/8">The siting of base stations was identified by the Stewart group as an issue of some concern. When they examined all the scientific evidence they concluded that</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/9" class="indent">&quot;there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/10">About 300 measurements undertaken by the Radiocommunications Agency (RA), now part of Ofcom, have confirmed that public exposures are very much lower than the widely accepted guidelines published by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This information is available on the websites of these organisations: <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a> and www.icnirp.de.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/11">Although the Stewart Group did not identify any adverse health effects caused by exposures by mobile phones or base stations they were aware that if people are unduly concerned about potential exposures then that in itself may affect their well-being. They made a number of recommendations, therefore, designed to provide more information about mobile phones and base stations. The Department of Health has produced a pair of leaflets and these can be seen on the Department's website <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones">www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones</a>. A description of work undertaken by various organisations since the Stewart Report has been written by Dr. John W. Stather of the NRPB entitled &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&mdash;an Update&quot;. This article was published on the NRPB website <a href="http://www.nrpb.org/publications/bulletin/no3/article3.htm">http://www.nrpb.org/publications/bulletin/no3/article3.htm</a>) in March 2003 and provides more detailed information on the issues.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/12">The sites of base stations in this country are now shown on the Sitefinder location of the Ofcom website <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>. Planning arrangements have been improved and a &quot;Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development&quot; has been developed with the aim of providing for more discussions between operators, local authorities and members of the public. The booklet and current planning arrangements (PPG8&mdash;Policy Planning Guidance on Telecommunications) can be found on the ODPM website <a href="http://www.planning.odpm.gov.uk">www.planning.odpm. gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/13">Over the last few years a number of groups have assessed the possible health effects of exposure to RF radiation such as from mobile phones and mobile phone masts. These include reports from Canada (1999), the Netherlands (2000), France (2001, 2003) and the British Medical Association (2001). These groups have come to broadly similar conclusions to the Stewart Report and have recommended further research. The new AGNIR review also supports the Stewart conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/14">Public interest in mobile phone base stations has been quite marked recently and a number of concerted campaigns against mobile phone masts have come to my attention. I am pleased that the AGNIR report has addressed this issue and concluded that</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/15" class="indent">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/16">Having considered research issues, AGNIR has helpfully made a number of specific recommendations that aim to improve the quality and interpretability of future health-related research and current health research programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/17">The Government, in conjunction with industry, are already sponsoring a &pound;7.4 million research programme in this country on a number of important health related issues identified in the Stewart Report. The research is being carried out under the management of an independent Programme Management Committee. The research is mainly concerned with users of mobile phone handsets as recommended in the Stewart Report but has recently decided to extend its range of studies to accommodate concerns about exposures from base stations. Full details of the research studies and the committee membership can be found on the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research website: <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>. This programme represents a significant contribution to a world-wide research effort encompassing the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Union, the United States and others.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.5/18">The Department continues to monitor research largely through the work of National Radiological Protection Board who have a statutory duty to advise on risks from all types of radiation.

Induction Centres provide additional services for the asylum applicant, including health screening, and initiate the consideration of their asylum claim and support needs. Induction Centres provide short-term accommodation, where necessary, prior to dispersal. Accommodation and services are provided in a variety of buildings which are expected to have a low profile in the existing community. Asylum applicants staying in induction centres are not detained and are free to leave their accommodation. Removal centres provide safe and secure accommodation for those who are detained under immigration legislation. No facility acts as both a centre for induction and detention.</p>

Information on the programme can be found in Reporting Centres, Reception Centres and Removals Centres as well as from the Home Office website. Asylum seekers who have been refused asylum are sent an information sheet which gives details of how to return voluntarily. We also hold regular meetings with non-governmental and international organisations including the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, UNHCR and IOM to discuss promotion of voluntary return. The voluntary sector organisations conduct outreach work with community groups directly to advise them of the option of voluntary return. The Home Office hosts meetings with Afghan community groups to raise the profile of voluntary return including the Return to Afghanistan Programme and the recently launched Afghan Explore and Prepare Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.2/1">Information on the total number of asylum seekers currently in the UK, including failed asylum seekers, is not currently available. This could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. Even such an exercise, however, would not produce a valid estimate as some applicants may leave the United Kingdom without informing the Immigration Service.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/2">The Government have commissioned research into the methods used in other countries to estimate the size of the illegal population in order to define methods appropriate for the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/3">The work required is challenging because, by definition, illegal migrants fall outside official statistics and are therefore difficult to measure. People illegally present in the UK are also motivated to ensure they remain hidden, further compounding the difficulties of conducting research.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/4">The number of cases (principal applicants) awaiting initial decision or awaiting appeal determinations continues to fall as the level of applications falls, initial decisions continue to outstrip the number of applications, and record numbers of appeals are determined by the IAA. The latest published figures show that as at the end of September 2003 there were:</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/5" class="indent">29,100 cases awaiting an initial decision (of this total, 8,500 cases were work in progress, i.e. the application had been outstanding for six months or less), the lowest level for a decade;</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/6" class="indent">an estimated 16,000 appeals lodged with the Home Office which had not been sent to the Immigration Appellate Authority (a proportion of appeals lodged do not result in appeal bundles being sent to the IAA); and</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/7" class="indent">28,800 asylum cases work in progress in the IAA (18,100 at the Adjudicator Tier, 5,600 applications for permission to appeal to the Tribunal, and 5,100 Tribunal Appeals).</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/8">Information on asylum applications is published quarterly.

If parents fail to take these opportunities to leave and put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of the children should be protected under the existing child protection legislation that applies to all children. We do not believe that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position. If this were to happen, the costs would be met by central Government.</p>

	<p pid=".704W.8/1">As indicated in its 2003&ndash;08 Corporate and Business Plan, the UK Passport Service is taking forward a range of initiatives to reduce passport fraud through improved fraud detection and prevention. These include:</p>

	<p pid=".704W.8/3" class="indent">The establishment in December 2003 of a new more comprehensive database for the recording and dissemination of lost, stolen and recovered passport information;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/4" class="indent">Exploring the benefits of using private sector and other government databases in establishing identity;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/5" class="indent">Developing the training of passport examiners to an accredited standard to ensure that knowledge and competency are regularly tested;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/6" class="indent">Introducing secure delivery for the despatch of all passports to eliminate thefts and losses in the post;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/7" class="indent">Increasing the professionalism of its fraud investigation capability through the creation of fraud and intelligence units in each of its offices, and strengthening training and support for these units;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/8" class="indent">Developing its IT systems to undertake more automatic checks; to better link passport records to an individual; and to identify passport fraud;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/9" class="indent">Developing the use of facial recognition biometrics to check new applications against images of known fraudsters and to implement more secure passports incorporating biometric identifiers;</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/10" class="indent">Changing the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and making these offences arrestable; and by creating a new offence relating to being in possession or control of false identity documents, without reasonable cause; and</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/11" class="indent">Actively working with law enforcement agencies to apprehend, disrupt and dismantle the activities of those involved in passport fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/12">These initiatives build on the successful implementation of a number of anti-fraud measures including the strengthening of the counter signatory requirement for passport applications and the prevention of fraudulent applications using the identity of dead children.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.8/13">In the context of the latter initiative the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) have used data provided by the office of National Statistics to stop 408 passport applications in the identities of dead children and have identified over 1000 cases in which this route was used to obtain passports fraudulently in the past. In all more than 120 people have been arrested as a result of this work and the details of the remainder have been circulated to law enforcement agencies at home and abroad.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.0/1">The new clause brought forward by way of Government amendment to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill will allow an Immigration Officer to require a carrier (UK or overseas based) to provide either a full or partial copy of any document relating to a passenger and containing information about that passenger. A carrier would only have to provide copies of documents on written request. This will help deal with the significant number of asylum seekers who deliberately destroy their travel documents.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.0/2">Consultation with carriers began on 27 October 2003 and continues through correspondence and meetings. The Home Office has received a range of cost estimates from a number of carriers. There are currently joint discussions over the practical details of a trial to provide a more precise estimate of the costs involved and to test the process.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.0/3">This power will not be implemented unless the trial has demonstrated that this is practical and cost-effective. This power would not be applied universally but would be deployed on selected routes as and when there was a problem with undocumented arrivals. The power will be capable of being invoked in respect of any ship or aircraft which has arrived/is expected to arrive in the UK or which has departed/is expected to depart from the UK, regardless of which port that ship or aircraft arrived/will arrive at or will depart/has departed from. It is, therefore, not necessary to designate or list departure points for the purposes of the use of the power.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.0/4">The proposal is for the criminal offence in section 27(b) (iv) of the Immigration Act 1971 to apply in respect of the new power. The offence in section 27(b) (iv) of the Immigration Act 1971 is not committed if the carrier has a &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; for failing to comply with the request. This means that it would be a criminal offence, punishable on summary conviction with a fine of not more than level five on the standard scale or with a maximum of six months imprisonment, or with both, for a carrier to fail to comply with a request to copy documents, without reasonable excuse. It is anticipated that a carrier would decline to carry any passenger who refused to allow their document to be carried.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.0/5">The Home Office will be responsible for the retention and disposal of any copies. All data processed would be done so in compliance with the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. The Act imposes a number of obligations on a data controller, one of which pertains to the retention and disposal of data.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.0/6">Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes will not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.0/7">Foreign governments will be approached only when a need for the power at a specific location has been identified.</p>

MAPPA provides a framework within which different agencies work together to manage the risks posed by these offenders, including those arising from the absence of stable accommodation. The resettlement of sex offenders posing a serious risk of harm to the public is jointly managed by the police and the National Probation Service within these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.8/3">Provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will formalise this multi-agency engagement by imposing a duty to co-operate with the MAPPA on a number of agencies, including local housing authorities and relevant registered social landlords.</p>

The management of juveniles, under 18 years of age, is now the responsibility of the Youth Justice Board. An outline planning application for a site for a new Secure Training Centre (STC) in Wales primarily for vulnerable Welsh juveniles was approved in December 2003. This is subject to final decisions to proceed with the project.</p>

	<p pid=".710W.8/1">Under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 when an offender makes his initial notification, the police may take his photograph and/or his fingerprints to verify the identity of the person making the notification.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.8/2">The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which re-enacts the 1997 Act with substantial amendments, will allow the police to take photographs of any part of an offender at any notification. This would include a notification by the offender of a change to his details and his annual notification. The definition of photograph is wide enough to include the use of biometric technologies such as, in the future, iris scanning. The Violent and Sex Offenders Register (ViSOR), currently being developed by the Police and Information Technology Organisation, will have the capacity to store multiple images of individual offenders. These will include facial images and other images such as scars, marks and tattoos. ViSOR, coupled with the new powers in the 2003 Act, will significantly improve the ability of the police to establish the identity of offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.8/3">The Police and Information Technology Organisation is actively monitoring developments in biometric technology and are associated with a number of research projects focused on the identification of individuals for law enforcement purposes. The Home Office funded a study by the National Physical Laboratory on the use of iris, fingerprint and face biometrics in identity card schemes. The results of this study are on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.8/4">Currently, the verification of the identity of individuals against their criminal record is achieved using fingerprints via the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS). The replacement contract for NAFIS is currently under negotiation and it is anticipated that the system architecture will provide a flexible platform to allow other biometric capabilities to be integrated should they be required.</p>

	<p pid=".717W.0/1">Most provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) have been implemented in Northern Ireland. The final provisions of part III of the DDA concerning the rights of access to goods, facilities, services and premises will be implemented in October 2004 when service providers may have to make 'reasonable adjustments' in relation to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.</p>
	<p pid=".717W.0/2">Part V of the DDA allows for accessibility standards to be set for public transport. Beginning in March/April 2004, the Department of the Environment expects to consult on proposals to implement the UK Government's commitment on making (public hire) taxis accessible to disabled people. Draft measures will have regard to taxi accessibility proposals announced for England and Wales in October 2003 and will form part of a wide range of measures to reform taxi regulation emerging from the on-going NI Review of Taxi Regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".717W.0/3">Under section 37 of DDA, the Department of the Environment introduced regulations on 1 August 2001 imposing on licensed drivers of public hire taxis a duty to carry without charge a guide dog, hearing dog or other prescribed category of dog when it accompanies the hirer. The provision also provides that such a driver may be exempted from this obligation on medical grounds. It is the Department's intention to extend similar provisions under section 37A to licensed drivers of private hire vehicles in mid 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".717W.0/4">The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations (NI) 2003 came into operation on 30 April 2003. The regulations are intended to ensure that disabled people can get on and off buses and coaches in safety and without unreasonable difficulty, and in the case of wheelchair users, can do so while remaining in their wheelchairs. They are also intended to ensure that disabled people are carried in these vehicles in safety and in reasonable comfort e.g., they provide for wheelchair spaces, boarding lifts and ramps, suitable entrances and exits, handrails and kneeling systems.</p>
	<p pid=".717W.0/5">The Department for Regional Development made Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (Northern Ireland) on 2 July 2001. All new trains, including the 23 currently being built for Northern Ireland Railways, must comply with these regulations</p>

	<p pid=".719W.0/1">The Department of Education is currently working with the Education and Library Boards and other school authorities to update the information held on the number of temporary classrooms in the school estate. This information will be supplied to you when the results of the survey are available.</p>
	<p pid=".719W.0/2">There is no average replacement time forecast for temporary accommodation. It is replaced based on the educational need and the resources available. Through the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative, &pound;15 million was made available over the past two years specifically to remove temporary classrooms from 52 schools. Over the next two years, a further &pound;16 million will be made available for this purpose. In addition, over the past four years major capital projects totalling some &pound;650 million have been announced and this investment will also contribute to further reductions in temporary accommodation as these schemes come to fruition in the coming years.</p>

	<p pid=".724W.0/1">The Department of Education does not collect information about the number of pupils who move schools as a result of bullying. Parents move their children from one school to another for a variety of reasons, which may include alleged bullying. However, there is no requirement for parents to advise any statutory agency of the reasons for the move. The Department recognises that bullying in whatever form and for whatever reason, have no place in schools. The Department has issued comprehensive guidance to all schools about how to tackle bullying. Further, the Education and Libraries (NI) Order 2003, which came into operation on 1 April 2003, places a duty on all grant-aided schools to have an anti-bullying policy and to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.</p>

	<p pid=".727W.5/1">My Department, in conjunction with other criminal justice agencies, is actively addressing the problems of ineffective and cracked trials. The CJS PSA2 seeks to bring 1.2 million offenders to justice by 2006 and to reduce the proportion of ineffective trials. My Department aims to cut the ineffective rate in the crown court from 24 per cent. to 17 per cent. and in the magistrates court from 31 per cent. to 23 per cent. To monitor progress, interim targets have been set for April 2004 of 20.4 per cent. in crown court and 26.5 per cent. in the magistrates court. Following changes to a more victim and witness focused listing system with greater emphasis on trials being effective, over-listing in the crown court has reduced and the ineffective rate has reduced to 19.7 per cent. over the last quarter. Progress in the magistrates court has been slower, which reflects the more diverse nature of the business, but is now achieving a rate of 28.8 per cent. New targets to lower the rate further in 2004&ndash;05 are currently being agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.5/2">My Department is working with the Home Office, the CPS and the judiciary to address the problems of cracked trials in a number of ways. The most important of these is the tri-lateral Effective Trial Management Programme, which will introduce a Criminal Case Management Framework, which clearly sets out the procedure to be followed in each type of case. This framework will be supported by a new soon to be established Criminal Procedure Rule Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.5/3">There will also be provision for judges and magistrates to give an early indication of sentence. These measures, coupled with the CPS taking responsibility for charging and the work being done to support witnesses, will reduce the number of cracked trials and those where the prosecution ends the case or offers no evidence. My Department has an effective performance management system in place which will ensure that the proportion of cracked and ineffective trials will reduce and is currently appointing Case Progression Officers to each area to work closely with other agencies to ensure greater certainty that cases listed proceed as planned.</p>

The provision of our training courses is targeted at those who will benefit the most from them.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.2/2">Eligibility for these programmes, and specifically the period of time people are required to be unemployed before becoming eligible, depends on the particular circumstances of each individual customer. People known to face particular disadvantage in the labour market may be exempt from an unemployment qualifying period, and can join Jobcentre Plus programmes from day one of their unemployment. These can include: disabled people, lone parents and people with basic skills needs.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.3/1">Private homes owned by Her Majesty's forces will qualify for council tax discounts in the same way as private homes owned by anyone else. For example, there will be a 25 per cent. discount if it is the taxpayer's sole or main residence and the taxpayer lives by themselves, or if they share with a full time student. If the taxpayer has two private homes, the second home will be subject to a discount. The amount of that discount can be anything from 10 per cent. to 50 per cent., depending on whether the billing authority has passed a resolution to reduce the statutory discount of 50 per cent. The power to reduce that discount came into force on 18 December 2003 for the financial year 2004&ndash;05 onwards. In addition, billing authorities now have the power to reduce the amount of council tax which a person is liable to pay in respect of a dwelling. Billing authorities therefore have discretion in effect to grant additional local discounts.</p>

	<p pid=".744W.3/1">The Government's plans for the Thames Gateway region, including south Essex, are set out in Creating Sustainable Communities: Making It Happen in the Thames Gateway and Growth Areas, published on 30 July 2003. That document makes it clear that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be establishing a Gateway delivery office to work alongside local, regional and national partners to turn strategic plans into operational programmes. The Gateway office will be responsible for monitoring implementation of the Government's plans and for communicating progress. It is anticipated that the office will be up and running shortly.</p>

Each soldier requires one pair of plates. Combat Body Armour or Enhanced Combat Body Armour is not usually issued as a complete set.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.9/3">Instead, units request the number of components (covers, fillers and individual plates) required to make up the sets that they need. Current estimates of the issue history of ceramic plates since their introduction into service show an average of approximately 4,000 issues a year up to 1999 when nearly 23,000 were issued. Most recently in 2003 more than 80,000 individual ceramic plates were issued.</p>

	<p pid=".746W.6/1">To date eight military vehicles have been identified as having been hit by depleted uranium (DU) munitions within the southern sector of Iraq under British military control. All these vehicles have been clearly marked. Arrangements are currently being negotiated with the US for a contractor to collect and securely store these military vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".746W.6/2">Generic assessments of the potential risks from DU munitions have been carried out by organisations such as the Royal Society and the United Nations Environment Programme and are available on the world wide web at: <a href="http://www.postconflict.unep.ch/">www.postconflict.unep.ch/</a> and <a href="http://www.royalsociety.ac.uk/du/">www.royalsociety.ac.uk/du/</a> The levels of DU contamination found by MOD personnel are much lower than those predicted from these theoretical risk assessments.</p>

This includes details of membership, whether or not the positions are remunerated and what the current expiry date is for each appointment. Appointments are usually made for a period of three or five years, depending on the body concerned, with the potential for reappointments up to 10 years. Members can serve longer if there are exceptional circumstances, however, extensions beyond the 10 year point have to be agreed by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>

These board members do not have standard terms and, given that they are not public appointments, no expiry date need be placed on their membership of the board.</p>
