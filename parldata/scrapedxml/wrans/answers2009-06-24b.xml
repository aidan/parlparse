	<p pid="b.894W.0/1">Since their introduction in the 1998 comprehensive spending review (CSR), public service agreements (PSAs) have played a vital role in galvanising public service delivery and driving major improvements in outcomes. Department's performance in the previous spending review period is always taken into consideration in any new spending review. The Prime Minister's delivery unit was established in 2001, and while delivery of PSAs is ultimately the responsibility of individual Departments PMDU and HM Treasury work closely to support Departments to ensure delivery against these challenging commitments. Currently 70 per cent. of SR02 PSAs are assessed as met, met-ongoing or partly met, while 56 per cent. of SR04 PSAs are assessed as met, ahead or on course.</p>

The Treasury, using an order under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, transferred KSF's deposit book of &quot;Kaupthing Edge&quot; accounts to ING Direct. The Government also committed to paying out in full FSCS eligible depositors whose accounts were not transferred.</p>

The administrators are responsible for managing the remainder of KSF's business and loan book to maximise recovery for creditors. The administrators will continue to deal with the assets in compliance with insolvency law and the provisions of the transfer order (including those provisions of the transfer order which confer certain limited functions on the Treasury in relation to the assets of KSF). Those depositors that are ineligible for FSCS compensation will be creditors of the bank in the normal way and paid out in accordance with UK insolvency procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.0/1">The Department for Transport has received some 130 letters about the carriage of oxygen. European Regulation 1107/2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air does not impose specific obligations on airlines to carry or provide oxygen in the cabin. Where air carriers do supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, it is possible to make a charge for this service. However, many airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet and Flybe allow passengers to use their own oxygen and their own Portable Oxygen Concentrator free of charge. It is important that passengers know airlines' charging policies before choosing which carrier to fly with.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.3/1">Aerodromes are expected to consider the environmental impact of their operations and apply measures designed to minimise the noise impact on the local population. To assist aerodromes in this task, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has published best practice guidance on noise considerations at general aviation aerodromes which is available on their website. This guidance also serves to provide members of the public with an explanation of the constraints and factors that must be considered by aerodrome operators when deciding on the noise mitigation measures that could be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.3/2">In the UK, aircraft are required to comply with the Aircraft Noise standards recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and published in annex 16 to the Chicago Convention (annex 16, volume 1). The certification requirements place a maximum decibel limit on the noise level that an aircraft may produce, and are specific to the aircraft type concerned. The requirements do not specify how those noise limits should be met, e.g. through the use of silencers.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.3/3">The Department for Transport has not had any recent discussions with the CAA about the fitting of silencers to light aircraft. The effective management of aircraft noise includes a number of elements, including action to address noise at source. While it is possible to fit silencers to some light aircraft, this can have an effect on engine power and consequently aircraft performance. The CAA must take these factors into account on a case by case basis when considering whether the installation of silencers on different types of light aircraft.</p>

This is because the Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not hold data for the population eligible to vote in parliamentary elections, which includes British citizens resident overseas and excludes foreign citizens (from outside the British Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland) resident within England and Wales. Indeed, there is no central database that holds this information.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.2/2">The ONS state that the closest available approximation to the number of people registered to vote in the 2009 European election is 45,226,650.

That was the most recent date for which data on the electorate are collated. The cut off date for registration, as enacted by the Electoral Administration Act 2006 is 11 days before the poll, so the actual number of people registered to vote in the 2009 European election may be different from this figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.2/3">ONS figures show that the number of people who were registered to vote in the UK parliamentary elections for Westminster on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase> was 44,180,464. This figure is based on a qualifying date of <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-15">15 October 2004</phrase> and is the closest available approximation to the number of people who were registered to vote in the 2005 general election when registration closed some six to eight weeks before the poll.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.2/1">In early 2008, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) commissioned site search agents to identify potential sites for &quot;Titan&quot; prisons in various parts of the country, including the North West.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.2/2">Among the sites identified in the North-West was a 200 acre golf course at Southport Road, Scarisbrick, L40 8HB. This site was identified on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May 2008</phrase> by our site search agents but was considered unsuitable by them, an assessment that was subsequently endorsed by NOMS on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May 2008</phrase>. The reason for this was that a golf course in a rural location did not meet the specific requirement for a site close to an urban conurbation with good transport links.</p>

The total cost of sickness absence for South Yorkshire Probation Service, including on costs, for 2008-09 was &pound;1,026,760. In order to address this South Yorkshire Probation Service have launched a sickness absence action plan which has made a significant impact on the incidence of sickness absence.

	<p pid="b.929W.2/2">The Department has policy responsibility for school attendance. However, the Ministry of Justice collects and publishes data for England and Wales on prosecutions brought against parents under the Education Act 1996 for the offence under s444(1) of failing to secure their child's regular attendance at school; and for prosecutions under s444(1A), the aggravated offence of knowing that their child is failing to attend school regularly. It is possible, because of the way courts record data, that some section 444 data is also collected under the more general heading of various offences under the Education Act 1996.</p>

Information on the number of parents prosecuted in Essex for failing to secure their children's regular school attendance between 2006 to 2007 (latest available data) is detailed in the table below.

Figures for 2009 are not yet available. The figures provided are based on volumes of production and trade. The figures are affected by market conditions in the UK and abroad. Factors affecting market conditions include exchange rates, animal disease and consumer demand. When interpreting the figures it is important to look at the trends over time, rather than concentrating on figures for individual years.</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.8/2">For beef and veal and mutton and lamb the percentage has been relatively stable over the whole period. For pig meat the percentage declined from over 60 per cent. in 1997 to just over 40 per cent. in 2003 due to declining domestic production and increased imports, but has also been fairly stable since then.</p>

	<p pid="b.944W.2/1">I assume both these questions refer to a provision in Part A(1) of Section 1.1 of Annex I of the Environmental Permitting Regulations (England and Wales) 2007. This provision refers to burning waste oil, recovered oil or any fuel manufactured from, or comprising, any other waste.

With a view to the adoption of such criteria, the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has carried out preparatory work and has published reports entitled &quot;Study on the selection of waste streams for end-of-waste assessment&quot; and &quot;End-of-waste criteria, methodology and case studies&quot;.

	<p pid="b.952W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/2">The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games are a key priority across Government. The Government Olympic Executive (GOE) was set up within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to oversee the delivery of Government objectives for the Games.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-15">15 June</phrase>, the GOE consisted of 93.7 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff. Of this total, no members of staff are working in roles defined as project management roles, 21.5 are working in roles mainly relating to legacy planning, 14 on roles mainly relating to project oversight, and six on roles mainly relating to financial control/oversight. The remainder of staff work mainly on programme assurance and risk management, staging, strategic communications and parliamentary matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/4">In terms of further specific posts relating to Olympic projects within DCMS, 7.5 FTE staff are employed on Olympic Programme Management, the Cultural Olympiad and in the Press Office. Of these, approximately 3.4 FTE are in roles relating to project management and approximately 1.1 FTE in roles relating to project oversight. The purpose of these posts is to manage the wider DCMS interests in relation to staging the Games such as elite sport, sport participation, tourism and culture. The remaining three FTE staff are full time press officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/5">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-31">31 May 2009</phrase>, the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) employed 245 members of staff. This consists of permanent staff, fixed term contract staff, and secondments. Contained within the fixed term contract staff category there are a number of graduates that have been recruited for a 10 month placement as part of the ODA's graduate placement scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/6">Of the 245 members of staff employed by the ODA, 136 are currently working in project management roles across a number of ODA teams.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/7">It is not possible to provide a breakdown of those staff that are exclusively working on legacy planning roles as every project within the programme is considered with legacy in mind ensuring that legacy requirements are incorporated into design briefs, specifications and business plans. This approach is designed to ensure that the London 2012 Games will be the catalyst for the regeneration of one of the most underdeveloped areas of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/8">The ODA currently has nine members of staff with overall project oversight responsibilities, and 19 employees who work closely with its Delivery Partner on the financial oversight of the programme. In addition the ODA has engaged Ernst and Young to provide an Internal Audit service.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/9">The ODA expect overall staffing levels within the organisation to reduce over time as construction progresses on the big five venues for the London 2012 Games although in the transportation area staffing levels will increase as we move closer to Games operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/10">Information relating to DCMS's other non-departmental public bodies who are working on projects relating to the London 2012 Olympics could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/11">Future staffing levels in the GOE will remain under review, within the overall budgetary settlement agreed with HM Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="b.956W.0/2">Tourism is the United Kingdom's fifth largest industry. It contributes over &pound;86 billion a year to the national economy and supports, both directly and indirectly, over 2.7 million jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.0/3">However, the number of overseas visitors to these shores has fallen this year compared with previous ones. But outbound visits by UK residents have also fallen, and these were 6 per cent. lower in January to February 2009 than they were in the same period last year. This offers a potentially good prospect for domestic tourism at a time when current projections show employment in the tourism and hospitality industry will grow by almost 10 per cent. by 2017, creating over 200,000 additional jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.0/4">Other opportunities the industry is well placed to exploit include: favourable currency exchange rates; the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games; the unprecedented number of high level sports events in the UK in the decade between 2009 and 2019; the Cultural Olympiad and, potentially, the UK City of Culture Competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.956W.0/5">These opportunities, combined with the UK's enviable heritage and attractions, mean that the contribution that the tourism industry would make to the UK's economic recovery could be considerable.</p>

	<p pid="b.970W.0/1">The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is the foundation for future peace and stability across Sudan. With only two years before the end of the interim period, we remain concerned at the number of outstanding CPA issues, including preparations for elections and referenda. We welcome the CPA conference in Washington on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-23">23 June 2009</phrase> which will bring together both North and South and the international community to tackle these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.0/2">We welcome the National Election Commission's plans for elections in February 2010, although we are concerned that preparations are behind schedule. There are major challenges which must be addressed, including ensuring necessary legislation, such as the security and press acts, is appropriate. The UK will be providing significant assistance and we are working with the Sudanese and the international community to ensure peaceful and credible elections are held.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.0/3">The UK remains completely committed to fair and credible referenda on self-determination, both for Abyei and the South, as defined in the CPA. The referendum bill is currently being discussed in the Sudanese parliament. We urge both sides to reach agreement quickly on the bill to allow preparations for the referenda to begin.</p>

The leader of the LRA, Joseph Kony, refused to sign the FPA, most recently in November 2008, in the absence of a guarantee of immunity from prosecution at the International Criminal Court. LRA activity in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Southern Sudan, including abductions and attacks on civilians, have continued in the interim.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.6/2">The Governments of Uganda, the DRC and the Government of Southern Sudan began joint military action against the LRA in December 2008. The Government of Uganda has stated that it remains committed to the FPA but is not prepared to re-open negotiation of the terms of the agreement with the LRA. There are no negotiations currently in train.</p>

	<p pid="b.976W.3/1">This Department and the Department for Children, Schools and Families currently fund Apprenticeships for adults and young people in a number of occupations in the automotive industry in England. Apprenticeships will play a key role in our response to the current economic downturn. Earlier in the year my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced a &pound;140 million package to provide an extra 35,000 Apprenticeship places over the coming year in both the public and private sectors to help boost the country's competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.3/2">Last month we announced that businesses across the country with a proven track record of delivering Apprenticeships would share &pound;11 million to create 3,000 new places by employing apprentices over and above the number they already employ. This will help these businesses support smaller companies in their supply chains. Companies benefiting from this funding include: Scania; Daf Trucks; Ford; BMW; Mercedes Benz; and Jaguar Land Rover.</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.3/3">Looking to the future, we have set ambitious targets for the growth of the Apprenticeships programme. Apprenticeships provisions are being taken forward as part of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, including provisions to ensure that an Apprenticeship place is available for all suitably qualified young people by 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.8/1">Students in North Yorkshire and elsewhere have already benefited from the increase in investment for further education of 53 per cent. in real terms since 1997. Recent changes which will affect LSC budgets were announced in Budget 2009. The Budget made available an additional &pound;300 million of further education capital spending and &pound;122 million to support extra training in England for young people who have been unemployed for 12 months. As part of DCSF-funded activity, there will be &pound;655 million to support over 54,000 more young people to take up a guaranteed place at school or college. As part of Budget 2009, the Government committed to delivering an additional &pound;5 billion of efficiency savings in 2010-11. The then Secretary of State for DIUS wrote to the LSC on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May</phrase> setting out expectations on the contribution to those efficiencies from post-19 further education provision. Taking into account these changes, the LSC will see an estimated overall increase in resources for frontline teaching, learning and learner support services for post-19 learners of around &pound;140 million between 2009-10 and 2010-11. We expect learners in North Yorkshire to benefit from these changes. Funding allocations for 2009-10 post-19 provision are currently being finalised and will be completed later this month.</p>

	<p pid="b.981W.2/1">Where local authorities are providers in their own right, they will receive a funding allocation from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to deliver provision in line with funding allocated to all other providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/2">Funding allocations for adult learner responsive (ALR) and employer responsive (ER) provision are calculated according to a national funding formula. This formula calculates funding using the volume of learning that the provider delivers at an agreed national funding rate.

	<p pid="b.981W.2/3">Local authorities deliver the majority of the &pound;210 million that is safeguarded annually for informal adult learning. This learning is not formula-funded, but is commissioned through a negotiated process with each local authority. It is a block grant to deliver an agreed volume of provision. The LSC uses final outturn data returns for previous years and in-year estimate data in order to agree learner numbers to be funded for the following year.</p>

	<p pid="b.981W.5/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) allocates funding to learning providers&mdash;including school sixth forms, FE colleges, independent providers and local authorities&mdash;where those providers are approved to deliver publicly-funded further education and skills for learners aged 16 or over. Funding is allocated in respect of an academic year, but the actual amounts paid will depend on demand from individuals and employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/2">Funding allocations data for all LSC-funded providers are available on the LSC website:</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk/providers/funding-policy/allocations">www.lsc.gov.uk/providers/funding-policy/allocations</a></p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/4">These data show that in 2007/08 academic year, over &pound;410 million was allocated to local authorities; the allocation in 2008/09 was over &pound;370 million. Allocations for 2009/10 are still being finalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.5/5">The majority of the &pound;210 million that is safeguarded annually for informal adult learning is delivered through local authorities, and therefore comprises a significant proportion of their funding allocations (around &pound;200 million a year over 2007/08 and 2008/09 academic years). The rest of the funding they receive supports adult learner responsive provision as well as training in the workplace (Train to Gain and apprenticeships) for both adults and young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.983W.2/1">Due a significant fall in demand, steel prices have dropped sharply from the peaks seen in the summer of 2008. Changes in prices are the natural consequence of market forces and as such it would not be right for the Government to interfere in the market in any way. However, if there was firm evidence that anti-competitive or unfair trade practices were the cause then we would press the European Commission to take action.</p>
	<p pid="b.983W.2/2">Since the start of the year the Government have introduced a range of measures to help increase liquidity and ease credit conditions for small businesses. This is real help that is focused and funded. It is help that has only been made possible due to the fiscal stimulus offered by the Government in the PBR. We have recapitalised the banks, agreed to underwrite more than &pound;20 billion worth of credit lines and lending and tailored a package of bank measures&mdash;including a new &pound;50 billion Bank of England facility for purchasing high quality assets&mdash;to get bad assets out into the daylight and help lending flow again.</p>

	<p pid="b.983W.5/1">Students in Essex and elsewhere have already benefited from the increase in investment for further education of 53 per cent. in real terms since 1997. Recent changes which will affect LSC budgets were announced in Budget 2009. The Budget made available an additional &pound;300 million of further education capital spending and &pound;122 million to support extra training in England for young people who have been unemployed for 12 months. As part of DCSF-funded activity, there will be &pound;655 million to support over 54,000 more young people to take up a guaranteed place at school or college. As part of Budget 2009, the Government committed to delivering an additional &pound;5 billion of efficiency savings in 2010-11. The then Secretary of State for DIUS wrote to the LSC on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May</phrase> setting out expectations on the contribution to those efficiencies from post-19 further education provision. Taking into account these changes, the LSC will see an estimated overall increase in resources for frontline teaching, learning and learner support services for post-19 learners of around &pound;140 million between 2009-10 and 2010-11. We expect students in Essex and the Castle Point area to benefit from this increase. Funding allocations for 2009/10 post-19 provision are currently being finalised and will be completed later this month.</p>

	<p pid="b.988W.2/1">Following a consultation, the Government plan to publish revised statutory guidance about children missing from home or care shortly. This will set out the steps that must be followed whenever any child in care goes missing. This includes the local authority working with partner agencies such as the police, so that there is a systematic response whenever a child in care goes missing from their care placement.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/2">The National Minimum Standards for Children's Homes and Fostering Services require that all homes and fostering services should have explicit procedures to follow when children in their care may be missing or absent. We will be strengthening these Standards later this year and will include more specific guidance on action which should be taken when a child goes missing from a residential or foster home.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/3">The Government have also launched the Young Runaways Action Plan. This brings together cross Government action on children who run away from home or care and places particular emphasis on vulnerable children such as those who have been trafficked. More generally, a national indicator on young runaways, introduced in April this year, now requires LAs to have in place protocols for the inter-agency response to run-aways and missing children, including preventative measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.988W.2/4">The requested information on the number of children who have gone missing from care who have not been found is not held centrally by the Department. It is not possible to derive the number of children missing from care who have never been found, because we can only account for the situation at the end of the last completed data collection year. Children missing at the end of the data year may subsequently return into care. Information on looked after children can be found in &quot;Statistical First Release Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>&quot;, which is available on the Department's website via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="b.993W.2/1">All local authorities in England have a duty to secure sufficient childcare places to meet the requirements of parents in their area in order to enable them to work or undertake education or training leading to work. They must also secure free early years provision for pre-school children of a prescribed age.</p>
	<p pid="b.993W.2/2">The Department publishes information on the part-time equivalent number of free early education places filled by three and four year-olds. This is derived by counting children taking up 12 and a half hours per week as one place, 10 hours per week as 0.8 places, seven and a half hours per week as 0.6 places, five hours per week as 0.4 places and two and a half hours per week as 0.2 places.</p>
	<p pid="b.993W.2/3">The latest information on the number of free early education places filled by three and four year-olds can be found in Table 5 of the Statistical First Release &quot;Provision for Children Under Five Years of Age in England: January 2009&quot;. The latest figures can be found at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.993W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000848/index.shtml">http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000848/index.shtml</a></p>
	<p pid="b.993W.2/5">Information on nursery school places per head of population has not been included. This is because children can access their free entitlement across different local authority areas and therefore part time equivalent places are not on an equivalent basis with the local authority population figures. Population figures at this level of disaggregation are also not as reliable as at the national level.</p>

	<p pid="b.994W.2/1">The PE and sport professional development programme is raising the quality of teaching and learning in PE and sport in schools. As part of the programme, schools are supported in carrying out an audit of their professional development needs in PE and sport. Schools can then choose, free of charge, from a menu of professional development resources designed to address these needs. The programme includes resources aimed specifically at getting young people more active, whatever their circumstances. The recent Ofsted report - &quot;Physical Education in Schools, 2005/08&quot; praised the Professional Development programme for the way it was improving the quality of teaching and learning in PE and sport in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.994W.2/2">As announced in Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: One Year On, the Government are currently exploring the development of a further focus within the PE and Sport Strategy for Young People which specifically helps overweight and obese children to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.</p>

It is a programme that local authorities, third, private and public sector partners and young people work together to plan, deliver and operate financially sustainable projects. As part of the MyPlace assessment process, projects were asked to provide robust plans and commitments for financing ongoing running costs and to ensure long term sustainability.

	<p pid="b.1004W.2/1">The safety and regulation of consumer products, such as personal music players is, within Government, primarily a matter for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. The Department welcomes the report of the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks. The Department, advised by the Health Protection Agency, keeps under review the risks to health which may be attributed to various kinds of noise. The Department has no plans at present for an information campaign on the risks to hearing posed by the use of personal music players.</p>

Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> 2. Primary and secondary diagnoses</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> 3. Codes used to denote measles, mumps or rubella</i><br/> Measles B05.&mdash;Measles<br/> Mumps B26.&mdash;Mumps<br/> Rubella B06.&mdash;Rubella [German measles], P35.0 Congenital rubella syndrome.<br/> If the patient has been admitted for treatment of measles, mumps or rubella, then the code for measles, mumps or rubella would be found in a primary position, except in the following cases:<br/> a. Measles, mumps or rubella complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium; in this case, one of the following codes would precede the code for measles, mumps or rubella:<br/> O35.3 Maternal care for (suspected) damage to fetus from viral disease in mother; and<br/> O98.5 Other viral diseases complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium.<br/> b. In the case where a baby is admitted due to measles, mumps or rubella acquired after birth but within 28 days of birth (perinatal period), a code from the following categories would precede the code for measles, mumps or rubella, which would be in a secondary position:<br/> P35-P39 Infections specific to the perinatal period.<br/> <i> 4. Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> 5. Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in national health service practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> 6. Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1018W.2/1">The purpose of an NHS health check is to identify an individual's risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease, for this risk to be communicated in a way that the individual understands, and for that risk to be managed by appropriate follow-up. These diseases are all linked by a common set of modifiable risk factors. Obesity, physical inactivity, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels all raise the risk of vascular disease. While the NHS health check focuses on reducing these risk factors in order to reduce the risk of vascular disease, health professionals carrying out the checks will of course have the opportunity to identify people who are seriously underweight and will be able to exercise their clinical judgment in referring them for appropriate treatment or intervention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1028W.2/2">The previous Secretary of State for Work and Pensions met with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to discuss ways to ensure the sport and culture industries are able to put together strong bids to the fund and deliver jobs in these industries as early as October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.2/3">Building on this, officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Work and Pensions have been working closely together to ensure the sport and creative industries play a prominent role in the jobs created through the future jobs fund and we expect to receive a number of bids from organisations in these areas when we start assessing bids from July 2009 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.2/4">It is important that we engage with individuals who are approaching long-term unemployment to help them move into fulfilling and valuable employment that will help Britain prepare for economic recovery. The future jobs fund will provide organisations with the funding to do this and make a real contribution to the lives of individuals and their communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1031W.2/1">The Government are committed to giving everyone the support they need to find employment as quickly as possible, whatever their age.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/2">A major factor in the employment of older people is employer behaviour. In addition to providing generic good practice guidance to employers, the UK's Age Positive initiative is working in partnership with business leaders to develop sector-based models of flexible retirement to support the increased employment and retention of older workers and the removal of fixed retirement ages.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/3">Our plans for the future include providing guidance to older workers on their options for working longer, encouraging employers to increase flexible work and phased retirement opportunities, and monitoring the impact of the economic downturn to identify which groups are being most affected and targeting further help where it is most needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/4">On the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>, as part of the Government's response to the economic downturn, the Department for Work and Pensions put in place extra support for newly unemployed customers, including information and advice about the latest job search techniques and coaching on how to make the most of transferable skills. Extra help for those who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months was also introduced, including opportunities to volunteer, support to become self-employed, recruitment subsidies and work-focused training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/5">Since last autumn, the Department has also quadrupled the available funding for the rapid response service, which provides advice and support to customers facing redundancy. It has extended local employment partnerships, the adviser discretion fund and access to work so they are available to customers from the first day of their claim, alongside the support they receive from their Jobcentre Plus personal adviser.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/6">The introduction of the flexible new deal across phase 1 areas from October 2010 will give providers the freedom to offer personalised, tailored support to everyone who has been claiming jobseeker's allowance for 12 months, helping them overcome their individual barriers to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/7">This will be available to jobseeker's allowance customers of all ages to ensure that everyone has the best possible chance of finding work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/8">In addition, the budget announced the future jobs fund and young persons guarantee. Future jobs fund places will be available for older people from disadvantaged areas who are facing significant barriers to employment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1037W.2/1">I welcome the progress is being made on the development of the internal energy market, especially the recent agreement of texts for the third liberalisation package. This legislation will come into force early in 2011 and will benefit consumers through the development of more competition, especially between member states, and by enhancing security of supply. In order to improve the operation of the market, the UK is encouraging member states to implement early and on a voluntary basis those elements of the package related to transparency and co-operation between national regulators and system operators.</p>

	<p pid="b.1037W.5/1">Tackling fuel poverty is a priority for the Government. Our present policies and programmes, in particular with the changes announced in recent months, underline our commitment to do all that is reasonably practicable to ensure that vulnerable households do not live in fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/2">We have set in place a wide range of measures to tackle fuel poverty and so far have spent more than &pound;20 billion on policies and programmes to alleviate fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/3">Since 2000 we have assisted over 2 million households in England in the private sector through the Warm Front Scheme by fitting insulation and heating improvements for households in receipt of means-tested or disability-related benefits. The scheme now has a budget of over &pound;950 million for the spending years 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/4">The Government's programmes also assist vulnerable households through the provision of income-based policies. We have increased the winter fuel payments, which helped keep 12 million people warm last winter, by an extra &pound;50 for pensioners aged 60-79 and &pound;100 for those over 80, and this will continue next winter. We have also increased cold weather payments from &pound;8.50 to &pound;25 per week and made 8.4 million payments worth &pound;210 million between November 2008 and March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/5">To ensure as many households as possible are eligible for assistance we have arranged for benefit entitlement checks to be carried out through Warm Front. To date some 48,000 checks have been completed. The average increase in income for applicants identifying new benefits is &pound;30.64 per week or &pound;1,590 per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/6">A review of our fuel poverty policies is under way. The review is examining whether existing measures to tackle fuel poverty could be made more effective, and whether new policies should be introduced to help us make further progress towards our goals, particularly in light of market conditions and our aims to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044W.2/1">The Department and my predecessor have held discussions with Vestas regarding their announcement to consult on the future of their UK manufacturing capacity. No sector is immune from the economic downturn, and we are taking urgent action to ensure manufacturers can invest with confidence to supply the onshore and offshore wind markets, including the announcement in the Budget of up to &pound;4 billion of new capital from the European Investment Bank that could support UK renewable energy projects, which should provide confidence for the onshore wind supply chain, and an intention to consult on a time-limited uplift in the level of support for offshore wind through the Renewables Obligation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1044W.2/2">I recognise that commercial decisions on the supply of turbines for renewable generation are a matter for the companies concerned. SEEDA, the local regional development agency, has established a task force to provide a package of co-ordinated support that provides the company and its employees with advice and guidance during the consultation period, including&mdash;if Vestas' consultation does lead to redundancies&mdash;support on every opportunity for seeking alternative employment, training and re-skilling.</p>
