	<p pid="b.1330W.2/1">The &quot;Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities&quot; provides guidance in respect of women fleeing domestic violence which accords with legislation and case law. Under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996), a person is homeless if they have accommodation available but it would not be reasonable for them to continue to occupy it. It is not considered reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is probable that this will lead to domestic violence or other violence against that person (or against someone who normally resides as a member of that person's family, or any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with that person).</p>

Furthermore, local authorities must treat every applicant as eligible for an allocation of accommodation, with the exception of certain persons from abroad specified in regulations; and persons whom an authority decides to treat as ineligible because they (or a member of their household) have been guilty of unacceptable behaviour serious enough to make them unsuitable to be a tenant of the authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/2">The hon.

At the moment members of the armed forces cannot establish a local connection with the area in which they are stationed or work. This can put the members of the armed forces at a disadvantage where a local authority takes account of local connection in its allocation scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1339W.2/1">The Government's planning policy on best and most versatile (BMV) agricultural land is set out in &quot;Planning Policy Statement 7: Sustainable development in rural areas&quot; (PPS7), published in August 2004. PPS7 replaced &quot;Planning Policy Guidance note 7: The Countryside, Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development&quot; (PPG7), published in February 1997, which included policy guidance on (BMV) agricultural land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/2">PPG7 said that, within the principles of sustainable development, BMV agricultural land (defined as grades 1, 2 and 3a) should be protected as a national resource for future generations and its development should not be permitted before opportunities had been assessed for using previously developed or lower grade land.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/3">In December 2000 the Government's Rural White Paper &quot;Our Countryside: the future&quot;, signalled that policy affecting planning decisions relating to BMV land should be changed. The White Paper said that decisions about proposed development affecting BMV agricultural land should take account of the overall value of the land and that agricultural quality should be treated only as one factor. It therefore proposed that BMV agricultural land should no longer be protected as a national agricultural resource and that decisions about proposed development affecting such land should left to local planning authorities. It also proposed that powers for the Minister of Agriculture to intervene in decisions on BMV agricultural land should be repealed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/4">PPG7 was subsequently amended by a parliamentary answer given by the then planning Minister <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-21">21 March 2001</phrase> to reflect the White Paper's policy proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339W.2/5">These policy changes were carried forward into PPS7. This asks local authorities that the presence of BMV agricultural land should be taken into account alongside other sustainability considerations when determining planning applications. The policy also says that where significant development of agricultural land is unavoidable, local planning authorities should seek to use areas of poorer quality land in preference to that of a higher quality, except where this would be inconsistent with other sustainability considerations. If any undeveloped agricultural land needs to be developed, the policy requires any adverse effects on the environment should be minimised.</p>

	<p pid="b.1343W.9/1">The Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system is one of the most complex business change projects in either the private or public sector. It has been successfully rolled-out on time to all three Services; to the RAF from April 2006; to the RN from October 2006; and to the Army from March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.9/2">Since the initial roll-out of JPA to the RAF much has been achieved to improve the quality of the service being provided and to address problems. Personnel are more familiar with the new system and the business processes that it supports. But we are still in a transitional phase and there will be a further period of 'bedding down' which is bound to highlight the need for further business process, technical and training changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.9/3">JPA now provides a stable, modern platform to support our Services. However, like all major change programmes of this complexity it will take a period of further refinement in order to exploit its full potential. I remain fully committed to delivering an excellent pay and personnel administration service to our armed forces.</p>

Although delivery schedules have not yet been confirmed, we anticipate that they will be deployed on operations within the next 18 months. The allocation of these vehicles to Iraq, Afghanistan and the UK based training fleet will be a matter for commanders.</p>

Presently there is no justification case for such expenditure. Considerable improvements are already being made to the West Coast Main Line to accelerate Anglo-Scottish journey times for introduction in December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1354W.9/4" class="indent">The attached table gives the number of employed people aged 16 and over who were either United Kingdom or foreign born, for the three month period ending June, for each year since 1997 up to 2007. Comparable estimates are not available for 1998 and 2000. Projections of migrant workers to 2012 are not available from either the Labour Force Survey (LFS) nor the National Population Projections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/5" class="indent">When interpreting the figures in the table, it is important to bear in mind that the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas for the following reasons:-</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/6" class="indent">The LFS sample covers people living in private households, those in national health service (NHS) accommodation, and students living in halls of residence who have a UK-resident parent. Students living in halls of residence who do not have a UK-resident parent are not covered by the sample.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/7" class="indent">The LFS does not cover people living in other types of communal establishment (such as hostels, hotels, boarding houses, or mobile home sites).</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/8" class="indent">Individuals living at sampled addresses are generally included in the survey only if they regard the address as their main residence. Those who have been living at the address for less than six months are not eligible to take part in the survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/9" class="indent">The survey results are weighted to estimates of the 'usually resident' UK population living in private households, NHS accommodation and student halls of residence. The population figures cover long-term international migrants (people who change their country of usual residence for 12 months or more). They do not include people moving to the UK for less than 12 months, nor do they exclude from the usually resident population people moving out of the UK for less than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/10" class="indent">The LFS estimates at this detailed level are only consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003 and they do not incorporate the more recent population estimates that are used in the headline LFS series.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.9/11" class="indent">Estimates are taken from the LFS. As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.2/1">Education, including sexual and reproductive health education, is one of the most significant factors in preventing the spread of HIV in the next generation. In Swaziland, two-thirds of teenage girls in school are free from HIV, while two-thirds of girls out of school have HIV. Girls, boys and adults with more education are more likely to have knowledge of key prevention techniques, including condoms to help prevent HIV infection and insecticide impregnated bed nets to prevent malaria infection, and more able to persuade their partners, and in the case of bed nets, families, to use them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360W.2/2">DFID has funded two major research programmes that included assessing the impact of sexual and reproductive health education. These are the 'Safe passages to adulthood' programme at Southampton university (with a &pound;2 million grant) and the Transitions to Adulthood' programme, run by then Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) and the Population Council (with a &pound;5 million DFID grant). Early AGI findings from research in four developing countries (Burkina Faso, Malawi, Ghana and Uganda) demonstrate that the impact of sex education varies with the country and cultural context, as well as with methods of teaching used. In Uganda, for example, there was 8.5 times the use of condoms among those that had sex education, compared to those that did not. However, this finding was not replicated in all contexts. 40 per cent. of women who had been given a practical demonstration on how to use a condom reported using one at their last sexual encounter, whereas only 30 per cent. who had not received the demonstration reported using a condom.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361W.7/1">The changes in the funding applied to the Environment Agency's non-capital spend which funded items such as staff costs, operational spend and maintenance of defences. Funding for capital projects for new and improved defences to reduce risk was not cut and no current or planned capital improvement projects were delayed as a result. Funding to British Waterways was also reduced but these changes did not have a material impact on the provision of flood defence by British Waterways.</p>

	<p pid="b.1367W.6/3">The board, which advises VisitBritain on its domestic marketing work has been re-named VisitEngland. In future, it will take a more active role in the tourism marketing of England, and will be responsible for VisitBritain's domestic remit. The VisitEngland Board will also be made more representative of the domestic tourism sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1367W.6/4">These changes have been fully discussed with the tourism industry, and the public sector organisations which support it, through bodies coming together and working together in a series of seminars organised by the Partners for England. VisitEngland will now work with Partners for England to re-invigorate, as well as better co-ordinate, English public sector tourism support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1371W.0/2">The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union does not change the existing provisions relating to the co-ordination of employment policies, currently set out in the Employment Title (VIII) of the Treaty establishing the EU under Articles 125-130. The employment provision in Article five relates to the Lisbon Strategy for Jobs and Growth, whereby all member states agree non-binding guidelines on employment and report annually on their main employment policies that relate to the Guidelines. This is principally to generate exchange of good practice on reforms that will help increase employment across the EU. This process is also supported by the European Social Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371W.0/3">The UK strategy of employment opportunity for all is seen as a good model and delivers the common EU outcomes necessary for more and better jobs. The UK is one of only four member states to have attained and surpassed the Lisbon employment rate target of 70 per cent.</p>

This is an important programme and we will continue to support the charitable work both in the UK and Belarus that facilitates these visits. In consultation with the charities we are actively looking for ways to minimise any difficulties that the introduction of biometrics might create. We had sought to establish a seasonal visa application centre (VAC) in Gomel Oblast through our commercial partner, Visa Facilitation Services (VFS). This would have provided a more convenient visa application point and a shorter journey for some of these children. Unfortunately, we have not been able to secure permission from the Belarus Government to allow our commercial partner to operate. Those living in southern Belarus might find it easier to travel to the VAC in Kiev, Ukraine to lodge their applications. Our embassy in Kiev will make the necessary arrangements to cater for individuals or groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1380W.0/1">The Government continues to show a sustained determination to tackle the harms caused by alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/2">The &quot;Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England&quot;, which was published in 2004, was the first cross-Government strategy to prevent any further increase in alcohol-related harms in England. The 2004 Strategy has been extremely successful. It has put in place the mechanisms needed to deliver the Government's objective of reducing alcohol-related harms and has made considerable progress across a range of issues&mdash;new police and licensing powers, the new voluntary alcohol labelling scheme and revised advice to women about alcohol and pregnancy, effective and popular advertising campaigns (e.g. 'Know Your Limits', 'Think!'), creation of the Drinkaware Trust and improving alcohol treatment services, for example, the publication of suite of guidance materials, such as the &quot;Programme of Improvement and Models of Care for Alcohol Misuse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/3">We are already beginning to see the benefits of this: reductions in crime and city centre violence and early signs of an end to the continued increase in levels of alcohol consumption. Nevertheless, the review of the 2004 Strategy, which the Government was committed to undertaking this year, identified more that the Government can and needs to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/4">The Government's renewed alcohol strategy,&quot; Safe. Sensible. Social.&mdash;the next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy&quot;, published in June, sets out the long-term objective, to minimise the health harms, violence and antisocial behaviour associated with alcohol, while ensuring that people are able to enjoy alcohol safely and responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/5">The Government plans to achieve this by seeking to:</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/6" class="indent">-ensure the laws and licensing powers we have introduced to tackle alcohol fuelled crime and disorder, protect young people and bear down on irresponsibly managed premises, are being used widely and effectively;</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/7" class="indent">-sharpen our focus on the minority of drinkers who cause or experience the most harm to themselves, their communities and their families. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/8" class="indent">-18-24 year old binge drinkers,</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/9" class="indent">-young people under 18 who drink alcohol,</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/10" class="indent">-Harmful drinkers; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/11" class="indent">-To shape an environment which actively promotes sensible drinking, for example through a &pound;10 million investment in a sustained information and communications campaign to challenge public tolerance of drunkenness and drinking that causes harm to health and to raise the public's knowledge of units of alcohol and ensure that everyone has the information they need to estimate how much they really do drink..</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/12">In addition, the Government are committed to commissioning an independent national review of evidence on the relationship between alcohol price, promotion and harm and, following public consultation, to consider the need for regulatory change in the future, if necessary. Reviews will also take place on the effectiveness of the alcohol industry's social responsibility standards in contributing to a reduction in alcohol harm, as well as on the effectiveness of the industry's social responsibility standards in contributing to a reduction in alcohol harm.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/13">The Government have also announced in their Comprehensive Spending Review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, a Home Office public service agreement target to reduce drug and alcohol harm. This includes a new national indicator to measure change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol-attributable conditions, the first ever national commitment to monitor how the national health service is tackling alcohol harms through both intervention and treatment, which will operate from April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1380W.0/14">The Government are determined that the steps that are set out in &quot;Safe. Sensible. Social&quot; will shape an environment which will minimise the health harms, violence and antisocial behaviour associated with alcohol, while ensuring that people are able to enjoy alcohol safely and responsibly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1381W.5/1">The Department does not hold information centrally on specific clinics or services offered by individual trust or funded by individual primary care trusts (PCTs). The provision of services is a matter for agreement between trusts and their commissioning PCTs, in consultation with local stakeholders. This should take into consideration local needs and priorities while ensuring they meet core national standards for the delivery of health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.5/2">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a clinical guideline on familial breast cancer in May 2004, partially updated in October 2006. The clinical guideline relates to the classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer in primary, secondary and tertiary care. The guideline recommends that women at moderate familial risk of breast cancer or greater should receive annual mammography or magnetic resonance imaging surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381W.5/3">NICE clinical guidelines are covered by the Department's developmental standards&mdash;standards which the national health service is expected to achieve over time. The Healthcare Commission has responsibility for assessing progress towards achieving these standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1384W.6/1">Information on dentists accepting new national health service patients is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384W.6/2">Central Lancashire Primary Care Trust (PCT) is investing an additional &pound;1.3 millions in NHS dentistry to help solve the issues around access. To attract new dentists to the area and to encourage existing local dentists to provide additional services, the PCT has advertised for dentists to submit tenders to provide the additional NHS dentist appointments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384W.6/3">It is anticipated that once the outcome of the tendering process is known in December dentists will agree start dates with the PCT and the increase in capacity will be available by the end of the year. Those patients that are on the dental access database will be contacted and asked if they wish to transfer to a dentist within their area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1386W.6/1">The Government regard abuse of vulnerable and older people as unacceptable in all its forms and is determined to root it out. We are addressing the issue in a variety of ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/2">We set out standards for care and treatment for the national health service and social care services via the national service frameworks for older people and mental health and the White Paper, 'Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability', copies of which are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/3">We introduced regulations and national minimum standards for care homes, domiciliary care agencies and adult placements. These are intended to ensure vulnerable and older people can live in a safe environment, where their rights and dignity are respected, staff are properly trained and care is of the requisite quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/4">We have created independent regulators, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Healthcare Commission, and given them the powers they need to take action against poorly performing providers or where abuse occurs. Ultimately, they have the power to close services down.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/5">We expect local authorities to play their part. 'No Secrets', published by the Department in 2000 provides a complete definition of abuse and a framework for councils to work with the police, the NHS and regulators to tackle abuse and prevent it from occurring. On June 14 this year, we also announced a review of the 'No Secrets' guidance. The case for legislation to protect vulnerable adults will be considered as part of the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/6">Local authorities have been given specific responsibilities. Statutory guidance issued in May 2006 required them to ensure that directors of adult social services maintain a clear organisational and operational focus on safeguarding vulnerable adults and that relevant statutory requirements and other national standards are met, including Protection of Vulnerable Adults (POVA) requirements. Local authorities must make sure the director of adult social services has the powers and resources necessary to encourage a culture of vigilance against the possibility of adult abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/7">We introduced the POVA scheme in July 2004, which requires staff who provide personal care to older people in their own homes or in care homes to be subject to statutory checks, including checks of their criminal record. The scheme, which operates as a work force ban, prevents dangerous or unscrupulous people from gaining access to older and vulnerable people in care homes or being cared for in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/8">The Mental Capacity Act 2005, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>, introduces a new criminal offence of ill treatment or wilful neglect of a person who lacks capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/9">The Government support the work of Action on Elder Abuse (AEA). AEA has been awarded a three-year Section 64 grant, totalling &pound;360,000. This grant covers the three-year period from 2007 to 2009 and is to help fund central administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386W.6/10">We are introducing a new centralised vetting and barring scheme for people working with children and vulnerable people. This scheme, as set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, will extend the coverage of the existing barring schemes and draw on wider sources of information to provide a more comprehensive and consistent measure of protection for vulnerable groups across a wide range of settings, including the whole of social care and the NHS. The new scheme will make it far more difficult for abusers to gain access to some of the most vulnerable groups in society and will be a significant step forward.</p>

It is therefore possible to determine the mortality rate for those suffering a heart attack who receive treatment. Latest available figures (2005-06) indicate that the survival rate (all ages) for those who experience a heart attack and receive treatment is just over 90 per cent. For under 75-year-olds who experience a heart attack there is just over 95 per cent. chance of survival.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-10-19b.157978.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-10-19b.1398W.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="1398W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071019/text/71019w0016.htm#07101930003061">
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/1">The prostate specific antigen (PSA) test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. However, it is not perfect. Some men with prostate cancer do not have raised levels of PSA. Two-thirds of men with raised levels of PSA, depending on the cut-off level used, do not have prostate cancer. The PSA test cannot distinguish between men with slow-growing prostate cancer and those who have a more aggressive disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/2">The number of PSA tests carried out in the national health service is not held centrally. The Department policy research programme funded a study on urological referral in men with raised PSA levels and patterns of testing in general practice between 2002 and 2004. The study showed that the annual rate of testing is estimated to be 8.6 per 100 men <sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/3">The number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer as a result of having a PSA test is not held centrally. However, it is likely that most men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer had at least one PSA test as part of the diagnostic process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/4">The Government are committed to introducing a national screening programme for prostate cancer if and when screening and treatment techniques are sufficiently well developed. There is currently insufficient evidence from any country in the world to show that screening would reduce deaths from prostate cancer. The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) keeps screening for prostate cancer under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/5">The Department is supporting the development of screening technology for prostate cancer by having a comprehensive research strategy into all aspects of prostate cancer. We are jointly with other National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) members funding two NCRI Prostate Cancer Research Collaboratives, and the Department has funded half of the total &pound;7.4 million cost for the first three years. Following a review of progress by an international expert panel the Department, Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council have agreed to provide a further three years funding of &pound;3.9 million. The research undertaken by the Collaboratives covers all aspects of prostate cancer, and the NSC will be kept closely informed of any research results affecting the evidence base of prostate cancer screening. We are also monitoring international trials on prostate cancer screening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/6">It is important to note that in order for a screening technology to contribute to saving lives it is essential for there to be effective treatments for the disease detected. That is why the Department is funding a &pound;20 million trial of treatments for (PSA) screen-detected early prostate cancer (the ProtecT trial). The trial is due to complete in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/7">Regarding the Welsh Assembly, the Director of Cancer Services at NHS Wales is an observer on the Department's Prostate Cancer Advisory Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.11/8" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> This is estimated data from selected general practitioners (GPs) at four laboratories and does not represent the whole of England. Only GP requests for PSA testing were included in the study, not those from urology departments. The study did not include testing undertaken in the independent sector. The study was restricted to men aged 45 to 84 years.</p>
