	<p pid="a.3W.8/1">There are no plans to change the current policy. Service personnel under 18 years who have completed 28 days of service have the right to discharge at any time before their 18th birthday provided they give the required 14 days notice. A service person under the age of 18 years three months who registered before their 18th birthday, their clear unhappiness at their choice of career can request permission to leave the armed forces. They do not have discharge of right at this age but it is exceedingly rare for such an individual to be refused permission to leave.

	<p pid="a.7W.6/2">The payroll cost for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) for May was &#163;1,011.502 million. The forecast cost for the whole of this financial year is &#163;12,273.236 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.7W.6/3">The cost of the payroll in future years will depend on a number of factors, including the number of civilian and military personnel employed. The MOD announced significant reductions to both these numbers in the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation of these reductions, which will be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trade unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.13W.3/1">Expenditure on the grey fleet was some &#163;34 million in 2008-09 and &#163;32 million in 2009-10. This expenditure represents the cost of fixed mileage rates through which service and civilian personnel are assisted with the expenses they incur when using a privately owned vehicle for travel on official Ministry of Defence business. The figures do not include the reimbursement of any parking or toll charges, where incurred, as we do not break down such expenses by mode of travel, whether private vehicle, MOD vehicle or hire car.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.3/2">Private cars are normally only authorised for use on MOD business if a pool car is not available and a private car is the most cost-effective travel option. We have additionally asked all staff, as part of a package of financial management measures for 2010-11, to avoid travel at all where the business need can be met in other ways, such as by e-mail and video or audio conferencing. This both saves cost and increases the productivity of staff, by reducing time spent travelling.</p>

A key component of the ARC is the provision of four Personnel Recovery Centres (PRCs) in Catterick, Colchester, Tidworth and Edinburgh. The MOD to date has committed &#163;35 million over the next four years to the ARC which includes the provision of military and civilian personnel to co-ordinate, manage and deliver the ARC, including staff for the PRCs.

	<p pid="a.37W.0/1">In principle the Government support the use of market mechanisms, including pricing where appropriate, to improve the efficiency of spectrum used by the transport sector, with the provisos that safety considerations must not be compromised, international obligations must be respected and users must be given time to adjust. Departmental officials, in conjunction with the CAA, made these provisos clear to Ofcom as it prepared its new pricing structure for aeronautical spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="a.37W.0/2">I recently met with General Aviation representatives, including the Light Aircraft Association, who outlined their concerns at Ofcom's pricing proposals. In its statement, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December 2010</phrase>, Ofcom announced the introduction of a low cost/low coverage licence specifically for aerodromes.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.9/1">The Government have made clear that an urgent priority is to tackle the UK's record deficit in order to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery. As a contribution to addressing the record deficit, we therefore have reduced the previous plans for local authority funding in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.9/2">Central Government's financial support grant to local authorities is provided through a variety of mechanisms, such as formula grant (including the revenue support grant), specific grants and specific capital grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.9/3">The Government are clear that local government needs increased flexibility to take decisions locally. It has therefore retained the most flexible funding (formula grant) for 2010-11 at the level approved previously by Parliament (&#163;29 billion). We have also lifted restrictions on how local government spends its money by removing ring-fences.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.9/4">We expect local authorities to be able to make savings from efficiency measures, eliminating waste and, where necessary, reducing spending in areas that are lower priorities for their communities. The fact that certain grants have been chosen for reduction over others, does not mean that the Government expect there to be a direct correlation between grant reductions and local authority budget changes. For example, road safety grant was reduced as this grant was spread evenly across all local authorities, not because this was considered an area of lower priority spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.9/5">Therefore the road safety area based revenue funding for 2010-11 has been reduced by about 26.6% from approximately &#163;77.3 million to approximately &#163;56.7 million. The road safety capital grant for 2010-11 is not being paid and had been planned to total about &#163;17.2 million.</p>

We plan to conduct at least eight feasibility studies and three pilot projects by 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.10/2">DFID is also supporting remittances programmes in several developing countries directly. For example, DFID has supported the Bangladesh Government's Remittance Payments and Partnership (RPP) Project, which is helping to drive down transfer costs. The RPP has contributed to reductions of some 50% that have occurred on transfers between Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. DFID is also working with the FinMark Trust to reduce the average cost of transferring remittances from South Africa to five other Southern Africa Development Community countries by at least 30% by 2014. In Pakistan, DFID supports the State Bank's Remittance Initiative which is working to facilitate the cheaper and faster transfer of remittances. Going forward, we will continue to explore opportunities to support the G8 cost reduction objective.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.8/1">The Government are fully committed to meeting the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) on aid from 2013, and will enshrine this commitment in law. This legislation would make the UK the first G8 (and G20) country to make a lasting commitment to 0.7%. The financial resources required to meet this target have been clearly set out in the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.8/2">In terms of developing plans to meet this commitment, I have initiated three thorough reviews of UK bilateral aid, multilateral aid and humanitarian emergency response programmes. These reviews will determine how we can accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals and achieve maximum value for money for the UK taxpayer. This includes identifying priority countries and sectors where UK aid will have the greatest impact on the world's poor, as well as the most effective mechanisms for delivering aid. The full results of these reviews will be announced in spring 2011 and will form the basis for the Department for International Development's (DFID's) operational plans. These plans will set out how DFID intends to achieve the spending target of 0.7% of GNI from 2013. We will closely monitor and manage progress against the target.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.5/1">The Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) has considered how agencies have delivered value for money using a range of criteria. These include assessing how well the organisation has delivered on the basis of their track record in delivering results, their strategic and financial management, and their fit with the Government's priorities for poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.65W.5/2">UNIFEM is the largest of the organisations that has been merged to create UN Women. The MAR has assessed UNIFEM using the same criteria that has been applied to other organisations. The Government will take these findings into account when considering financial commitments to UN Women.</p>

In addition, the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), which is chaired by Department for Education and Home Office Ministers and comprises over 170 organisations, is continuing its work with industry, including social networking sites, on self-regulation and good practice sharing, to help to keep young people safe online.</p>

For example, the steel for the aquatics centre was provided by Rowecord in Newport, a contract worth millions of pounds, Cardiff-based Euroclad have won contracts on both the Olympic stadium and the media centre, whilst Vannplastic from Saltney produced decking boards for the new facilities at Weymouth and Portland, where the sailing events will take place in 2012. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided.

	<p pid="a.82W.2/2">Evidence from the recent research commissioned by the previous Administration and undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research, working in partnership with Triangle and QA Research, in addition to evidence from the education maintenance allowance pilots, suggests that around 90% of recipients would have stayed on after age 16 even if they had not received EMA. This evidence informed the basis upon which the Government took the decision to end EMA.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.8/2">The report presents a mixed picture in terms of educational performance in England. It demonstrates that across the country there are many front line professionals making a real contribution to improving standards, and notes the positive impact of academies, many of which have replaced failing schools. The report also highlights the need for high quality teaching in all schools. That is why our Schools White Paper, published last week, places teaching at the centre of the Government's plans for reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.2/2">Take up of free early education places remains high nationally, with 95% of three and four-year-olds accessing at least some of their free early education. However, significant gaps in take up remain between children from the most disadvantaged families and their peers. To improve life chances for these families, children's centres will refocus on supporting families in the greatest need. We know that children's centre outreach workers play an important part in reaching families in greatest need. We are considering what role outreach can continue to play, alongside health visitors, social workers and other early years professionals to promote children's centre services (including free early education places for two, three and four-year-olds), to those families least likely to take up these services.</p>

	<p pid="a.91W.5/1">Primary legislation-s7 of the Childcare Act 2006-requires local authorities to secure nursery education free of charge for every three and four-year-old, whether or not there is statutory guidance in place. The legislative position is reiterated in new guidance, the code of practice, which came into force in September alongside new regulations which extend, to 15 hours per week, the amount of free nursery education to which each child is entitled. The code of practice, supports local authorities to deliver free nursery education and provides guidance on flexibility, quality, funding and working in partnership with providers. The extension and new code of practice was introduced following extensive consultation with providers and their representatives following trials in 34 pathfinder authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.5/2">The Department has received correspondence relating to free nursery education from providers in the maintained, private, voluntary and independent sectors, and from parents and local authorities. The Department is listening to the views of the early years sector on the recent extension to 15 hours per week and the additional flexibilities the code of practice introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.5/3">The most recent data held specifically about the take-up of free nursery education places is from &quot;Provision for Children Under Five Years of Age in England: January 2010&quot;. This showed that 22,000 more three-year-olds and 5,500 more four-year-olds were taking up nursery education, compared with 2009. 92% of three-year-olds and 98% of four-year-olds access some free nursery education. The Department publishes information on the part-time equivalent number of free early education places filled by three and four-year-olds in maintained, private, voluntary and independent provider sectors. Information on the number of available free pre schools is not centrally available.</p>

The latest OECD 'Education at a Glance' publication shows that the UK fares favourably on per student expenditure compared to other OECD countries. For example we are aware of computer to pupil ratios of 1:3 at secondary, 1:7 at primary, and 1:3 at special schools in England. These figures stand up well to international comparisons and suggest healthy levels of online education which many reports suggest work best when combined with effective interpersonal teaching.</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.2/1">The White Paper, 'The Importance of Teaching', draws on evidence from the world's best education systems when it sets out the reform programme for the schools system, with schools freed from the constraints of central Government direction and teachers placed firmly at the heart of school improvement. The 'Case for Change' is an evidence-based publication that supports the case for change to our schools system; this has been placed in the House Libraries and may be accessed here:</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.2/5">School autonomy is increasing at an international level (OECD, 2010) and findings regarding the relationship between school autonomy and raising standards are generally positive. High performing systems use four main approaches to help teachers to teach effectively: building practical skills during initial training; placing coaches in schools to support teachers; selecting and developing effective instructional leaders; and enabling teachers to learn from one another (Barber and Mourshed, 2007).</p>

The regulations requiring SENCos to be qualified as teachers and, if new to the role, to undertake nationally approved training were introduced following a recommendation by the cross-party Education Select Committee in 2006. The Committee heard evidence from parents and professionals who were concerned about variations in teaching skills among those working with SEN pupils in mainstream schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.100W.3/3">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Green Paper will be published shortly. The Green Paper will look at a range of issues with input from parents and professionals. The work force element of the SEN Green Paper will draw on this input and will build on the reforms set out in the Importance of Teaching White Paper. More recently, my colleague, the Minister of State for Children and Families (Sarah Teather), has recently met a group of SENCos as part of her consideration of the issues which the Green Paper will address. A Call for Views to inform the Green Paper also received 95 responses from SENCos.</p>

By comparing these relative amounts we can deduce an indicative value for the relative probability for children from broken homes coming under the supervision of a Youth Offending Team.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.2/3">The relationship between family set-up and child outcomes is discussed in the 2009 Demos report 'Building Character'.

	<p pid="a.111W.5/1">The figures available for cost of press cuttings services to the Department extend as far back as 2006 due to the introduction of a new Procurement and Finance IT system in December 2005. All details of expenditure prior to this time have been archived, and therefore disproportionate costs would be incurred to produce figures prior to 2006. There were significant costs incurred in the financial year 2009-10, this was due to increased press activity in relation to the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/2">The Department is committed to driving down costs and delivering efficiencies. A new contract was agreed in April 2010 which dramatically reduced the amount of employees with access to the press cuttings and also reduced the number of cuttings actually received. We expect this to substantially reduce our costs compared to 2009-10. We continue to monitor all expenditure with a view to delivering maximum value for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.5/3">The cost of press cuttings services to the Department from 2006 shown in the following table are inclusive of VAT, however it should be noted that the VAT is recovered by the Department for these services:</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is fully engaged with Government initiatives to promote the use of small and medium-sized enterprises and increase the level of business they get from Government. This business can be either direct, by winning departmental contracts, or indirect, working as partners with or sub-contractors to the Department's prime contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.2/2">We are achieving the new Government commitment that 25% of contracts will be let to small and medium enterprises and in 2009-10 achieved 29%.The Department is also fully committed to using the new cross-Government pre-qualification questionnaire which is designed to simplify the tendering process for small and medium enterprises and will be launched in December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.2/3">We plan to encourage and support small and medium enterprises to form part of a wider approach set out in the DWP Commercial Strategy. This has objectives to make it easier for suppliers to compete for contracts and encourage a diverse supply base.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.2/4">Small and medium-sized businesses are encouraged to contract with the Department, either as first tier suppliers where they are able or as sub-contractors for more complex contracts. Part of the approach is to use the DWP Supplier Charter, signed by the Department's top suppliers, which refers to extending its principles to small and medium-sized enterprises as sub-contractors. Under the Charter, larger suppliers are expected to use small and medium sized business and voluntary organisations as sub-contractors where it is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.113W.2/1">DWP continues to engage and acknowledge the vital role the voluntary and community sector plays in helping people back to work through the delivery of its employment programmes. This business can be either direct, by winning departmental contracts, or indirect, working as partners with or subcontractors to the Department's prime contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/2">During the autumn and early winter we have held events across Great Britain to engage voluntary and community sector organisations in our plans for the Work programme and the commercial opportunities it presents. We also supported events with the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO) Association of Learning Providers (ALP) and the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI).</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/3">In December I wrote to representative groups from the sector encouraging them to ensure their members are aware of the opportunity the Work programme presents for them to market their value and work with larger delivery partners in delivering contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.113W.2/6">DWP is competitively neutral in letting its contracts. However, it recognises the value specialist and voluntary sector organisations can add in the delivery of welfare to work services. We actively encourage them to form partnerships and join up their expertise and financial resources to bid as a consortium to deliver our programmes directly or alternatively, market their expertise to the prime supplier as subcontractors</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.2/7">We are supporting partnership discussions using the Indus Delta website, hosted by the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI), to provide a facility for potential framework organisations and supply chain partners to make first contact with each other.</p>

	<p pid="a.118W.2/1">As identified by Professor Harrington during his Independent Review of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA), we believe that the principles of the assessment are right, but that the system which we inherited contained some flaws that risked undermining its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/2">We are committed to taking forward the review's recommendations so that we can make the system fairer for claimants and fairer for the taxpayer. This is an ongoing process of improvement, so I am delighted that Professor Harrington has agreed to take on the second Independent Review of the WCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/3">As with other fluctuating and chronic health conditions it is important that the WCA takes account of fluctuating mental health symptoms when assessing capability for work, it is not a snapshot view of a customer's ability to undertake day-to-day activities at any single point in time, but rather an assessment of their ability most of the time. The recommendations of the Harrington review will help us to improve the process, including for people with fluctuating mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/4">Mental, intellectual and cognitive champions are due to be launched by Atos Healthcare during the first quarter of 2011, so that they are in place in time for reassessment of individuals from incapacity benefits. The champions will spread best practice regarding mental, intellectual and cognitive conditions and also handle more difficult cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.118W.2/5">Additionally, as you may be aware, Professor Harrington has asked Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, also involving Mencap and the National Autistic Society to provide recommendations on refining the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors within the WCA. We look forward to receiving these recommendations shortly.</p>

DWP Ministers and officials helped to formulate this strategy and the DWP continues to work closely with BIS on the proposals to support customers on active benefits (jobseeker's allowance and employment and support allowance (work-related activity group)) to access state-subsidised, accredited training relevant to the local labour market. The proposals give training providers greater freedom to tailor training to the needs of the local community and economy. Jobcentre Plus will have an important role influencing the local training offer, engaging with employers, colleges and providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.129W.11/4">The Pensions Regulator is responsible for providing information about how employers can comply with their new duties and their communication and education campaigns are designed to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.129W.11/8">Current plans are to make information and guidance available to all individuals so that in the run up to automatic enrolment and beyond people will have access to information about pensions. Our information service will be a key part of our wider communications plans to support the reforms, and will explain the reforms in a simple and accessible way. Information about automatic enrolment will be presented as part of wider information on retirement planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/9">We will ensure that information is available in a range of accessible and relevant formats, including online, via telephone, and in print where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.129W.11/14">The NEST Corporation will provide information about NEST to employers, employees and third parties. The information will aim to support employers who may be considering the option of choosing NEST for their employees and will aim to support scheme members in their decision making, such as fund choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/15">The information will be supported by communications and information from DWP and the Pensions Regulator on the introduction of automatic enrolment.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/16">NEST is now a scheme in its own right and is subject to the same legal requirements as other trust-based occupational pension schemes.

	<p pid="a.131W.2/1">We want to ensure that as many people benefit from the Work Programme as soon as possible, and will launch the Work Programme as soon as providers are ready to start delivery in each contract package area.

	<p pid="a.131W.2/2">We are determined to ensure that there is continuity of provision, and that the transition to the Work Programme does not leave any customer unsupported. Therefore, New Deal and Employment Zone contracts will be extended until June 2011, ensuring that customers referred to these programmes in March will be supported until the summer, by which time the Work Programme will have been rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.131W.2/3">Before their referral to the Work Programme, customers will have access to support delivered through Jobcentre Plus, including access to work experience, help to volunteer or take advantage of peer-to-peer support, as well as help with basic skills or jobsearch techniques and access to the Jobcentre Plus Flexible Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Ruth Owen:</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking if he will take steps to ensure that jobseekers living in rural areas with few transport connections are not disadvantaged by the use of a distance criterion rather than a travelling time criterion when being considered for financial support provided by Jobcentre Plus for travelling to interviews; if he will assess the merits of measuring the qualifying distance for financial assistance under the Jobcentre Plus travel to interview scheme by travelling time rather than mileage and what distance a jobseeker must travel to attend an interview to qualify for financial assistance under the Jobcentre Plus Travel to Interview Scheme. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to Darra Singh as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. As Darra Singh is currently on annual leave, I am replying in his absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/4" class="indent">The Travel to Interview Scheme is there to help our customers make the move from benefit into gainful employment. It aims to encourage customers to widen their jobsearch by helping them with travel costs to attend interviews outside their local travel to work area.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/5" class="indent">As travel to work patterns vary enormously, it is the responsibility of the Jobcentre to determine normal daily travelling distance throughout Great Britain. The Jobcentre takes the following factors into account when setting their boundaries:</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/6" class="indent">Do local people commonly travel to the place of interview?</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/7" class="indent">How far away is the place of interview?</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/8" class="indent">How long will the journey take by public transport or car?</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/9" class="indent">How much will it cost to travel to the interview?</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/10" class="indent">Using their local knowledge, our Jobcentres factor in both distance and travelling time when setting their boundaries and this ensures that jobseekers in rural areas are not disadvantaged when they seek help with travel to interview costs. Each application is considered on its merits, taking the above factors into account before deciding whether help can be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.8/11" class="indent">Advisers also have the discretion to help customers with travel costs to attend interviews within the local travel to work area, using their professional judgment for each individual case. Help may be given where a customer has several interviews within a short period of time or the cost of attending an interview will cause them financial hardship. In all cases the best interest of the customer must be the main consideration. There is no minimum travel distance; the only condition is that the cost of attending a single local job interview must exceed &#163;4.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.2/1">The Office for Disability Issues (ODI) is designated as the UK Government focal point for work on the UN convention on the rights of disabled people under article 33 of the convention. The ODI is working with Departments across Westminster, and with the devolved Administrations to implement and report on the convention. This work includes raising awareness of the convention's obligations so that Departments are aware of their responsibility to take it into account in the development and implementation of policies which may affect disabled people, and coordinating the UK Government report to the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.2/2">ODI is working directly with disabled people, including disabled children, in order to raise awareness of the convention and learn about their views on how the UK is implementing it, in the spirit of article 33(3) of the convention. This includes working with a convention working group chaired by the UK Disabled People's Council (UKDPC), and supporting a number of convention-related awareness and training events organised by UKDPC.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.2/3">ODI is also working with the four UK equality and human rights commissions which have been designated as the independent monitoring and reporting mechanism for the convention under article 33(2). ODI has supported a number of events held by the commissions in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to raise awareness, and help inform the reporting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.2/4">The wider Department for Work and Pensions is also committed to implementing the convention in relation to its policy and delivery activities. It is working closely with ODI and will be contributing to the UK Government report in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is committed to the UN convention on the rights of disabled people, and to protecting the rights of disabled people and promoting choice and control in their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/2">In respect of article 8, the Department has made a strong public commitment to the social model of disability, and the Office for Disability Issues has been working closely with the equality and human rights commissions across the UK to raise awareness of the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/3">In respect of article 12, the Department has made good progress in developing a review process for benefit appointees, with a view to removing the reservation to article 12(4). This is a major undertaking because there are close to 900,000 DWP customers with appointees.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/4">In respect of article 19, we launched the Right to Control on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-13">13 December</phrase>. This is a new legal right to give disabled people control over the support they receive. Disabled people can choose how to spend funding they receive from six different sources in order to maximise their choice and independence. Right to Control is being tested in seven local authority areas in England, in partnership with Jobcentre Plus and disabled people's organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/5">In respect of article 27, we launched Work Choice on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-25">25 October 2010</phrase>. Work Choice provides tailored support to help disabled people who face the most complex barriers to employment. It supports them to find employment and stay in work and ultimately helps them progress into unsupported employment. Work Choice is voluntary and available regardless of any benefits being claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/6">In respect of article 28, the Department is playing its part in tackling the deficit and bringing spending under control. The Department remains committed to supporting the people who need it most, and protecting the most vulnerable in our communities. We are committed to understanding the impact of our policies on disabled people and will be undertaking equality impact assessments, which will be made public.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/7">As regards the wider convention, the Department recognises the principle of involvement of disabled people in the development of policies that affect them, and is engaging with disabled people on key changes such as the reform of disability living allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/8">The UK Government will report to the UN in July 2011 setting out how implementation of the convention has been achieved across Government. DWP officials are working with officials at the Office for Disability Issues in preparing the report, and this will set out in more detail what the Department is doing to meet its obligations across the convention as a whole, including articles 8, 12,19, 27 and 28.</p>

	<p pid="a.137W.2/1">Following full implementation of Universal Credit, marginal deduction rates will reduce for around 1.5 million workers in total, with the average (median) reduction in marginal deduction rate being 20 percentage points. As part of this, Universal Credit will particularly improve earnings incentives for 700,000 low-earning workers, reducing the highest marginal deduction rates from 95.8% to around 76%.</p>
	<p pid="a.137W.2/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that no-one loses as a direct result of these reforms and we expect 350,000 children and 500,000 working-age adults to be moved out of poverty. We also anticipate that the Universal Credit will reduce the number of workless households by around 300,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.137W.2/3">Around 2 million workers will see an increase in their marginal deduction rates with a median increase of just 4 percentage points, and none of these households will be worse off financially when they move to Universal Credit. A change in marginal deduction rate does not mean a change in what a family receives, only a difference in how much of their benefit they retain as they increase their hours worked or earnings marginally. Indeed, many of these families will see this change in their marginal deduction rates because Universal Credit allows low-earning households to keep more of their benefit, so as a consequence some households who previously received no state support will now do so. They will therefore have an increased marginal deduction rate but a higher income, as they are now receiving support which is withdrawn where previously there was none. Other households among this group will receive more than they previously did-and hence be better off financially. Some households will see a slight increase in deduction rates but they and their families will see no actual loss at the point of change, because they will be transitionally protected.</p>

	<p pid="a.137W.5/1">As announced in the joint DWP/HMRC strategy paper, 'Tackling fraud and error in the benefit and tax credits systems', we will be bringing forward proposals in the Welfare Reform Bill to widen the range of working age benefit overpayments we can recover and this will include those resulting from official error. While the Department must take responsibility for its mistakes, that does not give people the right to keep taxpayers' money that they are not entitled to.</p>
	<p pid="a.137W.5/2">However, we recognise that recovery will not be appropriate in all cases, and the legislation will be supported by a code of practice which will set out the type of case where recovery action will not be taken. This will include overpayments arising from official error where the customer accepted the payment in good faith and where, given the customer's circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the money to be repaid.</p>

	<p pid="a.138W.5/1">DWP continues to engage and acknowledge the vital role the voluntary and community sector plays in helping people back to work through the delivery of its employment programmes. This business can be either direct, by winning departmental contracts, or indirect, working as partners with or sub-contractors to the Department's prime contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/2">During the autumn and early winter we have held events across Great Britain to engage voluntary and community sector organisations in our plans for the Work Programme and the commercial opportunities it presents. We also supported events with the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (ACEVO) Association of Learning Providers (ALP) and the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI).</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/3">In December I wrote to representative groups from the sector encouraging them to ensure their members are aware of the opportunity the Work Programme presents for them to market their value and work with larger delivery partners in delivering contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/4">DWP hosted an event on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-20">20 December</phrase> with small providers to encourage them to strengthen their hand in their dealings with prime providers and become an active participant in delivery of the Work programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/5">Small businesses and voluntary organisations provide significant contributions to welfare to work provision where their specialist and local expertise can add great value. In preparing for the Work Programme the Department has engaged with these organisations to gain their views and encourage them to become involved. It has taken steps to encourage potential prime contractors to come together with a range of partners and sub-contractors where they could add value to bids and will run local events to help prime-contractors understand the needs and issues within each locality so they can put together appropriate supply chains for that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/6">DWP is competitively neutral in letting its contracts. However, it recognises the value specialist and voluntary sector organisations can add in the delivery of welfare to work services. We actively encourage them to form partnerships and join up their expertise and financial resources to bid as a consortium to deliver our programmes directly or alternatively, market their expertise to the prime supplier as subcontractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.138W.5/7">We are supporting partnership discussions using the Indus Delta website, hosted by the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI), to provide a facility for potential Framework organisations and supply chain partners to make first contact with each other.</p>

The draft FDP Guidance and the &quot;Consultation on an updated Waste Transfer Pricing Methodology for the disposal of higher activity waste from new nuclear power stations&quot;, also published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-07">7 December 2010</phrase>, provide more detail on those costs for which a new build operator will be responsible. In summary, an operator's full share of waste management and disposal costs is considered to be: the cost of managing their waste pending disposal; the costs that are directly attributable to disposing of their waste in a geological disposal facility (GDF); a contribution towards the fixed costs of constructing a GDF; and an additional element or elements to reflect any financial risks being taken on by the Government in agreeing to title to and liability for the operator's waste.</p>

The Department's Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Brian Collins, maintains strategic oversight of the scientific, engineering and technical evidence and advice that informs policy development and can help policy teams identify gaps and opportunities for engagement with individuals and organisations with relevant expertise.

The scheme has been piloted during 2009-10 and is now being rolled out across the Department.

	<p pid="a.157W.0/1">The duration of university courses is a matter for institutions taking into account the complexity and content of the subjects delivered and demand from students. The new funding regime is designed to move from a situation where the bulk of funding is via direct grants to one based on the informed choices of students. Students will want to take into account course length and content, the quality of their experience at university and their employment prospects on graduation in deciding which courses to apply for, in addition to the fees being charged. Students will benefit from a fairer and more progressive system of graduate contributions and so we do not expect a particular impact on four year courses where there is a clear rationale for the length of study. Overall, however, we would expect innovative approaches to teaching, such as compressed degrees.</p>

	<p pid="a.159W.2/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) overall mission is to build a dynamic and competitive UK economy by creating the conditions for business success; promoting innovation, enterprise and science; and giving everyone the skills and opportunities to succeed. The work of BIS must reflect this. We are therefore wholly committed to the obligations set out within the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to improving outcomes for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/2">BIS will contribute to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Report in 2011, setting out what the Department is doing to meet our obligations and how implementation is being achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/3">A number of strategies and programmes already exist and/or are being taken forward by BIS which serve to support the various rights and freedoms set out in the numerous Convention Articles, examples from across our sectors include:</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/4" class="indent">The Skills Investment Strategy 2010-11 sets out how we will continue to support provision which meets particular equality needs-for example investing in further education and skills training for learners with difficulties and/or disabilities remains a priority, and in the UK we have a continuing commitment to be inclusive and equitable by maintaining opportunities for all learners.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/5" class="indent">Next Step provides a universal offer of information and advice about learning, work and careers for all those in and out of employment in England. It has been fully operational from August 2010. Next Step provides targeted support-by phone, online or face-to-face-to those with specific barriers to getting into and on in work, including overcoming wider obstacles to progress, such as employment rights, health, transport, personal finance issues, child care and financial support for learners. BIS is ensuring that the service is well placed to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities, and specialist support is available to help people with the full range of disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/6" class="indent">Work is ongoing to implement the Diversity in Apprenticeships pilots with the Department for Education to increase the critical mass of learners in non-traditional occupations.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/7" class="indent">In England, disabled students in higher education (HE) are supported by the Government via the institution they attend and individually through disabled students' allowances which are available to help students in HE with the extra costs they may incur on their course because of a disability (including an ongoing health condition, mental health condition or specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia).</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/8" class="indent">BIS is helping businesses and individuals to prepare for and deliver a successful 2012 games; and that as a result of the games there are businesses better able to deliver other major sporting, cultural and entertainment events. Further to encourage businesses to become more accessible the BIS and the UK Office for Disability Issues commissioned a report &quot;2012 Legacy for Disabled People: Inclusive and Accessible Business&quot; setting out the opportunities that disabled customers bring. The initiative focused on improving the way businesses engage with disabled customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/9" class="indent">As part of its work to promote STEM careers, the BIS and Department for Education funded STEMNET works to ensure equality of access for all, including those covered by disability legislation. While the duty to ensure wide access falls principally to schools, STEM ambassadors and others design and support activities and enrichment material in a way that allows young disabled people to fully appreciate how science can be a part of their lives and careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/10" class="indent">The work of BIS is also supported by a programme on implementing the requirements and provisions in the most recent equality legislation in the UK, the Equality Act 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.2/11">More detailed information about BIS and its contribution to supporting the rights and freedoms of people with disabilities will be available in the UK Report to the UN Disability Committee when it is published in the summer of 2011, co-ordinated by the Office of Disability Issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.167W.9/69" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup>Advertising spend is defined as covering only media spend (inclusive of agency commissions but excluding production costs, COI commission and VAT). All figures exclude advertising rebates and audit adjustments and therefore may differ from COI official turnover figures. All figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10,000. These figures do not include departmental recruitment/classified advertising costs and ad hoc spend under &#163;10,000. These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by NHS organisations to supplement national campaigns in their area. While this expenditure has been excluded as far as possible so that this chart reflects central departmental spend, it would incur disproportionate cost to validate that every item of NHS expenditure has been removed.</p>

The consultation, &quot;Healthy Lives, Healthy People: consultation on the funding and commissioning routes for public health&quot;, asks specifically what can be done to ensure the widest possible range of providers are supported to play a full part in providing health and wellbeing services. We plan to publish a response to the consultation in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.3/2">Localism will be at the heart of the new public health system, with devolved responsibilities, freedoms and funding, subject to parliamentary approval of the forthcoming Health and Social Care Bill. Local authorities will have use of a ring-fenced grant to fund their new public health responsibilities. We expect that the majority of services will be commissioned, given the opportunities this would bring to engage local communities more widely in the provision of public health, and to deliver best value and best results. We would encourage and expect that local authorities, where possible and appropriate, should be commissioning on an any willing provider/competitive tender basis. It is also expected that local people will have access to information about commissioning decisions, how public health money has been spent and the outcomes that have been achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.174W.3/3">Under the Access to Justice Act 1999, the Lord Chancellor has the power to authorise the Legal Services Commission to grant exceptional legal aid funding in cases which are not within the scope of the civil legal aid scheme. The total amount spent on exceptional funding was &#163;1.1 million in 2007-08; &#163;1.5 million in 2008-09 and &#163;1.6 million in 2009-10. While most of the applications for exceptional funding are for inquests, it is not possible to disaggregate the expenditure on inquests from the total amount spent on exceptional funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.174W.9/1">The consultation response documents detail the percentage of the population in each area within a 60 minute public transport commute of their local court. Table 1 shows details of the distance from closing court to receiving court for each of the courts that will close.</p>
	<p pid="a.174W.9/2">Central administrative systems do not provide statistics on completed proceedings at each individual magistrates court site, but do provide data by local justice areas (LJAs). Table 2 therefore contains figures for the number of completed proceedings in 2009 for those LJAs which contain one or more magistrates courts proposed for closure. The counts provided do not relate solely to cases dealt with at the closing courts and include cases dealt with at any other magistrates courts in each LJA which are not proposed to close.</p>
	<p pid="a.174W.9/3">For county courts, Table 3 sets out the number of cases (non family) in 2009 in county courts that will close. Table 4 sets out the number of public and private law orders in 2009 in county courts that will close. Table 5 sets out the number of family proceedings completed in 2009 in county courts that will close.</p>
	<p pid="a.174W.9/4">Not shown on the tables are Coleford, Chepstow, Circencester, Rutland, Epsom and Llandovery magistrates courts, and Chepstow, Goole and Gravesend county courts, which were not utilised in 2009.</p>

Clients with hearing or speech impairments may also access advice through the e-mail service or through the British Sign Language service offered by the helpline in partnership with the Royal Association for the Deaf.</p>

For example, there is a case that those who pose a high risk to the public should be excluded, given that the focus of the supervising agencies participating in multi-agency public protection arrangements is on effectively managing the risk of harm which such offenders present. The Ministry of Justice is seeking to test this view as part of the Green Paper consultation process.</p>

In distributing the 2010-11 Supporting People allocations via area-based grant, the allocations to local authorities were damped to ensure that no authority received a large cut year-on-year. Since Supporting People was one of the services transferred into formula grant from 2011-12, it is no longer damped separately but instead is included in the damping applied to total formula grant which also ensures that no authority receives a large cut year-on-year on a like-for-like basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.2/1">Where an individual planning application is submitted for determination by the local planning authority, it will be for that authority to decide whether or not permission should be granted. In taking such decisions a local planning authority must have regard to the local development plan for its area (which will incorporate any relevant neighbourhood development plans) and any other material considerations. (It is unlikely that the fact that there has been a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; vote in a referendum on a specific development proposal would be a material consideration-i.e about the planning merits of an application-which the local planning authority could take into account). Individual planning applications would not be determined by referendum.</p>

Under these provisions, a community can bring forward a neighbourhood development order which permits certain types of development (e.g. for commercial development) in outline or full in their neighbourhood. A community referendum must be held into any neighbourhood development order.</p>

Top down targets will be replaced with incentives for local action, and regional agencies and strategies are being removed so local communities can set their own priorities. Local enterprise partnerships are coming on stream, reflecting natural economic geographies rather than imposed and artificial regional boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.203W.5/2">Some places have developed an over-reliance on public sector employment and we want to support them in the process of adjustment. That adjustment will involve a bigger role for the private sector, and the &#163;1.4 billion Regional Growth Fund has been established to help achieve this in those places that are over-reliant on public sector employment.</p>

HM Revenue and Customs write to the company explaining why an objection has been made. The precise reasons can vary from cases to case. The most common reasons are that the company owes money to HM Revenue and Customs, that an inquiry is being conducted into the company's tax affairs, or that a Corporation Tax return is outstanding.</p>

No estimates have been made beyond 2015-16 and none have been made of the Government's cash requirement excluding repayments since that is a measure of net spending. The following table reproduces the figures in the OBR's report. Since most repayments relate to loans made several years previously and students need not make any contribution until they have graduated and are earning over &#163;21,000 under the new system, there would be no significant difference in repayments between the old and the new systems in the years covered by the OBR's report.</p>

In the EU this could involve significant extension to the interest and royalties directive, and the Government would have to weigh this against their commitment to no further transfer of sovereignty to Europe over the course of this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.219W.8/1">The Government announced their first deployment of troops to Helmand in January 2006, as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) expansion to the south of the country. Since 2006, the UK's troop presence in Helmand has grown from an initial deployment of 3,150 to approximately 7,700 troops.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.8/2">This Government remain committed to the international effort in Afghanistan. Our aim, along with that of other ISAF partners, is that the Afghan National Security Forces should be in a position to take the security lead across the whole country by the end of 2014. The role of UK and other international forces and their number will gradually change as this happens. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is clear that that there will not be British troops in a combat role or in the numbers they are now in Afghanistan in 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.8/3">At the present time, there are no plans to initiate an inquiry into the reasons for the UK deployment to Helmand. It would be wrong to consider holding an inquiry while our troops are still risking their lives and while operations are ongoing.</p>

We seek to raise the issue at every opportunity directly with the regime, with regional countries of influence and in the UN. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister discussed Burma during his visits to China and India, and we continue to work to build international support for the UN to consider a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in Burma. At the UN General Assembly Third Committee, we pressed the regime to improve their human rights record through a toughly worded resolution and the UK will reiterate our concerns during the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review of Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.232W.5/1">There are many things about the EU we would like to change. However, membership of the EU gives UK business full access to the world's most important trading zone, comprising 500 million consumers without the barriers of customs or tariffs. This is of great importance to the UK's prosperity. 10% (3.5 million) of UK jobs are reliant on exports to EU member states, the beneficial effect of EU trade on UK households is estimated at between &#163;1,100 and &#163;3,300 per year, UK exports to member states are worth more than &#163;200 billion, and EU Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) comprises 49% of overall FDI to the UK. Under the present terms of membership the UK plays a strong and active role in influencing and shaping developments within the EU, allowing us to further goals essential to the national interest, such as strengthening and expanding the single market, delivering growth, and promoting a resource efficient, low carbon EU economy. The European economic area (EEA) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members, in contrast, have to contribute to the EU budget without being able to negotiate the detail and content of EU legislation, and without receiving benefits such as the exemption from customs requirements and costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.5/2">In addition, EU membership gives the UK better leverage and negotiating power on the global stage, allowing us to better achieve our international objectives on issues such as freer international trade, conflict prevention, stabilisation, climate change, human rights and development. There are also wide-ranging benefits for UK individuals, such as the right to study and work within the EU, and to receive free or reduced cost health care on temporary visits within EU member states.</p>
