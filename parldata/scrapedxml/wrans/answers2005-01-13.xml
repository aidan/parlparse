	<p pid=".588W.2/1">Minimum performance requirements for dwellings are conveyed through the Building Regulations. These are functional rather than prescriptive to enable compliance in practical and cost-effective ways, and to leave open the possibilities for innovation. It would therefore be inappropriate to prescribe particular technologies such as grey water and photovoltaic cells.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is reviewing the Building Regulations energy efficiency requirements and amendment proposals were published for consultation in July 2004. The proposals include setting minimum performance standards at levels much higher than at present and providing new technical guidance on low and zero carbon systems. The aim is to encourage builders to take more account of the benefits of low and zero carbon systems without being prescriptive. The responses to the consultation will be taken into account in developing the final amendment provisions which we aim to publish this summer.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/3">Water conservation is being considered under a review of Part G of the Building Regulations which currently deals with hygiene matters. As in the case of energy, water conservation requirements are likely to be in functional terms. However, the supporting guidance is likely to include a suggestion that a separate water supply should be made to toilets. This will enable toilets to be supplied with grey water rather than use drinking water.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.0/2">The processes used by police forces to check the identity of a young person vary from case to case but will include asking to see any identification they may have on them, taking them home, cross-checking with any peers present at the time or asking their parents to attend the police station after arrest. The individual may also be known to the officer dealing with them. Relatively few young people give false details to the police; where there is doubt the police will make every effort to establish the correct details.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.0/3">The processes used by police forces to record details of contacts with young people vary from force to force and will also depend upon the circumstances of the incident itself. Not every contact is recorded as that may be inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.0/4">In the case of street bail, the police will write to the parents of the young person concerned asking them to attend with their child at an appropriate time. Again, if it becomes clear that the young person is not the one involved in the matter under investigation, police will make every effort to locate the correct person.</p>
	<p pid=".591W.0/5">Where the police decide to administer a reprimand or final warning, both of which count as a youth justice disposal, they are required first to make certain that the young person did commit the offence; including their having admitted this to the officer. The police then write to the young person, and their parents if the young person is under 16, asking them to attend at a police station for the reprimand or warning.

	<p pid=".591W.0/6">There are no current plans to change the way in which individual forces interact with young people as their policies will reflect local community concerns and protocols. However Clause 107 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill will allow the photographing of suspects elsewhere than at a police station. This will provide a safeguard against mis-identification.</p>

The current review of road traffic offences addresses the adequacy of the current law in respect of the often tragic consequences of bad driving, including the appropriate venue for trial. This work is reaching a conclusion and we aim to publish the consultation paper shortly. We are also responding to the recommendation of the Transport Committee's report &quot;Traffic Law and Its Enforcement&quot; that more cases should be dealt with in the Crown court.

	<p pid=".596W.7/1">The Ministry of Defence is organising this training in two different ways. First, by direct action, for example through British military training teams deployed to Africa, conducting specific training for Peace Support Operations (PSO) and training prior to actual PSO deployments, as well as through UK-based regular professional training modules offered to African officers. Second, indirectly through our support to the development of international training centres of excellence. Examples are the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana, the Peace Support Training Centre in Kenya, the Tactical Peace Support Training Centre in Bloemfontein, South Africa and the Jaji Peacekeeping Training Wing in Nigeria. Helping to build such training centres, as well as the training of trainers, has a major multiplier effect and is in line with the UK and wider international policy for the development of African PSO capacity over the longer term.</p>

Material of no value as a record is disposed of, preferably by recycling, as soon as it is no longer required. Documents that form part of the official record are stored until they reach the end of their retention periods or they are selected for permanent preservation and transferred to The National Archives. When they are no longer required, official records are disposed of by shredding or other appropriate means and paper is recycled where practicable.

This is, however, subject to powers for the extension being confirmed by Parliament and to our consideration of a final business case, which is expected to be submitted in the spring. Although the Department announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase> that the Secretary of State had decided to make an Order under the Transport and Works Act giving powers for the scheme, the Order will need to be subject to special parliamentary procedure before it can come into force, as it involves the compulsory purchase of open space without other land being offered in exchange.

We are currently consulting patients' forums and other key stakeholders about the arrangements that will be put in place to support patients' forums once the CPPIH has been abolished.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.3/1">These substances were the subject of a Government-funded study to investigate the possible link with hyperactive behaviour. The committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment assessed the outcome of this work and concluded that it was difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the significance of the results, but that this was still an area of significant scientific uncertainty that warranted further investigation. A new study with improved experimental design is underway and is due to finish in March 2007.</p>

	<p pid=".617W.5/1">Under EDF6, contracts for management of technical assistance and study scholarship awards were concluded by open tender. Successful tendering organisations were GTZ (Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit&mdash;the German development co-operation implementing organisation), AEC (Association Europeenne des Conservatoires&mdash;a Commission established cultural and educational network) and Agrer (providing studies and assistance in development assistance project implementation). Some Commission Delegations in partner countries also managed these schemes directly.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.2/1">A portion of a European Development Fund (EOF) beneficiary country's allocation is deposited in a local national state bank account for disbursal on the authority of the National Authorising Officer (NAO) with approval of the European Community (EC) Head of Delegation. When the 9th EDF became operational in April 2003, all previous EDFs were consolidated into EDF9.

As there had been no Commission presence in the country since 1996, in accordance with the &quot;prudence&quot; principle in accounting, the Commission decided to provide in full for a potential loss.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.2/3">However, the Commission has since been able to confirm that all the funds are still at its disposal in the original bank account. This has been confirmed in writing by the bank.

	<p pid=".620W.5/1">The Secretary of State for International Development recently visited Indonesia and Sri Lanka, where he met with representatives of the respective Governments and of UN agencies and major NGOs. The Governments of the countries affected are leading and co-ordinating the response to this disaster, both on immediate relief and longer term reconstruction, working together with the United Nations, the World Bank, and other agencies. The UK will be following up its immediate humanitarian response with longer-term support, working within the framework set out by the Governments concerned. It is of course important that longer term reconstruction in the areas affected is properly coordinated so as to be as effective as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/2">The most immediate way that local communities in the UK can assist is by contributing to appeals by humanitarian agencies. Where there is an existing link with an affected community overseas it makes good sense to build on that relationship by offering support to the overseas community. Where no such relationship currently exists, there may well be further scope for developing twinning arrangements with the aim of providing practical support.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/3">A first step for UK communities wishing to be involved with local communities in the recovery effort would be to consult the relevant UK Embassies and High Commissions, and UK-based community organisations of the countries affected. Most have websites giving details of the most practical and effective ways of supporting the relief and reconstruction effort. DFID is in direct contact with the Governments and agencies concerned and provides details of how individuals and organisations in the UK can help through our website: <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/4">Since the disaster, we are in contact with the Local government association about how UK local authorities might be able to work with local municipalities and authorities in the countries affected by the tsunami. Local councils and authorities are eligible to apply to DFID's Civil Society Challenge Fund, which aims to help poor and excluded people to enhance their capacity to organise, and get their voices heard and to demand better services and better access to them.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.8/1">DFID has standard procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of the assistance it provides that involve careful assessment of need and considered targeting of our response from the outset. DFID sent humanitarian advisers to the region to ensure funding decisions were based on good assessment and information and were part of a co-ordinated effort. The monitoring of our assistance is supported by DFID's Country Offices. We will be following up our response with an evaluation of its effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid=".622W.2/1">Our Presidencies of the G8 and the EU present an important opportunity to take action to bring the world together to make further progress to tackle HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.2/2">The UK has two priorities for the G8 summit: Africa and Climate Change. DFID shall make AIDS a centrepiece of our Presidencies of the G8 and EU in 2005, and focus on AIDS at high level UN-General Assembly events, in the context of our strong commitment to Africa. The two key priorities for Ads this year are bringing the world together to tackle AIDS and maintaining HIV prevention momentum.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.2/3">We have asked the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to work with us to develop a plan of action to realise high-level, time-bound and concrete commitments to ensure delivery of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) Declaration at country level. In early 2005, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the UK will co-host a high-level meeting, &quot;Making the Money Work&quot;, to agree an action plan, within the Three Ones' concept, to underpin future co-operation between developing countries and their partners. The aim of &quot;Making the Money Work&quot; is to achieve consensus on ways of stepping up the response to AIDS in the most affected countries and making sure that national governments can drive forward the action they need to take with the support of international partners.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.2/4">We will also be hosting the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria's second replenishment conference in September 2005. This meeting will be held alongside a broader AIDS funding meeting, building on the March event, which aims close the financing gap for AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.2/5">By the end of 2005, DFID intends to have agreement among donors and the international system on a harmonized and funded plan to tackle AIDS so that we can move forward on treatment, prevention, care for orphans and vulnerable children as well as research into better treatments, vaccines and microbicides.</p>

	<p pid=".622W.5/1">In July this year, DFID was one of the first bilateral development agencies, along with he Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to endorse the UNAIDS/UNICEF Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children living in a world with HIV/AIDS. Since then we have taken every opportunity to promote its use with governments and other organisations working to provide protection, care and support to children affected by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.5/2">In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, our country programme teams have been engaged with the rapid assessment, analysis and action plan process. This has resulted in 16 national action plans for orphans and vulnerable children being developed. These are based on the Framework guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase>, I spoke at the Global Partners Forum on Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in Washington (a copy of the speech is available in the Library of the House). The Global Partners' Forum provided a good opportunity for policy dialogue with other agencies. There was discussion with the World Bank, which is developing work on vulnerable children around social protection, and with representatives from the Netherlands and Norway on how we might work more closely with them in this field.</p>
	<p pid=".622W.5/4">The Global Partners' Forum demonstrated that the Framework is widely accepted, even if not all agencies have officially endorsed it. The key issue now is ensuring it is put into practice. A good start has been made in sub-Saharan Africa. There and in Asia, DFID will be providing at least &pound;150 million over the next three years to support national OVC responses guided by the Framework and working closely with international partners, in particular with UNICEF.</p>

It concluded that since undertakings of confidentiality had been given in the past by successive governments to people making returns, any reduction in the closure period for censuses up to that taken in 1991 would be a breach of confidence. It also felt, however, that a shorter period, of 80 years for instance, might be appropriate for future censuses.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".637W.5/1">We are aware of concerns about the implications of reform to the EU sugar regime for the Jamaican economy and society. We have discussed these concerns with the Jamaican Government at a senior level, and with other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.5/2">In recognition of the impact that reform of the EU sugar regime will have on African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers, the European Commission has undertaken to initiate dialogue with the affected ACP countries, including Jamaica, on the basis of an Action Plan. This will be used to define appropriate accompanying measures. These are likely to include financial assistance and help with diversification where restructuring and improvements in competitiveness in the sugar sector are not sustainable.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.2/1">Under the subsidiarity mechanism set out in the EU constitutional treaty, the six-week review period would start from the date of transmission of a draft European legislative Act. This would ensure that national parliaments have an active voice in the EU's law making procedures at EU level for the first time. Article 7 of the Protocol on the Application of the Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality sets out how this would work in practice:</p>
	<p pid=".638W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Each national Parliament shall have two votes, shared on the basis of the national Parliamentary system. In the case of a bicameral Parliamentary system, each of the two chambers shall have one vote.</p>

A European Council decision attached to the Treaty in a Declaration provides that all Councils (other than the Foreign Affairs Council) will be chaired by a team of three member states holding the Presidency for 18 months. The cost of each Presidency would continue to be met by the relevant host government(s) which would also continue to determine the number of civil servants it allocates to EU work during its Presidency.

	<p pid=".640W.11/4">The joint statements acknowledge the unique situation of the Kaliningrad region as part of the Russian Federation, but separated from the rest of the federation by other states, and agree to make a special effort to accommodate the concerns of both sides relating to the transit of persons and goods between the Kaliningrad region and other parts of Russia, and to intensify their co-operation to promote the social and economic development of the region as a whole. The UK supports the implementation of the commitments in the two joint statements.</p>

	<p pid=".641W.5/1">For the project to be separately accounted for in the EU accounts, it would require the creation of a separate budget line. The Government see no need for a separate budget line for this specific project as the financial details are scrutinised by all member states prior to adoption. The EU contribution towards the small arms and light weapons project of the Economic Community of West African States will be financed from the non-proliferation projects line of the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget line, part of the external actions budget. The financial note detailing all financial expenditure was scrutinised by member states, and agreed by unanimity, who will retain oversight of the project.

	<p pid=".650W.2/2">All exercises identify issues that need clarifying and addressing and Exercise Hornbeam was no exception.

	<p pid=".651W.5/1">No. Illegal imports of meat are normally destroyed without undue delay though if the seizure was made solely because the importer failed to comply with the pre-notification requirements of Products of Animal Origin Regulations 2004, Customs may agree, after consultation with Port Health Authorities, to the product being re-exported.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.5/2">The Government have considered the feasibility of testing samples taken from seized illegally imported products of animal origin for a range of animal diseases. It concluded that the endemic nature of these diseases in many countries around the world results in a low but continuous risk of infected meat reaching the country through illegal routes. This means that all such seizures are treated as a potential animal and human health risk and destroyed, as soon as possible, by incineration. The risk of disease relates to the possibility that infectious material in illegal imports may be consumed by animals. Very small amounts of infectious material may cause disease and are likely to be only a small proportion of any illegal imports. There is thus very little chance of finding infected material by testing samples. Similar considerations apply with regard to the testing of samples for human pathogens.</p>

	<p pid=".655W.8/1">The number of children entering post primary education in Northern Ireland continues to fall in line with the falling numbers in primary schools. Neither the base line nor the projected figures for post primary enrolment used in the Costello report included those pupils enrolled in special educational units attached to mainstream schools. When these pupils are factored in, the difference between projected and actual school population figures amounts to 0.6 per cent. or 966 pupils for the current school year.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.8/2">This difference is due to an increase in the number of young people staying on in the sixth form, where 26,321 were enrolled in 2004&ndash;05 against the 25,332 projected. As such, this may indicate the success of Government policies such as the educational maintenance allowance to encourage young people to stay in school beyond the compulsory school age.</p>

The report, based on some 16,000 measurements in private dwellings, includes maps showing the percentage of houses likely to exceed the action level throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/2">At high concentrations, radon leads to an increased risk of lung cancer and it is estimated that radon could account for about 60 of the 800 or so lung cancer deaths per year in Northern Ireland. The average level of radon in private dwellings in Northern Ireland is similar to the rest of the UK although there are areas in the west and south-east of the Province where radon risk is elevated and it is estimated that 4,000 homes in Northern Ireland are likely to exceed the action level.</p>
	<p pid=".657W.2/3">The Environment and Heritage Service has already offered free tests to all householders living in the high-risk areas. The radon risk map and radon leaflets can be accessed on the Environment and Heritage Service's website, <a href="http://www.ehsni.gov.uk">www.ehsni.gov.uk</a>.</p>
